      "Content": " Hi, your doctor is WRONG. He can NOT tell if it is a fibroadenoma or not, unless there is an ultrasound plus biopsie result. I found a lump in my breast about\n 2 months ago. My doctor examined it and referred me to a breast diagnostic center after he did a first ultrasound on my right breast and diagnosed it as a solid breast lump. He said it will brobably be a fibroadenoma. But nobody knows for sure until I get my biopsie. So I went to the clinic and I got a second ultrasound to verify that I need a biopsie. Then I got a core biopsie just 2 days ago. They took samples of the tissue. Today morning I had to come back for the result. It was negative .. no cancer. It was in fact a fibroadenoma. But please make sure that you follow the same steps as me. That's the only way to make sure that you are really having a fibroadenoma, not a malignant (cancerous) tumour. But if you are still young, it will more likely be a firbroadenoma like mine. But better make sure! Good luck !!! ",
