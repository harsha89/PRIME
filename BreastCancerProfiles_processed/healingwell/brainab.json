    "Content": " Hello everyone. I am just new to this forum, but was hoping you all could help. I am a 36 yr old female and I get yearly mammograms and have for a few years now. I get them because when I was 14 months old I was burned all down the front of my body (Inlcuding breasts) with hot grease and have had many operations (when I was younger) to reconstruct my breasts. So because of this there is not only scar tissue on the skin but lumpy tissue, too. It's virtually impossible to do an exam on me.\nAnyway, I had my yearly mammogram on Monday (Feb 6) along with a sonogram of both breasts. They do the sonograms every 6 months. I just got a call from the Imaging place and they said they needed to schedule me for further scans of my right breast. I understand that can happen quite commonly when you have a mammogram and they want to get a better look so they do an ultrasound. I'm scared because I've already had both done. I did notice (and just thought it was in my head at the time) that the ultrasound tech spent more time on my right breast. She even went under my arm on that breast and not on the left. They couldn't get me an appointment until Monday afternoon. PLEASE give me your feedback. I just had a high school friend die 1 month ago from breast cancer. Of course, this is all I can think of. ",
