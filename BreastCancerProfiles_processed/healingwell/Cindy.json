      "Content": " First, I have never laughed so hard. What a great feeling. I love all of your posts...\nI had breast cysts all my life and thought they were gone forever. Have not had one for over 15 years. I am 59 and not on hormones but I found one today. Same place as most of the painful ones that have had in the past. Right breast. Funny because the bigger ones were always aspirated from my left breast but the painful ones were always in the right breast. \nOnce a doctor did a breast biopsy which burst the cyst and it quit coming back...until now anyway. \nAlso, I had one female doctor in the past to ask me why I wanted it aspirated and I told her that I have a huge pain tolerance, had 2 babies back in the 80's natural (do not know what I was thinking), one weighed 9.8 lbs and the other 8.8 lbs but at least that was done and OVER. These cysts hurt 24/7 and mine have never gone away on their own. I know that aspiration is temporary fix but I do not know how anybody can stand this 24/7 pain. (She did not do the aspiration but she went and found somebody else to do it.)\nIf any of the doctors question me this time I will have a line to hand back to them thanks to the post where the lady said...let a man have scrotum problems and it would get healed right away. It will be funny to see their face.\nI have already asked my primary care doctor to refer me TODAY and hope to have the mammogram next week. I don't care if they think I am a sissy ",

      "Content": " Hi, I had a radial scar removed July 2012 and was surprised at the lack of information on the Internet. Post Op I felt fine and had the usual discomfort but it has lasted, it's now been almost 11 months. The discomfort is not daily but comes and goes and so does my mind worrying about\n what might happen one day. I can not find anywhere any information about\n realistic pain discomfort or follow-up. My surgeon (who is one of the best in Australia) told me that seeing that there is no specific risk factors that I don't need to worry about\n a check up for 2 years. I was told that too many mammograms might be harmful to the breast bone in the long rum. Anyone have an opinion or experience. Much appreciated! ",

Sometimes I have a deep aching pain in my breast and sometimes a specific pain. At the moment my shoulders pains on and off. I've been to three doctors the last 18 months, all three told me patients and recovery differs and the last one told me I'm paranoid of getting BC. I struggling to find any info online in regards to radial scars and recovery after biopsy.\nIf anyone had a similar experience I would love to know.\nThanks\nCindy ",
