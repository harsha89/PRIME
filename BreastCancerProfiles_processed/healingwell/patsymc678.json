    "Content": " Hi. I was diagnosed with breast cancer with bone and liver metastasis over 3 years ago. I had no previous diagnosis. I had chemo, etc, BUT, I also looked elsewhere -- at food testing,juicing, major nutrition changes especially organic, no refined sugar, no microwaves,supplements, vitamin c injections , visualisation, prayer . Throw everything at it, you have to find out for yourself, at least here in the UK. There is lots of info out there. Love, Medicine and Miracles book be Bernie Seigel was a great start for me. I have not felt so well for years.\nNo more treatments frees her to start healing .She can do it . ",
