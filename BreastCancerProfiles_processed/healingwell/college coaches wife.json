I had 3 benign cysts removed few years ago so I run with your same fear. If at all possible, find a Dr who specializes in breast cancer. I go to Dr Elliott in Baton Rouge, Louisiana - Breast Cancer Center. They do mammograms, thermograms, ultra sounds, you name it. I was also advised not to stop my hormones a year after hysterectomy and take Vitamin E daily. I don't think I would be able to wait around that long.
