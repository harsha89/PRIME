Ive been dealing with this for five years, but its not the \"Cancer-free anniversary\" that some get to have. Its nice to know that there are other people out there who have taken all the same drugs I have....Kathy! Ive seen the business end of all those needles - NO FUN! Im glad there are others out there who have taken their \"new normal\" and still seem to stay positive and believe, like I do, that the possibilites are endless....\n \n \n \n \n ",
