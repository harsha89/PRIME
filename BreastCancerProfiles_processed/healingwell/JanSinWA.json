    "Content": " Hi, Eveie-\nI am 'breastless near Seattle', with no regrets. Lefty had cancer in 1996, then again in 2002, so it was mastectomy time. I had just had a hyst the month before, and was so glad I had opted for prophylactic ovary removal at the same time. Surgical menopause has been quite an ordeal.\nA year later I had the right breast removed prophylactically. We have a very strong familial history, and have worked with a geneticist and have each banked our DNA for future testing as new discoveries are pursued. (I have a 20 year old daughter.) My sister was tested and turned up negative for the BRCA genes ... but she had bc at 37, I was 40 and 46, and mom had it at 65, 69, and 75. \nAt this point, all three of us are breastless. Frankly, I LOVE not having to deal with a bra - but then I've always been one to be comfortable with 'doing my own thing'! LOL! (I totally enjoyed being chemo bald.) We are so fortunate to have many options for reconstruction for those who wish it.\nCongrats on finishing your chemo - and best wishes to you on your upcoming surgery! Jan ",
