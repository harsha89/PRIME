    "Content": " I am a new member. I love these support groups - I feel like I have company out there. I don't wish anxiety on anyone, but it is reassuring to know I'm not alone. My mammogram is scheduled for the day after tomorrow. I start worrying at least a month prior. It was on my mind the entire time I was on vacation out West two weeks ago. As the time nears I get more and more anxious. I had a call back last year, but all was well. I have had a biopsy and another call back years ago (I'm 60). I know as I age, my odds increase. Does anyone have any ideas on how to get through this and remain sane? I hate being such a wimp. It's not the process at all, it's the anxiety that is ruining my life as it approaches. ",
