    "Content": " I'm new here, so hello!  Last Friday I had a diagnostic mammogram for calcifications on my left breast.  I guess they are what are called microcalcifications.  The radiologist suggested a core biopsy, so I'm schedule for this coming Tuesday.  I'm lucky, I was scheduled pretty quick, so Idon't have to do a massive amount of waiting.  Thank goodness.  Just hearing there was reason to do a diagnostic was nerve-racking enough, let alone the word BIOPSY.  I cried after they told me. LOL.  The nurse was very nice and told me 80% of these turn up ok.  And to stop worrying until they look me in the face and tell me there is reason to!!  Didn't stop the worrying though!  Hopefully by this time next week my worries can be laid to rest!!!!!!  I wish everyone good luck and health and happiness.
