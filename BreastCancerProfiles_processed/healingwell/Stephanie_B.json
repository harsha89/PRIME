    "Content": " Hi Julie, it's Monday and I'm thinking of you as well. I floated over here from the prostate cancer forum and your post grabbed my attention.\nI have to agree with everyone - based on past experience - it's so tempting to \"become active again\" It's like denial or ... I'm stronger than my condition is! - But take my word for it, take it easy! That is the fastest way to total recovery!\nWishing you all the best and big hug too!\nStephanie ",
