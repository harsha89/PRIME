      "Content": " So, Mary K -- you found me! LOL!! NKPA62 is my screen name everywhere I go. If I had another one, I would forget who I am! LOL!! \nI read through the roll call posts and recognized so many names! \nI don't live in Burton anymore. I live in downtown Flint now. If I ever got to Florida, I don't think I would have ever come back to Flint. But, I can't do that--I have family here. And, BTW--I have a 2 year old granddaughter! I have to see Codi grow!!\nI moved into a senior living apartment complex about\n 3 years ago, and it was the best move I could have made for myself. There are a lot of wonderful people here, and when they found out what happened to me, they got together and prayed for me. \nI posted at the end of the roll-call posts and explained what happened--most of what I sent you in email, MK. \nTavish? Lori--did you used to be Lori2000??\nGail--it's great to see you again. \nMNLady13 I am hoping the new drugs can do it for me. I won't know until at least Monday if I have to have chemo--depends on the scans I am having done. I can have a 6 month mamm now, too.\nI remember you too, Bev.\nDeb, I don't believe we have met. \nI thank all of you for your prayers. \nLove and hugs, Viv :)\nPS--MK notice that I am listening to you--I am not worrying about\n the tests. I am taking notes to talk to my chemo onc on Monday, but I am not going to worry until I have something to worry about\n. \nThe rad treatments--I have 3 left (of 20) and they helped me get back my walking and talking skills, which the dr said would happen--and it was almost right away. I thank God for that. I'm praying the rest of the rads took care of the 6 lesions and will have an MRI next week after rads are over. I don't remember as well as I did a few months ago, but I can live with it. Another reason/excuse for chemobrain--or just being blonde!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
