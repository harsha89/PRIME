      "Content": " Gayle, Gail, and MK, I'm one of the lucky ones. It turned out to be shingles. Who'd of thought someone would be happy to get shingles? Well, it surely was better than IBC, and better than Lymes Disease too. I hope those of you with IBS are getting good treatment, and I'll sure be thinking of you. Thanks for your help with my self-diagnosis. And I thought only the folks on the lupus forum are great, and then here are you guys, just as wonderful. Come on over if you get any aches or pains. \n \nLove,\nPat\n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi, I'm usually over in the lupus form, but something's going on with my left breast. I have a red swollen mark twice the size of a silver dollar, and it's sore to the touch, but no lumps. My PCP said it's a tick bite and started me on a regimen a doxycycline. \nI had my annual mammogram today and it was clean. However the radiologist asked to see me and suggested the possibility of inflammatory breast cancer and asked me to watch it and come back in in ten days for an ultrasound. I presume the wait is to see if the antibiotic does it's job.\nBut my poor boobie is so sore, inside and out. I'm here to look for someone who'll tell me that IBC doesn't hurt.\nThanks,\nPat\n \n ",

I'm not a doctor, and two doctors have looked at my breast, but the tiny bumps didn't look like this yesterday or last friday. Shingles are horrible, but they are a far better option than IBS!
