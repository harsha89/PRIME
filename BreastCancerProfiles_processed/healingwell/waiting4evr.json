      "Content": " Hi Thinkspos,\nIt is better to think positive, I pray your follow up in November will be good. I know when they told me to come back in 6 months it was always in the back of my mind and I just didn't feel like myself. I didnt laugh as often and didn't smile as much. I know that I shouldn't have let it get to me but i did. Now that I went back for my follow up back in April and it was ok I thought to myself what a waste of worry. Even though I go today for my regular mamo, I am a little nervous but i'm not worried. \nI work in the retail industry and some of the things that they put out there for breast cancer awareness makes you think \"What were they thinking\" a dish scrubber and a dog toy for breast cancer awareness are you kidding. I just like the subtle stuff like the pink wristband or a nice tee shirt. ",

I went back yesterday for my six months check up, the x-ray tech said that if they need to see me sooner they will let me know but otherwise they would see me in six months for my regular mammo. I was wondering does the radiologist let you know when your there if you would need a biopsi. My mom had breast cancer. They caught it extremely early and she just had to do radiation.
