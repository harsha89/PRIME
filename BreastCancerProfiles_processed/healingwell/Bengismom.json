    "Content": " Hi everyone. I had ACT in 2004. Lost all my hair, it regrew as others stated different texture, very grey but nice and full. Still have very little brow and a few eyelashes. about\n a year ago, I started having hair loss and it continues. Now getting really thin. New breast cancer last Nov. No chemo or rad this time, just mastectomy. Wonder if anesthesia added to problem? Hope all of you are doing well. ",
