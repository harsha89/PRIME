    "Content": " : HI\n All like to put everyone mind to rest if there having a biopsy, just had one this afternoon, got clustered califcations on right boob at front, Had mammagram few weeks back because I had odd wart like spot on left boob, well they also gave me altra scan that was fine had a blockage duct. Then follow up had mammagram on both boobs, after that got letter saying had to go back, so went back for another mammagranm on right, reason being; told me why was due to these calcium things, said if don, t hear from them not to worry\n Well had letter saying had go back to hospital for biospy for further tests. My thoughts was going in my head of Dread the thought cutting my boob, saw video exspected the worsed,, seeing needle giant !! needle, but was nothing just slight sting and clinking sounds was comfortable layed on side Doctor managed to get 2 calcium specimens and i will be seeing breast surgeon next week for results. Hoping they are not cancerious but if they are better catch them now than later, biopsy was not painfull as all numbed up and never saw giant needle just thing look like a ink stamp.\n ",
