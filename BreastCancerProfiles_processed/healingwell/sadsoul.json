      "Content": " Hi there.\nI had stage 2 breast cancer in 2011. I had a partial masectomy and radiation. I had both an invasive and a non invasive cancer. A sample of the cancer was sent to a lab a rated from 0 - 100 on the possibility of it returning. My grade was in the lower 30% so no chemo was done. Recently, I noticed that the breast hurts when I lay on my side or stomach. Went to primary care doc who pushed hard on the breast and it really hurt bad. I had already contacted my surgeon and got my mammogram moved up from 8/28/14 to 7/17/14. She's also wants a sonogram of the breast. \nMy question is - anyone out there have their breast cancer return and if so, was the breast painful? It has not hurt since radiation ended late 2011. I also fear I have stomach cancer due to severe pain in the upper stomach. I had a CT scan done Thursday & they said they'd call the doc if anything showed up. Well, I got the docs nurse call that same day and she said the CT scan showed \"thickening of the stomach wall\". I was told discuss this with my GI Doc. I had an endoscopy done late March that showed I have gastritis, but the pain I've been having lately is pretty severe and when I googled the quote above, all that popped up was stomach cancer. \nI've pretty well convinced myself that I'm on my way out so I'm not afraid to hear brutal replies. I appreciate anyone's time and input on my miserable situation.\nThank you.\nJB ",

      "Content": " Hi Ladies.\nWhat is it with breast cancer and gastro issues! In 2011, my year from hell, I had 2 months of getting up every morning and throwing up. This was about\n 4 months before the breast cancer. I had a endoscopy and colon.. 4 months before the constant throwing up. GI Doc ran a slew of tests including a CT scan of the brain which showed I had an aracnoid cyst on the brain. Saw a nurologist (I can't spell medical words very well) who said that the cyst was nothing to worry about\n and would not cause all that throwing up. My balance is off a bit and I would probably fail a walk the straight line test if I was pulled over stone cold sober. After all the testing I saw my primary care doc and we switched from Protonix to Nexium and doubled my xanax. That seemed to work. By that time I had lost about\n 20 pounds and everyone said I was too thin. Thank God, Advanced Radiology called one evening and told me it was time for my mamogram. After all I had been thru, that was the last thing on my mind. Good thing they called because it turned out I did have breast cancer. Two types, one invasive and one non-invasive. I also like my little boob better than the bigger one that looks like an orange in a sock hanging.\nI saw GI Doc Thursday and am having another endoscopy done Monday. Scared, yes, but I need to know what is going on with all this stomach pain. Thursday I have the mamo and sonogram of the breast that had the cancer. Scared, you bet! If it's back, which I'm pretty sure it is, I want both boobs gone. I'm pretty sure they'd take what's left of the bad on anyway. \nAre you ladies taking hormone blocking pills? I do and I hate them. They cause joint pain and no libido at all. If the cancer is back, I'm going to stop taking the dang things. \nBest wishes to both of you and I'll keep you posted.\nJB ",
