      "Content": " Hi all...I posted back in July when I had my first mammogram...I was called back within a week for a follow up mammogram and ultrasound because of a \"suspicious\" mass in my right breast. I went back and had both procedures done..and was advised by the Dr. that I had about\n a 1% chance of it being cancer....99% chance of it NOT being cancer. She didn't recommend a biopsy, but did recommend me coming back in 6 months. Well it has been 6 months and my appt. is for tomorrow at 1:00pm. If the mass has grown ANY at all they will advise me to have a biopsy tomorrow...only thing is ..it is so far back in my breast...almost at my chest wall that I have been advised that if I do need one tomorrow that it will require a longer than normal needle, and will have to go to a different facility to have the procedure done. I have never had a biopsy before, so I have no clue what \"a longer than normal\" needle means..or what I am in store for! So needless to say I am a little freaked out. I am just hoping and praying that it has not grown..or is either completely gone away. Has anyone else here had to go through the 6 month wait and watch? Thanks so much for your time. ",

      "Content": " Hi all, Thanks so much for your support. I went on Thursday the 4th, and had my 6 month re-check mammo and ultrasound. The \"mass\" had not grown any at all...so the Dr. said that in her opinion it appeared to be a fibroadenoma and not a cause for concern, but they would continue to monitor it every six months. She showed me the cyst, mass, whatever you call it on the mammo and it is about\n 1/2 inch in diameter. I am going to go with my gut instinct on this one and not get a second opinion. I feel confident that the Dr. at the Mammography center and my Gyno. would recommend a biopsy if they felt it was necessary. Thanks so much for your support. This message board has been a great help to me. Thanks again! \n ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone! I am hoping that I can get some information about\n how common call backs are for your first mammogram. I went in 2 weeks ago and had my first mammogram. I am 39 years old. \nThe Breast Center where I had my mammogram called this morning and told me that I needed to come back on on Monday for a repeat mammogram and a ultrasound. No more details were given..they could not/would not tell me which breast..if they saw anything..etc. Just that I needed to come back in. So now I am freaking out. My sister in law was just diagnosed with breast cancer 3 weeks ago. Her diagnosis prompted me to get my butt in gear and get a mammo...even though we are not blood related..that hit to close to home. She is going to be ok...she had a lumpectomy and is now preparing for radiation treatments. Back to what I am asking....Is it common to be called back in for a repeat mammogram and ultrasound? I have no history of breast cancer in my family and I have no lumps in my breast other than a few fibrystic?? cysts..not sure if I spelled that correctly. Anyway was just hoping that I could get some information. Thank you so much in advance! I am truly scared to death. ",
