      "Content": " Dear all,\nThe report came out yesterday. It is a poorly differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma. Signs of early metastasis are found in the lung. It said it is almost consistent with the signs of a recurrence. We are still waiting for the hormone report to see which drugs should be used.\nI have reservation with Chemo is because I wish no further pain will be inflicted on my mom, and also it guarantees no improvement even after series of excruciating treatments. Anyway, I will accept my doctor's recommendations and start with whatever he suggests at whatever the cost. I am just concerned whether we should use Chinese medicine as complementary treatment for rejuvenation during chemo. Worried about\n possible complications with Western and Chinese combination. I feel inclined to Chinese Medicine after reading all those report on the web and the experiences of my friends, though they may not be verifiable.\nPlease kindly give me any advice on these. Also what should I ask the doctor whenever I consult him? I am afraid of asking the wrong questions and waste our time. I just feel disoriented.\nA million Thanks ",

      "Content": " Thanks all your advice.\nMy mon was first diagnosed with breast cancer back in 1991/92. She had her right breast removed surgically and underwent sessions of chemotherapy later. A year and a half ago, she found her right arm go limp and suspected a recurrence. So she consulted a few doctors who said it was probably related to the bones and nerves and operated on her joint areas. they also said there were a black spot on my mom's lung but they said it was okay. \nbut her arm got worse after surgery, and right now she can hardly grasp or hold a thing. It goes limp and numb. And she found some lumps in her right breast a month ago. We saw another doctor, and after all these X-ray, MIR, biopsy and PET Scan, he suspected it was either a stage IV recurrence or even a new type of cancer. We will be getting the core needle biopsy report this morning. Also he said only hormonal therapy or chemo is suitable, for the cancer is inoperable, already spread to lung, ribs and lymph. Early signs of metastasis in the lung.\nI am not sure if chemo is okay with mom (whether it is too expensive with no clear improvement guaranteed I am not sure) and I am thinking about\n chinese medicine. Too many questions and too many options. I am just despearate.\nPlease kindly give me any advice. Thank you all. ",
