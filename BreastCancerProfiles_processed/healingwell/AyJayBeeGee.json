    "Content": " Wow...I just had a diagnosis of invasive lobular breast cancer with bone mets, in November. I found this site and it is so encouraging to read about\n those who are overcoming!! (I had ovarian cancer 19 years ago, also.) I can relate to everyone's responses...and I want to live my life to the fullest, also, and not let this disease rob me of my joy. I am blessed with wonderful, supportive friends and have faith in God's timing and plan. Looks like the cheering section balcony is crowded and I am glad to know you. I would like to hear from anyone who is on Anastrozole and Zometa, as that is my regimen. ",
