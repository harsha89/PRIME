I guess the point is they dont know it IS a fibro.. if it is i woudnt be concerned at all, ive had one over 20 yrs.. they are totally harmless! they dont know what it is, they are guessing based on my history and its size, which just isnt good enough for me. I have two friends who had theoretically harmless lumps that wound up being cancer. I will update when i have met with the surgeon!\nLouise ",

      "Content": " Hi Sheri,\nit's been pretty stressful. Another Doc i trust looked over the report and her reading of it is that its not that they didn't get ANY samples, just not ENOUGH to categorically define it as fibroadenema. She is sending me a copy of it so i can ready it for myself, but my doc is still trying for a 2nd opinion. At this point even though it might be entirely unnecessary i think i'd rather have the lump removed surgically with clear margins and know i am OK than be wondering every 6mths before an ultrasound!\nWill def post when i have more definitive info.. from speaking to some friends though, this seems kind of common (the uncertainty) The radiologists want to cover their butts so say \"inconclusive\" more often than not! In a health care system that is stretched to the limit, really it makes you wonder! One 1hr operation 5 weeks ago and everyone would know by now. But they would rather have me in for a 90 min biopsy, anf ultrasounds every 6 mths! doesnt make sense to me!\ndx fibroadenema 1990, surgical removal, mammos for life! ",

      "Content": " Hey Sheri,\nso kinda funny (no funny haha) story. I decided to call the clinic that did the biopsy to see th approx date of the results. They said \"oh we sent them last week to Dr XXXX\" which was interesting as a)that wasn't the right Dr and b) no-one had called me to tell me such. They apologized and offered to fax them to the correct Dr ASAP, but in the interim, i called the Dr they DID advise (my old Dr, whose practice moved) and they said they didn't HAVE all the results, which was why i hadn't been called. When i called the lab back, they said, Nope they definitely have them, but we will send them again if you like. \nI decided to just go up to the new Dr's on the off chance that she could see me today. She was booked up but the reception staff confirmed they did have the results sent over today, and the Dr would look at them ASAP. She did, and sent a message back saying \"no rush, come in in the next few days\" .. soooo i have an appointment for 1015am tomorrow.. can i assume if they aren't in a rush i am not going to need further surgery? \nWhatever, i guess i will know tomorrow morning. I will certainly post when i get the results, but i have to admit, knowing i should have had this info on Monday is a little galling! (oh and Leo has been cleared of all \"serious\" issues, he has the equivalent of IBS in humans.. lots of throwing up until we find food that agrees with him!! :()\n ",
