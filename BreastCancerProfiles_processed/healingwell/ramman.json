    "Content": " My wife, 44, had a mammogram a few days ago. They discovered a lump and afterwards she said it was painful. She hadn't noticed any pain before. We are a nervous reck. They have scheduled a consultation and then an ultrasound the next day. Is that normal procedure? I have talked to a few people who had lumps at their mammogram and they never had to have an ultrasound. Can they tell from a mammogram how serious a lump is? Seems serious if they are scheduling both a consultation and an ultrasound......just wondering if that is the normal procedure. Thanks. ",
