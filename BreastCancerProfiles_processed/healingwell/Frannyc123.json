    "Content": " I am 51 years old and am scheduled for a Stereotactic Core Biopsy next week for cluster microcalcifications in my left breast only. Can anyone tell me about\n this procedure? I have been warned that is is very, very hard - laying flat on your stomach unable to move, hoisted up in the air with your breast clamped for about\n 40 minutes while the procedure takes place below you. This sounds pretty bad and I am upset that this wasn't described to me by my doctor so that I could prepare mentally. Are there certain characteristics of a 'cluster' that would call for a biopsy as opposed to a 6-month re-check with a mammogram? ",
