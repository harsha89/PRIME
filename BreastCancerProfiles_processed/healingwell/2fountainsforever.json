      "Content": " Hello! First time posting to this site. Had a bilateral mastectomy 3/2009 ever since I have been bothered with the burning, itching, numb feeling in my chest wall, arm pit and shoulder. Currently on Cymbalta & Gabapentin for nerve ending pain and Lortab(prn) for pain. Can't say this is the greatest combination for relief. Wonder what some of you other ladies/ men are taking that work for you. Unfortunately I can not take NSAIDS due to an upper and lower GI bleed. Thank you for your help,Tina!! ",

      "Content": " I went to a Medical Supply Store. They carried bras. Or at first I wore a camisole with little slits where you can slide the prosthetics in and it velcros down the front. Much more comfortable st first. My oncologist had to write a prescript\nion for my bras and prosthetics . Lady measured me picked out brass. and got 2 sets of prosthetics one for daily wear and one for swimming. Thoughts and prayers sent your way ! Hope for a speedy recovery! Good luck picking out bras! :) ",
