And when I say just over, I mean my hyst. was in Mar of 2002. \nI know I should remain calm until I have real reason to worry. *ohm* I try. You ladies are a real inspiration.

She said there is definately something there and went to set me up for a sonogram.  Waited 2 more hours had a ultrasound done and was sent on my way.  At this point it is well after 5pm and the first girl is gone home.  So they told me to follow up with my Dr.\n \n \n \n ",
