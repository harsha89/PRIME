I realize this is a website created by the makers of Femara, but the explanation is fairly easy to understand. \nMy oncologist recommended that I take Femara also. I began taking Femara and started with a reaction that was not one of the \"normal\" ones listed in side effects. I had an appointment with my radiologist and mentioned the reaction to her and she suggested that I stop taking the drug until the reaction disappeared completely and then begin Femara again. If I had the reaction again to stop taking the medication and call my oncologist. \nSo I began taking Femara this morning and so far no reaction, but it took several days for that reaction to begin. I will let you know how things turn out. \nRobin ",

I have only been on it for a couple of weeks and have decided that I just cannot give up my quality of life for the aches and pains associated with Femara so I may have added protection from recurrence of the cancer. \nMy arms and legs feel like I have a tourniquet tied around my legs near my groin, and my arms around my shoulder/armpit. They are tingly and feel swollen. I am as stiff in all of my joints as if I have arthritis. I also had both of my knees partially replaced and I'm feeling like I never had them replaced. \nThis morning when I woke up I had to hold on to something all the way to the bathroom I walk like I'm 90 years old. I just cannot continue feeling this way. So tomorrow I won't take the next pill, and I hope I can get back to feeling like my 60 year old self and how I felt last April before the annual mammogram that started my journey. \nIn answer to your question, I would think that after a year some of the side-effects and pain should begin to disappear. Have you talked to the doctor who prescribed that medication?\nRobin ",

      "Content": " Hello Jane, \nThank you for sharing your personal thoughts on taking these drugs. I began taking Femara on Sunday and I also began a journal. The funny thing about\n having to take this medication right now is I am feeling the best physically and mentally since my mammogram last April. Now I'm taking a drug that may change all that, but like you I have decided that I will stop taking Femara if I have that deep bone pain. I had both of my knees partially replaced and believe me I remember that bone pain. Not fun. \nI am trying to be optimistic about\n the side effects also. And since I've always kept a journal it just made sense for me to add this to the pages. \nI hope your radiation goes well. I was lucky and got to follow a newly adopted protocol from Canada only 16 treatments. \nI will continue to post any useful information regarding the Femara. \nThanks again, \nRobin ",

Funny the things that go through our minds in such a short time. \nThe snow is coming down at a rate of an inch an hour right now. I went out and cleared a path to my car then around my car so that if I lose power I can go out there and turn the car on to get warm for a little while and hear some news on the radio. \nI made a path to my back door and cleared that so I can \nopen the door, as it \nopens out, and then I made a path to the heat pump so that I can get to it more easily to clear the snow away from the air intake. Whew!\nBut with the snow coming as quickly as it is I'll need to go out in a few hours to do it all again. I think it is easier to do it this way than to try to move 24\" at one time. \nI live in the country between Charlottesville, VA and Richmond, VA. Pretty, but hard for the DOT to keep up with all the rural roads. \nThe fun part is I grew up in Chester County, PA very near Longwood Gardens.

      "Content": " Jane, \nMy radiologist gave this to me. it is in a plastic tube that stands on the cap. \nThe company is Carrington. The product is called RadiaGel. Hydrogel Wound Dressing. It is a clear gel that feels sticky for a few seconds and then after it air dries completely disappears into the skin. As I mentioned I had only 16 treatments, but for women who have more treatments the radiologist gives another cream after some number over 16 as they did not give it to me. However I did get an unused tube from a friend who had 33 treatments. \nThe second cream is made by OrthoNeutrogena. The product is called Biafine. Topical Emulsion. It is in a aluminum tube similar to toothpaste. It is a white cream that is much heavier than the gel I used. I did use some of this on my underarm and nipple when I felt discomfort. This woman was also a patient of my radiologist, and I mentioned that I had received that cream from my friend the radiologist said that was fine and to use it. \nI know there are several gels, creams, and lotions available and if your radiologist hands you one you can be sure it will work. I'm fairly sure they don't want you to have a bad experience. \nI want to share some information with you that I learned from my radiation tech. He said that radiation stops the growth of new cells in first layer of skin, which is several layers below the skin that we touch. One of the reasons radiation causes redness and discomfort is that the top layer is damaged, and through normal everyday life is shed. The normal plan for the body is to move newer cells to the top to replace the dead cells, but since radiation stops the growth of new cells there is a time when the body doesn't have cells to replace the dead ones. The trick to all this is to be careful about\n clothing rubbing the skin that is being treated, and to try to keep your arm from rubbing the side of your body whenever possible ( this makes you look ridiculous, because you walk around with your hand on your hip sort of like a fashion model), but it works! \nI am not sure you how tired you will feel, but be kind to yourself. I think I was so tired because I went right from chemo to radiation and was working full-time, and going to college too, and I'm going to be 60 in Feb. \nI hope this helps. \nRobin ",

      "Content": " Jane, \nI had two small tumors in my left breast too. They told me all about\n the possible heart damage, and also the possibility of having my lung in the way, but I'm sure they were able to block all unnecessary sections so that my heart and lung were protected. That is one reason the angle of the machine was so low on the left side sort of below the table I laid on. The radiation was sent from below the table across my underarm and up past my nipple. The machine was repositioned on the right side of my body, but higher and the radiation went from my breast bone to the nipple. \nThe tech. told me that radiation travels in a straight line. The strength of the radiation is 100% on the outside of the breast and by the time it penetrates to the nipple it is 50% and continues to reduce to 0%. So by repositioning the machine to the other side the strength begins on the outside at 100% and drops to 50% by the time it get to the nipple, and again reduces to 0% by the time it is done. This way the entire treatment area gets 100%.\nDid that make sense? \nThe tech's. get their directions from a team of other folks who are schooled in radiation. The team gathers all the information from your individual test results, pathology reports, and information that your radiologist gave them. They calculate the angles, the strengths, and the timing of each treatment. Ask your tech. about\n that part of the process. (remember algebra? well these folks actually use it!!) and I thought there was no value in learning algebra. \nAs you see I asked a lot of questions and got lots of answers. \nRobin ",

      "Content": " Jane, \nI mentioned in another post that I only had 16 rad. treatments. They gave me a cream/lotion to use after my treatment and at bedtime. Make sure you put it ALL over the area being treated and on your underarm!!! I was only told to stay within the markings and my underarm was not part of that. I noticed after the 13th treatment my underarm was raw and very dark. It took about\n 2 weeks for that discomfort to go away. I would not have had a problem if I had known to use the lotion under my arm. \nI will tell you that even though I only had the 16 treatments I was very tired. Radiologist told me to expect that and she was right! \nCompared to the chemo radiation was a breeze. Going every day was a drag, but each day was a little closer to the end of the journey. \nRobin ",
