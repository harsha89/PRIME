      "Content": " Hi...I am sure you hate doubting your friend. As MaryK said there are people who have \"Cancer Envy\"...It doesnt make sense but it is true. For some reason they need what they think is attention. Believe me, I can do without all this \"attention\"....\nI have had so many different types of chemo, I cant remember all the names. This past January I lost my hair for the 4th time. But I have had some chemo that I didnt lose my hair. When that happened, people didnt believe I was on chemo, or assumed it wasnt bad. Some chemo landed me in the hospital a few days after each \"cocktail\"...with other treatment I was just fine. I have worked full time until recently .... what seemed a little strange is that she called you and sounded so sick and then showed up a little while later at the office seeming ok.\nI guess what I would do is ask some questions. Maybe ask her the name of the chemo she is taking and the name of the one she took previously.Write the name down and then look it up on webmd. Most people have someone with them during chemo. so offer to take her to her next treatment.\nWell, I hope you are able to figure out what is going on...having cancer is bad but then if she doesnt have Breast Cancer she obviously has another problem. So either way, she is a sick woman. \nCathi \n \n \n \n ",

Didnt think I could take being sick and tired all the time. I just wanted cancer to go away.\nWell 6 yrs later I am still here. I will be starting chemo again for the\n4th time sometime in November ( Depends on ct scans & bone scan )\nI still get mad, I rant and rave and cry. You need to know that is okay, \nas long as you dont stop fighting ! \nStay with us and these wonderful ladies will help get you thru these bad times. Remember we are sisters !\nHugs,\nCathi\n \n \n \n ",

Back to work\nI saw my Onc on Monday and we didnt do chemo, thank goodness.\nDecided to give me another week to get my strength back. So I\nwill have my 3rd treatment on Monday. We have stopped the Xeloda\nfor now..since they are pretty sure that was causing all the problems.\nI dont want to continue, but she talked me into going on...if I have \nanother reaction like before, I will stop.\nI hope you are well my friend.\nLove and hugs\nCathi\n \n \n \n ",

She needs to\nstay in the hospital and not insist on going home. I am the worlds worst patient, but when I have been\nso sick, I know the hospital is the best place for me.

      "Content": " Re: Femara and joint pain. I take it too and for the most part have had no awful side effects. However, my knees and ankles often hurt like the ****ens. So, I DID run this one by the onc. early this summer. He said that Femara, although a very good drug for fighting cancer, \"sucks\" calcium from the bones. He upped my daily calcium from 600 mgs. to 1200 mgs. I also take Fosamax for OSTEOPENIA, not osteoarthritis in the left hip joint. It's the osteoarthritis dose (70mgs) once a week. With all of that extra bone building stuff wouldn't expect to have a single pain, right??? But I shudder to think what would be going on if I didn't take all these extra supplements. So you're not imagining the pain, my friends, and we're not only suffering the normal aches and pains of aging. Because of chemo, which ages the body a minimum of 10 to 15 yrs when you have it (read that in a recent newspaper article on the Science page) and all of the add'l drugs after tx we are indeed dealing with far more than the normal, cancer-free individual has to cope with. Hope this helps. Thankfully, we have each other to bounce all of these things off of. Oh, where would we be w/out this board. Love & hugs, Luci\n \n \n \n ",
