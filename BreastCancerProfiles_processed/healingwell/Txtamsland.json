I take everything one day at a time and spend as much time as possible with my kids. I've gone through 3 rounds of radiation 1 on hip 1 on sholder and 1 on spine. I'm allergic to Zometa and Aredia vaused me to be hospitalized with jaw infections 3 times. So I'm not on that anymore. I take Arthrotec that teally helps alot with the pain and what seems like a dozen more meds and suppluments a couple times a day.
