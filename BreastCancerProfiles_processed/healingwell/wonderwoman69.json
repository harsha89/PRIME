    "Content": " Hello, I am 43 years old and just had my first Mammogram done. The radiologist found a suspicious mass in my upper left side of my left breast and I had to go back for another mammogram and an ultrasound. The radiologist thinks it might just be a lymph node because he has no other mammogram to compare it to and told me to get another mammogram in a year to see if there are any changes. My question is, should I be worried about\n waiting a year? Are Lymph nodes something to be concerned about\n? I have had itching under my breast and some soreness in my armpit. \n ",
