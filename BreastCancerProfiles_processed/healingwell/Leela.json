    "Content": " Have you looked into penguin cold caps to prevent the hair loss? I am from the crohn's board but I looked into it to prevent hair loss from remicade. I wound up buying something called arctic cooling cap but penguin cold caps has a whole system to use for chemo. You can do an internet search to find and contact them. I do know someone whose friend did not lose her hair using them. You may also want to ask your doctor or hospital if they have them. ",
