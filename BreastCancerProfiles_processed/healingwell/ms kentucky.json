Birth control until I was 32, then after a hysterectomy I have been on Estriodol, at first it was Estratest. After 14 yrs I just went thru all the biopsies, and even removal of the mass. I have no idea if it was estrogen related but very curious. Will I ever be put back on them? I have a very hard time, emotionally, and with flashes, etc, and I want my hormones back!!!!!How do I find this info out for myself? ",

      "Content": " \n  Well, thanks to all you ladies. When this \n started the catscan was for kidney pain, believe it or not. That sent me to the mammagram, and they sent me straight to ultrasound. Each test confirmed the mass. well, lucky me, I had the biopsy, it was ultrasound guided, on my bday, aug 22, After waiting 8 days for my results, and losing my mind thruought, I got my results. They also pulled me off the hormones I'd been on for over a decade. This didnt help my emotional stability one bit. A prescript\nion of valium and the 8 day wait, came and went when the mammography dept. called wanting me to see a surgeon on Aug 29th. Which I did. They said the biopsy was insufficient, but wanted to remove the mass because because of its appearance, etc. Well, blood work on the 30th, and I was in on Aug. 30, which was yesterday, for a removal. It was a hookwire procedure. The surgeon said he removed it all, now its on its way to pathology, and I am here at home, in bandages. So whatever it was, its outa me now, THANK GOD. I'm very soore, bandaged up, but not quite as nervous as I was. So I'll find out soon if it was benign or malignant. I'm just glad its outa me. He cut underneath the aureola, and I probably will be a lil lobsided but thats fine with me. So what do you gals think? I guess theres a possibility of radiation if the mass proves to have been malignant, and I still havent been given the go ahead on the hormones. I do appreciate all the replies, and thank you all. With your individual cases, does my experience sound close to what you experienced? And what do you think will happen next?  I'll be looking for your words of wisdom..........Thanks from the bottom of my heart. This all happened in a matter of 3 weeks!!!!!! And good luck to everyone else. I love you all. ",
