    "Content": " Hi Lori,\nI am going though something similar. In April 2011 I discovered that I had a \"clearish\" bloody discharge coming from my L nipple. By May I was having surgery to remove a mass. It wasn't cancer. In November 2011 I discovered blood coming from the same nipple. On November 17th I had surgey to remove 3 papaillomas. ( she didn't removed the affected ducts) I developed a post opt infection along with a mass the size of a tangerine. (it couldn't be seen but could be easily felt) I was put on a course of antibiotics along with being given a rocephin shot. My surgeon attempted to drain what was first diagnosed as a cyst then a abscess. it was unsuccessful. An appointment was made for Dec. 27 to have it drained. I went and to my surprised she stated that she didn't need to drain it, that it was a bruise and that I should stop worrying so much. My surgeon was with me a total of 5 minutes during that appointment. I was confused, disheartened and angry. Tonight, yet again, I discovered that I have dark red (close to brownish) discharge coming from the same nipple. Like before it doesn't leak on its own just when the breast is squeezed. I feel as if they have missed something...I also feel as if I have been dismissed by my specialist/surgeon simply because the other 2 diagnoses' weren't cancer... I know that it might be in my best interest to see another specialist... at this point I am just tired, and feeling as if this is a nightmare that won't end... ",
