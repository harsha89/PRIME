      "Content": " Hi I am new here but from what I have read gives me some hope I won't get the worst news on Tuesday am in the uk and literally from mentioning a sore breast to my gp to getting an examination , mammogram , ultrasound and the news that a 14 mm cluster of micro calcifications has been found and I am having a biopsy on Tuesday 28th of August. On Tuesday will be just under 3 weeks .... I am amazed I have been seen and diagnosed so quickly and slightly concerned with the speed I am getting the biopsy that it's bad....even had the cancer nurse who gave me the mammogram phone me yesterday to make sure I was turning up on Tuesday and did I have any questions .... My main worry is the amount of maternal relatives who have had breast cancer and only one has survived. Sorry for throwing this all out in my first post. Just glad so many of the posts I read through were benign and others have had breast cancer and recovered\n ",

      "Content": " Ummm well I want to reply but my news isn't good ..... I too have have had cysts in my left breast ... Removed 15 years ago age 32 . Now for the last 6 months had left breast pain getting worse. I put it down to another fibromyalgia symptom but it just got worse. Went to my gp he examined my breast said he couldn't feel anything but referred me to breast clinic. I am in the uk not sure where you are. The referral to seeing the clinc took just over a week was surprised at the speed... Was examined dr very happy saw and felt no sign of lumps sent me upstairs for mammogram just to be sure . Had mammogram sent straight into another room for ultrasound exam got dressed made my way back to dr who was looking surprised and said .. Good and bad news right breast is fine left breast ( the one with pain 14mm cluster of microcalcifications) am off for a deeper mammogram and biopsy on Tuesday so that will be 3 weeks since mentioning it to my dr to having a biopsy ... Even had one of the cancer nurses from the hospital phone me to confirm I had the letter and was coming and was there anything I wanted to ask .... Which has made me very suspicious that this isn't going to be a good result. If you have pain go back to your gp and insist that tests are redone and ask for an ultrasound I am on reflux meds and anti depressants for my fibromyalgia and no one has suggested this is the cause. Sorry for the negative reply but please try again with your gp\nGood luck xx ",

I have fibromyalgia and chostocondritis in my chest. have had 11 ops over the last 20 years and after every op my nerves around the op go into over drive can't stand anything touching the area .. Nightmare unless you are a naturist... Am in chronic pain for weeks and my scars don't Heal well my gallbladder scar is 7 years old and is still raised purple andlumpy and still I have days when it is sore to touch. I have to have a biopsy for breast cancer on Tuesday.
