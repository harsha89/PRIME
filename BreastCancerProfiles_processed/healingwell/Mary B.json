      "Content": " Thanks for caring!! I went yesterday for my US and they found the mass, the DR was very concerned and I had the biopsy done this morning so now I WAIT. I know you all have been there. The DR said that the up side to all this is that it is small, so that is good. Hugs back to you, it really means a lot to know that someone else is thinking of me. Truthfully, the main concern for me right now is my husband and sons. Our youngest is a sen. in HS and I don't want this for him. But, either way I know that we all will be okay,\nthanks again ",

      "Content": " Hey Girls,\nI am a hairstylist and my moms hair came in really gray and curly, but the gray was GREAT. We added a few highlights when it got long enough and it looked a beautiful platinum blonde (hot mamma) We had a lot of fun styling it. You ladies need to have fun with your new haircuts. Find a Fun and Sensitive stylist and let her experiment with your hair til you find what you love!\nGood luck on the new DOS\nMaryBeth ",
