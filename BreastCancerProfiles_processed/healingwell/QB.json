      "Content": " \n  I don't believe age has not a darn thing to do with your chances of testing positive/negative for breast cancer.  My mother and her mother both had it and both were different types and they were drastically different in age when detected.  I do know if it weren't for my mother testing positive at 28 years old I would have never had the mamogram that produced the odd lump because i am still considered to be too young to require one.  Can someone please tell me now why is it that mamograms are for the most part age restricted?  If it weren't for my mother's case i would have never even known what i know about\n the cyst that i have.  Regardless of the fact that what i do know about\n it is still very little, but i guess i just wish that it didn't take a situation like mine to get the annual testing that pretty much all mature females should be receiving. \n \n ",

What's worse is I am considered the strong oldest child, tomboy, nothing bothers me and now that i am in this little predicament with absolutely no control over what is going on i am losing it in a most \"gracefull\" way. Part of me is ready to break down under the preasure and just ****ing collapse and the other part of me won't even allow the word scared into my vocabulary.  Kind of like split personalities i guess... jesus... does this mean i am nuts too, HA! \n ",
