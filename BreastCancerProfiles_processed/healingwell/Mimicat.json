      "Content": " Hi!\nIt\u2019s been months since I got online because what I have feared to happen seems to be happening now. I have history of breast cancer in my mother\u2019s family. An aunt and a cousin died of breast cancer. Thus, I\u2019ve tried having a lifestyle that will reduce the risk of cancer. I eat healthy, drink herbal teas, and exercise regularly after my OB gynecologist gave me the green light months after I gave birth through normal delivery. But what I did is not enough\u2026\nI'm so anxious at the moment. I'm having nightmares and not sleeping well. I had an ultrasound which showed: 7x3x7 mm breast lesion 2cm from nipple. Hypoechoic with some through transmission. Small echogenic foci are identified within. No vasculariry or architectural distortion. It may represent a fibroadenoma however there does appear to be some tapering suggesting ductal in origin. \nHow likely is this to be cancer? I'm seeing specialist on Friday. The report says it suggest a biopsy. I have a 2-year-old son and I breast fed him for 1.5 years. I thought this would have been protective. I'm really after some support and some insight as to how likely this is something nasty. I actually went in to see my doctor as I had other lumps which just turned out to be benign glandular tissue- just part of my breast anatomy and then they found this unexpected lesion. ",
