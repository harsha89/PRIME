      "Content": " Well, I had rads to spine, hip and shoulder in July.  In August I suddenly couldn't talk properly, thought I'd had a stroke at age 48.  But it was a mass on my skull causing nerve damage to tongue and ear.   So whole head rads for that.  Boy, that really knocked me down.  Then started chemo again.  Most of the time I couldn't have it because the counts were too low.  So epo and neulasta shots and even a transfusion.  Then I started coughing really bad and having trouble breathing.  CT shows cancer in kidneys, liver and lungs was growing.  Lung problem could be damage from rads and/or cancer.  So off the navelbine and xeloda and on to Gemzar.  Also prednisone and an inhaler.  I get very tired from coughing and breathing so don't get much done.  This time I'm even having trouble keeping up with the kids' activities.  But no one seem's to mind dust bunnies everywhere but me!  So I guess I won't worry about them either.  In the 7 years I've been doing this, this time has been the hardest to maintain hope.  I sometimes feel like IT is winning!  But my youngest is only 9 and I want to be here for them.  So more drugs and more willpower.  God Bless you all.  I've been reading periodically but haven't posted for quite awhile.  I did appreciate the call from Gail.  Maybe we can meet up again sometime.      Janice ",
