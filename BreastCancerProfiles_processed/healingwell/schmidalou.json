    "Content": " Hi nana28\nI just came back from having a recall mammogram and ultrasound on my right breast. I was told by the radiologist that they found a small cyst. I am 64 years old post menopausal and not taking hormones.\nThey told me not to worry and come back in 6 months???? They no longer do any drainage breast cysts.\nThis is a worry. I feel as though I should get a second opinion.\nYears ago I had a breast reduction to remove fibrocystic cysts and fluid, therefore, there should be no sign of a cyst.?!\nShould I tell my caregiver to refer me to a specialist for a second opinion? Need advice. \n ",
