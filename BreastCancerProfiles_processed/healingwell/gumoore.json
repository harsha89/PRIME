      "Content": " Hi Kim,\nI'm in Victoria and a 4-yr breast cancer survivor. My one friend, also a breast cancer survivor, called the whole waiting process \"Hurry up....and wait\". It just about\n drove me mad.\nI understand the waiting game. Change in breast May 7, 2006, antibiotics (this will be clear in a moment) x 2, sent for a mammogram, sent for an ultrasound, sent for MRI and biopsy at same time. It was the MRI that provided the guidance to do a needle aspiration biopsy. Diagnosis: August 9, 2006. I was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer.\nIt's not my intent to say you have something wrong. Lumps can be ingrown hairs (with no infection), non-cancerous cysts, etc. \nThe only advice I can offer you is to keep going back until you get an answer and to not worry in between appointments. I know that's easy to say, but it is true.\nThinking of you.\n ",

I found taking a tape recorder or taking a friend all made retaining the information that much better. I spent HOURS on the Internet - and scared myself silly (too much information and too little reliability). I ended up talking a lot to my GP when I first started this journey, using the forums I found for advice.\nAs for mastectomy, because of the type of cancer I have (inflammatory breast cancer), the specialists wait until AFTER treatment to do the surgery (so I've done chemo and rad, and surgery scheduled for May 1st). All I've wanted from day 1 is the breast removed - I wanted the cancer OUT of my body and as far from me as possible. Having had to keep the affected breast the whole time has been hell mentally.\nAnd now that I'm at surgery, I'm opting for a bilateral mastectomy. I found lots of information about\n posture and potential physical problems associated with heavy/dense breasts when only one is removed.\nI still don't know how I'll feel about\n the girls being \"gone\" - I'll know soon enough. Mentally it's the right choice for me. Emotionally - stay tuned!\nHugs to you. My thoughts and prayers are with you.\n \n \n ",

Estratest works by replacing some of the estrogen that is lost when the reproductive system shuts down. Although it relieves the physical symptoms of menopause, it won't help emotional symptoms such as depression if the physical symptoms are absent. It combines supplemental estrogen with a synthetic form of the male hormone testosterone, and is prescribed when estrogen alone fails to relieve menopausal symptoms. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMost important fact about\n this drug\nEstrogen replacement therapy increases the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer in the lining of the uterus). The higher the dose and the longer the treatment, the greater the risk. It's wise, therefore, to limit yourself to the smallest dose that provides relief, and to stop the treatment as soon as you can. It's also essential to have regular checkups and to report any unusual vaginal bleeding to your doctor immediately.\n \n \n ",

I had to laugh at the timing of your question though because I've just gone through my own hair ordeal.\nI will let everyone else address chemo because I want to really address the hair part and because they've done an awesome job.\nMy first chemo was on Aug. 14th. By Sat. 19th, I was starting the thin. The thought of losing my hair in chunks or like this in general really upset me. So I asked my husband to shave my head. He was a gem. He covered the mirror in the bathroom and did it so gently. I think that it was as hard on him as on me. I did cry afterwards.\nFor the first bit, I couldn't bear to look at myself. I wore hats and scarves, but then three days into avoidance, I accidentally saw myself in the mirror. I must admit that I was a little taken aback. You just don't realize how much volume hair adds to the shape of your head.\nNow I'm just fine with it. I still have difficulty in public. What helps me is that my face is the same. Same eyes. Same nose (pity that). Same mouth. That and the fact that I am having an absolute ball with hats and scarves. \nI have purchased a wig (get it tomorrow) for those days when I am able to go out to dinner or socialize a bit, but I suspect that the general rule holds true: you wear it about\n 25-30% of the time.\nKeep us posted!\n \n \n ",

In a rare occurence (or so I'm told), the needle was in a vein right along a nerve and the pain was excruciating (by the way, also a redhead). \nThe second chemo was better for the needle insertion after they found a place to insert, that is. My veins all ran away and said \"No way!\". Fortunately, no pain this time, but the bruise was so purple that I called the nurse line in a panic two days later.\nNow I'm approaching the third course of treatment and already my anxiety is rising. Port was suggested to me last time I was in, but my oncologist was hoping I'd make it to at least half way before the port was installed. The nurse made it sound like it would be on my upper arm, but now that I know that it can be on the chest (collarbone area). \nLive Strong\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks everyone for your wonderful words.\nI kind of went AWOL for a while there. I've been on the biggest roller coaster ever! Dx on Aug 9, met oncologist and did a chemo teach on Aug 11, first chemo on Aug 14th.\nI gotta tell you, no matter what you read or hear about\n the fatigue, there is absolutely nothing to prepare you for it. \nI was nearly driven insane last week with the number of tests to determine if the cancer has spread. Bone test. CT Scan. Heart test. My arm is so bruised from needles and IVs that I look a bit like an amateur junkie who hasn't figured out how to do things yet!!\nRight now I'm one week out of the first chemo and I'm into mouth sores like you wouldn't believe. I see my GP today. My hair started to fall out on Saturday so I shaved my head.\nI actually haven't looked at myself in the mirror yet without a bandana or hat on. I'm still too chicken for that.\nTTFN\n \n \n ",

Seriously, my one true complaint is that it's the breast with the tattoo on! [I do know how to laugh at things, thank goodness!]\nI live in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada and while no stranger to breast cancer (one friend passed away two years ago and another is 4 years no sign of disease after a double mastectomy), I am severely guilty of believing it couldn't happen to me.\nI'm happily married to my soulmate and we're finding this hard to talk about\n together - both not wanting the other to be upset any more than necessary, I'm sure.\nI find the closer I get to the MD with the answer, the more frightened I am. \nI will continue to read the posts of our forum and surround myself in the support I am getting from everyone.\nTTYL\nGayle\n \n \n ",
