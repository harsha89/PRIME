    "Content": " I went in for my routine mammagram and was called back for a mammagram and ultrasound. I did get to see the lump which looked like several atoms stuck together. I am scheduled the 16th for a ultrasound core needle biopsy then results on the 18th. They said it was showing solid and the biopsy would help decide the next course of treatment. Yes, BC is in the family and I have had Fibrostic Cysts since I was 22. This lump was totally different than what I am used to seeing. Has anyone else seen their lumps on the tests? Were they similar and did it turn out to be cancer? ",
