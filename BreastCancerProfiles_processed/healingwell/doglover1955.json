The neurontin is helping, it is just so expensive and I get tired of taking so many drugs. I will keep on that drug till my Dr. appt. at the end of Jan.. Even when the hot flashes are in check, I still seem to have problems sleeping now, I am 55, so maybe age is my problem also. I just have to keep on going cause those dang dogs just won't do anything to help support me! ",
