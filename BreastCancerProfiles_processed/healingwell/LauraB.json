    "Content": " LauraB, age 44 at dx, inflitrating Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, tumor < 1cm. Turned 45 4/18 (Happy B-day to me, huh?!) than had Mod. Rad. Mast. 4/25 with immed. reconstruction (expander), lymphs clear. Unsure as to hormone assay. Met with PS on 5/4....slight necrosis (slap me, but was a smoker). My concern is if nexrosis is reversible (nurse said yes) bur will prob delay any chemo/rad if needed and of course \"fill ups\". Using Neosporin now...any other suggestions? Meeting w/ gen surgeon 5/9, PS again 5/11, ONC 5/19.... ",
