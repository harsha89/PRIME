    "Content": " Hi everyone,\nI represent a group of multi-school student researchers attempting to learn how patients make decisions about\n joining clinical trials. Our goal is to find and propose new ways to help future patients make better decisions about\n joining clinical trials. \nIf you or anyone you know has had to make choices about\n a breast cancer study, please take a minute to participate in this short anonymous survey, or pass the link along. Your participation will greatly help our research. Please accept our deepest thanks.\nSurvey Link (click OR copy and paste line below into your browser):\nhttp://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=eGal5UXQy1eQL6E8rAci9g_3d_3d\n-Steven H. Roffwang\n ",
