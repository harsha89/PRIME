That sometimes work to my advantage that they allow me to act like a baby. I love them dearly. Yet I still have to do what is best for the family which is keep the health insurance going. So see I just like the others making sacrifices for the benefit of the family. I do enjoy reading the postings they really are very helpful. ",
