      "Content": " Boy, I hate it when the site times out and I lost my post!\nA SB is an image guided biopsy that uses computer equipment to get a core sample from the \nlocation specifically identified on the mammogram. It's different in that a wide excision biopsy takes more tissue and has a different level of sedation; this is a very precise method of collecting samples. You'll be on a special table, laying on your stomach; your breast will be suspended through holes in the table. The technicians and Doctor do their medical thing and have you laying very still; the equipment is guided into place and it goes in, takes the sample and gets out. I don't remember it being completely awful, I've gone through better, I've gone through worse.\nDon't let the procedure scare you; it's just a very precise method of sample collection. As far as itching..the breast that did have cancer did not itch, my remaining breast..does...go figure!.\nHave you talked to your breast surgeon? you haven't mentioned that person; I would suggest that you meet with them too.\nTry to let this retreat a little in your head and enjoy the holidays ahead. Let me know what you learn though!...\nkeeping my fingers crossed for you!\nJanice ",

My mammogram was taken in May, biopsy in June, 2nd biopsy in June, mastectomy in later July. The outcome would have been no different than if it were all done on the same day.\nFast forward, 2 years. they've located something on my mri on June 11th in the other breast; I see my surgeon for a needle biopsy on December 6th.\nIt's normal to think that people should jump on something so potentially serious; but 2 weeks is not bad at all.\nGood luck to you and your mother.\nJanice ",

It's difficult to determine what kind of condition your wife may have; I'm not a Dr. and can only offer my opinion. \nWith what you've written, this could be an infection, could be fibrocystic changes, an US will help to identify any changes that may look like it needs a better view; this is a common and reasonable approach to a question on a mammogram.\nI know this doesn't provide you with the answers you seek, but in this case, you're going to have to wait until the ultrasound; make sure you get a copy of the films and a copy of the report, you can request these, normally, at time of check in. If you need to see a Dr. after this, search for a breast specialist and not just a general surgeon; having copies of films and reports will help you in any future appointments, if needed, or for historical record too.\nGood luck,let us know how it goes.\nJanice ",

It's Saturday, so today is a good day to start googling, but Monday morning, call your FP..if you don't need a referral, call the breast surgeon office direct...let them know what is going on; they will guide you and they will know about\n your insurance requirements too.

I'm currently going to physical therapy (isn't that a funny one..PT for my fake boobie!!); it keeps the scar tissue formation less dramatic and less painful. I am retiring at the end of December and my recon spl is talking about\n doing a flap; I'm thinking maybe the end of January? Tom and I are going on a cruise the middle of January..so good timing. I either have to have this thing removed and go with nothing or have the flap; I'm leaning towards the flap.\nIt took 3 tries before they got an onco score last year and it was low, I believe a 9 (maybe 11?), but I think 9; by that time it was already mid to late October. I tried the arimidex for a few months, but felt constantly nauseated and stopped it. I also didn't click with the oncologist...at one point he suggested tamoxifen; even though taking it in the breast cancer prevention trial many years prior, proved that it was to harsh for me, lots of side effects...so, why try it again, and since he knows this, why suggest it?\nAnyway, I haven't seen him for some time, I cancelled the last appointment and didn't go back. I saw my surgeon yesterday and she really wants me on something; said my risk was 1 in 10 if I was on something, 1 in 5 if not. I didn't do chemo, nor radiation and because of extenuating circumstances, they did not do sentinel node; although there was 1 or 2 in the breast tissue and they were clear.\nIn my mind, low onco, ovaries removed in 2004, mid 50's, small inv cancer......I'm not feeling the need, nor the desire to start on one more med.

      "Content": " Hello. I posted here quite a long time ago. I was diagnosed with DCIS, but ended up with a mastectomy after they determined it wasn't the normal DCIS, but aggressive and angry. In the end, the DCIS comprised over 50% of the breast and they also found IDC; the size of the tumor was difficult to tell because the original surgery was done at a hospital out of state. After 3 tries, my onco testing came back as a good score, so that helps a lot. \nAnyway, I have an exceptional PS, but my body isn't acting properly; I've developed capsular contracture twice; I had my 3rd surgery on May 19th; I still have my drains; fighting the adhesion's are a daily issue and I have a blood clot. I'm in PT 3x a week and see my PS weekly to help ward of the CC a third time; if this one fails, I'm out of options. \nThey would like me to take arimidex, but my IgG levels are low and they're not sure why, but the arimidex makes it drop even lower.\nAnyway, not sure what I want..maybe to feel less alone. I don't know of anyone who has had capsular contracture once, much less twice and counting.\nThinking of all of you fighting this battle every day.\nJanice ",

My PS actually talked about\n the sutures at one time, telling me the same thing and he takes some extra steps?....\nI saw my Dr.'s again yesterday. I'm 4 weeks out from the last surgery and on PT days or Dr. visit days, I'm still measuring 100+ cc's in a 24 hour period; this drain isn't coming out anytime soon! I told them how last Friday, they found a blood clot behind my knee; I didn't go to PT that day and the swelling and pain were no fun..no fun! I showed my Husband what they did at PT and he tried..it worked enough to break some of the backlog of fluid. \nI need the PT to help avoid the CC, the PT causes excessive fluid and drainage; the excessive fluid means the drain stays in ..on and on. There's one area that is already developed a bunch of scar tissue; my Dr.'s are hypothesizing that my body is reacting to the extra fluid by developing scar tissue..It's a catch-22 situation..\nThank you for being a shoulder for me to lean on, especially when so many are facing a much more difficult road.\nBigmen, thank you for your prayers :)\nJanice ",

I had my 6th weekly check last Friday; news was not good, I've already developed my 3rd case of capsular contracture; all of the efforts, precautions and extras failed. He removed my drain, which is always a good thing!, but the road ahead for me is to either have the implant removed and have no reconstruction or to have a flap..either tram or lat..he's leaning toward a tram I think. I can't do anything until I retire (hopefully) in February of next year; the surgery...as you are all probably aware requires a lot of time off from work, and I don't have time left...using FMLA or LTD pushes my retirement date back., so we're going to keep working on this thing to keep it from progressing and keep me going until February.\nJanice ",

Others here have said they're up and running in two weeks, boy, not me. They told me not to worry; with as much as I've gone through over the past two years, it will take me 3 months to get up to speed; I feel better knowing that.\nDrains were no big deal to me; 5 surgeries, drains= pita, but nothing else; exhaustion,loss of energy and loss of interest big trouble for me..and, of course, I developed a urinary tract infection, just like I always do around 1 month after surgery.\nTom and I are heading to the home and garden show tomorrow, walk around the arena for a few hours, (will probably do me in for the day), but being up and moving may be just the ticket too.\nI am constantly amazed at the beauty of my reconstruction...keep in mind, I'm 55, so you won't see me as one of Vicki's angels on the catwalk, but oh my, my new breast is perfect, perfect! soft, warm, same size and shape as my other side. The tummy tuck has taken years off my mid section, so, while I have complications, I'm not complaining. I have residual pain from the muscle donor site, but that too will pass. They healed my spirit by recreating my body and I would go through it again.\nI find myself being overly emotional; I chalk that up to screwed up sleep patterns, lingering pain and a long recovery, but spring is here and that helps my mood tremendously. It will be 6 weeks on Monday; they told me it will take longer for me, so, like I said, I'm not going to worry about\n it now.\nBev, you are a god-send! MrsC; I'm glad you stay in touch!

      "Content": " Thank you Kat. Because of my work situation, I had a tissue expander after the mastectomy and developed capsular contracture (grade 4). In an emergent situation, it had to be removed and I had a silicone implant inserted..capsular contracture, again, and again. I have failed this type of reconstruction 3 times; all that I have left is the tissue to tissue. This is a muscle sparing free tram; the amount of muscle is less than 3 inches; I retired last week and I will now have the time available to recover. We have researched and studied and discussed my options. Frankly, I will be happy to get rid of this implant and hopefully never have to have one again. \nI am concerned, could say fearful, but I'm going to go through with it; we're working with my gastro docs at Cleveland to calm the reflux and the asthma is getting better because of it... I'm going to keep my fingers crossed!!!\nThanks for sharing your story, I appreciate it :)\nJanice ",

      "Content": " Hi Mrs. C. My biopsy was done by a surgeon out of my area (that is a whole 'nuther story!) so she called me with the results. \nBreast cancer runs through my family, and although we're not BRCA positive, we get it just the same, so my reaction was not like one might expect; it was..okay lets deal with it, what's next.\nI went back to the surgeon and she did a wide excision biopsy; that came back with an aggressive form of DCIS and no clear margins. Long story short, I ended up with a new surgeon an hour from my home and she did a mastectomy; it was the pathology on the tissue from that which created the problems. \nMy path report showed the breast was 50% involved with this aggressive form of DCIS and they also found Invasive cancer; my new surgeon was quite angry, because she said it was a complete impossibility for the first pathology to have missed it.\nSo, here I am now, 1 1/2+ years out; I did not have radiation, I did not have chemo and I did not want to go on an aromatase inhibitor; I did try it, I did stop it. Additional genetic testing on the tissue showed a low score for recurrence ( an \"onco type\" score).\nThe problems I encountered have been in reconstruction, not because of my recon spl., but because of other challenges. I never wanted to go with an implant, but I did not have the luxury of taking 3 months off from work, so implant it was. My body doesn't like implants, and I have developed capsular contracture 3 times. I retired at the end of December, and on Monday, I'm going in for the free flap tram reconstruction.\nI am a very practical minded person, Mrs. C., and I don't deal well with wringing my hands and wondering what to do. I have to say, I have many health challenges and I've learned to deal with each the same way:\n1. learn as much as you can about\n it.\n2. learn what your options are and what is best in your mind and heart for you.\n3. learn who you can lean on and who will support you.\n4. allow yourself time to grieve, time to cry, time to grow and time to overcome.\n5. if your Dr.'s don't provide you with what you need, fire them and find one that does.\n6. you've already found healingwell, this has been a tremendous source of support and knowledge for me; it helps to have others to talk to that have been through it.\nYou want to hear something ironic?? After surgery, I contacted one of the local breast cancer support groups..guess what they told me...you didn't have your surgery here, we can't help you!! Holy cow!, who knew cancer was so territorial!! LOL!!\nGood luck Mrs. C! Like I said, we're here for you!\nJanice ",

The drain from the mastectomy wasn't removed until 6 weeks and only because they had to remove it, I was still draining a lot.

The implants were never my first choice; but because of my work schedule I couldn't take the time necessary to heal for a tissue reconstruction. The original plan (July 09) was to have a tissue expander in place until I retire (which is coming up in a few weeks).\nI quickly developed grade 4 capsular contracture and have been battling it since; I'm on my 2 silicone implant since the original tissue expander.\nI'm going to have the muscle sparing free tram, the first part of February, in Grand Rapids; do I feel fairly nervous about\n this? you bet! I underwent major surgery at Cleveland in July 08 on my stomach and esophagus and I was becoming close to a basket case with that. Normally, this sort of thing doesn't phase me, but the Cleveland surgery shook me up pretty badly and I can already feel it with this.\nPerhaps it's the pain, I don't know; but I sure would like to hear from others who underwent a flap reconstruction!\n♥\nJanice ",

Saturday morning I felt like a truck hit me!; but it convinced me that I need to watch this inactivity closely.\nMonday I see my family practice doc; he is wonderful and will talk to him about\n continuing some sort of very low profile PT; although my PT people don't require a script\n for me; professional/personal courtesy; it may be best to have something.\nI continue to be surprised at the lack of energy; considering the previous surgeries (implant vs recon), this one is really getting the best of me. Still; the difference in my appearance; even though the breast is still swollen, is amazing and based on that alone, I am glad I'm going through this.\nI'll continue to post my progress; hopefully it will help someone else thinking of or going into this surgery.\nJanice ",

I am very thin only 100lbs 5'2' and was not informed that it was not a good surgery to have if you are too thin. I would not have gone through it if I'd known. The surgeons strongly recommended this type of surgery to me and I wish I'd known what I know know.\nSince then I have had seromas in the abdomen which is still lingering around and trouble breathing and it's really bothering me as I am now not able to eat much at all. How long will this breathing problem stay? I've spoken to my PS and he told me it's early days and it's going to be more difficult because you are so thin. The chemo seems to have made the situation worst.\nI wonder if anyone has had similar problems and if this feeling will go away soon. The muscle is like a rock in the middle separating my body.\nHow long do I have to wait for it to go down? ",

      "Content": " Hi. I had the lumpectomy last Friday; the biopsy in May showed a small area of DCIS, 6 mm; the final path from Fridays procedure measured 3.2 cm! We just got home from a sort of discouraging Dr. appt. We met with the Radiation Oncologist; he was wonderful, he said they were all taken by surprise by the size of this thing and were in no way prepared for that finding, nor the finding of a second site.\nBecause of the size of the mass, I do not qualify for the 5 day mammosite radiation, but instead have to do the 6 week stuff. \nThe final path shows that it is fast growing, fairly aggressive and has a high likelihood for recurrence, hence the need for a different type of radiation. My Van Nuys is 7.1; the margins aren't as clear as they would like and tomorrow my surgeon, the RO and the pathologist are meeting, reviewing the slides and determining if they have to do more surgery. The RO has brought up the idea of mastectomy. \nI'll know about\n the surgery tomorrow, this really wasn't the news we had hoped for, but it could be worse; they did not find any place where the cancer was invasive, but because of discovery of the second site and the size of the mass, they may have to go back in. \nHow does a mammogram show just a small bit of microcalcifications, but the the lumpectomy come up with 3.2 cm? I think everyone has the same thought too, if the mammo missed something of this size, what else is it missing?\nJanice\n ",

I found forums and read, asked and listened and one by one, I dropped out, why? because of the negativity and quarreling that went on between members..except here. Healing Well has been the most exceptional place for knowledge and I don't know who named this place, but my props to them! Because of Kitt, our moderator there and the wonderful people who came before me, I got through my fears, had the surgery, the pitfalls, recovery and I'm on the other side helping where I can now.\nI'm grateful for the breast cancer forum as well, I'm finding the same spirit here as on GERD, so it's a comforting place to be. People like you who come in to say hello and offer words of wisdom are priceless and I thank you for that!\n---|__ (Janice getting off her soap box and walking !)\nThere is no talk right now about\n sentinel node, but we have a phone appointment with my surgeon on Wednesday. (I'm in Michigan and she is in Indiana..strange, I know, but I've been with her since she started practicing at Michigan State and then she moved to Goshen and I followed her!). I will ask her about\n it then.\nI still have questions about\n the high nuclear grade vs. the architecture of the cells and the spread of the multifocal cells (did I say that right?) and how that affects the treatment decisions. \nIf you can think of other questions I should, please let me know what they are! \nThank you!!\nJanice ",

      "Content": " Hi Judy, I've just started this process. Mine started out as DCIS (A little itty-bitty no big deal thing, is the way it was described to me) back in May; I switched surgeons and I just had a mastectomy two weeks ago; they found invasive ductal carcinoma, stage 2, but without lymph node involvement. Because I had major surgery last year and used up a lot of my time I'm not in a position to go through the entire reconstruction process now.\nIn a phased approach, we've gone with a tissue expander for now; I retire in a year and 1/2 and will finish it then. I've had a good amount of pain, they gave me ultram for it and it work only kind of okay; once I supplanted it with something else, I felt a lot better. I have the pulling and discomfort especially around the fold, I've wondered about\n the length of time that it will take before it stops feeling so odd and the pain or discomfort will stop too.\nI've wondered too about\n the TRAM flap thing as well. It is not the method that I want to use, my PS thinks that we'll have great results from that and I've already gotten the sit up talk...a friend though had it 10 years ago and still has problems with her back from it, so I'm no sure I want to go that route.\nI'm wearing a Wycoal bra and it seems to be fairly comfortable..not great, but tolerable. Right now, I'm still waiting to get the drain out; it will be 2 weeks tomorrow and I'm still draining a lot.\nI'm interested in everyones' discussion here and I hope you continue to heal Judy.\nJanice ",

We did go back on Monday; the DCIS is similar to yours and I am going to have a mastectomy; she told me that they would not be surprised to find an area of microinvasion or outright invasion. \nBecause of the high false negative rate we are going to forego the MRI for now, MSU has a new type of mamogram machine that is beyond the normal digital type..I'll be screened every 6 months on the left side to watch.\nI'm struggling a bit here, maybe you can give me words of wisdom! This started out as an itty bitty, no big deal DCIS; expected to be 1 cm or less and in a very short time its become just the opposite. The last two days I'm finding myself becoming more emotional about\n this, and that is normally not my style..I cannot reconcile this change very easily. It's still not a fear of cancer, I think its the realization of the magnitude and the fear of what it's going to look like afterwards.\nI am going to have reconstruction, but it will be later for so many reasons; I wish I could do it at the same time, but it just doesn't look like that is possible.\nThank you, everyone, again, for helping me down this path.\nJanice ",

I called my family Dr. and spoke with him and by the next morning I still felt the same way, so 2 weeks before surgery, I fired my surgeon.\nSo, now I'm in the process of finding someone new; we're meeting with one Dr. on Tuesday and another one on Thursday....we'll see how it goes!\nJanice ",

Today's visit produced a no-go on the removal of the drain; we'll see what the volume is like next week. Thanks for the heads up on the discomfort, because it really is, but, like I always say, it can always be worse! I've switched to Motrin 800's the ultram helped a little as long as I doubled up and 2 hours later followed up with something else. I've heard of Lortab, but know little of it.\nI had to look up mastopexy, didn't know what that was! LOL!, but I do now! Right now the plan is to keep the tissue expander in place until I retire and then go for something else. I'm planning on going back to work tomorrow, yes, I know it's Friday, but it's a Friday when most are going to be out of the office, so I can come in and work quietly, then go home and spend the weekend and start up next week, hopefully stronger!\nYou keep getting better Judy!\nJanice ",

What was odd, was when I started asking too many questions of the first surgeon...she got quite angry..which is why we searched for someone new. \nAfter the mastectomy, my new surgeon was fairly upset..not at me mind you, she said it was an impossibility for the first pathology to have not shown invasive...an impossibility. I don't know why that is, but there you have it just the same. It was because of the mammo and the pathology that they didn't feel that there would be anything other than DCIS. She did come upon 1 node during the mast., and that was negative, but was that a sentinel node? I haven't a clue.\nThinking back on it though, we met with the radiation oncologist at that time, he said this wasn't your typical DCIS, but serious, angry stuff; the first surgeon blew that comment off completely...makes me wonder now. \nWe are actually quite comfortable with the new surgeon, even with this situation; it's the oncologist that I'm having an increasingly frustrating time.

      "Content": " Hi Judy and thank you too. I posted this on the other forum with the folks that I speak to regularly. I'm feeling a great deal of relief today because of the phone encounter I had yesterday with the head nurse at a reconstructive specialist not far from my home:\n~~~\nI'm 1 1/2 years from retirement and I am trying rebuild my leave balances (after using them all last summer for the Nissen), so right now I have just enough to cover 5 weeks of being off. That has to see me through the surgery coming up and any follow ups...that leaves nothing for reconstruction. Where I work I do have disability, but it affects my retirement date, my pension and other things, and being so close to that date, I have to keep that in mind.\nAnyway, long story short, I was put in contact with an exceptional reconstruction specialist, just 1 1/2 hours from home. I called and his nurse talked with me for 40 minutes and told me so much. The best news ( for me) is that I can wait until after I retire to do the reconstruction! The reconstruction takes 8 to 10 weeks to recover (get this) from the FIRST! phase of the surgery..you have to go back for a second go round 6 months later.\nMy point, I guess, is that being given the freedom to wait until after I'm retired frees me from the worry that I've been carrying about\n this time issue. I slept last night so soundly, it was wonderful!!!!\n~~~\nI am, by nature, a control nut. knowledge, order, that's me! The issues I have had with this is not being able to get the knowledge and the the inability to put it into an order in my head to make things work for me. I think, with the conversation I had yesterday, that this is finally coming together and with that comes peace of mind for me....I am so grateful!!!!\nJanice ",

The biopsy, compared to shoulder surgery, is a walk in the park... but yes, there is discomfort, for some more than others.\nDCIS is cancer that is in the milk ducts within the breast; these milk ducts are quite extensive throughout the breast and the DCIS I had covered about\n 40% of the ductal tissue; it looks and acts differently than a lump or a mass. Picture an department store with lots of aisles, these aisles are the milk ducts and the cancer is running down the aisles, but not leaving the aisles to go look at the clothes. It's when it decides to actually break free from the aisle and go look at the clothes that it becomes invasive.\nWhen your tissue goes to pathology is segmented into \"blocks\", so depending on what is sent you can have many blocks are just a couple. Anyway, to update you on me; this final block had enough cancer cells for the Onco testing; my score?, a nice and cozy 14! So no chemo for me, just Arimidex..the postmenopausal version of Tamoxifen. \nWas my surgery done correctly, I think so, yes. She called me her 1 in a million patients...not necessarily using that exact phrase, but I am very rarely \"textbook\", so it doesn't surprise me.\nI still have to have surgery to have the tissue expander and scar tissue removed; the visit with that Dr. is next Tuesday.\nJanice ",

The biopsies also show atypical hyperplasia and other abnormalities, so it appears as though I am just an event in the making!\nI'm am one of these people who needs massive quantities of data in order to make an informed decision and the information out there is so contradictory; it does not help! I'll be doing the mammosite 5 day radiation, that seems like such an easier way to go.\nFrayda, my Dr. agrees with yours; while I tested negative and my cousin did as well, there has to be some sort of genetic turnkey that is responsible for many of us developing this. When I talked to one of my cousins the other night, she told me that she was diagnosed with invasive dcis; according to literature, that too seems contradictory, but there is that point where dcis can turn invasive; hers did and with my being noted as high grade it's likely that mine would have turned eventually too.\nThanks again for your help.\nJanice ",

She is absolutely amazing; she provided my Husband and I with more information and confidence than you could imagine. We spoke of the surgeon situation and she referred me to a surgeon nearby and was able to get us in with her last Tuesday.\nWe spent an hour with the new surgeon and she too is very good; we came away feeling like we were in the best of hands. This new surgeon, the reconstruction specialist all work together with others as needed and are always communicating with each other and you; they've pulled my family Dr. into the mix (even though we live 1 1/2 hours away).\nWe both feel like we missed a bullet with my other surgeon, even though I had known her for so long. We feel, comfortable, confident and like we're in the best of hands.\nThank you again for your kind words and support, we have a good ending to this story!!!\nJanice ",

I didn't feel it was appropriate to talk about\n this on the GERD forum, it is after all, a completely different issue and I didn't want go into details there.\nI've been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, the earliest possible; it has not invaded other tissues and that is a very good thing; it has been graded as high nuclear grade, which from what I understand, is a faster growing, more apt to be invasive type of cancer. \nIt has been found in all 4 of the samples and it's called multifocal; right now I'm looking at a lumpectomy, which is scheduled for Friday, June 19th and then following up with radiation. The radiation is a newer kind, which is only 5 days instead of 6 weeks. It's more intense and done from inside the breast as opposed to the lower dosage, external radiation, but 5 days instead of 6 weeks..yay!\nI have a phone appointment with my Dr. on Wednesday, we still have some questions; I've learned a lot since we first found out, but still some questions remain and those questions affect some treatment options, so we'll see.\nCompared to what some of the other good women on this forum are going through, this is not that big a deal, but I appreciate your support, friendship and hugs!\nJanice ",

This is why you get a yearly mammogram..a digital one at that!!!\nUntil pathology tells us differently, we're moving forward with a lumpectomy; my Dr. will take a certain amount of tissue which will be checked right away for clear margins. You want a certain edge of normal tissue surrounding the cancerous stuff, because they found it in a couple of places, even though they may be small, the final pathology may dictate more surgery. \nI didn't feel it was appropriate to talk at length about\n it on our GERD forum and I knew you were wondering where this was coming from, so I thought posting here was a good idea.\nDo not feel badly! there are others who aren't as lucky as I am; I am grateful for our friendship and the friendship we all share on the forum!!\nBill, once you're out of the hospital you can spend energy on me!!, until then buddy...GET WELL!!!!!

      "Content": " I used to post on the GERD forum (Kitt is an AMAZING! woman!), bu this is my first here. \n I need your wisdom and advice. I have an extensive family history of breast cancer and have had biopsies and close calls, etc. Now I've had another mammogram with a call back and they found a cluster of microcalcifications; another trip to my specialist where she did a stereotactic biopsy. The result are back with DCIS, Grade 0, 6mm; recommendation: lumpectomy followed by 5 day mammosite radiation.\nI'm a realist, I'm not afraid of a diagnosis; you can't be, not in my family, but what I can't wrap my head around is the need for any treatment for this. I've read that this is not a cancer, but a pre-cancer; another says, it is a cancer, but not invasive, but it may become invasive if left untreated.\nA chance of this becoming a slow growing \"real\" cancer is not, to me, a reason to jump into a surgical intervention right now. Because of a long standing issue, I have been on estratest (ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in 04); I am more inclined to stop the HRT and wait 6 months to see if there is a change in the mammogram, rather than go in for another surgery. I've had genetic testing, I am not BRCA positive.\nDoes anyone, anyone, have words of wisdom that will help me to determine if this is a reasonable course of action? Am I just in denial, or is this the result of being diagnosed with a \"less than\" type of situation than my mother, sister, aunts and cousins? ",

I'll be doing the mammosite 5 day radiation, that seems like such an easier way to go....My path report showed the breast was 50% involved with this aggressive form of DCIS and they also found Invasive cancer; my new surgeon was quite angry, because she said it was a complete impossibility for the first pathology to have missed it. So, here I am now, 1 1/2+ years out; I did not have radiation, I did not have chemo and I did not want to go on an aromatase inhibitor; I did try it, I did stop it....I didn't do chemo, nor radiation and because of extenuating circumstances, they did not do sentinel node; although there was 1 or 2 in the breast tissue and they were clear.
