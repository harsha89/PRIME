While the radiologist made a point to say that the left (calcification) looked fine, he said that the right looked very suspicious and went on to tell me that there were \"great therapy options\" now. That made me very nervous and I'm expecting bad news. So, what's next? You are all so much more knowledgable than I. Thanks, ",
