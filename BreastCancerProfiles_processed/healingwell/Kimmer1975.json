    "Content": " 8 weeks ago I found a pea sized lump in my left breast at 2\"o'clock. Given that my Aunt was diagnosed at 38 with invasive breast cancer, I've always been sure to do self exams. Sadly, my Aunt passed away at age 44. I waited a couple weeks to see if the lump disappeared incase it was simply a menstrual issue, but it didn't. It is now 8 weeks later and the lump is hard and twice the size. I went to the doctor who then sent me for a Breast Ultra sound. I am 36 so he opted against a Mammogram because of my age. The results were simply this \"Multi Septated Nodule, recommend another ultra sound in 3 months\". Are you kidding me? When I spoke to the doctor he said he could not say one way or the other if this is something serious. At first, he thought we were talking about\n my Ovary. Then realized his mistake after I was confused and questioned what he was talking to me about\n. \nHas anyone had anything similar come back on a Breast Ultra Sound and if so, what was your experience. I am living, sleeping and breathing this lump right now. It's nagging me. I can't figure out if it is worry or intuition. When I feel the like it is hard, bumpy (not smooth) and pretty much stays in the same spot. No pain at all. It's just there and growing. One side of the lump has defined edge where it drops off but the other side, I can't tell where the lump starts and the regular breast tissue is. It seems to blend in on the one side. \nI have not had any luck with replies on any other forum. I would appreciate any type of feedback what so ever. Experience? Support? Anything at this point. I'm very nervous and can't get rid of the nagging feeling I have that something just isn't right. \n \n ",
