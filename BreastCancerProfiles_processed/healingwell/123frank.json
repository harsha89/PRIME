      "Content": " Well, just found out this morning ...there was good news..it turned out to be a complex 6mm cyst that was benign. The doctor does want my wife to go to a breast specialist to have the remaining portion removed. Doctor said it was uncommon for a cyst to grow it the area where it was found. It appears that they want to keep an eye on the area. Hopefully all will remain well..thanks for your answers and support. I wish you all the best and a happy holiday season ! ",

      "Content": " Hi all, I am writing on behalf of my wife who is not internet savvy and wanted to ask a question. My wife who is 56 with no history of BC in her or her family was called back for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. She had the tests yesterday and was told by the radiologist that she needs a biopsy with fine needle aspiration. It appears that she has 2 cysts in her left breast. One is OK and the other requires the biopsy. The radiologist also told her that the troublesome cyst looked partially filled with liquid and may go away after it is aspirated. Why is the radiologist recommending this if it is only a cyst ? Are complex cysts different and require more diagnosis? Are they indicative of cancer or does the radiologist want to play it safe...Thanks, Very Nervous in NY. ",

      "Content": " Well my wife went for her needle aspiration today, however, the doctor was unable to actually aspirate the cyst. The complex cyst was very small, maybe 3 mm and round. She told my wife that the reason they wanted it examined was the color, not the shape or size. I wonder if its small size made it more difficult to aspirate? The doctor was eventually able to remove the entire cyst and did verify visually that it is a complex cyst with solid parts as well as some darkish fluid in the center. It has been sent off for biopsy but we will not know for a couple of days. I don't know if this is good or bad but we are anxious about\n getting the results. ",
