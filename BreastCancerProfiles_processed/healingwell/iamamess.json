I have not seen a surgeon yet, that is next week, and I feel like I just can't get through this . Is this a common reaction? Diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. 2 nodules, 1 is grade 1 and the other grade 2. I don't even know what any if this means. I sure don't want to start looking up things on the internet either. I also suffer from anxiety and panic disorder and am on that forum too.\nSo, so, sad! \n ",

      "Content": " MedicalCatchAll just saw your post. Had surgery a little over 6 months ago. Surgery went well and I had my right breast mastectomy. I decided against reconstruction after surgery, worried about\n complications because of my weight. It was a little hard to adjust to having a flat side along with a saggy D cup breast. LOL.. Margins and lymph nodes clear so no chemo or radiation needed. I was really lucky. \nI have my silicone prosthetic and all new bras and I feel whole again. Realization sets in at bedtime when I remove my bra. I am now taking Letrozole. This is something I will take for 10 years, I believe. There are side effects that bother me but, a small price to pay to keep me cancer free.\nI am sorry you have to go through this, but you will do great. I had so much support from family and friends and that means so much. I hope you too have a great support system. \nLet me know how everything goes. ",
