      "Content": " My girl friend was diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer in August of 07. In december she had a double masectomy and 26 lymph nodes removed. She just received news that there is cancer in her liver and bone and more lymph nodes. She lives across the country from me and she is losing hope. I want to send her some books that might bring her strength and hope. Has anyone read a truely inspiring book that might bring my friend some hope. There are so many books out there to choose from, I was hoping to get some insight from people who have an idea of what my friend is going through, and some books that gave them strength and hope to keep fighting.\n \n ",
