      "Content": " I post on the prostate cancer site as my husband has PCa.\nNow I have referred my friend to this site who has survived breast cancer 6-7 years ago.\nShe had another lumpectomy today but was told breast lump is not cancer.\nShe had pet scan a couple of weeks ago as she was having pain in her extremities and found there is cancer in her leg and arm and is waiting for the next step as to treatment options.\nHas anyone experienced this kind of spread without the breast lump having cancer? Is it necessary or can it be determined if this pain in her extremities is breast cancer spread? Is this important as to treatment option?\nRegards,\nBOOGEE ",
