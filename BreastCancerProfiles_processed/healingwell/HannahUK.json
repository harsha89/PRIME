    "Content": " Hello All,\nThe Stress, Trauma, Adjustment and Recovery (STAR) Study is part of a PhD research project being conducted by Hannah Stockton at the University of Nottingham. This online study examines the process of coping with stressful or traumatic life events or emotional upheavals. As a visitor to this cancer forum, it is likely that you or someone you love may have been diagnosed with cancer. For many people, the diagnosis of cancer serves as a traumatic stressor and causes great psychological distress as you battle the emotional demands of the illness. There is also a growing body of evidence to suggest that people can develop posttraumatic stress disorder following their diagnosis of cancer. \nEveryone is affected differently by traumatic experiences: some people cope fairly well and are able to move on with their lives, whilst others may struggle with symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety or depression. Either way, whatever your experience, the STAR study would like to hear from you. The STAR Study is currently recruiting and would like to invite anyone who has experienced a traumatic or stressful event to take part. This might mean you respond by focusing on your experience with cancer, whilst for some of you there may have been other events in your life that have been more traumatic, in which case you can base your responses on these events. It is entirely up to you how you respond, and you do not necessarily have to currently be troubled by your experience to take part.\nThe study involves completing an online questionnaire which asks about\n the most traumatic event you have experienced and its impact on the way you feel about\n your life, your self and your future. It should take approximately 15-20 minutes to complete. All responses will be completely anonymous and strictly confidential, you will not be asked to give your name, and you may stop at any time and delete your answers if you change your mind. The study has had full approval from the ethics committee at the University of Nottingham, and adheres to the British Psychological Society's code of conduct.\nFurther information is available at the STAR Study website: http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/KRHGGQH\nPlease contact me via PM if you have any questions about\n the research. Thank you for taking the time to read about\n this project.\nHannah Stockton\nHealth & Clinical Psychology Doctoral Candidate\nInstitute of Work, Health and Organisations,\nUniversity of Nottingham\n(Please note that this post has been approved by Peter Waite) ",
