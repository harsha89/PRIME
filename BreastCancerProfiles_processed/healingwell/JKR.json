The radiologist said it was a cyst and to do a follow up in six months. I asked if I needed to have it aspirated and she told me it was my decision but she would send the report to my doctor with the results plus recommending a six month recheck. She did hand me a pamphlet about\n the procedure for aspiration. I'm a total worryier so wonder if I should have it aspirated for piece of mind. I have an appointment with my gynecologist on 29 October so will ask her opinion. ",
