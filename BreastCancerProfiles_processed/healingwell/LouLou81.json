    "Content": " I have had burning pain in my left breast for over a month. I also have thick yellow/white nipple discharge. My breast is hot to touch, and moderately swollen. The pain is near my underarm but shoots through to my nipple and that pain is quite severe. I have noticed a change in the skin texture in one area of my breast. \nI have now been to the doctor twice, first time I was given a 10 day course of augmentin, second time a 15 day course of fluclox. After 2 rounds of antibiotics there is no improvement.\nI have another appointment tomorrow, what tests should I be asking my doctor to do? I really don't want to walk away with another course of antibiotics and no answers..... ",
