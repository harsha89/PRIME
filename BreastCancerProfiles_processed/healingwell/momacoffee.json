      "Content": " Hello everyone!\nI'm in the cluster microcalcification boat, and I'm really scared! I'm an RN, but I don't deal with breasts. I am a Neonatal ICU nurse. I've already had my 2nd mammogram with magnification. I'm scheduled to have my biopsy on Wed. My radiologist told me that he wasn't just getting a biopsy. He was going to try to get all the microcalcifications. This is different from anything I've read. He is being very aggressive. I am thinking the worst! I have been all over the web and it's scaring me. I don't want my husband and children to worry but one of my girls is also a RN and she is asking too many questions! I'm scared!\nSusan ",
