All i can do is try to comfort you and be hear to listen to you. I see you say this happened after your Biopsy i had no idea that this could happen from a biopsy, apperently I didnt fully understand everything they were saying to me. I didnt have anything like that happen, althugh contrary to what they said it did hurt me a lot =(. the first needle was fine the second holy moly!! they should be grateful i let them do any more after that but they did and i got my results. I am having to wait to see my specialist, i get in on the 8th of this month I thank God for that, so i can relate to feeling like not doing anything to fight the cancer, that is a real sun of a gun and the helplessness and fear is incredible! Please come back and let me know how you are doing and vent or cry or sit in silence or have a happy moment our feelings are what they are and i can accept the good the bad and the ugly no problem, what ever you need to do I am here i check in every day that I am home, if i miss a day or something it is because i am seeing the Dr's, but i will be back =) Big hug ",

My diagnosis reads as this breast mass is suggestive of invasive ductal carcinoma and lymph nodes are positive for metastasis. you all probably know a heck of a lot more what that means than I do. \noddly enough the thing that jumped out at me was this..we lose our eye lashes too?! I mean im no beauty queen so concite is far down the list of my personality but geez really! =( I am just trying to come to terms with losing a breast or both and the real possibility i might not make it although i am very optomistic that my fighting spirit and family and freinds old and new will pull me through. \nLike i said i dont know much and to be frankly honest im scared out of my mind to learn to much to fast =( even though time is really not on my side It takes a lot for me to process this at all. please bear with me. =( \nI apoligize if this is the wrong place to post this.

Feeling off kilter last couple of days, it is the oddest feeling, A mix of emotions all wrapped into one big ball, so If someone asked me how i was feeling i would have to answer honestly, which feeling do you want to know about\n lol. One Feeling i can unequivocaly say that is there is Gratitude, i am so grateful I'm not alone. That may sound selfish, but this is such a selfish disease! =( It takes so much and gives nothing back, I am just Grateful that there are women and men who are willing to give so much, so that the fact that this disease may take a lot from us, but there are women and men who are willing to give so much more. thank you every one and thank you Deb, your words mean a lot to me.

      "Content": " Understand it is a huge decision and I hope that you can find it in your heart and head to make the one that is best for you. Talk to your surgeon and ask him to give it to you straight and what he recommends and why one option is better than the other. Every situation is different, eventhough we all have the same disease, it is important to talk to your surgeon and ask for straight up facts, and what your chances are for reacurance with a lumpectomy versus a masectomy so you can make a informed decision. Hearing the facts can really be hard on us but we have the right and need to know the facts. Will be here for you no matter what, and yea this is a brutal disease on so many levels. Be gentle with your self, and know that what ever you feel, is ok. I too was told by my surgeon that the type of breast cancer i have has a high rate of recurrance, and it is already very advanced, however, I still have choices and options, and I hold those choices very near and dear, and make as informed ones as I can. My surgeon told me that it wont make a difference if I have a mast or a lumpectomy in my treatment, radiation and chemo will be the primary treatment for my cancer, so i opted for the lumpectomy, and lymph node removal as that I really had no choice in the lymph node removal, if i was doing what was best for me. If it comes back, the surgeon said it probably wont be in my breast but some were else in my body. for you hun though this is stuff you need to discuss thuoraly with your surgeon, as we all have different options, even though we all have the same disease. We disscussed it thouraly so I am confident I made the right decision for me, based on the facts. My other Dr, also concured that this is a good decision based on my facts, so am pretty optimistic eventhough the treatments are going to be very aggressive, will cross that bridge when i get to it =). Please keep in touch and feel free to write anything and everything, no judgement here =). No need to be sorry for how you feel, or if what you say does not make sense to others, cause Honestly we are all speaking the same language here and totally get what you are saying and even what you are not saying. It really a painful decision to have to make and come to a place of acceptance, that \"yea I can live with this decision.\" keep in touch and im Rooting for you!! Hugs. ",

      "Content": " Hey Tammid, I already had my biopsy, I am going for the scan/ MRI and chest exrays on the 8th. this is to make a determination as to whether my cancer has spread from my lymph nodes to other parts of my body. You need the biopsy to determine whether there is cancer cells present, the MRI is to determine how far it has spread if at all. the MRI will also show any abnormalities present, so it is really a good idea to do both, as from what I understand is if they find cancer they are not always able to detect cancer cells that are present else were, thats why they do MRI. However, they havent confirmed you have cancer present in the breast so it is important to have the biopsy and get confirmation or woo hoo im healthy or the alternative which is you do have cancer and you are going to fight it and be healthy, happy and cancer free, positive thinking. The MRI is probably a percautionary procedure as they want to be sure they do all they can to come to a confirmative diagnosis of positive or negative. I didn't get schedualed for the scans till after my confirmation, but you may have a Dr that is very cautious and cares about\n you a lot so he wants to cover all the bases, I would put your faith in God of your understanding, your Dr and yourself =) and do biopsy and if they want a MRI i would do that too, and don't be afraid to ask them why they want to do it this way. I know it really hard to relax and wait the waiting is awful, and talk about\n yur fears and feelings it is ok to feel what ever you are feeling it is normal and it is normal to be scared. no matter what happens I will be around if you need some one to talk to or sit with you in those moments when the day aint so bright and the light at the end of the tunnel looks suspiciously like a train lol. We will have our moments many many moments in a day and they are all going to be diffrent some good some bad and some downright ugly, but im here to share them all with you if you need and want too =) ",

This is what i think is happening they are not sure what the spot is and the surgeon/specialist wants to take a closer look at it and make a confirmative diagnosis as to what it is. It is scary as heck i know, and it is really hard to deal with the what ifs and not freak out. The spot could be any number of things so they really need to take a closer look. they would not do anything drastic unless they know conclusivly that it is indeed Breast cancer and to do that they really need a sample of the spot/tissue.They would let you know if it was cancer and they knew that how could they with hold information like that from you? If they did I would be astounded. I have been newly diagnosed so I may not be much help, but the one thing I can do is understand what you are going through right now in this moment. no matter what see the dr and let me know how it goes ok and if you need to talk i will check in here as talking to you helps me too =D\nHugs ",

When he said immediatly I think thats when I thought ok this is not good. So being told they want extra testing done sends off all kinds of alarm bells hey? I really did not think to much about\n it though till i got the confirmation of the results back, that is partly my hubby though as he is a born optimist and it tends to rub off on me too lol. more indepth mammogram do they mean they want to do an ultra sound?

      "Content": " Hey Deb, newly diagnosed with breast cancer. I been reading your posts every day for the last few days. It helps me to read post from other women who have gone through or are going through what i am about\n to step into the ring with. I cant relate to the infections and wounds as I have not had surgery yet, althugh i am scared. some of the things you said too i can relate to though, not being able to sleep for one, for different reasons, however lack of sleep or improper sleep can really take a toll on a person especially on us =(\nTrying to wallow in self pity..don't confuse genuine greif with pity hun. It is very early for me and already i am painfully aware that we run a gambit of emotions some are not fun nice pretty or easy to deal with, but it is definatly not self pity! Self pity would be giving up and saying the hell with it what will be will be, you are obviously not giving up so feel what you feel ebrace it and know that feelings change for us like a cloudy day turns bright and visa versa sometimes through the course of a day we feel more than we felt in one day when we were not sick, or maybe we just more sensative to how we are feeling i don't knwo but i do know this I feel what I feel for a reason and no one should taketry to that away from me or anyone.\nAs for the last thing i have not had my right breast removed yet although i know it is inevitable as I have stage 4 cancer and im 45 years old, does that sound like self pity? lol, if it does that ok it make me mad, i had grand plans for my self and my husband, who just recently had a mild stoke. But if i put myself in your shoes, which is not to difficult for me to do, I can understand wanting to feel whole, and normal. Some will opt to have reconstructive surgery some will not. But the common thing we all have is that we do have to come to terms with the fact that we have breast cancer and it leaves scars. wanting to feel a sense of normalcy is totally ok you know, its not about\n impressing any one, its abut doing what is right for you. Breast Cancer im finding is a very personal thing, that we share with others who also are fighting to live, because with out support I don't think i could go it alone, but that does not change the fact that it is my body that has been invaded by cancer. i have no right to tell any one else how to fight their battle all i can do is sit on the side lines and cheer, comfort,cry, laugh, hope and pray with them for all of us, while i fight my fight, and hope that i have a cheering squad too lol =). How are you supposed to feel? you are supposed to Feel what ever you feel even if sometimes yu wish you could flick the switch to happy mode, we feel what we feel for a reason and it is not self pity hun. You know that silly song \"Its my party and i'll cry if i want too, you would cry too if it happened to you!\" that runs through my head a lot these days lol. Keep coming back hun here to listen and offer what comfort i can.\nHugs ",

For me now I Have to come to terms and accept that ok lost some of my teeth so they could start chemo..that really sucked! Now I have to process ok they want to do heart test and chemo in the next two days. The thing is as difficult and heartbreaking some of the steps are I have to keep taking them if I want to give my self and my family a chance to have me in this world longer.\n I had to allow my self to feel those feeling acknowledge yea im scared outa my mind, or worried sick, or desperate for comfort what ever it is i was feeling and why i was feeling that way is ok. However, I only allowed myself to feel and prosses those thoughts in increments. Meaning I give my self permission to feel the feelings and acknowledge where they are coming from, accept that is how i feel and why, share with my closest and most trusted and become vunerable with them, then move on to some thing else, at least for a little while lol. If i have to go back to the dark place many times a day i do that, but i only stay for a little while, then move onto something else to give myself a break from my self lol =) A little while may mean something different to you than it does me that is ok , but all day and night is not a little while lol. \n It is ok to be scared, and it is ok to cry, and it is ok to laugh, and it is ok to be vunerable, and it is ok to be you in any given moment.\nBe Gentle with yourself, and not fret about\n having feelings, just allow your self to feel the not great feelings and acknowledge them know they are there, why they are there, then have the courage and faith to let them go even if for a little while. The day is comprised of moments, and every moment is going to be different, some great some definatly not so great, but each moment is a moment lived, and deserves to be recognized, but not horded cause if we hoard moments especially the bad ones we are going to miss some really spectacular and awsome moments =D you are stronger and more brave than you give yourself credit for you know, sharing with us your vunarbilty and fear takes a lot of courage and strength to reach out for help, it is ok you know.\nBaby steps still get you were you need to be, so yea im taking baby steps, you can take baby steps with me too, it is ok .

      "Content": " Hey Grammy sorry it seems like a long time since i posted, but wanted to touch base with you, as i am off on another road trip on tuesday for more tests and education about\n my meds and stuff. Still have a few more tests to take on my heart and what not, but so far it looks pretty good. Will be taking chemo before surgery, then surgery, then radiation, so at least I have an idea what i have to be prepared for, to an extent any way. Still waiting for a couple more test results. My Dr, who looks after the chemo told me that I may feel like stopping the treatments, but she is going to do everything in her power to convince me not too. i looked at her and said im not here for a play date, and it seems neither are you lol, so just keep me honest about\n my disease and we will get along fine and i wont bonk you on the head even if there are times i reeeeaaaallly want too. She also told me unequivocally that I will lose my hair...I said give me my life and you can have the hair...\nSo grateful to have you ladies, to talk and share my journey with and walk with you on yours.

      "Content": " Hey Alexikins, so glad you are reaching out for support. I really am sorry that you are having troubles with your breasts, really this is not something I would wish on any one, it is devastating, to deal with a serious illness/disease. Honestly, you do not have to worry about\n what you do not know yet, it is hard to not worry about\n the what ifs, but if you can think about\n what you do know. i know it is really hard to do this, I am going for my first appointment with the specialists and cancer team tomorow, I know i have cancer, what I do not know is how bad is it, has it spread am i in really serious trouble, ect, there are some things I am pretty sure about\n by what my doctor said, that the fact that it is in my lymph nodes makes it serious, I just don't know how serious so I think about\n what I do know and try to come to terms with that. Yes I have cancer, yes it is in the lymph nodes, yes I need more information before I can come to terms with what I don't know =). the fact that my doctor talked to me sorry don't know how to spell it lol so will just say fake breasts, (forgive me if this offends anyone) tells me that a mastectomy is probable.. but you know what I did not get confirmation that this is indeed the case, so me being me I'm going to belive that it is possible this may not happen untill told other wise. this does not mean i do not have moments of doubt and fear, that would be a lie, cause I do, i think it is human nature to think contemplate the what ifs, but I try very hard not to think about\n them to often or to long because like i said untill I get the facts, it is just that a what if's. Please understand this is not the same as denial, because I am very aware I have breast cancer, and any cancer is a serious thing, what i don't do is tire my self out thinking about\n what ifs too much because I am pretty confident i am going to need all my energy to deal with what i do know =). I hope this helps Alix, and i do empathize with you and I do understand were you are coming from, and i do want you to share with us your fears, concerns and triumphs =). Just letting you know that the what if's are not your priority at the moment, your priority right now is you =) and that means being gentle with your self and not tiring your self out. Talking to others is really healthy and it helps keep the what ifs at bay. i wont be able to post tomorow but hopefully will be able to post again on thursday, please keep in touch and know that my prayers are with you, and if the what ifs creep up on you it is ok this is a way that we try to prepare our selves for possible out comes, but they are at this point just possibles, and we need to look at it that way hey =) Untill im told otherwise everything I can think of are just possibilities, and I am just going to deal with what I do know for today. If tommorows possibilities are better than my what IF's Cheers!!! If my Ifs are confirmed then I will deal with them too, but the ifs are not going to take up to much of my time as I hope they will nt take up to much of yours. I know it is a long wait, waiting can be brutal, but you do not have to wait alone. ",

It is far better to go to the doctor and get it checked, mamagram, ultra sound and biopsy is what they did on me. It is scary as heck beleive me i know this, but that lump will weigh on your mind all the time untill you get confirmation negative or positve. In any event please go to the dr and get it checked. Please let me know how it goes for you. ",

You know your breast better than any one and if you find somethng like that the best thing to do is go Tell your Dr about\n the lump and how it is acting, like you shared with us. It very well could be nothing to be concerned about\n and what a relief that would be to hear that from your Dr, but if it something to investigate earlier is way better hun believe me. The last thing i want to do is scare you, I just am really concerned for you too. but the way you discribe it i am very optimistic too =) I really look forward to hearing from you again no matter what. hugs ",
