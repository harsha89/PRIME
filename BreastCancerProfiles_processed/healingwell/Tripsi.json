    "Content": " I found something about\n 3 months ago- It was not the normal lumpy feel that I have everywhere else. This lump is hard and is about\n the size of a silver dollar. Its under my right breast at like and angle from the fold of my armpit. It does not seem as if it has gotten any larger or smaller- but I make sure I check it a week before and a week after my period to be on the safe side.  I am only 25 but concerned as I am very admit about\n getting annual exams and self breast exams.  This spot is not really painful but is does feel tender at times. I have had two aunts with breast cancer-- One was a gene carrier the other was not. \n ",
