      "Content": " I was just wondering. Im coming up on my 5 yrs of breast cancer free. I think My question is. Do we use the anniversary date of our surgery and the docs saying they got all the cancer or do we go by the date of our last treatment of chemo and rads. I was told by a bc survivor that we go by our surgery date i was diagnosed 10/21/09 with infiltrating ductal carcinoma stage 3 grade 3 her 2 positive. And ductal carcinoma in sitsu. Both in one tumor. And i had a double masectomy 11/13/09.. i finished chemo on 4/17/10 and finished rads on 7/2/10.. ive been going by my surgery date because thats what i was told. Am i right or am i wrong. The 13th is coming up very soon. TIA\nLori ",

      "Content": " Hello Bellas gma, \nVery nice to meet you. Im very sorry its under these circumstances. My name is Lori. I am 50 yrs old but was diagnosed at 48. No one in my family was ever diagnosed with breast cancer so i guess im the carrier and i have five daughters. I was diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ oct 20,2009. I was stage 3b grade 3 and also her2 positive and a score of 3+. I got my port a cath put in pretty quick. Its much easier for you and them. My cocktail was Taxotere,Carboplatin and Herceptin. But the chemo itself...well i just took my anti nausea pills every four to six hours and it worked. I stayed ontop of it before it got me. I didnt lose one lb. Instead i gained weighed. I was always hungry..\nI was suppose to do chemo six rounds once every three weeks and the herceptin they wanted me to do for a year. But i already had a weak heart caused from my rheumatoid arthritis attacking it two years prior. The herceptin dropped my heart funtion down to 30% so i had to quit it. Then i had 28 days of radiation after the chemo. Well i could only finish 27 because i got burned so bad that it gave me 2nd degree burns. I know they dont call it that but i forgot what they call it. I had to see the burn specialists team and they told me it was 2nd degree burns on my skin. It also fried my lungs and damaged left side of my already damaged heart and now i have a pretty bad case of copd. Ive been hospitalized three times because of it. I know alot of woman that have went through the same as me and ive never heard of any of them having the rads do this to them. So please dont let me scare you. Im just telling my story. So i will pray for you to get through this without any complications. Any questions..im here...many hugs and prayers sent your way.\nLori\nR.A., Fibro, Breast cancer, anxieties. Have had pleurisy, pericarditis, myositis on the heart caused from r.a., Mitral valve prolapse. Heart murmer. Feltys syndrome, chronic kidney disease stage 2. Copd caused from radiation. Scars on lungs from radiation and radiation also damaged left side of heart. ",

That all was fine. I did my chemo..that went fine. Well I just finished 27 days of rads and had 1 more to go and I ended up in the hospital for 5 days. They litterally melted the skin right off my body. The skin just fell off. So now I sit here with 2nd degree burns and my whole left side of my chest and underarm is just flesh. And they also fried my lungs at the same time, said I had copd. Of coure all the docs are covering each others butts but I think  this is a very serious matter. Now not only do I have to wait til who knows how long my recovery will be but ..is my skin ever going to heal enough to be able to get my reconstruction done. I am so upset..furious and just not knowing what to do about\n this. I want to go to them and show them what they have done to me, but i dont think it matters. Just a warning to everyone out there...Please be careful. So sorry for ranting....but I always know you all are here for me.\n \n ",

I need to go and sign for my med records. I dont know what to do with all this just yet but I do know that if it interferes with my reconstruction. I will not be a happy camper. \nBrnadebt..I too have not heard of this happening to anyone. Bless your heart for having to go through this as much as you did.
