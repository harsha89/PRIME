      "Content": " Hi again, was looking on the Brest Cancer.org site and found the explanation below regarding why Tamoxifen\n\"Medications such as tamoxifen or Evista (chemical name: raloxifene) have been shown to reduce breast cancer risk. LCIS is usually hormone receptor-positive, meaning that estrogen and/or progesterone fuels the growth of the abnormal cells. If you decide to use medication to manage your risk of breast cancer, you are likely to use tamoxifen or Evista. \nIf you are premenopausal, your doctor is likely to recommend that you take tamoxifen, a medication that blocks estrogen from attaching to the cells and signaling them to grow. Tamoxifen works to reduce the risk of an invasive breast cancer from developing in the future. A large clinical trial called The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial found that women with LCIS who took tamoxifen for 5 years reduced their risk of invasive breast cancer by 46%. \nIf you\u2019ve already been through menopause, your doctor may suggest Evista (chemical name: raloxifene), another medication that blocks estrogen\u2019s effects on breast tissue. A large clinical trial known as the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (or STAR trial) showed that raloxifene was as effective as tamoxifen in reducing the risk of invasive cancer in postmenopausal women with LCIS.

      "Content": " Hello, I am also a new member and have recently had a needle biopsy on one breast and a surgical biopsy on the other (could not see area on second breast to also do needle) for several areas of microcalcifications on both breasts. Both biopsies came back negative, however I was told by my surgeon that I will now have to have mammograms every 6 months and see her because of the many areas of microcalcifations. My surgeon, although good, is very abrupt and brief, so I never feel I am getting an answer that is clear to me. When I askeed her exactly why and what they are looking for, her answer was\"we are looking for everything\". These biopsies were not easy as I had to be mamogrammed during each, on the surgical to place a wire marker, and on the needle I was biopsies during the procedures. My fear is they will also be repeating biopsies in 6 months, and all the doses of radiation, stress etc.\nSo glad I found this forum, as I am finding it difficult to get any information. ",
