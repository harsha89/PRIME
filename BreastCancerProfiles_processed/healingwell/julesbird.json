      "Content": " Thanks MK. You are right about\n the cancer in my family. I didn't even mention my Father dying of lung cancer (smoker) baby cousin - 20 months dying from stomach cancer & Mom already having non-evasive cervical cancer. So the big \"C\" word is like a nightmare for me. My lifestyle in the past hasn't been great to say the least either, so I always worry! Ughh! Yes - you sound like my husband (whose mother has battled & WON! Hodgkins & BC in both breasts, 2 mastectomies & stem=cell transplant). She is 73 yrs. old, still works as a nurse at a nursing home! ha! She is my hero. He always says \"don't worry about\n stuff until you know for sure, \n\". I am such an emotional person, it's hard to heed his advice. Thank you all for your support. You are ALL very brave.\n ",

      "Content": " Many thanks to you all for your swift replies. How great is the internet huh? I do know that if this turns out to be not good, my m-i-L will be my biggest support. Not only is she VERY brave & wise, but kind to me as well. I am lucky enough  & know it, to have a wonderful mother-in-law (Ginny). I will keep you all posted. Hopefully after the tests (6/15) the results won't take to long. Ginny always said the waiting on test results was always the most grueling, now I understand. Have a Happy Weekend! ",
