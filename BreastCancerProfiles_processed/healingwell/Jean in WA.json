      "Content": " Hello...I have not gone to the HealingWell site for a couple of years, but now may have a recurrent problem and found this site to be so helpful. But, I saw your question and needed to let you know of my experience with the Oncotype DX test. I had it done nearly four years ago and had to \"fight\" my insurance company (Premera Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska) to pay for the test. At that time, the Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonia had presentations by Kaiser Permanente and the New England Journal of Medicine validating the Oncotype DX testing. I did the homework and worked with my insurance company \"nurse\" who presented this information to their doctor panel who decides on payment of things like this. They finally agreed to pay for the test (and I did score in the low zone!). This was in April/May of 2005, and I was one of the first to have it paid by insurance, according to the Genomic Lab where the testing is done. So, FIGHT for your right to have the test paid for. And focus on the money the insurance company will save by the possibility of this test negating the need for chemo, which will cost them tens of times more than the Oncotype DX test. Good luck!\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Marianne,\nThis is Jean in WA writing about the Oncotype DX test. I had posted a couple of months ago about my experience getting the test approved by my insurance company. They, too, bulked at the test cost, and said the test was still considered \"investigational\". However, I did a lot of searching the internet and found that at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2004 had two entities validate the GenomicHealth Lab's work. The New England Journal of Medicine and Kaiser Permanente both did studies and found the information to be valid. Armed with this information, and the fact that I was the perfect candidate for the test, I confronted the insurance company. They finally agreed to pay for the test as though the Lab was a non-preferred provider, at 60%. That meant I still had to pay 40%, but $1350 is a lot better than $3500! My insurance company is Premera Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska, and I live in Washington. Do you have a case manager with your company? I was given the opportunity to have one, whom I can call on whenever I have a question. She helped to present this backup documentation to their doctor board, who make the decision to pay or not.\nGood luck to you! And as you said, they would smart to pay for this test, and possible elimiate tens of thousands of dollars in chemo treatments.\nTake care, Jean in WA ",

      "Content": " Good Morning Marianne,\nThanks for the thanks! Yes, I was the first that my insurance company agreed to pay for the test. I am still waiting for a final bill from Genomic Health, but expect at least to have to pay $1300 or so. I guess Premera negotiated with the lab for a lesser rate (a few hundred less??). \nI was interested in MK deciding not to take the hormone therapy after her surgery. And also that you were given Tomoxifen. Are you post-menapausal? If you are, my research (here I go again!) indicates that Arimidex is the therapy of choice for those of us who are post-menapausal, estrogen positive, early stage breast cancer. It is supposed to have fewer side affects than the standard Tomoxifen. Anyway, I have five more radiation treatments to go (had to delay a week since I am very red), but hopefully, I will be done by May 27...my graduation day! Then, I meet with the medical oncologist to \"discuss\" my followup treatment. I have already told him my choice...we shall see if he agrees! If not, I may be making another trip to Spokane to see my \"second opinion\" doctor, who agrees Arimidex is best for me.\nMy advice is to keep pushing your insurance company and do the research for them. Just type in Oncotype DX in the search engine on-line, and you will find tons of information and backup for your claim.\nTake care! Jean in WA ",

      "Content": " Hello Ladies...it has been a couple of years since I have posted to this site, and it was so helpful to me as I went through cancer treatment nearly four years ago. The problem now is that my oncologist found a small lump under my right arm last summer (my cancer was in the left breast) . He said to watch it...I couldn't even find it! But at the same time, a \"bad\" mammogram on the left showed the need for a surgical biopsy so I had that done (benign!) and an ultrasound on the right armpit lump. The doctors determined the lump to be a swollen lymph node and to just \"watch it\". It was checked by the surgeon in October and he was not concerned, and again by my oncologist in December who was not concerned. MY concern is that I can feel now, and I can easily find it and it is larger. My husband and I are going to see the Spokane oncologist who had given us a second opinion on chemo years ago. But, I just wondered if any of you have had a similar experience?? Thanks so much for your support...Jean In WA\n ",

I did go back to work in January and loved the job, but I got so tired that I finally had to quit in August.

So here I am, now 57, and feeling pretty good! It is hard to believe so much has happened in the last year.\nMy lumpectomy, radiation treatments, my fight for insurance payment of the Oncotype DX test (and winning it!), the pain and debilitation of Arimidex, and now, here I am on Tamoxifen. It's been two weeks and counting, and so far, no side effects that I can pinpoint. Of course, I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop! Hopefully it won't.\nAnd now the latest...I am going back to work after having retired 2 1/2 years ago. My husband was laid off seven months ago, and since insurance is necessary, and COBRA is SOOOO expensive, here I go. I am very nervous, and wondering about\n getting too tired, but I know many of you have worked throughout your treatment programs, so I will try to keep happy thoughts and get to bed early!!\nJust wanted to share these thoughts with all of you.

      "Content": " Hello Ladies,\nWell, today was my first day at work and I am really tired, but understandably so. I didn't sleep at all last night (sounds like the song!). Just couldn't shut down my mind. We are thinking Tylenol PM at 8pm tonight, and hopefully, sleeping for at least eight hours.\nThanks for all your kind thoughts. It really helps to know others are managing to go on with their lives, and doing so with extra rest. \nThe job is office administrator for the local Visitors Bureau. They have fashioned it to be a direct assistant to the President and CEO, so it should eventually be something quite fun, although busy. I have been \"The Boss\" in my job for the past 15 years or so before retiring, so my new boss is a little concerned that I won't be happy in this new role. I am trying to convince her that I don't want to be the boss any longer (nor do I have the energy to be....but I didn't tell her that!).\nOff to go pop those Tylenol...thanks again everyone. You are the best!\nTake care, Jean in WA ",

      "Content": " Hi Laure',\nI agree with all the other ladies about getting another oncologist. My husband and I just couldn't believe it when the doctor said I needed to have four chemo treatments, since everything we had learned prior to this was that I would just need radiation (I had a lumpectomy) and hormone therapy. We did get a second opinion by a doctor in another city, and he said the first doctor was probably within guidelines for recommending chemo, but that he would probably not do it. The first doctor had mentioned the Oncotype DX test, rather to placate us as we were so adament about not doing chemo. After a long three weeks of working to get my insurance company to pay for it, I had the test. As it turned out, I was in the low range which helped me to decide to forgo the chemo. The test is fairly new, but your oncologist should have known about it, I think. You can read about the test at the lab's website, Genomichealth.com. Or, just do a search for Oncotype DX. There is a lot of information out there, especially about the validation of the test by the New England Journal of Medicine and Kaiser Permamente at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium last December. Good luck to you. I am now doing radiation, six down and 27 to go. \nTake care,\nJean in WA ",

I guess it is the chance we take, but I was so fearful of having chemo, especially if it wasn't going to do any good. I am post-menapausal, so I am taking Arimidex, an aromitase inhibitor.

They make me ache in the joints, especially if I have been sitting for a while. The Dr. says to give it a few months and my body should adjust. I have never had a hot flash in my life, and still didn't after throwing away my hormone pills, and not now with the Arimidex, so I can be greatful for that. I know what you mean about\n taking the pills...I am tempted to not take them and take my chances, but then I read about\n the dear women who have lost their fight, and I think, \"Do I really want to take that chance\".

      "Content": " Hi Marianne,\nJust saw your topic posted from an old one. Yes, I did have some success in getting my insurance company to pay for the Oncotype DX test. They are covering it as a non-preferred provider at 60%, so at least that only leaves about\n $1300 of the original $3450 to pay. I bombarded them with information that I found on the internet, mostly from the December 2004 Breast Cancer Symposium in San Antonio. Kaiser Permanente and the New England Journal of Medicine validated the studies done by Genomic Health, the lab that does the testing. Several insurance companies are now paying for the test, and I told my insurance company (through a case manager I was given) that they stood to save a lot of money if I didn't have to have chemo, and that they really couldn't continue to say this was an \"investigational\" test any longer, given the validations it had received. \nGenomic Health still has not asked for my portion of the payment (a couple of months now), as they want to continue to \"fight\" with my insurance company, Premera Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska. By the way, I scored 16 on the test, just inside the 1-17 low range, but it was enough that I did not do chemo, just radiation.\nI am feeling really well.... a little tired still, but now walking 6 1/2 miles every day and lifting my big two pound weights! There is life after breast cancer!!!\nGood luck to you! Please let me know if I can be of any more help.\nTake care, Jean in WA ",

Also, my PT and OT said I should always wear the sleeve when exercising, and especially when traveling, due to the imoblility involved in sitting for long periods. Flying with the sleeve on is also a necessity, due to the pressurized cabin on the plane. They also told me to stop when traveling every couple of hours to walk about\n a bit, even on an airplane.

      "Content": " Hi again Skeeter,\nAfter what you have already been through, radiation will be a breeze!! Really! The people at the Cancer Centers are all so loving and caring, and you will be amazed at quickly the 6 1/2 weeks goes by. Try to get to know some of the other patients whom you will meet there. We got to where we looked forward to seeing one another each day, and would check on how we were feeling, and giving support to each other. \nThe simulation before the actual treatments begin is to prepare for your exact positioning on the table. Here, I was actually molded into a \"cradle\" that fit my body. Then when you go in each day, you lie in the cradle and it holds you in the perfect position. The mapping I had done with tattoos, although they also used pens periodically. The tattoos hurt for just a moment...I got four, on the perimeter of my radiation site. Be sure to remove the ink makings before you get dressed each day (unless they tell you not to!) so they don't stain your clothing.\nIf you are having problems with mobility and range of motion in your arm, do ask your surgeon for a referral to a physical and/or occupational therapist. I could not have gotten through this whole process without them. They taught me exercises to minimize the chances of getting lymphodema, and helped me to regain most of my range of motion. Also, to get into position for the simulation, you must be able to raise your arm above your head. Without their help, I never would have made it. \nGlad to see are going to eat healthy...my motto for getting through just about\n everything, Eat healthy, exercise daily, and rely on your support people. You will do great...just remember, this is a temporary problem that will be behind you soon. \nSending love and hugs to you.\nTake care, Jean in WA ",

      "Content": " Hi Kathy,\nIt seems as though the first couple of times it took them longer to get me in just the right position. I had a really difficult time keeping my left arm in the position because of pain, so any delay was a bit of agony. They used a foam pad to help support my arm, and that did help. After a few times, they got faster and I will always remember.... 95 and 7.5 were my positions, and I could tell when I wasn't just right in the cradle...my back didn't feel \"right\". I even got to where I would tell them I didn't feel right, and they would recheck everything. A couple of times I needed to be moved just a fraction of an inch to make it perfect. So, to answer your question, yes, it can take while, but it is worth it in the long run to make certain you are in the perfect position before they zap you!\nYou will be surprised how quickly the weeks will go by. It is good to visit with the other folks who are waiting with you, to help keep your mind occupied, and to focus on others' needs at the same time. I got to where I felt very motherly of some 80+ year old gentlemen, even though I am 56. They were very sweet and a little scared, as we all are.\nTake care, Jean in WA ",

Seems we will be traveling this journey about\n the same time together. However, since I am 56 and postmenopausal, I am going to be taking the Aromatase Inhibitor, Arimidex. Thought I might have a fight on my hands getting the oncologist to prescribe this, but since he already knew my preference, he agreed to do it. I am only one week past my last rad treatment, so I will start the Arimidex next Friday. I, too, am a little scared, but since I never have had a hot flash or any other symptoms of menopause, even when I threw out the hormones when I was diagnosed with BC, I am hoping I will be OK. Now, I need to work on the eight poiunds or so that I have gained while being off my exercise routine (although it has been rather fun eating bunches of calories, per my radiation oncologist's instructions!).\nAnyway, just wanted to let you all know that things are going well here in Washington, and I will keep you posted.

      "Content": " Hi Kathy,\nI am two days away from finishing my 33 treatments, with six of those \"boosts\". Unfortunately, I had to take last week off because my skin was too burned, according to my radiation oncologist. In fact, she started the boost early since it is a concentrated dose on the tumor site, and would allow my outter chest to heal some. But, with three boosts done, ALL of me was now too red. She said it \"should be\" OK to have the week off, and then finish this week. What bothers me is the \"should\" part. I know she stressed at the beginning of this whole experience that it was important to complete the series without break if at all possible. When I did have to have the time off, she said, get this, \"If IT comes back, then we would just have to do a mastectomy\". Now, that did not make me feel too good...go through all this and THEN have a mastectomy. So I guess my advice to you, based on my experience, would be to complete the series without break if at all possible. You said the \"rad tech\" said it would be OK...but did your oncologist say OK?\nTake care, Jean In WA ",

As you know by having read all the ladies' suggestions here, be sure to take good care of your skin. \"Slather\" up with aloe vera gel and any prescript\nions your doctor prescribes, although remember, no gels within two hours of your treatment.

So, you may want to visit the restroom right after a treatment that includes \"pen marks\", and wash it off before dressing.\nAnd my last little tidbit of information... being the \"chocoholic\" that I am, I brought a big Costco sized bag of Hershey's Kisses to the Cancer Center receptionist. She doled out two kisses to me after each treatment, as my \"reward\" for being a good patient! I also asked her to share them with anyone else who might need a chocolate fix. Then, on my last treatment day, I took a party bag full of Kisses for the patients, and one for the staff as a thank you for all their loving care. I may be forever thought of as the Kisses Lady!\nGood luck to you, and you will be in my thoughts and prayers.\nTake care, Jean In WA ",

      "Content": " Hi Janis,\nI was very much in the same position as you as to whether I should have chemo or not. My original oncologist recommended four chemo treatments (AC), followed by radiation, and then hormone therapy for five years. It was so very marginal that chemo would be of any benefit to me (1.3 cm tumor, ductal carcinoma in situ, negative nodes), but he still felt I should do it. When my husband and I were still questioning the validity of chemo, the Dr. told us of the Oncotype DX test. After several weeks and bargaining with my insurance company, I had the test on the tumor done, and I came in the low range, meaning chemo would probably not be beneficial to me. I also got a second opinion from a doctor in Spoakne (WA), who said his gut said not to do it, however, if I were his wife, he isn't sure what he would do..... So, the test was the determining factor for us. I am now on treatment number 21 of 33 radiation sessions, and have just started to burn a bit. I have been using aloe vera gel, Emu oil, and now a prescription for Silvadine. I actually feel very well...a little tired if I overdo it., but not bad overall. So, there is light at the end of this tunnel! I might also mention that the hormone therapy I am going to \"request\" (demand?), is Arimidex, one of the new Aromatase Inhibitors. I am menapausal, and the perfect candidate \"tumor-wise\" for this treatment. It has fewer side affects than Tomoxifan that has been the standard for 20+ years. You might ask about these drugs. Good luck to you....and remember, everyone is with you along your way!\nTake Care, Jean in WA ",

Hope you read this Janis! I too had a small tumor, 1.3 cm, and no lymph node involvment. I had the test and scored 16, just in the low range, but it meant I could more safely choose no chemo.

The scoring for the test is to determine whether or not you would benefit from taking chemo. My score was in the low range, 16. I just barely made it, as the intermediate range begins at 18. If I had scored in the intermedicate range, I felt I needed to go ahead with the treatment. So now, I am doing radiation, and am half way through the 33 treatments.

It was a little longer than a usual treatment, they told me, because they did x-rays too. My husband timed the minutes I was away from him, and it was 19 minutes. Not too bad, and the arm was doing OK until the last few minutes. Today was a snap! In and out in 10 minutes or so. I was told today that they do x-rays once a week, so to expect those treatments to be a few minutes longer, again. But, I feel pretty good and do thank you all again for your support. \nLove, Jean in WA \n ",

The nurse gave me something in my IV to help me relax before they injected the dye, and I don't remember anything else. I heard my husband's voice asking if I was OK, because they told him it would take about 20 minutes, and it took an hour and a half. Anyway, maybe you could ask for a sedative of some sort...aren't we all going through enough pain as it is??? (PS...I hope you get this in time.)\nJean In WA ",

Then the doctor said, \"You are in the low range\", which was music to our ears! The \"low range\" results mean I will not have to do chemotherapy. My score was 16, which was only two points below the intermediate range, so it was close. I had decided if it came in in the intermediate range, I would have to go ahead and do the chemo. So now, I am getting set to do radiation, and then will follow with hormone therapy. Here too, I have researched the alternatives, and I will be taking one of the new Aromatase Inhibitors, Arimidex. If you are interested in learning more about the Oncotype DX test, you can go to their website at Genomichealth.com. Take care everyone! \nLove, Jean in WA \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Janis,\nI am so happy that your surgery went well and you are feeling better. You said you are having a lot of pain and taking medication to help control it. I just can't imagine going to work and feeling that way. I had a lot of pain as well, and fortunately I retired a couple of years ago. I keep saying I don't know how women are able to work and go through all this cancer related stuff! Anyway, my advise, for what it is worth, would be to take the time you need to get past the pain before going back to work. Your body is trying tell you something! Rest while you can. I didn't start my radiation until nearly eight weeks past surgery, for a similar reason to Mia's. I had the Oncotype DX test as well, and it took several weeks to get insurance approval. My oncologist said it is usually six to eight weeks after surgery to allow for healing, and also so you can get your arm up into position. Just had my ninth treatment today and so far, so good! Good luck and we will be here to support you!\nTake care,\nJean in WA ",

      "Content": " Hello Everyone,\nThis is my first posting to this site, and the reason is to share my success in getting my insurance company to pay for the new Oncotype DX test. The test helps to determine who is at a greater risk of cancer recurrance in the next ten years, but, it also helps those women, like me, who are borderline for needing chemo, to make the decision to have the therapy or not. Most insurance companies still consider the test \"investigative\" and will deny the payment for it, and it costs $3,450. Well, after two weeks of my constant pressure on the insurance company, hours and hours of investigation on the internet, and documentation of my cancer being the perfect fit for this test, Premera Blue Cross has agreed to pay for it. It is the first case to be approved, and I am so pleased. It has delayed my possible treatment by a couple of weeks, which we all know is mental anguish, but I believe it has been worth it, not only for me, but for the hundreds of women who find themselves in my position of whether chemo is beneficial or not. Maybe now they can have this test and possibly not have to go through chemo. I won't know about myself for 10 to fourteen days (the time the test takes to run), and I may still need to make the decision to go ahead with chemo, but at least now I will know that I have done everything medically possible to make the right decision. So, for those of you out there whose doctors have recommended this test, but your insurance has refused payment, there is hope. Refer them to Premera Blue Cross of Washington and Alaska. We must all take charge of our own bodies....we are our best advocates!\nTake care, Jean ",

I have been using aloe vera gel, but I do have sensitive skin, so the prescription cream may be best. I will ask. Gosh, wouldn't it be wonderful if the radiation treatments could safely be limited to one week instead of six. I will have to look into that, even though it is too late for me. I can't tell you how much it means to know that you ladies will be \"at my side\", and I will think of you as I go through the next few weeks.
