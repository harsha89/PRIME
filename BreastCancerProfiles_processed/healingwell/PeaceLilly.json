    "Content": " Hi Julie,\n I just lost my best friend to Scleraderma this past Saturday. Its like one day she was here and now she is gone. She left a wonderful husband whom is devestated and a 14 yr old. We lived in different states but talked at least once a week or every other week. To hear her voice, you would never think she was knocking at deaths door. I still cannot believe she is gone. There is nothing anyone can say to make it better. Pray hard! We listened to each after our doctor's appointments and laughed about\n our kids. When we met it was like we knew each other all of our lives. It is so sad what these diseases do to us, and our families and friends. Again, have faith, and pray hard, I will!\nLove & prayers,\nPeaceLily ",
