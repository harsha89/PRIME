      "Content": " Dear free2010  I successfully went through the biopsy without any signs of cancer.  It seems cruel for  them to make you wait until next week for the biopsy, then you have to wait for the results!  Not fair.  The doctor seemed pissed about\n something or just life in general (he).  The nurses were kind.  I got to watch the whole thing (ultrasound in a dark room).  No pain but I could feel them pushing the needle through my dense flesh.  The wait was not the worst thing, it was the pain after the anestetic wore off.  Ask for pain medication!!!    God bless you and keep you strong.  They didn't take it all in the biopsy but I'm not worried any more.  Kinda mad.  Now, I have a new gyno and they want me to go for another mamo.  I moved.  Hear we go again.  I feel stronger as a patient and won't go for their money generating, invasive tests again.  ",
