      "Content": " Hi everyone, I went for my yearly mammogram on thursday and got a call from my dr on monday saying I have to have a follow up with a specialist. I suffer from panic attacks so I had little sleep. I see the specialist tomorrow ( Wed) and thanks to joining this forum I feel a bit relieved that I am not alone. Also I am demanding for a biopsy. Thanks for all your comments regarding breast cancer. God Bless U all.\nGiGi ",
