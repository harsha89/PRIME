There are a lot of wonderful women here and we all know what you are going through. \nIf you try to keep somethig dry in your stomach at all times, just a little bit at a time it does help. Do you have help at home? \nI know what you are saying about\n the hair loss. It was the hardest part for me but when it was gone that was it and I knew it would grow back and it did more beautiful then before. \nVent all that you want you have every right this sucks and you don't deserve this. I also pray everyday that they find a cure so not one other women will be touched by this disease but until that day you go right ahead and cry if you need to. The shower is the best place for that let the shower wash the tears away and then you can get out and start the day.\nYou are going to be amazed at just how very strong you are. I very rarely post but I just felt you needed to hear from someone that cares and I do. Sending you a very gentle hug. \nI pray tomorrow will be better for you.\nGod Bless\nDonna ",

Hearing good things,this is where my friend was doing her consult and was told that our cancer center was doing the standard treatment and that it the same thing they would do if she went up there. I would think the cancer center would also be a good place but have not found out anything out about\n the place. \nIf there is anything that I can do to help give me a yell I usally read on here every day. I wish your friend an easy journey and will keep her in my prayers. \nI thought I could not wait to see how the breast looked well I should have waited. It looks gross, I know this will get better with each passing day but for now I'm finding myself crying and in pain and not having a lot of fun. I really do not mean to be cranky so I think I will say good night and God Bless your dear friend.\nLove Donna ",

      "Content": " Carol,\nHope this finds you doing well. I am so sorry you are having trouble with your crohns. They say that chemo helps crohns because of the decadron. I had a lot of trouble during chemo. I spent a week in the hospital in between my first and second treatment. Then my seventh treatment was canceled because I had a drainage in my vaginal area. In fact my gyn took care of my crohns during chemo because my gastro was being a pain and did not believe all of the issues that put me in the hospital were due to the chemo. He did not want to see me when both my gyn and my onc spoke to him. So later my gastro and I had a talk and he now listens or knows he is hitting the road. I don't really care if I see him or not, waiting until something better comes along. They say that it is unusal for the crohns not to calm down with the chemo because of the steroids but I always have to do things the hard way. \nAs far as the port goes I did not get one at the start of chemo and it did cause a problem being in the hospital and they were using up my veins but then I finished and all was well until I started to do the Herceptin now we are just trying to get through without a port. I started doing the Herceptin 11 mos. after chemo and with the treatments being every three weeks I just want to forget all of it as best I can in between treatments. \nAs far as the swelling of your face I do not know for sure but I think it is the steroids I did not have trouble with my face but a friend of mine had trouble the whole time she did chemo.\nI hope you do well with further treatments and if I can help in any way just let me know.\nStay well\nDonna ",

      "Content": " Carol,\nI'm glad you are doing well. I also did the neupogen shots it would start on day 3 and I would get them every day for 8 days. The neupogen shot cause pain to the long bones and the Taxol gets the joints. I took the pain meds and it did help. I had my crohns under control until I started my chemo and then I had a couple stays in the hospital and one treatment delayed for a week. But the time really did go fast doing the dose dedense. The first part flew by because I was in the hospital the weeks in between the 1st ans 2nd treatment and only got out in time to do another treatment. Then when I went on taxol I could fuction better. I never missed work from chemo only the day of. The weeks in between were not from the chemo. It is all doable and before you know it you will be done and able to move on. I pray things calm down and your body adjust and the rest of your chemo flies by.\nI will keep you in my prayers. ( sorry I did not mean to go on. )\nDonna ",

There is a big difference in size and I would be more comfortable with it done but it won't be the end of the world if does not work out. \nThe plastic surgeon that I will be seeing is a woman and I like the idea of that. After being felt up by almost every male Dr. in our town when I was dx it will be nice to have a woman. She says that she enjoys this out of all that she does. I'm not looking for perfect just enough to make me more comfortable.\nI'll let you know how it goes.\nThank you\nDonna ",

Its hard waiting until you hear back but they are really good and call as soon as they get them. Are you finding the Taxol easier, I had a lot of bone pain but no nausea at all. \nI hurt all over with this darn cold it seems like it will go on for ever. This past week at work was so hard I fell a sleep really early every night. Its the darn cough that is getting me as far as my voice I don't mind not talking to much. Now I think my 7 year old grandson Kyle is catching it. We are a really close family though and so I see the grandkids every day. That was really a God send when I was doing chemo. If I was laying down and resting they would climb up and cuddle with me. Both of my daughters live with in walking distance. My oldest grandson drew our Christmas cards for this year and they have pink ribbons on it. \nStay well and keep going it makes it easier to get through all of this.\nGod Bless\nDonna ",

I never got sick from the chemo, I was just sick those two times that I went in the hospital. I lost 16 pounds during the a/c but was hungry on the taxol. A dear friend told me to make sure the first few days to never let my stomach get empty. I would nibble on crackers and bread or snowflake rolls they were so good. This really did work. My husband always made me mashed potatoes and they always helped. I just never let my stomach get empty. I hope this passes quickly for you. Get lots of rest. Sometimes just laying down felt good even if I did not sleep.\nWhat crohns meds are you on? I take colazal, Bentyl and protonix. \nTake care and rest.\nDonna ",

She said that with all she saw she does not see a problem with my insurance company. It will take 4 to 6 weeks to hear back from the ins. co. and then we can set a date then. I did get to see some pictures I don't want things perfect just more the same size. Hard to but bras with one side to big and the other to small.I just don't want to get my hope up and then have them shot down. So I guess I wait again.\nI have not heard back about\n my blood work hopeing in the morning, I hate this waiting and waiting. I get so sick to my stomach. I have a rotten cold that I have been trying for two weeks to get rid of. So I am just a little cranky. \nI forgot to ask the dr. if there is any problem doing this while on Herceptin. Does any one know. \nI am so tired I am going to bed will pop in tomorrow to see if everyone is doing well.\nTake care and thank you all.\nStay well\nDonna ",

It worked very well and I only used lotion at the very end when I got the dry feeling like you get after you have had a sunburn, even though I did not burn. My best to you.

There was jars of candy sitting out where we did chemo and it did seems to help. Just not a good idea if your laying down. ( sorry I sound like a mother ) \nI nice longggg soak in a really hot tub helps ( check into a hotel that has a jacuzzi, just kidding but I thought about\n it ) with all the aches and pains. Is this part of your crohns or is this new for you? I barely had time to figure out all the junk with the crohns when I was dx with the bc. ( Crohns in Feb. and bc in May )\nI was always carrying around dinner rolls and would just keep pulling tiny bites off and putting them in my mouth because \nopening my mouth and trying to take a bite would gag me. Have you ever found Mrs. Grass noodle soup, all it has in it is noodles and broth and that seemed to help if I just sipped on it. In fact I am sipping on the soup now, I have a cold and feel rotten today. \nI know you might not think so right now but this will pass and you will have good days in betweeen treatments just make sure you do a lot of drinking. Water was always best for me, but a lot of people say ginger ale works really well.\nI hope you feel better soon and let me know if I can help in any way.\nKeeping you in my prayers\nDonna ",

There is also a program where the drug company is helping out when insurance will not pay. I am glad to hear that the side effects are not to bad. I will be able to get 2 treatments in before I go back to work in Sept. I will be having a Muga scan on Mon. and my first treatment on Tues. I spoke with a girl yesterday who is doing once a week, she finished her chemo at the end of Dec. so she also had a pause like I did. She also spoke with another onc. who felt that doing the Herceptin even though she has been fininshed with chemo for a while was a very good idea. I am for doing every thing that I can to make sure this does not return. This girl I spoke with is only 34 when she was dx. I read that the risk of heart issues is greater if you are doing Herceptin when you also do A/C. So hopefully that will not be an issue for me. \n The road seems like such a long one sometimes but we do what we need to do. I also have crohns and am hoping that the herceptin and the crohns get along. I'm not seeing a problem though. \nI hope all is going well for you.

How often did you have Muga scans on the Herceptin. I think he will do another one after my next treatment. He said every three months.\nI hope you are doing well and that things are going better with your daughter. I will keep you and your family in my prayers.

I have an appt. with the plastic surgeon on Nov. 3 to see about\n having my good breast reduced so I hopefully will match up.

My onc. said that there were no studys with Herceptin doing it so long after chemo but he did feel it could not hurt to try. This girl I spoke with even got a second oppion from another onc.

My Onc. said the same about how often he would see me, I wonder if it was the same for everyone. He also said I could stay at 3 months if that made me more comfortable. \nI have been making breast cancer bracelets, and I really find it helps I have sold almost 40 of them and everyone just loves them. I find some peace from it and have donated some of the money to help with breast cancer. I have given some as gifts to a few ladies that I know that just finished their treatments. One of the girls is my sister-in-law who found out right after I finished my rads. She is doing well and hers was found very early and that was a blessing.

I'm sorry I feel like I only come here when I need help but I read everyday. \nWe took my mother to the breast clinic in Rochester, New York to rule out inflamatory breast cancer, I was still very uncomfortable when we left. Before going she had a red spot on the left breast and that breast leaks, also her nipple is now inverted and she gets alot of pain in the breast. They tryed her on an antibiotic and the redness went away but everything else remains and they can now feel a lump so at the clinic they did a repeat mamo and U/S and a needle biopsy which came back neg. and they told her that they saw a cluster of cyst and that was where they took the biopsy from.All that I have read says that they don't rule out inflamatory b/c with a needle biopsy. I read something about a skin punch biopsy. I think my mom would like to just go with the neg. biopsy and be done with it. I would welcome any advice that anyone could share. \nI find all of this unsettling, its time for my 3 month check on May 3rd and I'm anxious about that . I feel like some days I see a normal person in the mirror and other days I'm not so sure. Thank you for listening.\ngrammy ",

I was told in Dec. of last year that the lump that they could see on the u/s was nothing to be told in May that I had B/C. I guess it is her choice, but it is making me worry and its now time for my 3 month check and I worry about that. So pretty much all I do is worry. \nThank you so much for listening and the good advice I'm just not sure what I can get her to do with it. I shall keep trying. \nGod Bless\nGrammy ",

My mother just had a mamo and u/s on this past Monday. Her left breast has been leaking and recently she noticed a red area. The mamo report showed nothing, but the u/c report says that there is a dilated duct and that it displays internal echoes. Also says that it is not readily classifiable as benign or malignant. Says it is most suggestive of infection/ mastitis, but the possibility of inflammatory carcinoma cannot be excluded. Extremely close clinical followup is strongly recommended. The Doctor put her on an antibiotic for a week and if the redness goes away they will do a repeat of the u/s and if the duct is no longer dilated it was an infection but if there is still something showing there would be futher testing. My head is spinning with all of this I feel like I have barely gotten back on my feet. I was d/x with crohns a year ago Feb. and then the bc in May. I feel like everything keeps crashing in on me. Does this sound like this is something to worry about or not? My Mom said that some of the redness is better since taking the antibiotic. I'm sorry to go on but, I feel like my head and heart have had a work out this past year. \nThanks for listening\ngrammy ",
