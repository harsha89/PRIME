      "Content": " Had a my mammogram about\n ten days ago and got the letter saying they needed more imaging done due to nodule densities (2). Since that letter I have been feeling pain in my left breast. Actually have felt pain there before but am now paying attention to it. Am scheduled for a spot compression mammogram on Wednesday. Have not slept a full night since I got my letter, even if I take my ambien. Any suggestions? Nervous person here waiting to hear from someone. Forgot to add I am 65 so I can rule out period pain in my breast. Just really worried and it seems to take forever to find out anything. I am a worrier by nature so this has really set me off.\n ",
