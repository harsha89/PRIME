      "Content": " My doctor is a breast specialist and I intend to ask him at my next appt. but I have researched and found some connection to my diagnosis of Stage Zero Microcalcification malignancy to be connected to former injury, operation or infection in that breast. I had my first biopsy about\n 11 yrs ago in a hospital with a regular surgeon. It was benign and it was a fatty fibrous lump. However I got a terrible staph infection at the surgery incision site. I had high fever and red streaks and a huge amount if pain and drainage from the incision which was on the nipple so it was extremely painful! I had to go to the surgeon daily to have a needle inserted to drain fluids. The surgeon never billed me at all. I think he felt very bad about\n it but my concern is if that staph infection has resulted in my recent malignancy then do I have recourse??? ",
