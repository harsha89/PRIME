    "Content": " Hello\nI am a refugee from the IBS forum and feel a bit guilty at posting this question on a site where so many have really serious issues but...\nI had an excisional breast biopsy nearly four weeks ago for a papilloma. The result was benign and this was a great relief. I have healed well over the incision but still have a small pink area right at the edge of it near the nipple and a fair amount of itching and burning sensations. Don't feel poorly and there is no redness or excessive warmth other than that which I presume is occasioned by healing. Also some weird shooting sensations. Can anyone assure me that these are normal after a procedure of this kind and how long they might be expected to persist?\nThanks so much. ",
