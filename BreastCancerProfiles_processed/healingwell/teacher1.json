    "Content": " This is the 3rd year in a row that my annual mammogram has shown something in left breast that has required follow up. We have repeated mammogram and done ultrasounds. Have also met with general surgeon 3 times in last 3 years as he reviewed mammogram results. He believes it is just cysts and no cause for concern. However, I experience burning and discomfort in my left breast on a regular basis. This pain is much more pronounced after my breast check and mammogram, causing pain for weeks afterwards. Waiting now on word about\n images retaken of my left breast last week. I am considering having a second opinion of cause of discomfort. Any advice or suggestions welcome. ",
