      "Content": " My DH,DD, and myself just returned from San Diego. We went out to see my youngest DS who is working out there through college. We have never been to California and it has been thirty years since I have been on an airplane. How exciting it was. Now I can say I have swam in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. California is so neat. My son was right I didn't want to come home. We saw so many things, including Balboa Park, sunset at the beach, and a ferry cruise across the bay. The best thing that happened was the dinner at Karl Strauss (a brewery in San Diego). It was my birthday and my DS arranged this dinner with 13 people including my brother and sister in law whom I have not seen in years. My brother lives in San Diego. What a surprise !!!!. \nYes Mary and Bev, my oldest DS is state side for the next few years anyway. What a relief. I still worry about\n all the other military over there. A very good friend is due to go back soon, so I will be getting packages ready to send again.\nMary, my prayers are with you and your daughter. Your daughter sounds determined to get on with life with the baling hay and all. You know what they say, \"You can't keep a good woman down!\".\nJo-Ann, hope you are doing better. Even though it has taken me awhile to post, I have always enjoyed your stories. You have always put a smile on my face.\nLauri, hope all is well\nWell I have to get back to reality and go get my car fixed. \nPrayers to all\nHugs, Patty\n ",

      "Content": " I have been away from the board for a long time now, although I do lurk at times. When I read about\n Chris, I was filled with so much sadness. I had tried to contact Chris several times during the past few years, but no response. I do not know what happened with IV and it doesn't matter.What does matter is the friendship that was established there and here. Many of you ,along with Chris, brought me through tough times and for that I will always be greatful. \nLet me update you on what has been going on in my life. My oldest DS is still in the Army and has has three tours in Iraq. Thank the Lord is he back in the states and safe. My DD is now happily married and they just bought their first house. My youngest DS is in San Diego (we are going out next week to see him). He spends six months doing a co-op there and six months going to the University of Cincinnati. My DH and I are still together (for those who remember the two years we were apart). Things are going good and it has been two years since we got back together. I am now a desk nurse (getting to old to do patient care these days). Not too much else is going on. I am eight years out and doing well.\nMy prayers are with you all and I think of you often\nHugs and prayers\nPatty\n ",

This will be the last time we get to see him before he goes back to Iraq in June. (plenty of prayers for him please). As for me, well I am moving back with my husband. It seems to be the right thing to do at this time in my life. I think we have both realized life is just to short and we truely want to be together. It's not that we have enough to do but we are redoing the house (paint, flooring,.......). When all of this is done, I'm going fishing!!!!!!. Prayers to all. Hugs, Patty\n ",

We had so much fun and it was so good to be able to see my oldest DS.  My DD managed to get her big brother in tears when she dedicated the song \"When I'm Gone\" to all military men and women especially her big brother who is leaving for Iraq. It was a very touching moment when just my DD and oldest DS danced together. They were the only ones on the dance floor.  I thank God that  he blessed me with three wonderful children and that they are so close. Youngest DS had his girlfriend there so he was too cool to shed any tears! During the ceremony when the minister asked \"Who gives this bride away\", my DH said\" Her mother, myself, and her brothers\". I had to chuckle to myself.

      "Content": "  It has been a long time since I have posted here. I have been lurking to keep up with some of the happenings. All is well in my little world.  My DD is getting married May 21st and we have been so busy with all the plans. (Some of you may remember meeting her at the first Cincinnati get together).  She had originally planned to get married in May 2006 but my oldest DS has gotten orders to go back to Iraq in June of this year so the wedding got moved up a year. We have managed to get everything arranged in just three months.  Like I have always said  never underestimate the powers of a determined woman!!!! I thought it was very sweet of her to make sure her brother was able to come to her wedding. Like I said above my oldest DS is headed back to Iraq which is something I am not happy about but he has chosen a career in the army and he is happy. Please remember him and all our men and women overseas in your prayers. The youngest DS is very busy at University of Cincinnati. He is majoring in aerospace engineering and if I might brag a bit he got straight A's last quarter. My divorce still is not done. In fact DH (?) is trying to talk me into coming back.  He has quit drinking and is the process of finding a full time job ( two of my conditions for even considering thinking about it). Who knows what will happen although it has been almost two years since I moved out and I am happy with my two dogs ! Physically I am doing fine. I lost 58 pounds and my last check up showed NED.\n \n ",
