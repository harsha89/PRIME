Being another lifer with a terrible prognosis. I can also say the the doctors certainly don't always know. They are forgetting who is in charge. You have given us all hope and showed us how to live. I was amazed at everytime you went back to teach! Cartlady gave it all up a lot sooner. I have a PET on Wednesday, and I will remember that if she finds anything, it can be sent into remission again. I will send your letter to my friend RoseMary. She needs some hope right now. \nThank you for letting us know. I have been wondering about\n you but could not have guessed at anything so wonderful. You are in my heart. Love, Di ",

Peg, I know there is nothing you can do. I was told I couln't by an elder abuse counselor. Dad also fell in the street before Chritmas, He just told me., hit his head and layed there until he was found by paramedics driving by. Thanks for all prayers. They are needed and answered since Mom fell at the bottom of the stairs and not the top. Those angels I sent over there were watching her. \nSo glad your uncle was not hurt Deb. \nYes, we need another week end sometime soon. Maybe to celebrate with peg.

Does it hurt? Should I take a pain pill before I go? The other test I had did not hurt. I always took pain pills at Barnes during radiation since I was tied to a stake, or something twice a week so I didn't move during radiation and hyperthermia. It was just hard to stay in that position that long. I would have a hard time on survivor.

She didn't have time to check my records but she said I probably do not have a cervix. They had me scheduled for a colposcopy here and she said she would do a biopsy. She said she would Make time for me! Even at Christmas. I am going the first week in January. From now on, I should go down there twice a year to see her. She said that it is , at the worst, probably low grade dysplasia at the top of the vagina. I may need to go to the operating room for laser surgery. That didn't sound so bad.

When I had dysplasia before, they did a biopsy and then a cone procedure before the hysterectomy. She didn't hurt me at all and it only took a few minutes. According to the information the other doctor sent me though, it takes 30 minutes. I know it wasn't like that before. Wren sends her love to you, Libby, as always. Love, Di and Wren ",

I had the abdominal also for dysplasia. the possilble beginning of cervical cancer. \nYes, the flashes are bad, but compared to cancer we can handle them. Silx years later, they are hardly noticeable for me. I'm just warmer than I used to be. I live alone and was just fine with that. I can usually rest better that way.

I'll go to see Dr. Aft after the test and sometimes they have the PET results and sometimes they don't. Once they said they'd call me at home and they never did. So, I was bad and didn't call them either. That was a bone scan I think. \nI sure do thank you for fireing up the plane. \nAs for the coyotees, I am actually in town, one block from the main street that goes past the university, Jo-Ann. It is considered a rural route and I walk 3 houses down to get my mail. I am on a hill surrounded by woods with 3 creeks in various directions around me. They are so creepy. I think there may be a baby one behind my house. I never let the cat in the yard a minute by herself any more.\nThat's where I've been also. In the yard on a lease. I've hesitaed to mention it because those that aren't animal lovers think I'm crazy. \nI've actually wondered about\n the safety of the screened in porch. I 've seen too many reports of bears breaking into people's houses lately.\nWell, thank you again Joyce, Jo-Ann and MK for coming. Remember that I will certainly be giving you all hugs. I'll be ready for some by Oct. too. Lots of love, Di ",

I have mine too in education and I know how much work that is. However, I did mine before I started teaching so that was a lot easier for me. And, I didn't have a family. You are AMAZING! \nI'm so very happy to hear that the Abraxane is working for you and please let us know when you have scans so we can pray for you. I'll certainly be sure to do the same. In fact, mine is June 15th. \nI hope you have a wonderful summner. Maybe a great graduation trip would be nice. \nIt was so good to meet you. I had wanted to for a very long time. \nYou had your transplant right after mine so you were one of the first people I knew on the board. Keep in touch. Much love and hugs, Di ",

Steve's mom passed away etc. Fact is, I just want more time before I go so who am I to tell you what to do. I depends on how much you trust you doctors. Since I fired all of my bad ones, the ones I have now I treasure and would trust their feelings.\nJust know that I am praying for you as always, and I miss Jo-Annie too. Love and Hugs, Di ",

But, I am now almost 5 years out from the recurrence. I had the mastectomy when I had the recurrence. To make a very long story short, I can't have reconstruction. I wish I could. This is due to radiation damage from double radiation. I agree with MK though. With one breast, you always have to wear a prothesis to be evened up. Something to think about as if you already didn't have enough. We are there for you. Hugs, DiVanDyke ",

I wish I had had this board when I was first diagnosed. \nI had the choice of either and the doctor chose the lumpectomy. We left it up to him. He was wrong. They did MRI's though, and couldn't find any cancer in my breast. It started in the nodes under my arm. Two years later it came back in the breast. . It was probably there in the first place but we will never know. I since have had the mastectomy and more chemo and radiation. I think the now I have the best doctors in the world. I am very blessed to still be OK. Since then, I have had to have surgery due to radiation damage because I had double radiation which they usually just do not do. Now, as a result of this, I can not ever have the reconstruction. Most people never get like this. However, in my case, I could have had the reconstruction if I had had the mastectomy in the first place. However, maybe the chemo the second time was helpful. All I want you to know is that there are several sides to each story. I would definately do what others have said and look at your path report. I have a very aggressive form. Otherwise, the lumpectomy would be ok.\nThese girls are all so wonderful. Whatever you need to know, someone has been through it. Love and Hugs, DiVanDyke ",

I don't have the answer but it sounds like you do everything which is what I did. I hope you will just get some rest and he may have to kick in and help if you aren't. I don't know. I wish I could help. I feel so bad for you. At least I wasn't sick when I was going through everything. \nI will pray for you. Love, Di ",
