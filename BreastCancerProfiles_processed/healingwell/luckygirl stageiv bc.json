      "Content": " \n  relax, you only have stage 1 breast cancer, that is terrific, does stage 1 mean your lymph nodes weren't involved right or were they and how big was your tumor.  anyway, make sure you ask for a bone scan and a mri just from experience, my cancer may have came back to my spine and i did have a bone scan and it was clear when i was first diagnosed, but never an mri.  i would of liked to know if my mri showed something a year and a half ago.  also along your healing, please if you have any suspicious pain at all, get it checked out.  i let mine go for about\n 3 months and now i don't know what it is.  i will find out tomorrow when i get my pet scan.  good luck to your liver, i will pray for you\n ",
