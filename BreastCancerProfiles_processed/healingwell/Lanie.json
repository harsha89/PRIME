This was before the newer mammos which are now digital so they did a needle biopsy. It was fibrous tissue and I was told not to drink a lot of caffeine. (I don't! And I never did anyway.) But today they have much better equipment to read what's going on in there. If you can ask for a digital screening, maybe that would be helpful. Look at this link: \nGood luck!\n \n ",

After they did a small biopsy to rule out any cancer, they just told me not to drink a lot of caffeinated beverages and that was that. I hope it all goes well for you, too.

I appreciate your encouragement as well...one thing I want to add is that last year in May I was diagnosed with colorectal cancer...have had treatment...surgery and now have a permanent colostomy but am doing great! When the surgeon went in she could see nothing remaining of the tumor...only scar tissue. I didn't have to have any more treatment and they say I'm cancer free. I tell you this because it hasn't even been a year since that diagnosis and I'm pretty nervous about\n this call back for that reason specifically. Again...they were reassuring and stressed that the paperwork said they didn't see anything. She also said that sometimes it's not what they see but what they CAN'T see..that they sometimes just need more views. Thank you again for the help...I really appreciate it!\n \n ",

There is no breast cancer in my family but even so, I felt there should be no other choice but to have it biopsied. With your family history, I cannot understand why a doctor would say you're not a 'high risk'.

      "Content": " Exactly. Sure, they may have a formula based on a certain number of active cancer patients but that doesn't mean the next patient will test positive or negative in my opinion. Their 'formula' is not 100%. If I were a doctor, I would want to err on the side of caution. Only then could you rest easy. \nWhen I went through the fibroid experience, I was told not to drink a lot of caffeine as that seems to make fibroids worse or more common. Well, I drink one cup of coffee (sometimes two) a day and that's it, no cokes. Also, I had read that it's best not to take HRT which is what I was taking at the time and I stopped.\nSo, the bottom line is you have to be pro-active on your health. Be informed and ask questions. Maybe other women will come here and respond with their particular experience which is closer to yours. In the meantime, from what you wrote, I think you're making the best decision. Best of luck with that. Please come back and post how everything went. I'm not a moderator on this forum and I haven't had breast cancer but I would like to read your follow-up!\n \n ",
