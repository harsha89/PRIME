      "Content": " My mother is going to have a lumpectomy followed by internal radiation. She called her sister Thursday night to tell her about\n the cancer diagnosis. She thought that she should know. Her sister revealed that she had a partial mastectomy 2.5 years ago followed by radiation. She NEVER told anyone in the family. This plus what the radiation oncologist told her really convinced my mother that she needed to do the recommended treatments. In addition to my mother's sister having breast cancer, my mother's grandmother and 2nd great grandmother also had breast cancer.\nThe radiation oncologist felt that the six weeks of external radiation would cause my mother more problems than the internal radiation. I like the surgeon and rad. oncologist very much. They spoke on the phone between my mother's visit to the radialogist and surgeon. The two doctors have very thoroughly coordinated their plan, minimizing the number of trips my mother will have to make to the breast center. We are very fortunate that she lives close to probably the finest breast cancer center in the state. My mom is going into the surgery with a very positive attitude. I believe this is going to serve her well during her recovery.\nThe breast surgeon did recommend that I discuss my risks given the family history and the immunosuppressing drugs that I have been taking for over 5 years. She feels a baseline breast MRI should be done at this time if my risk warrants it.\nThanks for all of your comments and well wishes. My mother is a tough, head strong lady that has all of her wits and much of the feistiness that has served her so well through the years. She should handle the surgery and radiation treatments quite well.\n \n ",
