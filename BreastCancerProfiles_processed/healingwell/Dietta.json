    "Content": " Yes, Ive been through the same. I had a lump and went in for a mammo. We found out that the lump was nothing...but there's these calcifications that are definitely a reason to be concerned. \nI had 2 biopsies and found the calcifications to be high grade (comedo) DCIS that was so widespread that I could not have a lumpectomy. \nI have since had a bi-lateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction via expanders. Now silicone implants that are growing to be comfortable (all this happened in Oct 2011 and implant exchange in Feb 2012). \nMy advice for you: Try to stay calm. I think waiting....(for doctor appts, for lab results etc) is the worst part of the whole thing. Your imagination and the wealth of information on the internet can drive you insane! Try to keep positive thoughts. Stay busy! and if by chance it does turn out to be a less than ideal situation, then know that there are many that have come before you and will stand beside you through it. \nSending you peace and positive energy,\nDietta ",
