      "Content": " Hello to everybody. I just want to see if anyone out there has any input regarding my concern. I am a 45 year old and breast cancer runs on my mom's side of the family. I just recently noticed that my right breast has a white c-shaped area on areola. It is smooth and not raised. It is not tender but my breast is swollen and with my physical exam, the doctor said that my lymph nodes were enlarged on the right side. I am very concerned about\n this with breast cancer running in my family. I go on Tuesday, November 15th for mammogram. If anyone has any information about\n this, please let me know. Thanks in advance for the comments and replies. \nP.S. I read the other comments that dated back to 2003 and thought I would give this a try to see if anyone else out there has had similar concerns to mine. \n ",
