    "Content": " I have been having pain in left breat.  I did a self exam to check for possible lumps.  Thank God there is none that I can feel.  However this pain is horrible.  If I touch it I just want to throw myself on the floor it hurts so bad.  It hurts when I bend over like drying off after a shower.  I sqeezed my breast trying to pin point exactly where the pain was coming from and oh my lord.... it was awful.  I know your prob. saying go to the doctor.  I am terrified of the doctor.  I was hoping someone might have had the same syptoms.  I feel it in my breast but if I try and lay on my stomach to sleep the pain is so bad I feel it going in to the same area in my back so I have been sleeping on my back to make a little less painful. I am 34 yrs. old I have never had a mammograhm.  Thanks for taking the time to listen and God Bless. ",
