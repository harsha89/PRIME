    "Content": " Thank you so much for this discussion.  I am experiencing the same symptoms, and am awaiting a diagnostic mammogram scheduled for Dec 9th.  I had never heard of IBC until reading this thread so feeling very apprehensive.  I do have a very small lump along with the burning and pain, which seems to be worsening , so will now be able to start some serious research.  Have a very cancer heavy family history, so this is a scary time.  Everybody's sharing is so helpful.
