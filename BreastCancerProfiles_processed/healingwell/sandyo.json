      "Content": " Hi Milly43, I also have cysts in both my breasts and at the end of last year, the largest one, 4cms, was swollen up and was protruding in the form of a lump about\n the size of a small egg in my breast. It was also sore if I bumped it and after a mammogram and ultra sound the doctor performed an aspiration on it. (Draining of the fluid in the cyst, this is not painful at all) The doctor just gives a small needle into breast to anesthetize the area and then drains with another needle which you don't feel at all. The lump is gone immediately. I have had no problems since.....I hope this helps you...regards Sandy\nSANDY ",

      "Content": " Hi Milly43 How is the health system run in America...I presume that is where you are. I live in Australia and am privately insured. Here I can get my GP to write a referral to get an ultra sound and the results are sent the same day back to my GP....It only takes a few days to get into the ultrasound X-ray, sometimes the next day. Even if you are not privately insured, I would consider paying whatever it costs just for peace of mind. You will worry yourself silly if you don't. The problem is you are in fear of the unknown!! I can honestly understand this but let me give you a little tip....The more you worry, the worst it seems to get! Do you know what the definition of fear is????\n F...........Stands for FALSE \n E...........Stands for EVIDENCE\n A...........Stands for APPEARING\n R...........Stands for REAL\n \"FEAR\"...........\"FALSE EVIDENCE APPEARING REAL\"\n I do hope you can get some answers ASAP so that you can stop worrying.....\nSANDY ",
