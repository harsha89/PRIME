      "Content": " Thanks so much for all of your support.  On Friday I went and had mamo done on both breasts.  Tech brought films to be read by radiologist immediately and came back and whisked me off to Ultrasound.  Of course I am fearing the worst.  No one would tell me anything.  They just told me I would be hearing from my doctor later in the day.  Of course this is at 9:00 on a Friday morning!  No call all weekend or on Monday.\n \n \n \n ",
