      "Content": " \n \n Hello! There is no forum for liposarcoma but it is still a soft tissue tumor issue \n I had about\n a 4in lipoma removed from my thigh two weeks ago today. It appeared and grew within less than two months. It was firm, fixed, painful, and located between the bone and deepest layer of muscle (quite deep seeded). It\u2019s been 14 days and still no news about\n pathology/biopsy. I\u2019m getting concerned and stressed. Can anyone tell me how good or bad this sounds? I thought pathology usually takes about\n 3-7 days...\nAny help is greatly appreciated! \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Susie,\nThank you for the response. They did say they would call. I have not been back yet but have an appointment on Monday to look at the wound. I called them last Thursday to schedule the follow-up and also asked if they knew anything yet- they said they had no updates for me at that point. ",
