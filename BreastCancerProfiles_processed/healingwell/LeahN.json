      "Content": " hi,\n THe chemo is based on the type of bc you have. I have E+ and P+ and Her- so I will have 6 cycles of CAF. I had my first one on Thursday. I will go every 3 weeks for a total of 18 weeks. MY doc told me I would not get Taxol because of the type of bc I have. I will then be put on meds for 5 years until I go into menapause then something after that. Good luck Judie and I wish you all the best with your upcoming treatment. ",

      "Content": " Hi Sandy,\n I have look for a wig and have one picked out. I feel like I look very foolish with the wig on but I have to have something as i dont think I have the courage to go out bald. When my hair falls out I will be devastated. I have read from most women that this is the hardest part of the chemo. I know I have cancer but unless I look at my scar it could be hiden but with no hair I dont think I will be able to look in the mirror at myself.\nGood luck with your treatment on Sept 6 and stay strong, things do get better and one day we will both look back on this and be amazed as women what we have accomplished. THe first treatment is where all the fear is because it is unknown. I had my treatmen t Thursday and it was uneventful no pain and no discomfort when the meds are given. There is a light at the end of the tunnel ",
