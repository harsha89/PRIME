      "Content": " Just finished my 2nd mammogram, and of course that was inconclusive so an ultrasound was done. \nAt first it was just density and my left breast, apparently she was concerned about\n my right breast too. \nAfter the ultrasound, the radiologist came in to talk to me and redid the ultrasound.....oh my now I am thinking she found something significant.\nA complex cyst with debris in it, what does that mean? \nRadiologist says it means we do this again in 6 months!!!! You got be kidding me!!! Okay so it's normal abnormal? Yet it could be something so we recheck in 6 months.\nI was thinking why not wait a year...this testing is very hard on my nerves. ",

      "Content": " Maggie, your week sounds like mine. I went in for a routine mammogram and got the call a few hours later. I needed to set up another mammogram and possible ultra sound because the breast tissue was dense.\nIf they can't see or identify the density as normal, an ultra sound is done to see if it is fluid filled cysts or solid. My next test is Tuesday...and I am scared too. \n1 in 8 women are diagnosed with breast cancer...that sounds too high.\nAdd risk factors, immediate family with breast cancer, overweight, diet, smoking, hormone therapy, race, age, ect.\nI figure no use worrying...we are going to be the 7 out of 8, ",
