    "Content": " I am very frustrated with my doctor and my test results. I had my yearly mammogram done over a month ago now and the got a call that they needed more views I went to have that done and on Wednesday of last week and have not heard a word on what is going on. I am so mad and frustrated and anxious I can't stand it. I have left several messages with the doc with no return call as to what is going on. I was told that I would hear today and it is not 437pm and I have yet to hear anything. I have now called to see another doctor and get a second opinion on what it is that is going on. How long does one wait for just the results? I mean is a week normal? they had the scans that day but the radiologist was too busy to read them. Not sure what to do aside from going to the docs office and demanding that they give me my results. ",
