      "Content": " Thanks to everyone who answered and gave advice. All of it great. I have now taken the step-I see a psychiatrist tomorrow. I also learned that because I never once allowed myself to cry over this that I robbed myself of being a feeling human being. I refused to reach out and ask for help. What a mistake. I kept all of the anger inside and refused to even acknowledge that it was there.\nI live (and was raised) in Anchorage Alaska. Am single and have been since 1967. I do have a daughter and 2 grandaughters from which I am estranged. Being the \"Tough Alaskan Woman\" working in the oil industry I just had to prove to the world I could do this all by myself. The result was a fall into an emotional and psychological abyss that has been terrifying. Last week I actually went 84 hours with no sleep at all.\nI just started a relationship with a wonderful supportive man in June of this year after 15 years of never letting anyone into my life. I am now trying to repair this relationship because I took my self directed anger out on him. I don't know what I will do if I lose him. He has several health problems and has to think of himself too. It seems as though every area of my life has been yanked out from under me.\nMary K-\nI was let go from my job because of \"lack of funding\" but I had been getting a lot of pressure from my company for several months because of the time I had to take off to have the prior 3 surgeries plus all of the doctor visits-you all know the drill-managing your health team.....numerous oncologists, 2nd opinion in Seattle.\nI was told that my \"multi focal microcalcification\" condition was very unusual. The group of surgeons at Providence Hospital said they only saw about one of these a year.\nI was floored when I was told on 9/13 that I no longer had a job. In July I had my last biopsy and had to beg to take 4 days off prior to the procedure. I was told \"you are putting the project at risk-you are too important to be gone for 4 days\". I don't think this is legal but even 6 weeks after surgery I am still not healed and am unable to mentally focus to know where to get information.\nHas anyone else been \"laid off\" from their job because of cancer? Are there legal alternatives?\nThank you all so much. This is my very first reach out (and also the first chat room I've ever been in.\nHappy Thanksgiving to everyone.\n\"My fear is real. When I honor it, I do not need to be controlled by it.\"\nAnne Wilson Schaef ",
