    "Content": " When people hear cancer the first thing they think of is a death sentence. I was diagnosed with breast cancer early March. You have to have a positive attitude and keep hope. I have heard stories of people surviving many years after receiving treatment. You have to be strong especially for your children. If you show fear they will be afraid. My granddaughter who is 4 ask me questions and I answer her in a way she understands and everyday she tell me she loves me. Family support love and dealing with your situation will bring you through this just fine . I i don't know if you are a religious person, but prayer will bring you through this. I read script\nures on healing and know that I am heal. Be strong, keep hope ,pray and family love will pull you through. ",
