      "Content": " Hey guys,\nHope all's well?\nI finally saw the breast surgeon; he concluded it's Fibroadenoma too and gave me the option of a fine needle biopsy or leave it as is & monitor by ultrasound on a 6 mth period. I opted to wait & watch with the u/sound. He's thinks I may notice more activity with my periods, so I guess I have to observe. He did advs tho, that if it got problematic before the 6 mths are up to get back to him.\nNow with the size of the lump reduced and the tenderness gone, it's still warm and it pricks like a dog-gone needle around that area. This doeasn't happen often...like once a day for a few minutes but enough to make me cringe. Anybody experienced this?\nNeways, so much for me. How are you guys doing out there? ",
