I gained 35lbs since all of this happened and I was very tiny so I am trying to adjust to the weight gain. As far as the scars...I have some sensation and some numbness in parts of my upper arms but it is slowly going away. I have to say that my surgeon did a beautiful job and my chest is not scary to look at. The day I got my staples out I went into my bathroom alone and looked and it wasn't shocking, in a way it was comforting if that makes any sense. I just had a hysterectomy so as far as being intimate...that is something we can't do right now, but I have alot of faith that when i am ready breasts or no breasts all will be ok.\nxoxoxo\neveie\n ",
