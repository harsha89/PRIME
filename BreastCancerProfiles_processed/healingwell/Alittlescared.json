      "Content": " There is breast cancer history in my family. My mom had bc..went through chemo same time my sister went through chemo for bc. My mom became cancer free even though she passed a year later from other medical conditions. My sister was not so lucky with hers, the doctors gave her the wrong chemo and instead of shrinking the tumor it spread and she went into stage 4 very rapidly. She fought very hard for over five years and just recently passed away in Sept. 2013 at age 58...Having both my mom and sister with bc makes me a triple threat to also getting bc. I have been advised to get a mammogram every 6 mos. instead of a year because of. In previous mammograms i have been told that I have multiple cysts, benign..But for the past month or so I have been having a burning sensation that comes and goes in my left breast. Without mentioning this I went for my routine mammogram last week and I received a call from my regular doctor saying that they had found something in my left breast and want to do a second test to get a closer view. I was at work when I got the call and I had to leave work early it was so upsetting because my first thought was the big \"C\" word. I am waiting to hear from the diagnostic center to schedule a second test. I have heard of this being a symptom of having IPC. When I go back to get a second view should I insist on a sonogram? I will be turning 53 next month and am perimenopausal. I have also been told that another hospital in my area gives 3-D mammograms. The hospital I normally go to gives the digital. Also, I have a friend that has suggested I get a double matsectomy because of my family history. I am pondering over whether I might should go ahead and get the double m so I won't have to worry about\n it. ",

      "Content": " Sandra, it sounds like you have gone through a lot and I hope you are getting better everyday. Good luck to you...I finally was able to schedule my second mammogram for a closer view of the area in concern, just had that done today. The radiologist has suggested a biopsy. I have decided to have the stereotactic biopsy versus the incision type. The radiologist said with my family history as well as there being so many calcifications and being so close together was the reason for his suggestion. Having so many and close together there could be just one that is cancerous and I am hopeful that if there is that the biopsy will be able to detect it. I had strongly hinted to have a biopsy, that I would prefer one just to be able to rule out anything that probably won't show up on the mammogram. I am now checking out a couple of doctors to decide who to use for the procedure. One that my internist suggested is a breast cancer specialist and general surgeon. I am also waiting to hear from my ob/gyn doctor to see who they might suggest before I make my decision on a doctor. I will post more news as I have it. Thank you for your input and suggestions. Good luck and please let me know how things are going for you. ",
