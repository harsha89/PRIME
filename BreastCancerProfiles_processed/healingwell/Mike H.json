      "Content": " So I'm the husband here and a near 4 year veteran of the Prostate Cancer side of Healing Well.\n12 Years ago my wife had a lumpectomy on the \n followed by 5 years of tamoxifen.\nOn August 1st, 2013 she had breast reduction surgery and upon examination of the removed tissue they found a tiny 2mm lobular carcinoma in the \n.\nThe surgeon who did the lumpectomy 12 years ago said this 2mm finding, would never show up on a mammogram and is suggesting an MRI in 3-4 months after the swelling goes down and most likely radiation and or some newer drugs or tamoxifen. Her attitude is the reduction was a great thing and very well may have cured my wife of cancer a second time. She feels there is no rush to consider a mastectomy at this time, and if need be it's something we can always consider later.\nNow we have the Plastic surgeon who did an amazing job on the reduction and was WONDERFUL in every way. He reached out to a breast cancer specialist is his hospital (different from the 12 year ago Dr./Hospital) and his colleague there seems to be pushing very hard for a double mastectomy. We meet with her tomorrow but in a phone consultation she and the plastic surgeon had with my wife they are very much of the mind you've found cancer twice, no more fooling around.\nMy wife is going to do the genetic testing for BRCA, but I'm wondering where all the folks on the Breast Cancer side of HW feel about\n next steps.\n1) Assuming the MRI finds nothing do we go with radiation & medication? \n or\n2) Do we strongly consider the double mastectomy sooner than later?\nHow difficult might a mastectomy be 5 -10 years down the road if we did radiation & meds now and later discovered we had to do surgery?\nThanks,\nMike (the husband).\n \n DOB. 6/11/60\n12/2/00 PSA was 4.9\n5/5/03 PSA was 5.4 - Biopsy Negative\n6/10/09 PSA hit a all time high of 6.9\n7/23/09 Biopsy Positive. 10% cancer in 1 of 12 cores.

      "Content": " UPDATE >>>>\nOn 10/8/13 My wife had the double mastectomy. \nThe pathology results determined that the 2mm cancer found in the breast reduction was the only active cancer. However in the remaining breast tissue they did find:\nLCIS (Lobular Carcinoma in situ) &\nDCIS (Ductal carcinoma in situ).\nLCIS indicates that you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer. \nWomen with LCIS have an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer in either breast.\nDCIS is the presence of abnormal cells inside a milk duct in the breast. \nDCIS is considered the earliest form of breast cancer. \nDCIS is noninvasive, meaning it hasn't spread out of the milk duct to invade other parts of the breast.\nWhile DCIS isn't life-threatening, it does require treatment to prevent the condition from becoming invasive.\nEnd of the day the doctors felt the pathology results from the mastectomy confirmed and validated that we did make the correct choice with the double mastectomy.\nThere was no lymph node invasion and no need for any further treatment.\nYesterday she has had the last 2 of her 4 drains removed and has begun having her tissue expanders filled for the reconstruction that we hope to have done in early 2014.\nI must admit that my wife is much stronger than I had imagined. She's doing great and has an amazing outlook under the circumstances. She says she does still have her dark moment when she's alone and looking at herself in the mirror but I'm doing all I can to love and support her, and even after just one day of tissue expansion she's starting to have some definition in that area and it looks better already.\nThe mastectomy was necessary and as you can imagine a very low point for her and the entire family.\nWe're hoping we can now get on with living cancer free and looking forward to the reconstruction, a surgery she's excited to have.\nThanks for letting us share.\nMike ( the husband).\n \n DOB. 6/11/60\n12/2/00 PSA was 4.9\n5/5/03 PSA was 5.4 - Biopsy Negative\n6/10/09 PSA hit a all time high of 6.9\n7/23/09 Biopsy Positive. 10% cancer in 1 of 12 cores.

      "Content": " Sandra,\nThanks for the reply. I assume you're happy and well? Do you look good as new? Are you happy with the reconstruction?\nMy wife did the lumpectomy 12 years ago and were it not for her recent breast reduction who knows how long she'd have gone before the 2mm cancer was discovered or the DCIS or LCIS would have turned into something else.\nI'm not sure 12 years ago a double MX would have been called for and my gut says my wife is emotionally in a much better place to deal with this at 50+ with grown adult children than at 40+ with teenagers.\nAt this point we are where we are. Did you have the belly flap procedure to harvest tissue for the reconstruction? How did all that turn out for you??\nMike\n ",

      "Content": " KC,\nI'm honored to be the recipeint of your first ever posting.\nThankfully my wife dose not need any further treatment other than the reconstruction.\nToday she has her second visit with the plastic surgeon to fill the tissue expanders a bit more.\nShe's now telling me she likes her super tiny boobs and doesn't want to go much bigger than she is now which is nearly NOTHING!! She went from a 44DDD to maybe a 40D after the reconstruction.\nAfter the double mastectomey my guess is she's a 36 A or an A minus if there is such a thing.\n\"WE\" will be negotiating on the final size but end of day I think her vote will carry more weight than mine, and she wants them tiny LOL!!\nI hope your circumstances are good. Have you taken any action since your diagnosis?\nWe are in a much better place mentally and emotionally now that the cancer is gone and she has the beginning of some definition to her chest again. Life moves on!\nLast week I purchased her another T-shirt. It says \"my cupcakes licked cancer\". It was so cute I had to buy it.\nEvery few weeks I order her another funny shirt. I think they are way better than greeting cards or flowers!\nJust my way to let her know I'm there for her and always thinking about\n her.\nMike\n ",

The recovery may be a bit tougher but the woman ends up 100% \"natural\" and gets a bonus - free tummy tuck out of the deal.
