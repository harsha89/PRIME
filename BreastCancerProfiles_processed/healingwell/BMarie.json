I am opting for delayed reconstruction with a skin sparing mastectomy and expander to be placed at the time of my unilateral mastectomy. They will expand pretty quickly as not to delay the radiation treatment. There are side effects as you know from radiation, but I am happy with my decision. I will have surgery on March 23. I am 37 years old. \nHope this helps. Be encouraged and know God's love prevails above all.\nMarie ",

I have made a decision to go to John Hopkins for surgery and breast reconstruction. I have been communicating with the director of the breast center there and she had a delayed bilaterial diep flap in 2002 after 10 years and she was \"thrilled\" and finds it \"far superior to doing the tram flap\" because it spares the muscles. I hope to have a consult by month's end. My node status came back negative with the needle biopsy. I will still need to have a sentinel node biopsy with the mast, but I am so encouraged. I have a long road ahead of me, but reading about all the tough times, successes, and comforting words shared by all healing well, helps me get through another day. My love and prayers to all.
