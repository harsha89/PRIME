      "Content": " \n ok guys (or girls :) im in desperate need for help or advice. I'm just gonna throw everything out there in hopes someone will know EXACTLY what im talking abt. Abt 2 months ago I found a lump in my right breast. I've been told from a mammo approx 4 years ago that I have fibrotic cysts bc of breast feeding my 4 kids. Aka \"lumpy breast tissue\" so I didnt really think anything abt this new lump that I have found. Anywho...fast forward six weeks and the lump is abt a grape and a half bigger. Now almost 10 weeks after original lump found it has almost doubled in size and is shaped like a sickle cell (of you guys know what that looks like) I was having sharp occasional pain from my armpit down to my nipple seeming to skip over this lump that I can press on with no pain at all. I am now as of the last few days have had burning from my armpit to my nipple like hot water being poured on the area constantly. Due to my ins i cant even go to the dr much less any specialist or special tests until after jan 15 bc of work rules and regs. Blah! Any advice!?\nthanks in advance!\nroxy ",

      "Content": " Thank you! well we got an aflac policy that is in effect on mid January but there is a 30 day waiting period. If I am diagnosed within the 30 day waiting period they pay nothing for 2 years! If I get diagnosed (which I hope I don't) then aflac covers a ton of on coming medical expenses! It's a great policy for any kind of cancer. Since I am the primary income. .. it was important to think ahead I guess. But the waiting game is horrible! ",
