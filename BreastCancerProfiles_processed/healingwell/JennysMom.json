    "Content": " just wanted to say hi, i'm new to this forum.  I am a 5 yr Stage 2B survivor.  i had a lumpectomy.  Actually, i had 3 lumps.  2 were cancerous.  Surgeon tried Sentinal Node Biopsy unfortunately the dye wouldnt move so i had 14 nodes removed.  4 of 14 nodes were positive.  I had 4 rounds of A/C chemo, 4 of taxotere, and 33 rads.  Never had a sick day, continued working while going thru treatment.  5 yrs later, and i've had a couple scares, with microcalcifications, but other than that, i'm still alive!   nice to meet you all :) ",
