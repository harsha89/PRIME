    "Content": " Hey Victory 13 - the best thing to do is try not to worry - I'm in my 2nd year of Mammograms and Ultrasounds - back and forth between right and left side. The newest is a 6 month follow up of mammo and ultrasound which revealed a new complex cyst which they want to look at 3 months time with Ultrasound. I try very hard not to linger on what could happen and try to stay positive (though sometimes your thoughts move into a bad direction).... The only question I have is when should they aspirate or remove - how long is long enough? Shelmagator ",
