      "Content": " I live in Saskatchewan Canada. On your 50th birthday, the Saskatchewan health sends you a letter to get a mammogram.\nMy mom, sisters and I have always had what we call 'lumpy' breasts. In fact. about\n 15 years ago, I found a lump and had an ultrasound. The technician then told me that it was a fluid filled cyst. She also told me that if it hurts, it's not cancer (which I have since learned is not correct for some forms of breast cancer). \nSo I went for my mammogram 2 days ago. I was told by the technician that I should not panic if I get called back for a second mammogram. Especially since this is my first (they need to ensure they have a good base for future mammograms) and also because I do have 'lumpy' breasts.\nWell, today I got the call to go back for a 2nd mammogram as well as an ultrasound. \nNothing that is said to you when you get your initial mammogram prepares you for that phone call.\nThe lady on the phone said that \"92% of recalls turn out to be nothing\". \nAs positive as I am trying to be, 8% has never seemed as big as it does now.\nI go back on Wednesday for the 2nd mammogram and the ultrasound.\nI have read some of the posts on here and it has calmed me quite a bit. \nWhen I got home from work and told my husband, he gave me a big hug and said 'it will be okay'. \nI believe him. Even if it does turn out to be cancer, I will learn to deal with it. And darn, I will be a fighter.\nPlease wish me luck and/or say a prayer for me that everything turns out okay on Wednesday. It's going to be a long 5 days. ",

      "Content": " I already posted on another thread but will post on yours also.\nI went for my first ever mammogram on Dec 7. Dec 9 they called me to go back in for another mammogram and an ultrasound. I go in tomorrow morning, Dec 15.\nI too am freaked out even though they told me that 92% of people called back are fine.\nI have talked to many people at work as well as my family and every one either has been called back or know of someone that was and that there was no cancer.\nEven so, I am still freaked out but trying not to show it.\nIt has been a stressful week and am happy that tomorrow I will know either way.\nNothing worse than the waiting as too many thoughts go through your mind.\nWishing you luck and will say prayers for you that everything is okay.
