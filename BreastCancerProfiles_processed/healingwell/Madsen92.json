      "Content": " My mom goes a clinic here that takes 3 to 4 months to give you an appointment for anything, she had a mammogram earlier this month. Yesterday she was called, they told her they needed to schedule another exam because they had found something. The only thing that worries me is that it isn't til the beginning of February, why so far away? She is 61 and we have no history of cancer in the family at all. \n ",
