    "Content": " I'm new here I just got a call back. I had a mammogram Monday got a call that\nevening, they got me in tomorrow on Wednesday. going to do a retest and then\nif needed an ultrasound. I have an annual mammogram was a year ago and they\nsaw some changes they said in my left breast.\nI will be 70, no breast cancer history, I used to have fibrocystic breasts, my doc\ntold me to quit drinking coffee and reduce caffeine and that stopped the pain. I\nalso had lost 50 pounds years ago I have regained 10 but I'm still in pretty good\ncondition. I had a hysterectomy almost 20 years ago and still take premarin, that\nmay have to stop, we shall see. Hate to it keeps me young, but oh well.\nI have never had a recall before so I'm nervous, but they are doing it quickly, the\ntech said she notified my doctor and that they will make sure I know if anything\nis wrong before I leave so that's not going to leave me hanging like so many of \nyou have been. I think I have a good facility and also a good doc, hoping for\nthe best and no matter what I will work through it. I have been under so much\nstress the last year or two nothing would surprise me. A mentally challenged \ndaughter of 44 to deal with and a MIL with dementia/alzheimers, they are both \nplaced now so I' hoping to be able to distress. Will get my answers tomorrow. ",
