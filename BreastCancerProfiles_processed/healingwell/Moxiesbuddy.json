    "Content": " What an ordeal you've been through! I'm truly sorry your outcome has been so complicated, in ways even your surgeon didn't expect. It's good that you stopped smoking but I know how frustrating it is when your body doesn't heal like it should. It can be tempting to second guess your past decisions, but truthfully, you can only move forward from here. Who knows if any of this would have been prevented if you had chosen a different treatment path?\nCan you give the wound vac more time before making a decision on graphs or expanders? I would imagine this is something that is being closely monitored, even by a team of doctors. Does your oncology center have a support group you can attend? Sometimes it's really helpful to talk through options with other women who have personal experience, even if your situation is unique. \nI will pray for complete healing of your body, and wisdom as you make important decisions. Gentle hugs coming your way. ",
