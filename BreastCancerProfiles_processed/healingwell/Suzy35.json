      "Content": " that I have breast cancer. I have posted before on the Depression and Anxiety board, that was last September, October..ect. I got that all under control and was feeling pretty good. Now this.\n This lump is very pronounced in my right breast, right under and around the nipple, a bout the size of a walnut, if not bigger. When it started it was smaller and I had a mamo and sonogram done, they came back fine and off I went. about\n three months ago I noticed it changing but thought it was because of hormones. It got to the point it didn't shrink, just got bigger. I was sent to have a biopsy done on Tuesday, I got the call a while ago that it was cancerous. I'm really scared because it's so big! \n \n I go in for an MRI on the 17th then will take with my doc about\n options. My poor husband is so sweet and strong and I know he will love me and be with me through all of this.\n I have three girls that I need to tell, sometime soon. I worry about\n how we are going to pay for this and what will happen. \n Eight months ago I was fighting a depression so hard I thought about\n dying, now here I am again. It's so scary. ",

      "Content": " Ok, I went to the doc yesterday and from the MRI, talking with her and my husband, I am going to have a masectomy done on my right breast with reconstruction right after.\n The skin doesn't want to move around the lump, so she thinks it may be attached, so the nipple and all would have to go anyway. I would rather they just take it all and hopefully and cancer cells with it and I can move foreward with this. I go in on the 9th to talk to the plastic surgeon and then the two docs will get a time together to get this all done.\n I'm nervous about\n the whole thing, and not thrilled about\n loosing my breast, but I feel like it's the best choice for me and my family. I have no idea what kind of treatment I will have to have afterwards, hopefully my lymph nodes will come out clean. ",
