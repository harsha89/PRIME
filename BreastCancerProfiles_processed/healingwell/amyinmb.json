    "Content": " So glad I came upon this forum! I am going back in tomorrow for a magnified mammo of my right breast. They found microcalcifications on my last mammo and I had never heard that I had them before. There were a ton of them in both breasts. My Mom was diagnosed at age 51 and it finally took her life at 70 years old in 2010. I am always a bit nervous since I have very cystic breasts and have had cysts drained in the past also. I realize that microcalcifications are quite often non-cancerous, but I'm still very nervous!!! ",
