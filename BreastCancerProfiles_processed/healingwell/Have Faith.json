Mom turned 69 in April and she's on Taxotere, Carbo with Avastin and Zometa for the bone.  We live in Maryland and have a wonderful onco.  He gave her the choice to fight that one faithful night because he knew it if she would make it it would be a miracle.  A miracle did indeed happen.  He can in the following morning with such surprise in his face and we asked time how can she go from so low to feelin no pain and gettin better so quickly?  He just looked at us and held his hands in the air as if We already knew that answer.  God was with her and still carries her now when she's down.  An hour ago I got off the phone with the Dr. and he said the scan showed to be (and I know I will not spell this right) interstial? I'm sure he will order another scan.  The scan on her hip has not come thru as of yet.  BTW?  How high were your markers?  I have never heard of any at all from other people fighting this and would just like to know.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " I dont know where to begin.  My mother had breast cancer 13 years ago and things were fine until this Dec.  She kept saying her back was bothering her.  So we went and got all the test run and sure enough the cancer has come back.  Her CA 15-3's were at their highest at 1867 on 2-14.  She had been going for her treatments 3 weeks on and one week off.  They put her on a new schedule one week on 3 weeks off and her her markers went from 550 back up to 1670!  We go tomorrow to find out the scan results and to see what's going on.  This is a roller coaster that we all want to get off of.  I think I'm just looking for encouraging words.  And prayers would surely be appreciated.\n ",
