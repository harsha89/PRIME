    "Content": " I had lymphoma in 1990. I have had black drainage from one of my nipple s and boy was it scary. But I went to the cancer specilsts and she said they looked at it under a microscope and it was nothing darn, I wish it had been something so I could have had them both cut off and then reconstruction because they are both huge and give me painful chronic pain in neck and back between shoulders and on sholders because that is where my over the sholder boulder holder presses down. I hope you do alright and I pray it is nothing. but check it out \nSincerely,\n connie (Knitwit) ",
