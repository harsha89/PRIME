      "Content": " hi 53 diagnosed BC 2010 IDC 3mm grade 2, 4mm 10mm spread, 2 nodes clear. Radio 3 weeks. No taking tamo. 1st month no problems, except very dry skin this has got worse as i suffer from very sensitive skin and have ezcema. The dry skin is terrible now, and i have cracked heels that are bleeding. Had bad vag dryness, itching which i went to the doctor for who said it was thrush so they treated it and it got worse, urine test said Strep B infection and now put me on pencilline which is worse. Suffering from constipation and piles at the moment, had enough. Have not had a decent nites sleep for the last 4 weeks. Decided to come off the tamo. My oncologist said that if i had trouble with it (as i had expressed my concerns about\n dry skin, poor circulation), that i have a 96% chance without taking it - so ladies what the hell cant stand this.\nWill get an early oncologists appointment this week as not due for another 4 months. Dont know really what to do at this stage.\nAny suggestions, similar problems and advice accepted.\nPinks ",

She was horrified when i told her i had agreed to radio, and said it is never to late to de tox. She suggested 5 kelp tablets daily to de tox. dont take tamo, - start with erradicating everything none to man that is harmless. This seems a life changing decision (I love coffee, shampo, washing clothes, moisturisers, dont smoke or drink now, veggie, low fat).\nCould anyone give advice to stopping tamoxifen.\nPinkie ",
