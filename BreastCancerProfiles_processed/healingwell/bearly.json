      "Content": " I was just hoping I could get some answers to ease my mind. My mother went for a mammogram, six months ago. They found a little lump, 3.5mm. She had to go back in 6 months for another. They said that they were going to send her to a specialist and for a biopsy as they don't know what it was, but that in grew only slightly to 5mm (pea sized), and that it may be, what she thought he said, something about\n calcuim. She was told by the specialist that there doesn't seem to be anything else around there, just this one lump, and everything else looked good. She went for a biopsy today, but has to wait until probably tuesday to get the results. She is 61 years old, and I am probably worried just as much as her. Since of her age, and since they probably would have known it was a cyst from the mammogram, what else could it be? Should we be worried that its definitely cancer? What are the odds that since they sent her for the biopsy that it could still could be non-cancer? If it turns out to be cancer, is the size of this mass caught soon enough to give her a good prognosis?\nthanks all!\n ",
