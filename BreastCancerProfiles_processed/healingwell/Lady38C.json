    "Content": " Hello @Englistea I too had a mammogram & ultrasound in December 2011 and told I had fibrocystic breast and told to come back 6 months for a follow-up. I had the mammogram and ultrasound done a second time June 2012 and told I have precalifications that would require a \"stereotactic biopsy\" as well as a ultra sound guided biopsy for another area on the same breast, (one of the nodules in my breast seem to have a gray haze over it - should be a solid black core). \nI had the stereotactic biopsy last Thursday 7/5/12 and was told it would take 1-1.5 hrs. Mine took about\n 2.5 hours. Here's a video to help put your mind at ease: http://youtu.be/aOJahVP0qCo Mine went well enough, the (procedure) Dr.'s bed side manners weren't very courteous though, (he told me I'd feel nothing when he put the needle in position and well...I definitely needed more numbing. He responded nonchalantly to my cry as if I were being over dramatic to the pain he had just caused me. However, the assisting nurses were very kind, sympathetic and even holding my hand. A much appreciated and comforting gesture.\nI am now waiting for the results. I am also scheduled for a ultrasound guided biopsy next Thursday 7/12/12 (a week from the first one) for a 'hazy nodule' in the same breast. I'm a bit anxious and sought out this forum to help me to not feel so overwhelmed. \nSo far... so good. lol! Not much in the forum about\n the stereotactic biopsy yet. It looks like it's just you and I kid [@EglishTea]. I noticed it's been a few months since your last post. I'd love to hear your updated story. \nI pray all is well. I'll be sure to come back and post my story of 'what happened next'.\nStay UP - Stay Buoyant! ",
