    "Content": " No one knows the exact causes of hereditary breast cancer.Â Doctors often cannot explain why one woman develops breast cancer and another does not. They do know that bumping, bruising, or touching the breast does not cause cancer. And breast cancer is not contagious. You cannot \"catch\" it from another person.\nResearch has shown that women with certain risk factors are more likely than others to develop breast cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease.\n ",
