    "Content": " Hello, I am new here as well. I found this forum while I was researching info on calcium in the breast. I had a mammogram a few wks ago and it came back with findings..as the doctor put it. So I had to go back for a second just on my right breast. They then call me up and tell me that they want me to go see a surgeon. I went to see the surgeon who could not feel anything by a breast exam so they have set up an appt for a breast MRI. He said that there is calcification in my right breast. The one thing that makes me nervous is that my Mother had a masectomy after battling breast cancer. They really aren't telling me much which also makes me nervous. ",
