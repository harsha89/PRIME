    "Content": " Hi all. I guess a need some reassurance. I'm terribly worried that I got a call back after a routine screening mammo for asymmetry in both breasts. I think in my head if it was one area of asymmetry I wouldn't be as worried. But since they saw something on both sides it makes me think it could be something real. And of course now that I know these results I'm getting all kinds of weird sensations in my breasts. Makes me worried, actually terrified. I go back for a second mammo on Tuesday and the waiting is excruciating! Thoughts? I would appreciate any input! ",
