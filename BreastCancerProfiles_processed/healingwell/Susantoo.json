My nodes were clear but I was having terrible indigestion and abd pain and cont to lose weight. I had put off a colonoscopy for years. In shock, I scheduled a gastroscopy and colonoscopy as instructed by my medical oncologist. I had them Wed morning. Normal colon and a hiatal hernia, not more cancer as I was convinced. So miserable can become less? \n I can at least help you worry. I am still terrified, I have my radiation simulation and tattoo placement Wed, and start 28 treatments plus 5 'boosts' Thursday. Since I have lupus too, I'm afraid what's left of my poor boob will fry and harden. Keep us posted,\nSue\nPs I bemoaned to my surgeon that I guess I'll never be a perky size A...he laughed and said that could be arranged! \n ",

      "Content": " Hi! Lisa and everyone,\nI know your terror well. The fear of not knowing what to expect is, to me, a void of dark numbness that finally, is getting better. I wanted to climb in my bed and not get out. I had a routine mammogram 5/9, and a 1.3 CM Stage 1 IDC was discovered. I had a partial mastectomy and two sentinel nodes removed that were clear. I have lupus, too, and my surgeon was wonderful about\n discussing a double mastectomy with me, and reassured me that new evidence proves that in breast cancer, it's been proven best to only remove the involved tissue and only the lymph nodes they need to. Trust your dr, there are a lot of us cancer survivors worrying about\n the same thing. Hence once my dr got in there, he only needed to remove part of my rt breast to reduce the chance of impaired healing from unnecessary incision and wound size. And to my surprise, my lupus flare while waiting for surgery 6/4, seemed to abate. It's almost like my body knew the limits of what I could bear. Your dr will give you enough and powerful pain meds, take them as prescribed so you get better soonest. I found two soft pillows suited me better than the firm body pillow I had. I tuck one along my ribs on my rt side, and the second small pillow under my armpit. God bless and my prayers your way, keep us posted,\nSue ",

I found a wonderful plus size bra at Walmart. 9 front snaps, nylon/spandex, Fruit of the Loom, style FT308 RN 97431. I went back and got 2 more, and one in size 46 as the swelling went down a lot and I've lost a lot of weight. The sentinel lymph node scar is kinda high up near my arm pit and for the first few weeks the edge of the bra seemed to make the scar more sore, so I used a folded new white hanky to pad my stitches from the bra. I'm starting radiation treatments next week. Prayers your way,\nSue ",

With no symptoms, no family history, and 40 years of normal mammograms under my belt...they found a mass on 5/9. My biopsy on 5/16 was positive for Stage 1 invasive ductal cancer. Estrogen positive. The drs have been wonderful and reassuring. I had a breast MRI on 5/21 and a partial mastectomy on June 4th. I was expecting a lumpectomy as surgeon said study evidence shows no benefit to a mastectomy over lumpectomy with 6 weeks of full breast radiation and 5 years of arimadex. They removed the cancer completely, it was 1.3 CM and he got clear margins. They did a sentinel lymph node biopsy, removed only 2 nodes that were negative for cancer. I told surgeon it would be fine to remove both breasts, and declined any reconstruction. He reassured that there really was no evidence removing healthy tissue, with the greater post op recovery and risk for lymph edema, impacted long term survival or reoccurrence. I start radiation treatments next week. My oncotype score was 20 and oncologist said that was good and new data is showing no benefit to chemo with that score and my cancer. I feel so reassured that my treatment is being individualized for me and blessed that finally, I see some light at the end of this tunnel, this journey. I'm still so scared but grateful to have had access to the best healthcare in the world. Prayers your way,\nSue ",
