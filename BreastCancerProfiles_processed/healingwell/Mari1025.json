    "Content": " Carolbrestar,\nJust joined and read your post. I could have written it. A quote from your post...........\n \" Then in 11/12 I started Tamoxifen! My life has been a living heXX ever since the Tamoxifen. I have body pain,...\nFour + years ago I had a double mastectamy, been on Femara -didn't work - mastesized in left hip, left rib and t4 and t5 in back. So started Faslodex injections - didn't work, now we are trying Tamoxifen and I do NOT like the side effects. I have only been on it for less than 4 weeks and my body aches, aches, aches. Can't hardly get up out of a chair or bend over very well. It's getting more difficult to get my pants on! Any sudden movement is not good. I have a bone scan scheduled for next week because I was having hip pain. I don't notice it anymore after starting Tamoxifen! Other areas hurt more.\nI hope you are doing better. Please let us know. Will post my results when they come. ",
