So glad all of you survivors are here and so positive. Certainly this horrible disease brings out the figher in all of you! Life is so worth it though!! ",

      "Content": " Everything I have heard is positive for this drug although the pain is a real downer for her. I can't imagine how it is. I didn't know whether mild exercise would help like it does for some arthritis or make her feel even more soreness and pain. I am just trying to be supportive. My sister is 13 yrs my senior but we have always been so close. I must get her to try using a computer, she doesn't have one. She needs a support group. She doesn't drive either and we live in a very rural area. So all of you are a boost. Have a great day and weekend Happy! ",

She didn't get sick from chemo and only side effect now is the bone pain. Wonder what it does exactly to cause it. ",
