    "Content": " I had a double mastectomy in June, cancer spread to lymphnodes on the left. I do not believe in Tamoxifen in any way, shape or form, but the doctor scared me so much that I agreed to take 1/2 dosage. I've been taking it for two weeks and I feel like I have a balloon in my belly and I'm meaner than mean!! It sounds like the side effects just keep getting worse and nobody mentions whether or not they go away after you stop taking this horrible pill. I really don't know if it's worth it and I'd like to hear from someone who has stopped taking it and what has happened since. Anybody?? ",
