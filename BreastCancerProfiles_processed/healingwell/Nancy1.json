      "Content": " I was diagnosed with breast cancer this past November. I had a lumpectomy and will be receiving radiation treatment. Depending on my Oncotype DX score, I may also need chemo. My oncologist also is planning to put me on a hormonal therapy medication. I am 67 years old. I am very concerned about\n how I will handle all of the cancer treatment along with dealing with arthritis. Has anyone else dealt with both of these conditions? I need advice. ",
