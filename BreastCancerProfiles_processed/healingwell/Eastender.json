Thought nothing of this my very first recall - one week later I received a letter to say I had to return to clinic because of something the radiologist had seen. One week later I returned to be told I had two areas of which could be micro calcifications. One week later returned for core biopsy on two area very scared did not know what to expect. This went ok had to wait another week for a telephone call to be told one area was abnormal and return for a vacuum assisted biopsy. Again returned one week later for this procedure. Did not know what to expect my husband came with me & had the procedure done. One week later received telephone to say this cluster is abnormal had to be referred to breast surgeon who tried to reassure me and placed me on yearly recalls. I know how you must feel. Because it was my first mammo they don't know how long they been there. Abnormal what's abnormal I feel like a time bomb waiting to go off. Like you find it very hard to talk to people. Sometimes feel on my own but I know there is other people out there just the same as me. I wish you luck and hope all goes well for you. Take care - thank you for listening to me. ",

      "Content": " In October 2012 aged fifty two was invited for my first mammo. Week later was called back to have a core biopsy on my left breast - I have micro-calcification in two places. One week later received a call to say the bigger cluster was benign - but the smaller cluster was B4 abnormal. Now I was called back to have a vaccum assisted biopsy. You have no idea how I was feeling - scared very scared. After this percedure I was left another week then got the call to say these are abnormal and to see the Breast surgeon two days later. Now I'm on yearly recalls - will these turn to cancer ? No one can tell me. Three months down the line my breast still aches -cant lift anything heavy with my left arm. Tired very tired of just thinking all the time. \nSorry I should have said this is all new to me something that was routine as turned my life upside down. Don't think I was told enough what was happening to me - or maybe I just blocked everything out. J I've got my yearly appt through and seems to me I'm just waiting or one day told yes this is now BC.\n ",
