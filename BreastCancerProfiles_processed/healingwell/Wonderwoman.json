      "Content": " Hi KiwiSimone\nI am a new member of this site-this is my first post. I found this forum whilst researching breast lumps.\nI was putting fake tan on myself four days ago, when I found a lump in my right breast. I never do breast exams so I am glad I found it. I don't know how long it's been there though. I am 32 and very worried!\nI am seeing a nurse tomorrow morning and if she thinks it's anything to worry about\n then she is going to make me see the doctor. My friend at college (she was in her early twenties) found a lump in her breast, went to her neighbour who was a doctor, he told her it was nothing to worry about\n, a year later (yes, a year later) she was diagnosed with breast cancer, at that point she was stage 2, she was gutted that she didn't detect it earlier. She is fine now though.\nAnyway, the lump feels quite big, it's moveable (if that's a word!) it feels different to the other lumps that one feels at certain times of the month. It's a hard lump. I am so worried as I have no idea how long it's been there. I wish now that I had done self examination all along...\nAre B9 lumps affected by times of month? What time of the month are your breasts at their most lumpy? during your period? Well my period is not due until the 20th, I guess I am trying to diagnose myself here... I guess I just have to be patient ",

I have to wait for an appointment by post... which kills me, I wish I could get it seen to NOW!!!!\nIt has totally affected me, I feel like I have become irritable and I could blow a fuse at the slightest thing... \nThank you for reminding me of the statistics, your imagination can run away with you at a time like this.\nMy friend, like I mentioned, had breast cancer, she was in her early twenties, I felt her lump and it feels similiar to mine! arrrrrgh! Maybe all lumps feel the same at the end of the day...\nWill keep you posted, did you have a lump in your breast also? ",

I am in London, but if I fly back to my country, I could arrange a biopsy (or a mammo or what ever it is i need) pretty much right away. \nI guess I am just wondering if it's bad for me to wait, i mean is the lump going to get bigger etc... I am sorry for my ignorance on the matter!! \nWhat's the doc going to do only feel the lump and agree with me that i need to get a biopsy! Seems like a waste of time, it's obvious that this lump is something that needs to be examined...\nThanks in advance ",

Anyway, I will wait and try to keep it in perspective. I keep thinking of that 80%! \nThis experience has made me think of all the women out there who have breast cancer, I can't say that I know what it feels like but I can imagine it a little, it takes one hell of a strong woman to deal with such a disease.\nI have nothing but admiration ",
