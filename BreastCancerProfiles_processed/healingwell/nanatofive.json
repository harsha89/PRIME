    "Content": " luvtherockymtns - How are you doing now?\nI am going through almost the same exact situation as you have. It has been over 3 year now and I still have pain/discomfort on my right breast after having a biopsy in which I got a very large hematoma. I went to a breast specialist and she said she could do surgery to remove the hematoma or I could just wait to see if my body would reabsorb it. She put me on an antibiotic and it did reabsorb as far as I know. I have weird pains with certain bras and figure It is scar tissue or possibly a nerve problem. I have had several mammograms since and they disregard my pain. I have even had a double core biopsy since on the left breast and was terrified that I would go through the same thing as I have gone through with the right breast. I stressed to the radiologist the horrible experience I had on the right breast and he assured me that everything would be fine. He did a great job. Thank God the double biopsy on the left went very well and they were able to drain my cysts and the results were benign. It is time for my annual mammogram again and I am having the same pain in the right breast after 3 years now. I am thinking about\n going back to the breast specialist that I originally went to after the hematoma to see if there is anything she can do to relieve the discomfort/pain. Wondering if you ever got relief from your situation. I hope you are doing well now. ",
