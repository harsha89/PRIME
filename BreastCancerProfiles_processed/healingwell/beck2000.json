Want to come help us?!\nLauri, I know your mom was glad to celebrate her birthday with you. Look at all of those trips you've taken making wonderful memories. The most special memories would be of seeing her great-grandbabies. Hope you have lots of pictures for her to enjoy.\nMK, one of my favorite b'day memories is the time you and Chuck called and sang a duet of \"Happy Birthday!\" I'm so glad you're home from the hospital. Now rest and feel better.\nJoyce, Geo will never, ever forget you! Even if you don't have lemons hanging around your neck!! Give that Vic a hug for me.\nLadies, you are so special. I love you all. \nBecky\n ",
