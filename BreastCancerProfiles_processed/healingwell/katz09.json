Now while i am writing this I am feeling nothing but ina couple of minutes I think it can come, what is wrong with me. please suggest, is it IBC or something else?. There are no rashes or redness or swelling but a viry tiny dot size spot like mosquito bite near the nipple skin which appears as if scratched by a nail but it is also subsiding in pain now. But i am still worried, please reply if anybody is online. Thank you. ",
