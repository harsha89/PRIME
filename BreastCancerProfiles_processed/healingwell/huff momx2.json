    "Content": " Hi, I am new to all of this so I really don't know how to start. I am 43 years old. I had a breast reduction in 2006 and several mommagrams so far the dr said everything has been ok until last Wednesday when I went for my annual checkup( well actually it has been 2 years since I went.) Anyway he found a lump in my left breast, it is no where near any of my scars. He ordered a sonogram and a mammogram. The girl that did the sonogram said she wasn't really seeing anything so I went for the mammogram. The lady that did it took four films, she said she wasn't seeing anything but because he felt the lump she had to do 2 more. After she did those all she said was he will talk to you in a few minutes. I talked to my dr, he mentioned sending me to a surgeon for bioptsy after we got the full results from the films. I am waiting to hear something now. I have had burning in my left breast along with a sharp pain every once in a while. The pain only lasts a few seconds then goes away. I have also had some night sweats and fatigue. My left breast is slightly larger than the right one. Sometimes the burning feels like something is trying to pinch the end of my breast off. I don't know if I should be concerned or if I am just paranoid. Like I said I have had the symptoms for several months but just never told anyone because I guess I felt it wasn't important. I also had a historectomy in 2003 but he left my overies. My mom passed away from cancer when she was 55 but it wasn't breast cancer. I just don't know how to feel. I am afraid it might be something and the tests not catch it, then on the other hand maybe I am paranoid. Thanks for listening and sorry I rambled and might not have made any sense at all. ",
