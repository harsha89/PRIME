      "Content": " I had breast cancer in 2003 with a mastectomy and no chemo/rad only took Arimidex for five years. Until this May almost five years to the day) I was fine, then at a regular checkup the doctor found a axillary node, did a fine needle biopsy which came back positive. Mammograms, ultrasound, MRI, Stereotactic biopsy, CAT/PET scans, Chest X-Ray all came back negative. They think the tumor is in the breast but not sure where. I to am going to have a port put in and begin Chemo. I am so scared, even though I am a Reg. Nurse. with a Bachelors in Nursing. My sister in law had Chemo and has suffered heart problems but other than that she is fine. My other friend had Chemo, went and finished her PhD and worked....she was fine. Remember, you can keep a positive mind which will helpe your healing process. Keep in mind, it isn't ceforever!!! !!!!!!!! Joyce ",
