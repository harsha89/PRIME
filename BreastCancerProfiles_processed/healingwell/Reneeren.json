    "Content": " Janice, my friend! No wonder we haven't seen you! I want you to take a look at this from the National Cancer Institute:\n\"Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive breast cancer. In some women, DCIS lesions will progress to invasive cancer, although at present we cannot accurately identify these high risk patients. DCIS is also called intraductal carcinoma.\"\nJanice, this is cancer, not a pre-cancer, not a kinda-cancer, not a cancer wanna-be, it is something that you need to take care of. I know that the different web-sites call it different things, but I'm believing NCI and I would feel a lot happier if you would too!\nBiggest hugs!\nRenee ",
