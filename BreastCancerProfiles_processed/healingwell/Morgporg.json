    "Content": " Hi I'm new to this forum but anyways, 2 days ago I experienced a sharp pain in my left breast which went on for the rest of the night and I woke up with tenderness and redness around my nipple. I'm only 18 and I still live with my mom so I showed her (she's been to the doctor for multiple wonky breast things) and she told me to wait a couple of days to see if it goes away. It's now day 3 and it's fading but still tender. My mom hasn't shown any concern but I'm really worried as I've looked up my symptoms and IBC came up. Can anyone help me out? ",
