      "Content": " Hi Bev, Thanks for the insight. I have tried hearbal remedies, no caffiene, new bra's the works and it's good to hear others know what I am going through. I try not to say anything half the time so my family will not think I'm a chronic complainer BUT the pain is ridiculous. It's ironic that you said your friend had her breast removed because I was going to my next appointment with that question. I'll stay connected and hopefully with good news.\nSmooches\nNivenn ",
