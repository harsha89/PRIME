      "Content": " Angie from Phoenix, AZ, new to this thread but am on 4 or 5 other ones including Hypothyroidism, Fibromyalgia, Bi-Polar, Chronic Pain, Scoliosis and there isn't one for Brain Cancer although I'm in a holding pattern for that after 1 Craniotomy in 02(Meningioma), Gamma Rad. in 08 and again in 13 with 2-4 still present and accounted for. I had a Lumpectomy in my left Breast in 6/2011 came back benign was told not to worry as i have alot of scar tissue from being large breasted, was a B-cup went up to a C after 1st child in 1991, stayed a C after 2nd child, up to a D in 2009 after a Radical Hysterectomy 8 months following 1st \"safe\" Radiation Treatment for 2nd Brain Tumor in 12/2008 and have been a D-DD depending on weight ever since. I'm 5'0 so the difference between 145 and 160 is a whole other cup for me. Anyway 6/16 due for Mammogram and recently found 3 or 4 new Lumps on Left Breast and scared ****less. I've been living with the Brain thing for 14 years and my Neurosurgeon already knows I'm ok with surgery but NO CHEMO! my kids are 26 and as of tomorrow my son will 21 and my Granddaughter 2 on the same day and my kids know the Brain Cancer drill too. But I know or I've heard Breast Cancer is a whole different Beast. I'll be 48 on 6/14 and I'm not ready to die even though I know I've been living on borrowed time for 14 years. I hope this helps explain, I'm a Recovering Addict/Alcoholic, I've been Clean and Sober since 6/7/2004 and I can't die with a needle stuck in my arm too high to recognize my own kids and that's Chemo will do to me. I'm not in charge of anybody but me, so what you do is none of my business, but I'm terrified and you guys no way more about\n this than I do and I \nopen to anything that doesn't involve me dying loaded.

      "Content": " Hi, I'm new to this subject although I belong to 4 other diseases here at Healing Well. I will keep it short, 1yr ago I had a mass removed from my left breast bone, I did the follow up mammograms and all was well for a while. I went back on hormone replacement therapy 6 months ago. For clarification, I had Gamma Knife radiation for a brain tumor, my second, and 9 months later I had to have a complete hysterectomy, I was 40. I had been on Estradiol 2mg for 18 months when the mass showed up. When I went back on them, I have a .5mg patch 1xweek and 100mg progesterone 1xday. And this time the stuff is all over my breast bone and there some other lumps on the side. I'm getting a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound today. Since I had the radiation in 2008 I have gotten steadily sicker and sicker, I have 3 Autoimmune diseases and I can't even get a dr. who will treat the new one, plus I am menopausal, I can't take anymore Western Treatment, so what are chances of survival if it is cancer?\nFibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Brain Tumor 2nd, crainiotomy 2002, radiation 2007, mild scoliosis, carpal tunnel, surgical menopause, 44yrs old and on disability since 2009.

      "Content": " It is highly unlikely that this is cancer and your doctor won't send you for a scan for anything that small. But since your in your forties you should be getting a mammogram every year, when was your last one? Also if it does change, get bigger or you find something else don't rely on a mammogram, apparently they are worthless unless it is cancer and its big enough that an airport security scanner could find it. I had a \"perfect\" mammogram on my 43rd B-day and then i had a Large Lesion removed from my breast bone 6months later. Luckily it wansn't cancer that time but I just had a mammogram and an ultrasound and now i have to have an MRI because apparently neither of these scans includes the breastbone area. So yes, be vigilante, there is no history of breast cancer in my family but there's no history of brain cancer either yet I'm on my second brain tumor.\nFibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Brain Tumor 2nd, crainiotomy 2002, radiation 2007, mild scoliosis, carpal tunnel, surgical menopause, 44yrs old and on disability since 2009.

I know its propably impossible but if you could skip the mammogram process completely you could save \nA LOT of money and A LOT of time and fear. Mammograms are, in my opinion, about\n as useless as using a CT-Scan to look for a brain tumor, by the time they find it, 90% of the time its too late. i've never had oozing from anything but if i did I would be in the ER(they have to see you if you live in the U.S.) and go to everyone in a 50mile radius if you have to until you find a Dr. who gives a you know what(this may take a while) but that is the only way to save our lives that i have found, and I have insurance.
