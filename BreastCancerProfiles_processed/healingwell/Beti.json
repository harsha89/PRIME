      "Content": " Well, after so long I've decided to write again. I wasn't sure about\n it, as everything came back negative from my excisional biopsy (the lump turned out to be a fibroadenoma) and I almost felt ashamed to say it after reading how many of you get bad news from the biopsy. But I just wanted to say, for those that have to go through it, that everything went so well with the doctor and the nurses, that I'm happy I did not have to wait and see is the lump changed before deciding to have a biopsy. Another thing, beside all the anxiety of waiting first for the surgery, then for the results, is that I found myself worrying about\n my family, not about\n myself, if the lump turned to be BC. I know that fibroadenomas tend to form again, so I'll probably have to endure all this again, thinking it's something bad (I know women with fibroadenomas have twice the chance to get BC). It also tells me that at almost 40 I might be getting into premenopause :). Anyways, I just wanted to say good luck to everybody in the forum, those who have to go through all the tests and waiting, and those that go through treatment. I'll keep reading the posts!\nThanks\nBeti ",

      "Content": " hello all. I'm new, and I started reading your posts when I had my left breast checked for a small lump. Since then (July 15th) I've gone through the several painful mammograms they took, plus the ultrasound. They couldn't clearly give a diagnosys (cyst or tumor), so I was sent to the breast surgeon, who said that it looks like a complex cyst and it's so dense they can't use the needle to take a sample. So I'll have surgery on August 22nd for a biopsy. I'm not only concern about\n the results, but also of the \"after effects\" of the surgery. I'm not young (39), but I was still hoping to get pregnant. I'm keeping my hopes high, thinking that everything will be OK and actually be concerned about\n how the breast will \"behave\" if I get pregnant, after having the surgery. That's all I could say right now, I'll keep reading your posts for comments about\n the surgery (it looks like my lump is easy to find, and it's close to the areola, does it make the surgery easier and the healing faster?)\nThanks!

      "Content": " Thank you very much for your words! I did lose a very close friend because of BC (tomorrow would be her birthday) because I think she did not have the proper treatment, according to her age and type of cancer. I hope that all the advice you give here could reach even more people. \nI also wanted to mention that I had a lot of support from my partner, you will laugh, but he kind of found the lump, and encourage me to go to the doctor right away (I was planning to wait for a couple of months to see if the lump went away), and having all my family far away (South America) that meant so much! \nI think going through this will also help me provide support to other women. One of my cousins has a similar problem, and she basically freaked out when she heard about\n fibroadenoma, because she has several. If any of you has any more info (besides what can be found online) or a very good site to check, I'll really appreciate the info.\nAbrazos (hugs, in spanish)\nBeti ",
