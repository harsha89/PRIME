      "Content": " Hi,    I went through breast cancer 3 years ago.  I just had a mammogram 12 days ago and they found 2 spots on my left breast that I had biopsied.  Thank God they were benign.  Since the biopsies I have this awful pain in my back, the same side as the biopsies.   The pain is constant and in one spot in my back.   I called the Women's Center and they had me come in to check the area.  All looked good.  They sent me to see my primary doc.  He thought maybe shingles, but I have no rash.  He put me on darvocet for the pain.  He said if it doesn't go away in a couple of weeks I should call him.  I've put the heating pad on it, I tried ice packs.  Nothing seems to help.  Anyone else have this kind of pain.   \nMeds:  Asacol 2 tablets 3x a day\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

How are you doing with the Crohn's disease. I've been on so many meds trying to get this under control. The Imuran alone didn't do it. So the doctor, just last week, suggested going on the one entocort a day. So far so good. I'm glad you're finished with radiation. I went through that and was so happy when it was over.
