    "Content": " I have been on Tamoxifen for about\n 2 1/2 months. about\n 6 weeks ago, I started feeling extremely anxious and depressed. Psychiatrist put me on Effexor, Seroquel, and Klonopin -- not much relief yet. I was told that you could try to split the 20mg dosage and take half in the a.m. and half in p.m. This hasn't seemed to help much either. Has anyone had these side effects? Has anyone taken their dosages in the a.m. and p.m. instead of all at once? Has anyone heard that it's ok to literally split the pill in half or should I ask for 10mg pills and take 2 per day? Thanks! ",
