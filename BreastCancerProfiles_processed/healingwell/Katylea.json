      "Content": " Hi, Im new here and was hoping somebody with the same experience could help put my mind at ease. I found a lump at about\n the 10'o'clock area of the left breast just two week ago, I got a real fast appouintment at the breast clinic for the following week. The doctor asked me to point out where i could feel the lump as she couldnt find it whilst i was lay down and neither could i, however when i sat up it was easily felt and i pointed to the area of the lump. The doctor had a feel around and asked if it would be ok to place a needle in it, which i now know was a fine needle aspiration, on withdrawing the needle there was blood and what can only be described as yellowy gunk, she said she wasnt alarmed by what she saw in the needle, however i was. I was then asked to call the breast clinic for my results in a weeks time which will have been this coming Friday, but i was so sick with worry i built myself up this morning and called them, in the hope that they would have something to tell me. What they told me was that there wasnt enough tissue sample taken to complete the biopsy and so left me hanging. The lady on the phone asked if i had received my appointments for the mammogram and scan to which i advised her that i hadnt, so she said she would call the department and ask them to call me and let me know when this would be. I have just received this call this afternoon and the appointment for the scan and mammogram is for a weeks time now!!!!! To say i am out of my mind with worry is an understatement, im not sure i can hold out for another week, the not knowing either way is killing me. \n ",
