      "Content": " Update: wife is done with 6 rounds of Chemo and did pretty well through it believe it or not..The doctors were pleased. Her tumor shrunk alot, almost to where you cant feel it anymore. MRI came back good, but we go and see the surgeon this week. They think she is going to still have to have the mastectomy. Was hoping it was going to be a lumpectomy. Luckily it didn't spread to lympnodes, etc..know more soon. thanks\nLialda 2 a day\nMMJ/Simpson Oil\nPhillips Probiotic\nCurrently in Remission ",
