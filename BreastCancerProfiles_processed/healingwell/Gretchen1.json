      "Content": " Hi there. You can always ask about\n genetic testing. Genetic testing probably won\u2019t be warranted if you have no family history of breast cancer. It is $300 or more dollars and often insurance doesn\u2019t cover it. The diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound should be enough. Dense breast tissue just means that a regular mammogram isn\u2019t getting a clear picture. It doesn\u2019t mean that a mass was seen or that cancer is suspected. The diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound should get a clear image. If you are concerned about\n something being missed, you could ask for an MRI. Again, your insurance my not pay for this unless your doctor says it is warranted. Be very diligent with self breast exams. If you aren\u2019t sure how to do this thoroughly, ask a doctor to show you. Many masses are first detected by us!

      "Content": " Hi there. I\u2019m just here to lend support. I understand your anxiety. Finding a lump is a very scary situation. I can tell you from experience that ultrasound makes a fairly clear image. If the radiologist said 95% that it\u2019s benign then you are probably fine. I know that sounds lame. But try not to panic until there is something to panic about\n. \nI got the opposite line. I was told 98% chance that what they saw was malignant. I didn\u2019t panic, but I was sad, worried, scared etc. I can tell you that the worst part was the not knowing. So be kind to yourself and take good care.\nDiagnosed with MS July 2006, Breast cancer 2017\nI have no lesions on my soul and so I live with no limits. ",
