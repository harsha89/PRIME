      "Content": " I have to agree that this is very perplexing, and I agree with MK that this IS the sort of thread that is better off deleted. Some things are just ugly. It is not that anyone here made it ugly, Peter included. It is just that it IS ugly. Whether Denise was real or Denise is someone with Munchausen's By Internet (good name), well, we may never know. And there are many things we will never know. If you watch Lost on ABC, you will know what I mean. Ha. Some things just may never be known. The best thing we can do is remember what we remember about\n Denise and hope that we were never and will never be defrauded, and that if we were or or, it is only because we were decent enough to \nopen our hearts. And that should never be regretted.\nI still believe that it might have been better for Peter to not publicize any of this until and unless he knew for a fact that Denise was a fraud. Bygones. I hope this thread gets deleted.\nSurvivor ",
