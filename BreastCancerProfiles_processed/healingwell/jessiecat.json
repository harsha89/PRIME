      "Content": " Dear MK.\nI am really sorry to read this about\n Carolyn.\nI did both Xeloda and Abraxane. I had a rough time with the Xeloda too. I wanted to quit it so many times. \nAs far as the Abraxane goes, the problems I had were diarreah and joint pain. It made me feel like the Tin Man and I needed to be oiled at my ankles when I got up in the morning or got out of the car on a long car ride. But once I started moving it got better.\nI took Immodium with my breakfast every morning and ate a bland diet to help with the other problem. \nThere was the hair loss too, but that was expected.\nI will tell you that my onc said that the worst of the side effects that you read about\n from Taxol and Taxotere are from the Cremaphore that is used to dissolve the medicine. Abraxane is Taxol in its purest form and it is wrapped in albumin so it goes through the system right to the cancer without causing as much harm to your body as the other two Taxanes do. \nWith Taxol and Taxotere you have to get premeds of steroids and Benadryl and the infusion can take over three hours. Abraxane takes only 31 minutes because there is no need for premeds.\nMy insurance would only pay for Taxol, BUT since I had an allergic reaction to the Benadryl of all things, they had to give me the Abraxane.\nThere are studies that show that Arbaxane works better than Taxol so if Carolyn should have an allergic reaction or something that resembles an allergic reaction to the Taxol - if you get my drift - the insurance HAS to pay for the Abraxane. Something that resembles an allergic reaction would be difficulty breathing and complaining loudly that you are feeling quite ill, etc. Heck, we gotta do what we gotta do.\n I had the Abraxane weekly and it was much easier on me because of that. \nHere is one news result on a study of the superiority of Abraxane to Taxol:\nhttp://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/18716.php\nHugs,\njessie ",

      "Content": " Actually- here is the WHOLE thing:\nIs My Tumor Truly Hormone Receptor-Negative?\nBy Susan Peck, PhD \nThe steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone stimulate the growth of normal breast tissue, as well as many tumors. This is because breast cells contain specialized proteins, called receptors, for these hormones. After binding the hormone, the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progesterone receptor (PR) turn genes involved in cell growth and survival on and off.\nThere are two ways to measure the amount of receptors in a tumor. The older method involved labeling the hormone with radioactivity and measuring the amount that bound to a tumor sample. Binding assays are quite accurate but require specialized lab equipment and larger amounts of sample. Also, contamination from non-tumor cells can skew results.\nA second method, immunohistochemistry (IHC), is more commonly used today. A tumor sample is placed on a slide and incubated with an antibody, a specialized protein that recognizes the ER or PR. A color reaction makes the receptors visible under a microscope. This method can be performed on small samples and doesn\u2019t require sophisticated lab procedures. But scoring and evaluation is subjective, and results can vary.\nThe amount of receptor on breast tumor cells can determine whether hormone therapy will be effective. In the past, some women who had a low level of ER or PR expression in their breast cancer cells were considered receptor-negative and thought not to benefit from hormonal therapy. It has now become clear that even low levels of hormone receptors may allow women to benefit from hormonal therapies like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Currently, the most stringent cutoff point to be considered receptor-positive has been lowered. If a woman has as few as 1 percent of cells positive for hormone receptor by IHC, she may be given a trial of hormonal therapy.\nEven within ER-positive tumors, there are subtypes with different prognoses. For example, when investigators in the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination) trial looked at patient subsets, they found that the decrease in relapses seen with Arimidex versus tamoxifen was even more dramatic in women with ER-positive/PR-negative tumors. These results need to be confirmed in a prospective trial.\nGene microarrays, a new tool to measure the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously, are being used to develop a system for classifying tumors. In the future, the \u201cmolecular fingerprint\u201d of a tumor may allow us to conclusively determine the tumors most likely to benefit from hormonal therapies. ",

      "Content": " You guys are preaching to the choir here!\nThe site of all those pink ribbons on that fence were for women who this disease had lost. It was heartbreaking.\nI get in trouble when I get started BUT...I was a professional fundraiser for many years and donated money NEEDS to be accounted for.\nFor example: The Lean Cuisine Deal. How many people actually think Lean Cuisine gives a rump about BC? It is a marketing ploy. If you read the box it says 10 cents will be donated for each box bought UP TO $100,000. OK- $100,000 donated where? For what? And I am sure the makers of Lean Cuisine could donate MUCH MORE than that. If it says donated to the Komen foundation ok think about it- first you take the $100,000, there is the salary of the people in charge of collecting and organizining that money. Then it gets sent to the people at Komen- the adminstrators, staff, etc. take it in and \"decide\" what to do with it. When they finally send it to its ultimate location there is probably $12.95 left.\nAvon, Clinique et al... they want to sell mascara and rouge- they really are NOT doing it because of some overwhelming urge to cure breast cancer. But a woman shopping sees it- it strikes a chord in her - and she buys it thinking she has helped. She walked past the Lancome mascara because she THINKS Clinique will do more good. Well she has helped. She helped Clinique make more sales in the month of October.\nI am VERY HAPPY the \"Pink Ribbon\" movement got BC out of the dark ages and brought our disease to light- BUT- I resent having it exploited for marketing gains.\nThat is why I really only trust the ACS and that Research Lab that I am always talking about. \nThe walk on Sunday raised 2 million dollars- the ACS HAS to put that towards BC because they are strictly regulated. The Cold Spring Harbor Lab does ONLY research for BC and they have made incredible discoveries that are going to help us. 85% of every dollar goes Directly to research. That is an unheard of number. They are ranked #1 in fiscal responsibilty for non profit organizations.\nHere in NY the new thing is these magnet pink ribbons for your car. You buy them at the card shops or newsstands. NONE of the money goes to BC research. I don't understand that one at all.\nI know I have said this before but AIDS in America gets FOUR TIMES more funding than ALL cancers combined. Have you ever bought an item- or seen a single product- that says 10 cents for each box is donated to AIDS research? No. And THEY get more money, have newer, more humane treatments coming out all the time.\nWe have to think about this. Next time you are tempted to buy a \"pink\" item maybe the price of the entire item should be sent to an active BC Research lab instead.\nOK- now I that I have managed to piss off just about everyone I will put my soap box under the bed. Wait til MK comes home. I promised to be so good.\nBut when you really think of the numbers, the amount of promotions and the LACK of anything good coming our way it DOES make you wonder doesn't it???\nLove,\nJessie ",

      "Content": " I think the stat that \"most OVCAs are only caught at stage 4\" is based on the fact that a woman doesn't have any SYMPTOMS to warrant getting a pelvic sonogram. So by the time she feels pain, the tests are done and they see the tumor it is already at stage 4. \nWomen with polycystic Ovaries have larger than normal ovaries. But with ovarian cancer your ovaries can appear large too.\nRemember when you got the doppler? If you had a tumor that would indicate ovarian ca, the doppler would have picked up blood flow to the tumor. Meaning it had its own blood supply which is NOT a good thing. \nA simple cyst does not have its own blood supply.\nI don't know if bi-annual sonos would help. Margaret321 might be a better one to ask. But I have been followed like that on and off since I was 15 years old. I have watched so many sonos done on me I can name the parts they are looking at- it is actually fun to freak out the techs.\nBut they always measure the size of my ovaries. Let's say yours were 3cm by 2cm last month. And you went again in February and they were 6cm by 5 cm- a doc would want to do an exploratory lap to check them out. \nBut the \"virtually undetectible\" I believe is for the SYMPTOMS not the actual physiological findings.\nWhat I was trying to tell Ellen in that post is the sonos can pick up pretty much everything- including the thickness of her uterine lining and I believe that is where they found a concern- a thickening of the uterine lining.\nDid any of this make sense?\nYou can ask me anything you want as long as it doesn't have to do with math or geography.\nlove,\njess ",
