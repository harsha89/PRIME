    "Content": " First of all let me say I am supremely sorry for everyone in this group. I just saw my PCP who did a breast exam. She found some \"lumpy bumpies\" as she called them and felt they could be fibrocystic changes but that it would be unusual. I am 65, have had a complete hysterectomy years ago and have been off estrogen for a long time. Having a diagnostic mammogram Monday. That's 6 days to worry about\n this. Can anyone give me any good information about\n this? Thanks all.\nDiagnosed with MS 2001. Fibromyalgia, Graves Disease, IBS, Gastritis, Spondylosis, Degenerative Disc Disease, Sjogrens, Osteoarthritis, Osteoporosis, Tendonitis, Costochondritis. All the autoimmune diseases are attacking me. Taking the minimum of medications. ",
