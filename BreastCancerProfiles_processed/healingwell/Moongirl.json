    "Content": " I was called back for a redo after my first mammo also. They said my breasts are very dense. Then I found out I have microcalcifications. I go back in July for my 6 month follow up. My breasts hurt all the time if I touch them and have always done. I'm 40. I was freaked out a bit when I first got the news of the microcalcifications but then other health concerns took a front seat and so I have just tried to let go of worrying about\n it.\nIt's very scary and you are not alone. But be glad you are getting your mammo. So many women go unchecked.\nMoon\nMoon\n--------\n40 yo female\n20 years of IBS and GERD\nWent off PPIs in Jan 2012\nVitamin D and B12 deficiency diagnosed in 3/2012\nStarted Gluten Free diet in 4/2012\nStarted B12 shots in 4/2012\nCurrently treating SIBO symptoms with Xifaxin/Diflucan.\nOff all depression/anxiety meds now that Vitamin D3 is working.
