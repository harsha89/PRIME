    "Content": " First....take a deep breath. Calcifications....there are two types. Microcalcifications could be a concern, but depending on how shaped...clustered...etc. i had focal asymetry with clustered microcalcifications. Went and had excisional vacuum assisted stereotactic core biopsy. Not painful at all. I felt nothing. The only thing was my neck felt a little stiff from laying on bed. Biopsy results were all negative. After what i readon internet i thought for sure i had cancer. Do not let anything you read scare you. Good luck to you. ",
