But when I picked up his\npersonnal things from the hospital my picture was the first thing in his wallet, when I got to his house my pic's where eveywhere...... Talk about\n wanting to be angry!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I won't be. I can't! because it will just make me sick. I am waiting now to find out if I am going to have to have chemo, which I am almost certain i will. Somedays, I just want to scream, or hit something, I have to let whatever makes me negative go, I have to just stop sometimes and look at my life as though I am having a somehwat out of body experience, kinda like just watching myself go through the motions,\nYou have TO stay STRONG NO MATTER WHAT...i KNOW IT'S HARD, AND SOMETIMES YOU JUST DON'T WANT tO BE STRONG.....but YOU have to.
