Being the worry wart that I am I asked if I would be notified earlier if they found anything or had a question. She said no and went on to say she didn't see anything but she was not the one that read it. Do they say that to everyone? I worry about\n everything. Know I should have been going yearly but no doctor had mentioned it. Am 63. Any advice will be appreciated. ",
