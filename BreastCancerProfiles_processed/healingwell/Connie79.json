    "Content": " My Dr has started me on Aromasin. I was on tamoxifen for 5 years and 3 months. I am now on Aromasin. Can someone tell me somethng about\n this pill? I was told to take one daily AFTER my meal. If anyone is taking this pill please let me know what time you take it. I used to eat my main meal at any time. Now I may have to eat my meal later, say 4:30 and then take the Aromasin at 5:30. I would like to know if anyone knows what is the best time to eat your main meal and then take the Aromasin. I was told that it is very important to take this pill at the same time and AFTER your meal. Thanks for your help.\nConnie79 \n ",
