He still told me to come in 6 months to make sure it doesnt get bigger, which he followed by saying it wouldn't...\nI keep reading ladies on forums who were told they had such a thing and the radiologist ended up being wrong.

      "Content": " Good Morning Everyone,\n4 months ago I had an ultrasound on a lump which turned out to be a fibroidadenoma. First ever ultrasound on my breast I am 34 years old. I had to go for a follow up to make sure it didn't grow, I made the appointment before the 6 month mark just to relieve my anxiety about\n the whole thing. The ultrasound tech but the probe only on the spot near the fibroiadenoma and although that lump remained the same, I had another growth a 1.2cm nodule. Long story short after sleepless nights and reading up all about\n breast cancer and pregnancy (I am 21 weeks pregnant) I had a biopsy and thankgod it was benign but the diagnosis was PASH.\nI am so scared, I know its benign but everything I read online says it should be removed and I got the old follow up in 6 months. Also what scares me too is that she literally put the probe on a PART OF MY BREAST and found this then imagine what she would have found had she scanned my entire breast. I begged the surgeon to write me a script\n for a bilateral breast ultrasound but she said she doesnt want to \nopen a can of worms?? and its not for screening! I don't know what to do now and I cant find anything to relieve my anxiety, thoughts? ",

The doctor told me to come back in 6 months for a follow up ultrasound just to determine stability. I am 5 months pregnant now and I went back today (4 months later) for the follow up ultrasound and the doctor told me that the tiny fibroid has not changed in size but that my breast has changed so much (its like a new breast) and I have clusters of masses that he can't tell if its hormonal from the pregnancy or something else so he wants to do another biopsy of the entire area. I am really worried this could be BC. Could it be possible in 4 months that cancer can proliferate like this?\nAlso I have had three doctors check my breasts every single month during pregnancy and no one found anything particularly worrisome in my breast. I am so scared. ",

      "Content": " I am sorry to hear what you are going through Djry11. It is so frustrating... When I had the second ultrasound (first one tech lady didn't find anything she only scanned half of my breast), after the script\n said entire breast, I had to do another one, they did entire breast and found the lump...thankfully, but I had to fight with my insurance and it was't my fault that they messed up the first one. \nI would still argue with PCP for a breast MRI... I don't know I am sorry to hear what you are going through it is like pulling teeth, you are right. It's sad because look at you, you are aggressive and they won't let you get as far as you should. Imagine the other people who slip between the cracks. NO one cares...\nI hope it works well for you and good luck with the heart surgery...it will all pass and sunshine is just around the corner (that is how I like to think)\nI had the biopsy, it was honestly a piece of cake, although they give you nothing to cover your eyes so I turned away since I did not want to watch them cut a piece of my breast lol...

It is driving me crazy, I am also getting shooting pain from there and an itchy armpit and like you I fear the worst!!!!\nI went to my GYN and he looked at my breasts and did a physical. He found a lump in the same stupid breast!!! IT SCARED THE HECK OUT OF ME. He sent me for a mammo and ultrasound (I didnt do mamo because everyone told me that you are too young and it probably wont show up, etc...) so I did first ultrasound they found nothing.... Because I am an anxious person and I assume no one knows what they are doing I fought to have another ultrasound done with a more experienced tech (the first one who did my ultrasound was 25 yrs old!!) anyway I guess I get lucky cause my husband is a physician at the same hospital, they did it again and they found the lump. THe radiologist was SO confident in telling me it is a fibroadenoma..\nI AM STILLL anxious, since I keep reading stories online that masses classified as Fibroadenomas on ultrasound can be cancer on biopsy, so yes they think I am a wack job but I am pressing for a biopsy and want it out.\nBack to IBC (inflammatory breast cancer) it scares me so much because nowhere did I read that fibroadenomas cause itchiness like the one I am experiencing. I keep checking my breasts and I really dont see any skin changes but this itch is in one section and my other breast doesnt itch and I keep thinking this is IBC in its early stages but like you I keep getting brushed off since I do not have any noticeable skin changes...\nI have an appointment with a Breast Surgeon on Monday and I am going to ask her... I know how you feel it is so frustrating. I am 33 yrs old I have 20 month old daughter but I stopped breast feeding a while ago (over a year) so I know it has nothing to do with that, ,,, I dont even have that as an excuse to comfort me :(((\nFather diagnosed Nov. 9, 2009 \nopen radical prostatectomy Dec. 21, 2009, post op pathology report T3a, Gleason 7\n5 week post op psa .55\nCombination therapy, hormone and IMRT. 40 sessions 72gy. \nHoping and praying for a cured dad.

I went to a breast surgeon (hoping to get it biopsied) she agreed to do it for me, and then (after the second sonographer found it on imaging) the breast surgeon with her own machine could not find it. I am now scheduled to have an ultrasound guided biopsy done by a radiologist (I guess he is the most skilled to find the lump), so hopefully I will get this sorted out. ",
