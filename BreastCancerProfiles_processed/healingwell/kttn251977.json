    "Content": " Hello ladies, I am usually in the chronic pain area. I lost a very close friend to breast cancer 2 years ago- she was only 27. So, I always have my own monthly check up. I have always had small \"knots\" in my back- which have recently progressed to other areas of my body. Last night while doing my check-up I noticed one of these \"knots\" under my left breast. I did feel my friends knots, and this one does feel a little differernt. Can anyone tell me any symptoms or otherwise that you felt before you were diagnosed? Bless you all, strong- courageous woman. Good Luck. -Shannon. ",
