      "Content": " I have an MRI scheduled for the 15th. My mammo was inconclusive so they sent me for a second mammo and a sonogram. The doctor came in and said it looked \"strange\". He said that what he was seeing on the screen almost looked like bruising under the skin and commented, \"well obviously you aren't bruised\". He asked me if I had recently injured myself, which I hadn't. He said that a biopsy would be difficult because it is close to the skin surface and that going from the top or bottom might miss the area in question. So he scheduled an MRI and possibly a biopsy based on MRI findings. Just wondering if anyone ever had something the doctor thought was bruising/hematoma and it ended up being something else. Overall, I am not worried much. \nNote- My mother had breast cancer and her breast removed in her 60's (they felt it was from hormone replacement). My first cousin on my dad's side had breast cancer in both her breasts in her 40's. So I may possibly have family history on both sides. ",
