    "Content": " I have diverticulitis and have had 3 episodes since last Sept...I am on Cipro at the moment ..and don't eat seeds,nuts or raw vegetables and the attacks come out of the blue..I am very depressed and basically eat pasta, chicken, potatoes..I do eat my sweets but does anyone have suggestions as to a diet that would work so I would not get another attack..Doctor's are hesitant to do surgery but I live in fear..and I take Miralax to ward off constipation...almost everyday..My doctor says that constipation is something I should avoid..Right now I am on day 5 of Cipro and still feel discomfort..No fever though..
