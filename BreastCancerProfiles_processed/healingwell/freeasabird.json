    "Content": " Hello Everyone, \nI wanted to post this, as all the information I found on my own, online, about\n Core Needle Biopsy's were horrendous! Anxiously, I visited the Breast Care Center today and had the biopsy preformed. The hardest part is not knowing what to expect. \nAs someone that hates needles, Honestly, I didn't even feel the numbing agent go into the tissue. When they took three samples with the core needle, all I could feel was a pressure, but nothing painful. There were two people in the room assisting- \nIf you are about\n to have a Core Biopsy, don't fret- it's a piece of cake! \nBest of luck to you! ",
