    "Content": " I had severe digestive problems on Arimedex so I was put on Femara. All was ok until 6 months ago when my joint pain was so severe, I thought I'd only be able to walk with a walker. Doctor took me off Femara and it was like a miracle. Within a few weeks, the pain was gone. Now I'm on Aromasin, this is my second month and I'm thinking about\n getting off. I agree, the quality of my life is worth a risk without these drugs. ",
