    "Content": " I found a lump over a week ago and went to my gp he examined me and told me that the lump iÂ  had was firoadenoma, and that I would have to have it cut out and he would write a letter to the breast clinic. I have been doing some research on what he told me i had but i want to know if just by feeling at the lump the dr can determine what the lump is or was he just easing my mind while i went to the breast clinic. the research i have done regarding this matter says that the lump can be moved when touched mine is moving no where and this is what is worrying me. anyone with previous fibroadenoma your comments would be grateful thankyou.
