      "Content": " i just recently had a biopsy and was told that it was just a intraductal noncancerous papiloma. i was fine until 6days later my breast felt alittle harder. but there isnt any bleeding at the inscision site the blood comes out of the nipple. Before i had the biopsy i had clear yellow sticky fluid coming out when i put warm soaks on it and massage the area. I am putting warm soaks on it now as well and applying pressure for 5mins just like they tell u to on the after care sheet. This is such a pain... i cant believe this is normal. Anyone have any advice im supposed to go meet with a breast surgeon at the request of the dr that did the biopsy, why is that necessary if she said she \"believes\" i will be ok and that its just a papiloma?
