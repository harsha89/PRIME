    "Content": " My daughter is 13 years old. She too had a lump it was blue and painful. She had an ultrasound done today we were told she had clusters of cysts a total of 4. I wasn't given much information just that she needed to see a surgeon. 2 of the cysts had debris in it I am extremely worried. I'm not finding much information on the internet for teenagers & cyst. I wasn't even aware she had anything until it began to hurt her. Apparently from what shese told me shese had it for years and she noticed it was getting larger. Please keep me updated on your daughters progress from one mother to another. ",
