    "Content": " pmedic, your story has totally relieved my fears! Thank you for writing about\n your experience! I'm 33 years old and was just diagnosed with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ). My surgeon is advising a double mastectomy with reconstruction. I have been totally freaking out and searched online for other women's stories. When I read yours, all my of fears were calmed down (a little lol!) Thank you so much for sharing. I would love to connect with you either via messaging or by phone. I think it would really help me to talk to someone who has gone through this since I have no idea what I'm in for. My email address is gogirlusa@yahoo.com....please message me if you feel up to sharing more of your story with me :) I have heard scary things but I am trying to keep your encouraging story in my mind.\n-Danielle ",
