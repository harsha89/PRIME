I already made a post \"just found out I have breast cancer\" earlier. Trying to keep my head on straight is taxing these days...lol...but I know I'm not the only one here that is struggling. This is a GREAT bunch of people with problems too. I found out today that I will have the mastectomy on my right breast Tuesday May 10 at noon. I have to get off Plavix for 6-7 days & I have an appointment with the heart Dr. Friday for more tests, then hopefully get it over & done with. Wish everyone else good luck in what they are going through.....Jan ",

      "Content": " Hi Jo-Ann, oh I was ready to go home when they discharged me (in my mind). The problem that sent me back was that I was anemic & my my blood pressure was extremely low. They ordered 4 units of blood, but because of my blood type (o-negative) could only get 2, so they gave me that...which helped. The good thing was I was back in the hospital..with the 2 drains, that slowed to nothing. The heart Drs. got the surgeon to remove them so they could do a heart cath, so I didn't have too much trouble with the drains. I do have diabetes & we were upset because it kept being over 300. I could not eat much ( in fact, had dropped to 101 lbs.) We were still trying to get them to get the insulin dosages right when I got discharged the second time. I \"think\" if you are not sick when you go in a hospital, it's a good chance you will be when you get out. All in all, I'm so very glad just to be home......Jan ",

I had it done Tuesday, & was discharged Wednesday. I would not have thought anything about\n this except Thursday night I had a heart attack & was admitted back in the hopital on the heart floor & the nurses there could not believe that I had had a mastectomy 2 days before & had gone home. The heart attack was cause by me being very low on blood, so after 5 more days in the hospital for that, I am now home dreading (but wanting) to get the staples out Wednesday.\nBest Wishes to Everyone !\nJan ",

      "Content": " MiaB & debbiR, thanks for your replys. I went over to the diabetes, heart disease, & arthritis board & having had these so long understood most of the meds, treatments, pains, etc.....almost feel like an \"expert\" over these things, but on the breast cancer board I am not understanding a thing (but hoping I will be here long enough to learn). Reading this board is like Greek nto me.I remember very little of what the Dr. said (I was too busy crying). I remember him saying something about what course Nancy Reagan took...my Husband was with me & the Dr. talked mostly to him. Speaking of my Husband, I am MOST Blessed to have him...we will be married 40 years May 19, the last 15 years I have been in a wheelchair & he has done everything,,,works full time, shops, cooks, keeps the house & yard up. Now that the RA has gotten so bad, he rolls & combs my hair, buttons my clothes...there is not a thing he has ever refused to do & has NEVER complained. We lived in La. when I had the bypass & he had to travel some in his job, so he got another job with no travel but it was in another state so we had to move away from our family,so he has no help with me. Did I say I have a Great Husband, I thank God for him every day. Is a \"port\" the same thing as an IV? If is is, that is the first thing they do to me is hook me up to one of those, & that is to me one of the most dreaded things about going to the hospital...they have a horrible time with me, they say my veins \"roll\", \"collapse\" & my veins are so small (I'm 108 lbs). I am going to try to check the book you reccomended out at the library, I usually don't want to know what the Dr. is going to do with me, but with this thing I think a little knowledge wouldn't hurt.
