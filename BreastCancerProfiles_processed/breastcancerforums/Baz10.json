      "Content": "Just watched a BBC report on breast cancer treatment which has been trialled over 10 years in the UK NHS. In place of weekly targetted radiotherapy post surgery it involves a single radiotherapy procedure during surgery, that's it no further radiotherapy is required. Apparently the 10 year trial results are so immensely encouraging that this procedure is being rolled out across the UK NHS by the end of this year. A spokeswaoman for Breast Cancer Research said this procedure is far superior in producing results and replaces weeks of treatment and allows the patients to get on with their lives as there are no visits required for weekly radiotherapy treatment.

The news report was based on a review by BMA (British Medical Association and Cancer Research UK) as was stated in the news report. It appears that you are referring to the US and not UK. I have revisited the news item and there is categorically no link between drug manufacturers and this report. The efficacy of this treatment appears to be very high, I assume for the selected recipients. I think it is wrong to infer that this applies to the US as it most definately does not in this case. The consultant and hospital stand by the results, and further please remember this treatment is carried out under our National Health Service which is a free to anyone at point of treatment government service, unlike the US or other parts of the world.

      "Content": "Watched on the ITV UK evening news a report on a new procedure for the treatment of breast cancer and as they stated it could be applicable to other forms of cancer. I'll condense the report as best I can This procedure requires a one day hospital stay, where the patient is given a shallow general anesthetic , chemotherapy drugs are introduced slowly intravenously injected.30 minutes after chemo is given, the specialist introduces a small diameter probe to the tumor or cancer sites(s) and commences passing a electrical current through the probe. As the report stated the electrical current apparently breaks down the resistance of the cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. Although it was not specific, seems that they mix some form of carrier into the chemo cocktail which carries the chemotherapy drugs directly to the site of the cancer. So it is targeted treatment which according to the report makes the chemotherapy drugs 8,000 times more effective than conventional general chemotherapy. In effect all the chemotherapy drugs given during this procedure are attracted to the area of the probe and the site it literally overwhelmed by the drugs. The report stated that within days all cancer cells are destroyed. As there is only 1 chemotherapy treatment given there are negligible side affects and generally the patient is discharged the same day. Apparently this procedure has Ben trialled and tested and will become the NHS first line of treatment for breast cancer and other forms of cancer. It showed a mother and daughter who had the hereditary gene where the mom had had previously 6 breast cancer occurences and following this procedure was pronounced cancer free, the daughter similarly after 1 procedure was given the same result. The report can be viewed ITV.com/news Heading Latest weapon in the treatment of breast cancer and other forms of cancer. It's definitely worth viewing and may give hope to this treatment being generally introduced within our NHS system in the UK Barry",

      "Content": "Not my forum but with reluctance I'm going to post this appallingly sad story. A friend of our daughter age 32 was diagnosed today with Breast Cancer with a spinal tumour and also a hip tumour. Married 3 years ago with a 14 month old child. For several months she went to her GP's with back ache and was prescribes NSAID's followed up by manipulation. 5 months ago it got worse to the extent she couldn't walk and had to use a wheelchair. She was given a MRI which the report stated was suspicious yet undefined and was sent home with paracetamol. Her symptoms rapidly got worse over recent days, her docs sent her to the Surgical assessment unit, where she sat in her wheelchair for some hours waiting to be examined. She was kept in overnight and had a CT scan this morning. This afternoon she was informed she has BC with a large spinal tumour and a further hip tumour. She is being kept in for a few more days while the specialists come up with a plan, but she was told she is stage IV so the options are limited. It took her 8 months to get to this stage. Her GP's sat on their (pardon) arses for months. The hospital never followed up the suspicious MRI. She didn't push her case and unfortunately accepted her doctors knew best. Well fact is they didn't. Typical and how do I know, her GP's are my GP's and my wife and daughters and grand kids. This folks is exactly why I will not ever accept at face value what they say. What the future holds for her I don't know, what I do know is this, she may not live to see her daughter grow up. This lack of care and yes diligence by the docs makes me furious as I hear so many similar examples. That's why I use the expression I kick the doors down and dont let the docs roll me over. Barry",

      "Content": "Kirsten, There was no intention on my part to be critical. It appeared that as you referred to the FDA thereby a wrong assumption by me. I think we come from differing perspectives, you professionally, I from a point of interest where a \"hopeful \" treatment regime is reported as being highly successful for the participants. To hopefully clarify, I'm not promoting this treatment just reporting, as I have no involvement or connection with any drug company, nor from a medical perspective. I believe your third paragraph is in essence what I posted. I'm sorry to hear of your moms prognosis. My wife's mom and then stepmom died from breast cancer also my sister in law has had long term breast frights which has developed into an auto immune disease (Polychondritis), she is one of three known cases in the UK and knows she is living on borrowed time. Wish your mom and your family the very best. Barry",

      "Content": "Watched on the ITV UK evening news a report on a new procedure for the treatment of breast cancer and as they stated it could be applicable to other forms of cancer. I'll condense the report as best I can This procedure requires a one day hospital stay, where the patient is given a shallow general anesthetic , chemotherapy drugs are introduced slowly intravenously injected.30 minutes after chemo is given, the specialist introduces a small diameter probe to the tumor or cancer sites(s) and commences passing a electrical current through the probe. As the report stated the electrical current apparently breaks down the resistance of the cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs. Although it was not specific, seems that they mix some form of carrier into the chemo cocktail which carries the chemotherapy drugs directly to the site of the cancer. So it is targeted treatment which according to the report makes the chemotherapy drugs 8,000 times more effective than conventional general chemotherapy. In effect all the chemotherapy drugs given during this procedure are attracted to the area of the probe and the site it literally overwhelmed by the drugs. The report stated that within days all cancer cells are destroyed. As there is only 1 chemotherapy treatment given there are negligible side affects and generally the patient is discharged the same day. Apparently this procedure has Ben trialled and tested and will become the NHS first line of treatment for breast cancer and other forms of cancer. It showed a mother and daughter who had the hereditary gene where the mom had had previously 6 breast cancer occurences and following this procedure was pronounced cancer free, the daughter similarly after 1 procedure was given the same result. The report can be viewed ITV.com/news Heading Latest weapon in the treatment of breast cancer and other forms of cancer. It's definitely worth viewing and may give hope to this treatment being generally introduced within our NHS system in the UK Barry",

      "Content": "Update as of today which had us all in tears and I've only met her and hips and on two occasions. There is no possibility of treatment for \"cure\", work that one out if you can. possibility of steroids they say or hormone combination whatever this is. Apart from this they (the docs) are negotiation between themselves on what to tackle first, given it is also in the rib cage and sternum. Pardon but yes I know it's close to home, but many patients have said its about time our local GP's stopped farting about and did their bloody jobs instead of dishing our paracetomol etc. Even the hospital doctors and surgeons in know have said categorically that the reason they are under such pressure is \"GP's don't diagnose any longer. They mess about with assumptions for ages and when the medication doesn't work they refer to A&E or a consultant. By that time months have passed. This seems a classic case of Take two paracetomol four times a day and if you don't improve come back in a couple of weeks and we'll try NSAID's. Don't worry the pain in your ribs must be a strain and do you carry your toddler a lot, well there is the answer to your back problem. Ohh you can't walk because of the pain, we will refer you for physiotherapy, are you OK for getting there in the car and your wheelchair. I'm sorry it isn't getting better we will try stronger medication. In desperation they go to A&E who send her out with more paracetomol having done no X-rays or scan. Her doctor finally makes a referral to SAU (Surgical assessment unit) wher she waits 5 hours in he wheelchair before being seen. Then more delay as they can't find a bed for her. Finally a bed is found but asits a Saturday and O consultants work on a weekend she is given IV morphine, kept in bed till Monday when a CT scan and MRI is finally booked. Monday night at 8pm, I'm terribly sorry to tell you it is cancer and it is stage IV. This bleeding fiasco went on for 8 months to a point now where she knows it is incurable. I better not say anymore as you could boil a pan of water on my head in 30 seconds I am so furious and I've got to see the same GP's tomorrow. Barry",

      "Content": "Kirsten, There was no intention on my part to be critical. It appeared that as you referred to the FDA thereby a wrong assumption by me. I think we come from differing perspectives, you professionally, I from a point of interest where a \"hopeful \" treatment regime is reported as being highly successful for the participants. To hopefully clarify, I'm not promoting this treatment just reporting, as I have no involvement or connection with any drug company, nor from a medical perspective. I believe your third paragraph is in essence what I posted. I'm sorry to hear of your moms prognosis. My wife's mom and then stepmom died from breast cancer also my sister in law has had long term breast frights which has developed into an auto immune disease (Polychondritis), she is one of three known cases in the UK and knows she is living on borrowed time. Wish your mom and your family the very best. Barry",

      "Content": "Positive thinker, That's a double whammy for sure, If the rectal cancer is confirmed stage II then it has not metastised and unless the are other unknowns then stage II is eminently curable, I use the word curable. Which raises the question of if in 11 you had a single polyp removed which left you with a clean colon where has the stage II come from. Has it originated from another polyp or is it inside the colonic wall. This frankly is puzzling given the diagnosis of breast cancer as well. Good luck Barry",
