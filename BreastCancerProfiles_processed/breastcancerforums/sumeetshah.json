If its very hard, and deep in tissue, and if you can feel, the rest of the breast is soft, they I am worried. Do consult your doctor as soon as possible. I would advise a mammogram (which is a special type of Xray of the breast), and an FNAC or core biopsy from the lesion (where they put in a needle, and get some tissue from the lesion and send to pathologist, for diagnosis). But before jumping onto conclusions, let your doc have a look. It may not be what we are suspecting.",

      "Content": "There is a lot of interest generated by cyberknife. Cyberknife and its related products are more for metastatic cancers than for treatment of any primary tumour. Like for example, a patient of breast cancer develops a secondary in the brain. Brain secondaries cause a lot of symptoms. And it is difficult to operate on same, especially if the tumour are multiple (where surgery is not possible, and conventional radiation therapy takes multiple sessions and results are not that good). With cyberknife, those secondaries can be targeted, with minimal loss of surrounding tissue, and render a patient symptom free. For the same brain mets, we would give palliative radiation therapy Cyberknife, as of now, is NOT indicated for primary surgery of breast at all. It is being tried in those areas where surgery is difficult, and for stage 4 disease, where surgery is to be avoided. As for your question on whether it helps and avoids complications of chemo, the answer is a strong NO. Because, cyberknife is only a 'local' therapy. It can never replace chemotherapy which is a 'systemic' therapy. The aim of chemotherapy is to destroy all cancer cells circulating in the system. The newer chemotherapy regimes have fewer side effects, and have excellent results.",

After axillary surgery, it is common to have altered sensation on inner side of arm, sometimes it feels like pain, sometimes it feels like the arm feels 'heavy' etc. These tend to settle over a period of time.

If the lesion from the breast turns out to be a cancer; whether the nodes have cancer or not is not going to change management. If they are enlarged and clinically felt, a complete axillary clearance is done. So do not worry that your radiologist did not biopsy those nodes. Let the report of the biopsy from the lesion in the breast come and then it will be decision time.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gott April 5th, my breast started getting painful and sore. The next day I found a golf size ball lump in the same spot and in the same breast. April 7 the lump/mass got even bigger and turned in to an oblong shape about 3\"x5\". It is painful just like the one in Dec. The symptoms which you mention seem more in favour of an infective pathology and not a cancer. Besides, most breast cancers, rarely if ever, produce pain and redness (except inflammatory breast cancer). So I suggest, you visit your doctor and let him/her assess and opine.",

When we are fighting cancer, there are times, when we just run out of available treatments, and just have to accept that we can fight it no longer. But we can definitely ensure, that whatever days our beloved has, we can make that special. Everything that she ever liked. Past family albums, reviving good old memories. Spending as much time with them as possible. Most important is that, I believe, the sufferer should know that time is limited (many may not agree with me, but I feel they should know), which initially will make the patient depressed, but within a few days, they accept it and face it bravely. The most important is to keep the patient symptom free. Brain tumours tend to have unacceptable symptoms, including convulsions, and they should be tackled aggressively. Hold your Dad's hand, and face it together. I always tell my patient, that about a 1 an 9 or 1 and 10 ladies are going to get breast cancer. Your are that 1 in 9, so it implies, you have saved the other 8 from getting breast cancer, and that's a noble job by all means. I hope you get the point.",

Nevertheless, if the sites of spread are limited, then chemotherapy may definitely be of benefit. When you say cancer in the 'stomach', I guess you mean 'abdomen'? Go ahead with treatment and pray.

      "Content": "Hi Brandy, I will try to clarify a few things: 1. Since the nodes showed metastatic deposits, it is essential to do an axillary surgery to clear the axilla of all nodes. 2. Yours is a breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy). All patients who undergo lumpectomy also need radiation therpay, basically to decrease the chances of the cancer coming back in the same breast. 3. Any 'node positive cancer' needs chemotherapy 4. Depending on results of receptors, hormonal therapy will be planned. My advice: I can understand the anxiety you must be passing through, now. All of us are worried by the word 'chemotherapy'. We think of loss of hair, vomiting and other side effects. But believe me, the present molecules do not cause as much side effects as before ten years. And these side effects are easily controlled. So a few days after your every chemo cycle, you will be back to normal, do not worry. Radiation by itself, does not cause any pain or such. It is just cumbersome, to daily go and sit through the sessions. Think of your daughters, go to your doctor and tell him that I have to live for them, I am willing to fight, treat the way you have to. Time will fly, and soon you will be cancer free, dont worry. You might want to read up how we plan treatment here on my page: http://www.breastcancerindia.net/bc/bc/treatment.html",

Other hormonal agents do not function with a functioning ovary, so that cannot be given now. After 5 yrs of tamoxifen, if menopause occurs, you can switch over to Letrozole.
