    "Content": "Hi I was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer, had the lumpectomy healed well then after a flight, a small pinhol appeared under my breast at the incision site, My breast Dr was unconcerned and told me to put a sterile pad on it. The next day I was scheduled for chemo(one of the .05 tmors was non estrogen receptive) when the oncologist looked at my breast she said it was infected , had me put on iv vanco for 3 days 2 hrs a day then oral antibiotics, incision still leaking, she said she wouldnt start chemo til it was healed, I understand that. My breast suregeon and her had a talk and the oncologist asked her to pull out what clots and blood were still inside the breast, and pack it, sent me home to pack this tiny incision myself twice a day for 1 week. extremely painful I might add, my 8 week ideal date to start chemo is less than 2 weeks away, can anyone tell me if they had this problem? does any of this make sense? Im getting very frustrated at the time this is all taking, and questioning if the packing and therefore leaving the wound open could possibly make it heal faster, any one have this problem?",
