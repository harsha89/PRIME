      "Content": "Love the name but so sorry for you to be here. I had colon so no neoadjuvant treatment but maybe you should jump into the CRC forum as you will gelt a lot of support there for that. You may need to post in the BC forum but that is not as historically active. Have you ever been tested genetically? There are genes now they know that shows your predisposition to certain cancers. You may want to discuss this with your doctors and see if that is the case. I hope your BC is early stage too and you will get through treatment and become cancer free. It is extremely possible. Good luck, Allen",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of all that you have been through. It must have really been a downer when they told you it wasn't treatable. I'm not sure I understand you completely. Do you have metastatic breast cancer? Which is it started I the breast and spread to the other parts of your body. Or, do you have different primaries? One being breast cancer and the other being bone cancer as it was on your spine. If metastatic, the treatment for those is the same as for the original. The cell structure of the spread would be the same as the breast cancer so the chemo's that work for breast cancer would kill those satellite tumors with possible radiation. If you had breast cancer and bone, they would have to treat it with different chemo's as what works,on one cancer might not even touch the other. Hopefully t was metastatic for you and it is easier to find one chemo which will eradicate all cells circulating throughout your body. Either one, I hope the treatments were fairly manageable as far as side effects and they are eventually able to get rid of any remaining cells that you may have floating around your body. Good luck, Allen",
