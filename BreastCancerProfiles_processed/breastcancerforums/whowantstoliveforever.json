      "Content": "I am an very young person (18 years now),but i try to understand this world from another point of view (philosophy view) I need a good advice from you: My mother had breast cancer (2001 or so),she had chemo and all that stuff,big pain,emotions that i cant understand( and don't want to).....and all that things your probably experienced alone. Sure as son of her i was in that sorry all the time,watching my mother without hear,family problems,but thanks to god she is alive,and psychically ok. Now i started an student life(uni),but i noticed my mother is again without hair(i sow her with an hair band but dint wanted to ask her why is she again without hair) ,she is not so happy,and when she talks she has always that liquid,like smokers have or sickness you get when its cold outside,i heard that some scan shows something on her liver,but i dont know what it could be. (i am not sure about all this \"symptoms\" should they mean something,ok, hairless means something but...) This is my problem: i don't know what is best for her and for me:should i ask her exactly what is with her,i am scared bad news will affect my university,and i am not sure does she want me anything to know about it,my father doesn't tell me anything bad,everytime i ask about her healthy,she says its going somehow child,her face doesn't give an impression like \" i am dieing\". Is it possible to go to the hospital where my mother is threated,and as her son, ask for imformation about her status (and if i have that right, should i make that,is it clever for my psyche) This letter might appear as unemotional,i am an very emotional person,but the thing is what do i get if i think about it too much,i can just blow my university,and that means blow my life,and the question is does really my mother that wants)but yes i am more than just interested of her really status.I just dont know how will i watch her,loosing weight and loosing her mind if she has liver cancer and it starts to grow One thing i have to say to this community:Let it be (Beatles),if our dearest die don't worry we will soon follow them and be together again. (as my mother everytime says: be patient son be patient)",
