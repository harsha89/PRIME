Also, I read that Johanna Budwig successfully treated cancer with flax seed oil and cottage cheese. The Omega 3 in the flax seed oil and the Omega 6 in the cottage cheese helped increase the oxygen and cancer occurs in an oxygen poor environment so increasing the oxygen is a good thing. There are other things you can do. Jason Winters tea is a good tea to take and they have a website. Do a search. I hope this helps you. Cheryl",

Flaxseed oil and cottage cheese Six time nobel award nominated doctor says this essential nutrient combination actually prevents and cures cancer! by Robert Willner, M.D.,Ph.D. (author of \"The Cancer Solution\").
