      "Content": "Thank You. That will be a blessing for our family. Personally I didn't mind paying if I had to but I will explore the option presented. Just curious does anyone know who does have to pay the full price of breast cancer drugs? The price at that site were the lowest I could find for non-generics and yet still they are high. But if people can either claim from insurance or receive the drugs subsidised I wonder who exactly (apart from someone like msyelf who wouldn't otherwise have been aware of alternatives) pays full price?",

      "Content": "Hello I am new to this forum. Recently my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and because of no insurance it means paying for her treatment. I have looked high and low, asking for help from others and was recommended this forum by a friend. Femara is the treatment of choice for her. Has anyone any comments on its use vs armidex or aromasin? Reading up it seems that aromasin may be stronger... Finally, regarding cost I was recommended by my friend to try the website elitenetpharmacy.com to buy letrozole which is $140 there. However aromasin is only $120. Given this I am tempted to go for the aromasin. Has anyone tried both and can anyone say one is better than the other? Also can anyone recommend a cheaper source for either of these? Thank You in advance.",

The site my friend gave me has it for just $80 a box which is half what you are paying. I haven't ordered from there yet as I will follow your prior advice first but if you can't get it on insurance yourself I would look into there. expect an email from my mom",
