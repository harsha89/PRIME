    "Content": "See your gyn again and insist on a biopsy. That's the only way to get peace of mind, in my opinion. There are a number of things that could cause breast pain and long menstrual cycles. If it's any encouragement, a breast cancer would not affect your menstrual cycle, but a hormonal imbalance could cause both the irregular periods and the breast pain. Still, it's good to be concerned. Don't give up till you get an answer. Blessings, Jeanne",
