    "Content": "Hi, I am new here. Atlast, i confess this. I am so afraid to know the truth but do want to know whats going on with my body. On my right nipple, i have this seed-like thing stick on it, i cant say its a lump, cause it is not a lump. I just do not know how to describe it, i tried to search for the similiar image online, but i cant find one. I want to know if this thing im having is something bad. Because, i do not feel any lump, no pain, no niple discharge, basically no breast cancer symptom. My breasts arent big, not even an A size and i am 21 years old. Can someone help me with this. I ve been wondering about this for quite long already. I can say its growing, maybe only when i am stress(i dont know). I am so scared if its very dangerous.",
