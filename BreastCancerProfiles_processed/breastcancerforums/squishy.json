      "Content": "Thanks PO18guy and Dead Man. Yes, true about the cancer DX. I had mammo this morning and can find out between now and 4 days from now...if I have to wait 10 days then it's most likely nothing. I am praying for the nothing. What prompted my concern was actually real symptoms that are similar to others who were DX'd. I wasn't looking for something, which is why I haven't had one in 4 years. I HATE taking medication, let alone taking anything else that I'm told to....even went with no Tylenol 8 (hydrocodone?) or whatever after c-section because \"I can handle the pain.\" Whatever. I dealt with it. All that to say regarding the back: YES! I do feel that you pushy folks have convinced me I should see my PCP for a recommend. It just seems that if the pain radiates and does not let up (though I'm not in seizure territory at all) that it's a good sign of something more pressing. I would like to walk until I die, thank you very much. I seriously came into this forum because 1)I am truly concerned; 2) I do NOT like to self-diagnose but DO research; 3) wanted to find a crowd that understood that while we are not physicians (unless we are) we can still commiserate and hear from others of similar ilk so that we can feel supported...maybe make some decisions.....and, if we do have an outcome that is not \"healthy\" we can still remain for more support. I cannot tell you the night and day difference that this forum, however short, has made in this season of my life. So, THANK YOU all......if anything comes of anything I guess I'll let y'all know!",

      "Content": "Greetings! I was in a different forum for cancer, but found that certain people posted continuously to everyone and were quite emphatic, tore apart a post, and didn't offer constructive (or supportive) feedback. SO...I'm not saying I may say something that is wrong or offensive or seem to be presumptive, but simply: Please think about what I may be trying to say and respond to that...thank you. I also do not know if this is the correct forum so I guess the post will be moved if need be... So, I have had some pains in my lower back, for a very, very long time. I just thought it was me getting older, or maybe that I was out of shape...until I had MORE pain after running on the treadmill at the gym. It's lower back and then around the hips, sort of, and it's like an unclosed bracelet: doesn't hit the front or groin area at all. However, I kept going to the gym anyway because of diet and exercise . It doesn't sometimes hurt or hurt when I do X....I notice it from morning to night. About 9 months ago I started having some issues with a breast. I researched extensively and while traditional medical websites stated pain was not associated with BC, many anecdotal reports state otherwise, for those who it related to. I don't believe that retrospectively there was pain...after DX. I believe that people had pain, but were consistently dismissed, and after all the protocols and a DX, they came to understand that the pain was precisely where the cancer was: I don't call that retrospective association. Anyway, I continued to develop more potential issues so that I finally broke down and saw my GYN, who is new to me, and frankly he said all the things others said they say to my concerns. Fine. I am getting a 3D mammo tomorrow, but have the feeling that the results won't come in until a week or so, rather than immediately. Again, fine. My question is: would there be any potential way that any cancer can tie in from those two areas? This is not completely unfounded. Cancers run in my family. You name it, and it's probably surfaced: colon, stomach, breast, bone, blood.....and I've been completely immature about it all, thinking that because I know more it won't/can't happen to me. So, no need to cover that; I'm good . Thing is: Where do I begin? Aside from the female stuff, I simply want to get some analysis or review or I dunno, testing? Can I request that? I'm def not paranoid, just concerned. I'm 44, F, and have had 5 pregnancies: all sections, all BF kiddos.....the pain is not where the epidural was given, either. it's lower than that...\"could be\" muscular, but had dr administered PT, and with exercises, the pain never really went away. Thanks to whomever can provide some feedback.",

      "Content": "Dead man: LOL...thank you! Yes, I continue the abhorrent behavior, er uh...running on the treadmill. However, within reason. Other aerobic activities are similar, and for the record, I stopped doing the boot camp class with the additional weights (hell, I have enough weight of my own thank you very much). As it was, my brother, aged 46, just had the same back surgery. So, hooray for genetics. BOO!! I don't want to get it looked at, but I think you're right as is the mod.I will need to check that FIRST to alleviate THAT concern.

      "Content": "Thanks PO18guy and Dead Man. Yes, true about the cancer DX. I had mammo this morning and can find out between now and 4 days from now...if I have to wait 10 days then it's most likely nothing. I am praying for the nothing. What prompted my concern was actually real symptoms that are similar to others who were DX'd. I wasn't looking for something, which is why I haven't had one in 4 years. I HATE taking medication, let alone taking anything else that I'm told to....even went with no Tylenol 8 (hydrocodone?) or whatever after c-section because \"I can handle the pain.\" Whatever. I dealt with it. All that to say regarding the back: YES! I do feel that you pushy folks have convinced me I should see my PCP for a recommend. It just seems that if the pain radiates and does not let up (though I'm not in seizure territory at all) that it's a good sign of something more pressing. I would like to walk until I die, thank you very much. I seriously came into this forum because 1)I am truly concerned; 2) I do NOT like to self-diagnose but DO research; 3) wanted to find a crowd that understood that while we are not physicians (unless we are) we can still commiserate and hear from others of similar ilk so that we can feel supported...maybe make some decisions.....and, if we do have an outcome that is not \"healthy\" we can still remain for more support. I cannot tell you the night and day difference that this forum, however short, has made in this season of my life. So, THANK YOU all......if anything comes of anything I guess I'll let y'all know!",

      "Content": "Greetings! I was in a different forum for cancer, but found that certain people posted continuously to everyone and were quite emphatic, tore apart a post, and didn't offer constructive (or supportive) feedback. SO...I'm not saying I may say something that is wrong or offensive or seem to be presumptive, but simply: Please think about what I may be trying to say and respond to that...thank you. I also do not know if this is the correct forum so I guess the post will be moved if need be... So, I have had some pains in my lower back, for a very, very long time. I just thought it was me getting older, or maybe that I was out of shape...until I had MORE pain after running on the treadmill at the gym. It's lower back and then around the hips, sort of, and it's like an unclosed bracelet: doesn't hit the front or groin area at all. However, I kept going to the gym anyway because of diet and exercise . It doesn't sometimes hurt or hurt when I do X....I notice it from morning to night. About 9 months ago I started having some issues with a breast. I researched extensively and while traditional medical websites stated pain was not associated with BC, many anecdotal reports state otherwise, for those who it related to. I don't believe that retrospectively there was pain...after DX. I believe that people had pain, but were consistently dismissed, and after all the protocols and a DX, they came to understand that the pain was precisely where the cancer was: I don't call that retrospective association. Anyway, I continued to develop more potential issues so that I finally broke down and saw my GYN, who is new to me, and frankly he said all the things others said they say to my concerns. Fine. I am getting a 3D mammo tomorrow, but have the feeling that the results won't come in until a week or so, rather than immediately. Again, fine. My question is: would there be any potential way that any cancer can tie in from those two areas? This is not completely unfounded. Cancers run in my family. You name it, and it's probably surfaced: colon, stomach, breast, bone, blood.....and I've been completely immature about it all, thinking that because I know more it won't/can't happen to me. So, no need to cover that; I'm good . Thing is: Where do I begin? Aside from the female stuff, I simply want to get some analysis or review or I dunno, testing? Can I request that? I'm def not paranoid, just concerned. I'm 44, F, and have had 5 pregnancies: all sections, all BF kiddos.....the pain is not where the epidural was given, either. it's lower than that...\"could be\" muscular, but had dr administered PT, and with exercises, the pain never really went away. Thanks to whomever can provide some feedback.",

It just seems that if the pain radiates and does not let up (though I'm not in seizure territory at all) that it's a good sign of something more pressing. I would like to walk until I die, thank you very much. I seriously came into this forum because 1)I am truly concerned; 2) I do NOT like to self-diagnose but DO research; 3) wanted to find a crowd that understood that while we are not physicians (unless we are) we can still commiserate and hear from others of similar ilk so that we can feel supported...maybe make some decisions.....and, if we do have an outcome that is not \"healthy\" we can still remain for more support. I cannot tell you the night and day difference that this forum, however short, has made in this season of my life. So, THANK YOU all......if anything comes of anything I guess I'll let y'all know!",

      "Content": "Greetings! I was in a different forum for cancer, but found that certain people posted continuously to everyone and were quite emphatic, tore apart a post, and didn't offer constructive (or supportive) feedback. SO...I'm not saying I may say something that is wrong or offensive or seem to be presumptive, but simply: Please think about what I may be trying to say and respond to that...thank you. I also do not know if this is the correct forum so I guess the post will be moved if need be... So, I have had some pains in my lower back, for a very, very long time. I just thought it was me getting older, or maybe that I was out of shape...until I had MORE pain after running on the treadmill at the gym. It's lower back and then around the hips, sort of, and it's like an unclosed bracelet: doesn't hit the front or groin area at all. However, I kept going to the gym anyway because of diet and exercise . It doesn't sometimes hurt or hurt when I do X....I notice it from morning to night. About 9 months ago I started having some issues with a breast. I researched extensively and while traditional medical websites stated pain was not associated with BC, many anecdotal reports state otherwise, for those who it related to. I don't believe that retrospectively there was pain...after DX. I believe that people had pain, but were consistently dismissed, and after all the protocols and a DX, they came to understand that the pain was precisely where the cancer was: I don't call that retrospective association. Anyway, I continued to develop more potential issues so that I finally broke down and saw my GYN, who is new to me, and frankly he said all the things others said they say to my concerns. Fine. I am getting a 3D mammo tomorrow, but have the feeling that the results won't come in until a week or so, rather than immediately. Again, fine. My question is: would there be any potential way that any cancer can tie in from those two areas? This is not completely unfounded. Cancers run in my family. You name it, and it's probably surfaced: colon, stomach, breast, bone, blood.....and I've been completely immature about it all, thinking that because I know more it won't/can't happen to me. So, no need to cover that; I'm good . Thing is: Where do I begin? Aside from the female stuff, I simply want to get some analysis or review or I dunno, testing? Can I request that? I'm def not paranoid, just concerned. I'm 44, F, and have had 5 pregnancies: all sections, all BF kiddos.....the pain is not where the epidural was given, either. it's lower than that...\"could be\" muscular, but had dr administered PT, and with exercises, the pain never really went away. Thanks to whomever can provide some feedback.",
