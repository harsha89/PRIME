    "Content": "Sooo my surgeon is wanting to remove the lump from my breast in June. I was wondering if anyone had any advice about how to cover up the scar, and how to relieve the soreness that my mother in law says will be awful for a few days. I also feel a bit overwhelmed.... There were only a few biological family members that I knew of with breast cancer. Two of them were on my mothers side ( two female cousins who both passed away), and two aunts on my dad's side (one of them just passed away). I asked one my aunts if there were any more with breast cancer; expecting to hear that there weren't any more, only to hear that there were six more with breast cancer (five biological aunts, and one biological cousin once removed).",
