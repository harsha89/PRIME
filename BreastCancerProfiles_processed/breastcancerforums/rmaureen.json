It can be a real struggle in making a decision on such a dilemma like you were faced with; but I think its good to be with your mother during this time. There is certainly no easy to answer to these things. I lost my aunt to breast cancer, it was diagnosed about five months after she had a mammogram. My heart really goes out to you, and you and your mom are in my thoughts and prayers.",
