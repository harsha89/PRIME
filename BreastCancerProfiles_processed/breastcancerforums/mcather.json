My youngest brother died of colon cancer at 54, other younger brother had prostate cancer and lung cancer, died of pulmonary embolism, father died at 63 of pancreatic cancer-- all were heavy heavy smokers. i quit 12 years ago. Start chemo in 2 weeks. Everything points to beating it, from what I've read. haven't met another guy with this breast cancer yet. mcather",

Are you at a good place getting treatments where docs deal with a lot of breast cancers? I don't know much about male vs female variants. But I know that cancer can grow in any cells that have DNA. They did take out 19 lymph nodes and all were clean. mcather",
