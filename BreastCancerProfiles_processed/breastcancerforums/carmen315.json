      "Content": "First, let me apologize for being one of those not yet diagnosed posters. I know you are not doctors and can't tell me what I have or don't have. Over the past week, I've talked to 3 different doctors, visited countless forums, and still feel so confused. I feel like I'm freaking myself out. As a PhD candidate in psychology, I keep thinking I'm a role model for hypochondriasis but I know my symptoms are real, I just don't know how severe. A couple of months ago I felt a strange painful twinge in my armpit (axillary) area and thought it must be from lifting weights. The pain in my armpit became constant and I realized it was my lymph node when it became swollen. I was feeling a strange exhaustion and assumed it was from graduate school work load. I began to suspect it was hypothyroid and ended up going to an endo who did tests and I found out I was not only hypothyroid but also had Hashimoto's disease. I figured that the pain in my armpit and exhaustion would go away once I started on the medicine the doctor gave me. Fast forward to this past two weeks. Both of my armpits were painful. The pain is now in my left shoulder, left chest area near my clavicle, in my left shoulder blade and my left arm is tingly. I went to one doctor who diagnosed me with lymphadenopathy and lymphadenitis. He prescribed vicodin and antibiotics. Blood tests and chest x-ray were normal. He mentioned lymphoma. Yesterday the pain got so bad in my chest I went to the ER. EKG and second chest x-ray were normal and the doctor said she suspected breast cancer. She referred me to an OB/GYN for a mammogram. She also said, \"I don't want to freak you out. Don't stay up late at night thinking about this.\" Which is exactly what I'm doing. I made an appointment with the OB/GYN for a mammogram for tomorrow. What should I ask him? What other tests do I need to do? I don't think I have BC or lymphoma based on the research I've done. Did anyone else experience these types of symptoms? My aunt literally passed away last month of BC. She passed a month after learning about it. She said she had never felt any pain. It had already spread to her bones and muscle and even broken her back without even knowing. She was 59. The fact that I might have BC never even occurred to me based on what my aunt went through. Thanks so much for your time and best wishes for you all!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Didee Hi there. I am so sorry you are going through all this. It is such a horrendous time not knowing as tests are done and a diagnosis, if any, is made. All the what ifs just run amuck in our heads. We can all empathise with that one. You are doing the right thing getting the tests to see what is wrong. Comparing symptoms though is pretty useless as so many are also symptoms of other things much less serious than cancer. Googling symptoms too can just make us freak out more. The time to research is after you have been given a firm diagnosis. Google well then, sticking to reputable medical sites so you can become informed as much as possible. Write down any questions you may have and take them to any appointments you have. That way nothing will be missed. In my opinion, if nothing much turns up on the mammogram I would ask for a CT scan which should then hopefully put your fears to rest. Good luck and best wishes. Thanks, Didee. You're right. I'll find out soon enough with all these tests I'm going through. I will ask for a CT scan like you recommend although I don't look forward to paying for it. As I'm sure many here are aware, the costs are definitely already adding up but it's worth it knowing for sure what's going on. Part of me hopes I find out that there's a reason for this pain, but part of me is afraid of what it is or that it's all in my head. Deep down, I guess I think I'm making too big a deal of it. Best wishes to you! - Carmen",

      "Content": "Well I had my appointment today. The doctor found a lump in my right armpit that is about a quarter size. That's not even the side I was having pain. The left side has a few other lumps. Cysts? I thought I'd have the mammogram today but it's actually tomorrow. They'll be doing a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. In the meantime, I'm on vicodin because the pain is so awful. I think the doctor is a little concerned about uterine issues as he also scheduled me for a uterine ultrasound. So much information but nothing for sure. It's driving me crazy!",
