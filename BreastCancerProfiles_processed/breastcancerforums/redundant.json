    "Content": "Hello all, here is the pertinent information first: Age: 29 Diagnosis: undetermined Markers: her mother had breast cancer and proceeded to have a double mastectomy I am a newcomer to this subject as my family personally does not have any history, but recently my fiancee felt a lump in her breasts and due to her family disposition, we decided to scheduler her a mammogram. Unfortunately the mammogram was inconclusive due to the extreme density of her breasts, and we proceeded to schedule an ultrasound in an attempt to gain at least some sort of information. Thankfully, she was able to get an ultrasound today but upon finishing up the procedure, the technician informed her that the sonogram was really dense and that she could not notice anything. I understand that technicians aren't really trained to read the results, but everything that I have read on this subject stated that the ultrasound would be the least invasive method to diagnose her lump. My question is, have any of you all ever heard of this sort of instance? In her rush to get an ultrasound she simply chose any facility that had an opening, and I am worried that the technician did not perform the procedure correctly. Understandably we are very worried and would appreciate any information that you guys have to offer. Thank you so much!",
