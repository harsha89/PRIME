I previously had DCIS in 2005 when I had a lumpectomy and 4 weeks of radiotherapy. It was a big blow when this happened a second time. I was 36 years old the first time, I'm now 40 and wasn't expecting this. I had a mastectomy in December and sentinel node biopsy which showed cancer in it. However when they then took out the the rest of my lymph nodes it showed that they were clear. I go to hospital today for my pre assessment before i start chemo on Wednesday for 6 months. I have to say I'm dreading it. I'm also having a prophilactic mastectomy on the other breast after the treatment finishes as they say I have an increased chance of a new cancer starting in the other breast. After going through hell waiting between tests and results, I don't want to be worrying between mammograms for the possible chance of it happening again. I will have reconstruction at the same time. You will be fine and I hope everything goes well for you. My thoughts are with you x",

I noticed over the last three to four months that the breast concerned was getting smaller and a slight puckering. I had my mammogram last week and received a letter saying they have found a small abnormality. I feel devastated. I go to see the consultant on Tuesday for a chat and then on Wednesday for a scan and possible biospy. Has anyone else been in a similar position?

He said I need to have a sentinel node biopsy on 15th December and then the mastectomy on the 16th. Depending on what comes back from the tests will depend if I need chemo. He said the intention is for cure but recommended a double mastectomy (not at the same time) with having it a second time. Its a shock but I know other people have experienced the same and hopefully everything will get sorted. Thanks for your support xxx",

Around about July time I noticed that the breast affected looked slightly smaller but put it down to the scar tissue/healing process. However more recently the skin underneath looked puckered. I went for my mammogram last week and have to go for a chat with the consultant who said they had found a small abnormality tomorrow and then for scan and possible biopsy on Wednesday. I'm terrified that the 4 month period has allowed things to happen. I can't think straight and feel sick all the time. Its horrible. I'm imagining all sorts.",

      "Content": "Hiya I haven't been on the forum since November 2009 when I first mentioned my worry about an abnormal mammogram. I had DCIS in 2005 with lumpectomy and radiotherapy. I was worried about a recurrence. Well it wasnt a recurrence as such. It was a new primary tumour 2cm. I had a mastectomy in December and they did the sentinel node biopsy which showed cancer, therefore I went back in last week for lymph node removal. Not pleasant. Got results yesterday and thankfully there was 12 removed with none positive. I start chemo in 2 weeks time, FEC and Docetaxel over 6 months. When I read the side effects, its quite frightening. I just wondered if anyone has had this combination and how they found it. Incidentally I'm having the other breast removed once treatment is over as I am at a high risk of recurrence in the healthy breast having already had two breast cancers in the same breast and I'm only 40. I look forward to any helpful suggestions",

I am 40, was diagnosed with DCIS in November 2005, had a lumpectomy and 4 weeks of radiatherapy. I wasn't told anything about how my breast could possibly change. I have noticed over the last 4 months that my breast affected by DCIS has shrunk quite a bit which has shocked me and it feels very lumpy tender. I can't say I have noticed it before and has started worrying me. Incidentally I went for my yearly mammogram yesterday and hopefully results will be okay, but I just wondered if anyone else has suffered similar symptoms. Thanks again",
