      "Content": "After speaking with 2 surgical oncologists, I was advised by both that a mastectomy of the cancerous breast is the only option given the size of my tumor. After a lot of discussion, thought, and fear of ever dealing with breast cancer again, I have decided that a double mastectomy is the safest choice. At 32 my chances of having breast cancer again is about 60%. With a double mastectomy it's about 5%. It's still unreal sometimes, but I have my surgery scheduled for May 1st. My mother thinks I made this decision too quickly. Did I? Am I allowing my fear to dictate this decision, or am I being smart for making sure that I will live a healthy, cancer free life?",

A week and a half after surgery I'm barelynfeeling any pain. The one thing I'm having a bit of a hard time with is the loss of sensation in them. I can't really touch them just yet. I read that this was common and in time it will get easier and also the sensation will return. So be prepared for the 'weirdness'.

They took 3 lymph nodes and so far no cancer in any of them, however, the final results will come in sometime next week after a full detailed pathology. Survivor12, I can't begin to imagine having gone through so much at your age. You are an amazing, strong woman! I definitely understand your decision to opt for a double mastectomy if the cancer does come back. I really hope it won't though. Bookwriter, best of luck to you with this journey. I agree 100%, getting 2 matching ones is better than having one look a little different. I've seen pictures of both options, and though the PS does a great job matching the two, there is still a little difference visually. When are you having your surgery?",
