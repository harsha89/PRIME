    "Content": "I'm 33 years old and I felt a lump in my left breast several months ago and my gyno felt it, too. She sent me for an ultrasound. The tech couldn't find anything, so she sent me for a mammo. Nothing was reported on either test. Gyno referred me to a breast specialist, who I saw today. She looked at my mammo and ultrasound and gave me an exam. She felt where the lump is and said it's just fatty breast tissue and that \"I'm fine.\" She wasn't trying to make me feel dumb, but I left feeling that way. I asked her if I should get a biopsy, but she said she does this all day and that she knows what she's talking about. Should I get a 2nd opinion and push for a biopsy?!",
