    "Content": "I had treatment for breast cancer in 1988. In 2002 it reappeared on the same side (assumed to be new primary), and in 2004 it appeared on the other side (doctors undecided as to whether this was a new primary/secondary). I have been on Arimidex since May 2004, and Fosamax since October (early osteo. diagnosed). Since the Autumn I have had a mild but persistant pain in my coccyx. While on holiday in Thailand in Jan 06 I had a liver funtion test done which showed a raised alkaline phosphotase level (281 - normal range 20 - 110). I had an abdominal ultrasound done (all ok), and a bone scan done in the UK last week. I wont get the result of this for another 10 days, but I am really worried. I know alkaline phosphotase is used as a cancer marker, but could the raised level be due to the Arimidex or the Fosamax?
