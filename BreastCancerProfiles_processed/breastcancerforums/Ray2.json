    "Content": "Hi, I'm in remission from a 2nd round with Multiple Myeloma and my wife had a benign tumor (DCIS) mastectomy several years ago. Well, that's our introduction. She had a mammogram this week, then a biopsy; and learned there's another tumor and it's worse. That's all the information we've got till the coming week and more testing. This is sort of a silly question, but right now she is beating herself up about having stopped tamoxifen after 2 and a half years instead of 5. Any thoughts?",
