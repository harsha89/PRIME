They wanted to give her some IV chemical (don't know the name) drug to stop the bone itself from thinning any more than it already is. Two days after her first IV, she got an infection in her foot. Size of a football. Is this a common occurrence from such a toxic chemical? Anyone heard of such a thing?",
