      "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with reoccuring breast cancer about 3 yrs. ago. Her first bout was back in 1985. This time it was a tumor in her lung and she is being treated with Femora. When she was diagnosed the second time the doctors also saw very small spots in her brain, and were not sure what they were so they did radation just to be on the safe side. After 3 years on the Femora the tumor is shrinking away. The real side effect I have seen from all of this is my mom, who is 83, has gone from a woman weighing around 145 lbs. now down to about 112 lbs, got around really good with fairly good memory, to a woman who now just shuffles her feet when she walks, has a horrible memory, and I just can't believe in 3 years how she has gone down. Her doctor who I have complete faith in, has not really said much about her condition as far as her fraility. I am just wondering if her condition could be a long term result of the radation or the Fermora? She regulary has 3 month visits to her cancer doctor and also has a CT scan every six months. Thanks for any help or input. God Bless.",
