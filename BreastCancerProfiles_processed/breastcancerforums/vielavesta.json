      "Content": "UPDATE: Nancy went to the hospital last night, fairly reluctantly. Thankfully, we live just outside of Baltimore, so we have access to GBMC, which is affiliated with Johns Hopkins. Her nurse, after her initial exam, said to her, \"Nancy, we have two things in common. First, my name is also Nancy. Second, I'm a cancer survivor and you will be, too!\" In her health history, Nancy revealed that she found a lump two years ago and did nothing about it. Now, we are facing what is perhaps advanced breast cancer and wondering if her chronic cough indicates that the cancer has spread. Tests are being done today and hopefully, we will know more soon. I have many concerns, of course, and so many questions. We all just want answers... I am scared that her cough is, in fact, a sign that the cancer has spread. I am also concerned about her body. She will need a mastectomy, but it sounds as if her arm is also in jeopardy, as the cancer has been allowed to eat away at her underarm a great deal. Now it's just a waiting game to hear the test results and it's all very unsettling. It's so easy to speculate and so very hard to have to wait to hear if your worst fears are confirmed. I understand to some extent why she did nothing to be proactive about the lump. She claims that life just kept getting in the way. But it's just so far beyond my comprehension how she allowed this to go on for so long. I desperately want to be there for her but don't know how or what she needs... If anyone has advice, it would be much appreciated. Thank you again for your responses and for your thoughts and prayers. It seems that this is the worst case scenario but we all have an incredible amount of faith that Nancy will be able to fight this. Thanks again, Jayme",

      "Content": "Let me begin by saying that I don't have 100% of the information regarding my mother-in-law's symptoms. What I know is limited to what my father-in-law has told me today. I knew NOTHING of this before today. Also let me stress that my mother-in-law is NOT aware that the whole family knows about her fears that she has breast cancer, so we all feel that our hands are tied. But I would like some opinions because the information that I've found on the internet isn't fitting with her symptoms necessarily. And moreover, I just want to know how concerned we need to be... So this is what I do know. My mother-in-law has become completely reclusive. She has alienated herself from family gatherings and from the lives of her grandchildren. I have seen her twice in the past 8 months, whereas I used to see her weekly, at least. She has stopped teaching Sunday School, something that was very important to her. She is 52 years old; today is her birthday. As far as symptoms, she has had a very severe, persistent whooping cough for almost a year. Over the past month, she has started to vomit after every meal (not purging). She has weeping sore(s) on her breast(s) that have been growing in size - I do not know where/how many/type of discharge. There has been a very foul smell in her presence for several months and tonight, my father-in-law said that it was coming from her breast. It is extremely pungent to me, at least. I've sensed it the past couple times that I've seen her. She has NOT seen a doctor and these things have been going on for the better part of a year, beginning with the cough. I do not know if the cough is related, when the sores on the breast(s) developed, anything... I just know a few of the symptoms and that she is incredibly stubborn and fearful. She is convinced - whether she's researched online or not, I do not know - that she has breast cancer. And to everyone's frustration, she will not see a doctor. Apparently, she told my father-in-law that she would several times, but hasn't. In my opinion, he needs to carry the woman into the emergency room immediately, but he feels that it would betray her in some way, that she needs to go on her own accord. My immediate concerns/questions are: Does this sound like it could be cancer? Perhaps IBC if the secretion is coming from the nipple itself? And how can I tell her that I know about all of this and that she really must go see a doctor? I am so scared for her, and I'm feeling incredibly helpless and frustrated. I cannot even imagine how my father-in-law is feeling and, of course, I'm frustrated with him, too, for allowing this all to progress to the point that it has. Your advice/experience would be incredibly appreciated. Thank you! Jayme",

      "Content": "UPDATE: Nancy went to the hospital last night, fairly reluctantly. Thankfully, we live just outside of Baltimore, so we have access to GBMC, which is affiliated with Johns Hopkins. Her nurse, after her initial exam, said to her, \"Nancy, we have two things in common. First, my name is also Nancy. Second, I'm a cancer survivor and you will be, too!\" In her health history, Nancy revealed that she found a lump two years ago and did nothing about it. Now, we are facing what is perhaps advanced breast cancer and wondering if her chronic cough indicates that the cancer has spread. Tests are being done today and hopefully, we will know more soon. I have many concerns, of course, and so many questions. We all just want answers... I am scared that her cough is, in fact, a sign that the cancer has spread. I am also concerned about her body. She will need a mastectomy, but it sounds as if her arm is also in jeopardy, as the cancer has been allowed to eat away at her underarm a great deal. Now it's just a waiting game to hear the test results and it's all very unsettling. It's so easy to speculate and so very hard to have to wait to hear if your worst fears are confirmed. I understand to some extent why she did nothing to be proactive about the lump. She claims that life just kept getting in the way. But it's just so far beyond my comprehension how she allowed this to go on for so long. I desperately want to be there for her but don't know how or what she needs... If anyone has advice, it would be much appreciated. Thank you again for your responses and for your thoughts and prayers. It seems that this is the worst case scenario but we all have an incredible amount of faith that Nancy will be able to fight this. Thanks again, Jayme",
