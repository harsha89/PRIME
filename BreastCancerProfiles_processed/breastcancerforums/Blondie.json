      "Content": "Hi Sue and All, I am new here and I was delighted to find this site. We can all relate well to that dark cloud Sue but in time, it doesnt follow you quite as often. What we new as a normal life before breast cancer no longer exists so we have to move on eventually and create a new normal. In the fullness of time we don't allow cancer to consume us and the goal is to resume quality of life. I was diagnosed with ILC 6/99 with no node involvement. On 6/2002, I was diagnosed with ILC with no node involvement on the opposite breast as it mirrored itself. I absolutely agree with MuttsMom in that with or without nodes, no one can truly predict because there are many variables to a diagnosis sometimes so everyone is different but treatment indeed is the best line of defense. Right now your experiencing post traumatic stress which we can all relate so please know that your feelings are very normal. Remember to take things one day at a time and in the mean time, your doing great. Your reaching out for emotional support and healing emotionally is most important because when you heal emotionally, you not only survive but you start living again. Sending mega hugs.......",
