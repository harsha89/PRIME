      "Content": "My mother had a mastectomy 10 days ago. Path report says the tumor was 10 cm, 20 positive lymph nodes, estrogen-negative and HER-2-Neu positive. Surgeon said she is Stage III+. Pre-surgery CAT scan of her chest and abdomen + blood work indicate it has not spread to major organs and no sign of other tumors. She has not had a bone scan. Surgeon has recommended aggressive chemo + radiation. She met with Radiologist today for an intro appointment. Radiologist felt a lump in her remaining (right) breast. Says it feels like a cyst and recommending surgeon examines on Thursday when she has second drain tube removed (hopefully). Nothing showed on mammogram in right breast 1 month ago. Is it possible that the cancer could have spread and grown this much in just a month? Any thoughts on the cyst and her prognosis? Thank you.",

      "Content": "Susan, Thanks for your response and words of wisdom. Just a quick update to my original posting -- the lump the Radiologist felt in my mom's right breast was examined by her surgeon and he did not feel anything abnormal. He's going to examine her again in a month. The Oncologist got her bone scan report while we were in the office on Thursday. There were three areas of concern (spine, right femur and left rib area), but the Radiologist couldn't be conclusive on whether or not it was cancer. He said it could be arthritis, cancer, or something else (can't remember). After the Onc appt. we had to walk over to the hospital and have those areas x-rayed. Probably won't know those results until next week. The Onc did say that if there is cancer in the bones, then she will be Stage IV and can't be cured. She is still treatable, but he just couldn't ever prevent the cancer from returning. She starts chemo next Thursday; she'll have four cycles of Cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin via IV (every three weeks x 4). She'll have a week's break and then start treatment with Herceptin and Taxane on a weekly basis for a year (if it shows signs that it's working after the first few treatments). She'll be able to start the radiation treatments after the first four cycles of the Cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin. The radiation will be five times per week for six weeks. We're taking it one day at a time and hoping for the best. How long were you receiving Herceptin treatments? What kind of side effects did you experience? All the best to you for your continued good health and recovery. Auntie MO",
