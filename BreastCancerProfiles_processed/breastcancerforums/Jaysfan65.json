    "Content": "Hello everyone\u0085I\u0092\u0092m new to the board..I was diagnosed with breast cancer..confirmed on March 20. They told me it was DCIS which I felt positive about\u0085but then the surgeon said it was 6cm and that although the test showed DCIS..he was treating it like invasive cancer. That was okay, I\u0092d rather be safe than sorry. BUT now I am worrying about every little thing\u0085when I cough I think lung cancer\u0085.my shoulder hurts..I think bone cancer\u0085.is this normal ? I\u0092m definitely not a hypochondriac\u0085at least I never was. I\u0092m a healthy and active 48 year old. But I\u0092m starting to get freaked out.",
