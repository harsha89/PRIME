    "Content": "Hi everyone! I'm excited to meet everyone and learn more about this disease. I am a 28 year old male, current student, and former Marine. Unfortunately, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer on Friday, Mar 27. That same day she had to put my 17 year old Jack Russell Terrier, Pooky, down because she too had cancer. My mom still hasn't had a biopsy done, but she will be meeting with a surgeon (I think that's who it is) tomorrow, Monday, Mar 31. We don't know what stage she is yet, but the ultrasound showed roots reaching the lymph-nodes. My maternal side of the family has a history of breast cancer, with 0 survivors so far. Two months ago my mom got insured on Obamacare Platinum, with 94% coverage -- for whatever that means for this. I am very thankful for this because she is well below the poverty line. We are all very scared and fearful, but I am trying to be the voice of reason and action. She is very religious and considers her relationship with her Catholic priest to be as, if not more, important than action. My time on this postboard will be spent asking many questions and seeking answer to assist my mom in her coming fight. Questions like: 1) What should we ask the doctors if I go with her on appointments? 2) What is standard treatment, especially under new provisions under the Affordable Care Act? 3) What kind of emotional, and support roles should I play in the coming fight? I'm a Marine, and I prefer action, planning, and learning all the options before committing. You're help will be life changing for me, and in turn for my family and mother. Thanks so much for your time and support. Oscar O.",
