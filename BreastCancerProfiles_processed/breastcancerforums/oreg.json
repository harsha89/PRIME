      "Content": "Hello everyone, my mom had been treated with xeloda successfully for about a year, before it stopped working a year ago. Since then she used caelyx and navelbine, which worked just to some degree. One of the possibilities that are considered next is to return to xeloda, which proved itself. But I'm not sure if one year is enough before giving it another chance, since most of the cells haven't gone through a massive natural selection during this time. Does any of you have any experience with something similar? Or maybe you know if there's a phrase in the jargon which describes this act of returning to an old medicine, so I can get more details about it? Thanks a lot in advance! Ore.",
