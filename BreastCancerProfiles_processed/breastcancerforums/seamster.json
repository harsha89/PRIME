    "Content": "I had my last taxol treatment November 13 of 2011. Four months later, I am still dealing with the side effects. My fingernails (but not my toenails as of yet) are in various stages of turning white, black and lifting off. I have neuropathy in hands and feet and I think in my right thigh. After the taxol, I had a mastectomy at the end of December and now I have lymphedema in my right hand. Because of the extreme tenderness in my fingertips and now the swelling my in right hand, I slowly stopped using my right hand - fortunately I have been able to do as little as I do with my left hand. Here is the one bright spot in all of this. I only recently found that there are physical therapists who specialize in lymphedema. After two sessions I can see a decrease in the swelling, but I guess I'll be wearing a compression stocking and gauntlet till whenever. NOW, if I can only find someone who knows how to treat neuropathy, maybe things will start looking more positive. I am really concerned about my doctors who all deny any of their treatments are the reasons for my side effects. That is puzzling to me, and it makes me angry. I truthfully get more helpful advice and information from a couple of friends who are nurses. I'm glad to have found this forum so I can \"vent\". And it was a blessing to know I wasn't in this situation alone. I guess we should consider ourselves lucky that some of these drugs are available for our cancers. And this forum will help those coming after us to learn and to cope.",
