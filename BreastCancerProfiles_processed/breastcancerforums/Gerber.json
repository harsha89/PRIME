    "Content": "Hi, I'll probably show a lot of ignorance here, but I am trying to help a friend. Sorry - this is long. His wife is 34 years old, mother of two very young children, 2.5 years post diagnosis, stage 4 with mets to bones, lungs and liver. She had been on a number of different chemo regimens. She also sees a naturopath who gives her vitamin C infusions. She's not feeling great at the moment. Recently her naturopath doc sent her an email from Medicor Clinic in Toronto touting a side-effect free chemo. The idea being that they give a drug called Mesna to eliminate side effects of the chemo, which would be a high dose of the chemo Carboplatin. This was developed by Dr. Kenneth Matsurmua in the US and has just been brought to Canada. From what I can tell, it *could* work, but I'm not sure I see evidence of it. In their words: Typically, there is no hair loss, no infection/septicemia, no severe vomiting/diarrhea (temporary loss of appetite and nausea is possible), no mouth sores, and no drop in blood cell counts. The therapy is compatible with natural medicines (e.g. iv C between chemo doses). There is a much higher potential for remission than conventional chemotherapy (~ 90% response rate for advanced cases such as stage 3/4 breast, lung, colon or pancreatic cancer). Based on limited initial phase 2 data, there is a high chance of complete remission, including long-term remission lasting for years. Details are on the website. The therapy requires an initial telemedicine consultation with an oncologist on Dr. Matsumura\u2019s team, and then a visit to the Medicor office for infusions 3 days in a row every 2 weeks. Cost is approx. $4000 per treatment (per 2 weeks), and payment is made directly to Dr. Matsumura\u2019s cancer center (they reimburse us for infusion costs and supply us the drugs for each patient). It typically requires 8-10 treatments for best response, but results can often be assessed after 2-3 treatments. We have just started this therapy, and will be able to offer it more widely in the near future. Currently we are only offering it on a very limited basis. I am not sending this email to solicit patients, as we are not ready for a large number of patients yet. It is only to keep you informed. Our new website should be launched soon, and you will be able to get updated via Twitter from the new site. I couldn't find any clinical data so I emailed them: A friend has stage 4 breast cancer. Would she be eligible for the side effect free chemo? She has mets to her bones, lungs and liver but not brain. Oh, also I\u2019m trying to find something to document the ~90% response rate with remission rates. I want to tell others about this and the data would be very helpful. All I can find is anecdotal evidence on the site so far. I\u2019m probably looking in the wrong place. Response: The bone mets may be a problem. Is there a met in the femur near the hip? That can fracture during therapy requiring a hip replacement and although do-able, we are cautious about taking such patients because Safe Chemo works so rapidly, such fracture may occur more easily. Because we have really only a tiny amount of safe medicaments to treat only a handful of patients worldwide, we have embargoed the research report that if published will get headline news and the stampede that will happen will destroy our centers. We don't really try to persuade anyone to believe our statement and it is quite understandable if you do not. We are already inundated with patients who want to be treated and we already have to turn down so many. So, on the one hand, their caution about bone mets suggests they're responsible. On the other hand, why would any clinic in Canada have to charge for chemo? And why would they have only a tiny amount of the meds? On top of that, the second half of the email sound like a sales pitch \u2013 a stampede of people will destroy our centres. ??? Sort of a \u201cget in, get it now\u201d approach. My spidey sense doesn't like it, but is that valid?? I can't really find any review on the Medicor clinic in Toronto, or the place in the US, Berkeley Institute International, whose only \"product\" appears to be this treatment. Is there any value here? My friend's wife probably feels like she is running out of options and understandably is willing to try anything that could potentially be legit. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!",
