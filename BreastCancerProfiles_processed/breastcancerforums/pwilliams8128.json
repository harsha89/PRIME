Just last week, my mom was sitting up and talking, not eating much, but she tried. Friday she went to not eating at all, to sleeping all the time,she hasn't used the bathroom in three days, and now she doesn't open her eyes. I know that I have been trying to prepare myself for this, but this is the hardest thing. I find myself yelling at my kids and husband for laughing to loud or yelling while watching football, just doing the normal things that they usually do. I know that I am not the only one going through this, but sometimes I feel like it. This is happening way to fast. Any advice you can give , I will appreciate.",

I am sure you know much about this than I do, but the doctor actually diagnosed her with Pancreatic cancer, but said when they did the biopsy, the markers came back as breast cancer markers, which is also in her liver. Ironically, my husband reached out to comfort me today, and it made me feel whole lot better. Hospice has been involved for the last two weeks, and they are wonderful. It is just so hard, which I am sure it is the same for everybody. Today, the social worker came to discuss arrangements for the uninevitalble. After he left, my mom was turned sideways in her bed, and when I went to move her, she asked \"who is that? who is that, tell him I am already in church. I did read the hospice pamphlet \"Gone from my sight\" So I know it won't be long. I do take peace in knowing that we have had many long talks, laughs and good times. It still is so hard, but I know that she is tired and spiritually ready to leave us. Pat",

      "Content": "First of all, I want to say thanks to all who gave me some insight, on what to expect , and support during this very rough time. My mom passed away on the 14th of November at 0730. I was blessed to have a beautiful relationship with my mother, and even more blessed to be able to care for her during her illness. I came to this forum to get some knowledge of what to expect, but from day to day, as we dealt with this brutal cancer, I was still somewhat in denial, thinking I had more time. I remember when hospice came in and provided us with the hospital bed, and the bedside comode. My mom looked at the comode and said \"I don't need that\". Three weeks later, she had to be picked up to be placed on that same comode. One day I came home from work, and rushed up to her room with my pillow and blanket to sit for our daily discussion, and because of the long nights of tending to my mom, I unintentially fell asleep, little did I know that would be the last time I would hear her voice; from then on it was two blinks for yes, and one for no. Today it was a week that she has been gone, and I miss her so much. The one thing that I think about daily, is what she said to me about three weeks ago, as she took her medicine. She said \" wouldn't it be wonderful if I woke up in heaven tommorow, I would be shaking hands with all my family and friends\". She was spiritually ready, and she wanted me to know that. I was blessed to have her for as long as I did. To anyone that is beginning to deal with this, enjoy every second, every minute. My mom's name is Myrtle Vaultz , you can google her or go to NOLA, and read her obituary to get the short version of the beautiful life she lived To Rachel, you were right that it wouldn't be long, I took your advice and told my sisters to come sooner than they had planned, they came here on the tenth of November, and left on the thirteenth, my mom passed the next day.
