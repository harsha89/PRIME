LOL big smile I know I will be in the room for you, Nancy, at least spiritually. Wishing and praying for all good blessings to flow to you on the 14th. I know things are so rough for you right now.

      "Content": "Dry skin: A white petroleum based ointment, such as vaseline or aquaphor is best. However, it is very greasy. But if you can put it on at night, and then cover it up with gloves or socks etc., this is very helpful. Lots of water, at least 8 glasses for anyone with dry skin is good. Coffee, tea, & caffeinated sodas only count as 1/4 the liquid you drink, due to their diuretic properties. The dermatologist I used to work with also advocated only tepid water for showers, and Dove soap. The less one had to use any soap though, the better she felt. And, there was a doctor on Oprah (I am embarrased for admitting I get my medical news from Oprah , who said 2 baby aspirin a day help the skin as inflammation is decreased, wrinkling is decreased or delayed, etc. (hmmm, I don't know what to think about that, but this doctor was 'right on' about everything else he was saying.",

      "Content": "It is the Anesthesiologist who will make all the difference in terms of the after effects of any surgery. So talk to him/her. You will see him right before they take you into the operating room. There are very potent anti-nausea drugs out there now. There is minimal pain with a lumpectomy (you aren't have an axillary node dissection too, are you?). and the trick of any pain, is to take something for pain before you experience pain; as pain after surgery increases quickly; starting as a slight pulling or stretching and quickly exaccerbating to deep pain. After surgery, I took my pain pill as soon as I got home (make sure you have a little something on your stomach, or you will become nauseated); even though I wasn't experiencing pain. Then went to sleep. Took pain pills every 4 hours after that the first day. Gosh, listening to your life circumstances, it never rains but when it pours. How awful about your husband losing his job, the sale of your home, etc. You will have to take one day at a time, and not look to far into the future. Do what you can today, and then try not to worry (easier said then done, I know). Happy Easter many hugs let us know how things go Roxanne",

My oncologist felt it was nothing to be concerned about, and in any case, there was no further procedures to be done at this point, as these spots were too small to biopsy (NOTE: liver enzymes are fine, and I feel very healthy.......don't know if this is impt info, but thought it might be). The oncologist felt it would be a real surprise if my cancer (see vital stats below) would mets to the liver so quickly, and said it was probably cysts, as they are quite common (???? is this really true????) Should I be concerned? What is the next step for me? Any of you have this type of results? Thank you Roxanne",

      "Content": "Hi imadare6 I'm with you: how would they know if margins were clear? Although my surgeon, when I talked with him on phone, was absolutely positive when he took my tumor out, that the margins were clear.......... Guess if margins were not, they would have to start over. Take balloon out, and wait till re-excision and try again? I also agree with you that the 'hole' where tumor or calcifications were, would 'fill in' eventually. My guess is that this process starts almost immediately, and probably has most of the 'glue stuff' in place for further regeneration at about the 10 week mark. I know this happens with sentinel node biopsies. The accuracy diminishes if you have the biopsy after the lumpectomy, even if only 2 weeks has gone by. Not by a lot, but some. I hope you let me know what happens with you. I am crossing my fingers and saying my prayers that it all works out the way you would like. I will look up the site you told me about. I wonder, if my Radiologist could refer me to a place out of state? My cancer was 1.2 cm dense at the widest point, so from that stand point, I think I am eligible. I haven't had the sentinel node yet though, so will wait to hear the results from that. I also won't get the full path report back until tomorrow, so......before I can even think of my future, need to hear what that report has to say. I have to 'pace myself' . I always want to jump ahead about 3-6 months into the future, and guess this cancer journey is not like that for anyone; at least not in the acute phase of the journey. At this point, only know I have a 1.2 carcinoma which was in Right breast, 5 cm from nipple, and 1 c.m. deep. Roxanne",

But if you can put it on at night, and then cover it up with gloves or socks etc., this is very helpful. Lots of water, at least 8 glasses for anyone with dry skin is good. Coffee, tea, & caffeinated sodas only count as 1/4 the liquid you drink, due to their diuretic properties. The dermatologist I used to work with also advocated only tepid water for showers, and Dove soap. The less one had to use any soap though, the better she felt. And, there was a doctor on Oprah (I am embarrased for admitting I get my medical news from Oprah , who said 2 baby aspirin a day help the skin as inflammation is decreased, wrinkling is decreased or delayed, etc. (hmmm, I don't know what to think about that, but this doctor was 'right on' about everything else he was saying.",

      "Content": "From my brief review of the literature, mammosites are still being researched. They are not currently the standard of care. Although, all the current findings indicate that it is equal to, if not superior to conservative radiation therapy. as mamm. are currently still being researched, it is impt that strict research protocols are observed, one of which is that mamm.'s can be done 'up to' 10 weeks of the lumpectomy. The lit. seems to indicate that the reason the 10 weeks is chosen, is that after that, the tumor bed is more difficult to ascertain. And, it is imperative that the radiation reach each edge of the tumor bed. Leo, with your computer capabilities, you are probably 'the' person to research this question more easily than I am. I think as mamm. become more and more the 'state of the art/standard of care' these type of questions will become increasingly more evident. Therefore, it would provide such a benefit if you could evaluate the current literature re: the 10 week s/p lumpectomy restriction. Thank you Roxanne PS: wish I were in an area of the country where mamm. were available to me You are lucky you are eligible for this treatment. Good luck imadere with being able to follow-through with this treatment option.",

Didn't have anything for either of them, other than the local anesthetic. That was sufficient. Really didn't need anything else. (and I am the biggest pain whimp that has walked the face of the earth) the wire localization was a piece of cake; especially compared to a biopsy. The radioactive dye/tracer used to be very painful (burning pain, like bee venom); but they have since diluted the tracer, so it is nothing either. maybe you could discuss this with them, especially if you have these adverse reactions to those drugs.

      "Content": "Hi Alaska Angel I too have been very intrigued by the research on olive oil. We only cooked with olive oil, but I am now using it on my salads, bread, etc.. For those who might be interested, copied the most recent article which I have read on olive oil, and Her2/neu expression.Olive Oil Aids Breast Cancer Fight Jean Louis Santini Olive oil can help fight breast cancer, a discovery that researchers said could guide the development of related treatment. \"Our findings underpin epidemiological studies that show that the Mediterranean diet has significant protective effects against cancer, heart disease and ageing,\" said the study's lead author Javier Menendez, of Northwestern University's Feinberg medical school in Chicago. Researchers showed in a series of laboratory experiments on breast cancer cells that oleic acid, found in olive oil, dramatically cuts the levels of a cancer-promoting gene called Her-2/neu (also known as erb B-2), according to Menendez. High levels of the gene occur in over a fifth of breast cancer patients and are associated with highly aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis, according to findings reported in the January 10 Annals of Oncology. Oleic acid suppressed the gene, and other tests showed that it boosted an antibody treatment trastuzumab (Herceptin), which targets the gene and has helped to prolong the lives of many breast cancer patients, the researchers said. Menendez said the findings should not only help in understanding the molecular mechanisms by which individual dietary fatty acids regulate the malignant behavior of breast cancer cells, but also suggested eating oleic acid may help Herceptin work in breast cancer patients with the Her-2/neu gene. \"To our knowledge this is the first report that a dietary monounsaturated fatty acid previously suggested to be protective against breast cancer significantly down-regulates the expression of Her-2/neu, cutting it by up to 46 percent. Her-2/neu is one of the most important oncogenes in breast cancer,\" said Menendez. \"In our tests, oleic acid's inhibition of Her-2/neu synergistically interacted with Herceptin-based immunotherapy by promoting the death of breast cancer cells exhibiting high levels of the oncogene. \"Additionally, alongside the sensitizing effect of oleic acid on the efficacy of Herceptin we found it increased the expression of a protein (p27Kip1), a tumor suppresser protein, which is implicated in the development of resistance to Herceptin treatment.\" Menendez worked with Ruth Lupu, director of the Evanston Northwestern Health Research Institute's Breast Cancer Translational Program and Ramon Colomer, head of the Medical Oncology Division at Institut Catala d' Oncologia in Girona, Spain",

      "Content": "I had a limited nodal dissection on 1/25/05, and the results were negative. I am so very fortunate. I feel like a miracle has happened, and will forever more give thanks. So, I am now officially stage I with Histology Grade 2 (E/P positive, but Her-2/neu negative). I anticipated at each step of the diagnostic process, that there would be pain almost too much to bear. However, with local anesthesia the wire localization was painless; the lumpectomy on 1/5 was painless (thanx to the surgeon who filled my wound with local anesthetic before he closed); the SNB and radioactive tracer was painless (thanks to the new process of diluting the tracer); and the nodal dissection was painless thanx to Lortab q 4 hrs after surgery and a terrific anesthesiologist who was 'into' pre-emptive analgesia; and the axillary drains after surgery, while not the greatest thing, are certainly not painful (and what would happen with all that fluid, if I didn't have any drains? daily trips to the surgeon for aspiration sure don't sound very appealing) The interminable wait between procedures and/or interim path reports to obtain the final path reports were what caused the most anguish. Time has never gone so slow. The friend I made from this forum, and close friends/family at home, made all the difference in the world. Without them, my emotions would not have been as stable nor as positive. Just wanted to provide an update, and maybe a hopeful note to others who are still undergoing the diagnostic process........ Now...........onto treatment............... Roxanne",

I would like to have a mammosite; however, not offered yet in my area (6 months from now, but not now). And, he said he would also refer me to an oncologist, as I probably would need Tamoxifen or Arimidex (I already have osteoporosis, so I don't know how they would handle the Arimidex........) I don't think I will need any chemotherapy; at least, they haven't mentioned that yet. So, if I do, I am totally unprepared. Thank you again for responding, Dr. Lu Roxanne",

If large areas of active bone marrow are treated, your red blood cell count may be low as well. If your blood tests show these side effects, your doctor may wait until your blood counts increase to continue treatments. Your doctor will check your blood counts regularly and change your treatment schedule if it is necessary.

I do the exercise with both arms at the same time to prevent cheating and to establish goals for my right arm. Initially, while exercising, I had pain extending down the side of my right chest, under my right upper arm, and on top of my right forearm with even minimal stretching. I also had a burning type pain where the incision was which was constant (whether I was exercising or not). I take no pain medication; nor do I apply heat or cold. I can now extend my hand to the top of the door frame, and do the second exercise with hand behind neck/elbows extended. The pain has gone away from the side of my right chest completely. However, when I extend the stretch the pain is still felt under my upper arm, and on top of my forearm. This area is also very tender to touch. The burning under my arm where the incision was has diminished somewhat; being worse in the evening/night. Can you think of any suggestions for me? Any other exercises? Do I sound as if I am progressing? Do the symptoms I describe sound normal? Thank you for your help in advance: Roxanne",

      "Content": "Some very wise ladies on another forum, after asking me several questions, made it clear to me, that I was very unclear as to why my surgeon selected the following sequence of events: (my surgery is 1/5, so am hoping someone is out there who can help me clarify my situation) 1. Annual screening mammogram followed by a diagnostic ultrasound found a 1.2 cm irregular spiculated mass. Mass was hypoechoic. Bi_Rad was 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy, and to take action) No lump could be detected by myself or my gynecologist. 2. Surgical consultation: Surgeon stated, as lump could not be felt, he would do a surgical excision of lump, preceded by wire localization. He was adamant that a serious auto accident and signficant bruising etc. of breast in same vicinity as present suspicious area could have led to scarring. Surgery scheduled for 1/5. Is this the way to go? Wouldn't a biopsy prior to surgery be a better plan? 3. After path report, if malignancy invasive, then will return to surgery for sentinel node biopsy (perhaps he said axillary node biopsy, am unclear...........could it have been sentinel node?????? wouldn't the above lumpectomy rule that out as a procedure? 4. Some place in the above sequence, he also mentioned dirty margins, and future surgeries. Am unsure as to whether that would be before the lymph node biopsy???????? Or After????????/ 5. Then after all surgeries healed up, would follow with 6 weeks of radiation. Guess this is the only part I am sure of, as I am sure radiation will be the last thing that occurs. Can anyone help me. I am so confused. I feel like wrong decisions have been made, or if not wrong, at least better ones could have been made. I am hoping someone can help me Thank you Roxanne",

You write that: \"Her radiation is for 4 different areas, lump/aux nodes/intermammary/supraclavical nodes\". Intermammary nodes are almost right on top of the esophagus. Radiation to the GI tract does cause nausea. As the esophagus is part of this 'alimentary' canal; the same could be happening with your wife. The extent of her radiation to surface area is significant; therefore, radiation fatigue could be quadrupled. My Radiation Oncologist said I could anticipate fatigue after only 2 weeks of therapy, and I am only having the right breast irradiated. If you couple fatigue with nausea, that could explain some of her symptoms. I am so glad you will see the Radiation Oncologist today. Please let us know what happens. Good luck Roxanne",

I am wondering if the mild edema is due to my massage of cream into my breast three times a day (aquaphor); or is it due to having large breasts (normal cup size D; now probably a DDDD, if there is such a size as that) My main question (and biggest fear) is that if I am having these problems so early in the treatment cycle, what will happen to me as the treatments progress?

      "Content": "Some very wise ladies on another forum, after asking me several questions, made it clear to me, that I was very unclear as to why my surgeon selected the following sequence of events: (my surgery is 1/5, so am hoping someone is out there who can help me clarify my situation) 1. Annual screening mammogram followed by a diagnostic ultrasound found a 1.2 cm irregular spiculated mass. Mass was hypoechoic. Bi_Rad was 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy, and to take action) No lump could be detected by myself or my gynecologist. 2. Surgical consultation: Surgeon stated, as lump could not be felt, he would do a surgical excision of lump, preceded by wire localization. He was adamant that a serious auto accident and signficant bruising etc. of breast in same vicinity as present suspicious area could have led to scarring. Surgery scheduled for 1/5. Is this the way to go? Wouldn't a biopsy prior to surgery be a better plan? 3. After path report, if malignancy invasive, then will return to surgery for sentinel node biopsy (perhaps he said axillary node biopsy, am unclear...........could it have been sentinel node?????? wouldn't the above lumpectomy rule that out as a procedure? 4. Some place in the above sequence, he also mentioned dirty margins, and future surgeries. Am unsure as to whether that would be before the lymph node biopsy???????? Or After????????/ 5. Then after all surgeries healed up, would follow with 6 weeks of radiation. Guess this is the only part I am sure of, as I am sure radiation will be the last thing that occurs. Can anyone help me. I am so confused. I feel like wrong decisions have been made, or if not wrong, at least better ones could have been made. I am hoping someone can help me Thank you Roxanne",

      "Content": "Update: I saw my Radiologist today. She said it is true, that larger breasted women have more problems, as there are more tissues which become inflammed. She said that when someone did have this swelling problem, it usually started almost right from the very first radiation treatment (which it did). She also said that it did not progressively get worse, but instead, seemed to stop all together at the 4th or 5th week (she did not explain the physiological basis for this; but it is such good news). Then she gave me cortisone for my very very sore nipple. She seems to think that everything is right on track, and I should not worry. Just wanted to let everyone know what was occurring, or perhaps this information may even help someone else who may go through this in the future. Roxanne",

      "Content": "I had a limited nodal dissection on 1/25/05, and the results were negative. I am so very fortunate. I feel like a miracle has happened, and will forever more give thanks. So, I am now officially stage I with Histology Grade 2 (E/P positive, but Her-2/neu negative). I anticipated at each step of the diagnostic process, that there would be pain almost too much to bear. However, with local anesthesia the wire localization was painless; the lumpectomy on 1/5 was painless (thanx to the surgeon who filled my wound with local anesthetic before he closed); the SNB and radioactive tracer was painless (thanks to the new process of diluting the tracer); and the nodal dissection was painless thanx to Lortab q 4 hrs after surgery and a terrific anesthesiologist who was 'into' pre-emptive analgesia; and the axillary drains after surgery, while not the greatest thing, are certainly not painful (and what would happen with all that fluid, if I didn't have any drains? daily trips to the surgeon for aspiration sure don't sound very appealing) The interminable wait between procedures and/or interim path reports to obtain the final path reports were what caused the most anguish. Time has never gone so slow. The friend I made from this forum, and close friends/family at home, made all the difference in the world. Without them, my emotions would not have been as stable nor as positive. Just wanted to provide an update, and maybe a hopeful note to others who are still undergoing the diagnostic process........ Now...........onto treatment............... Roxanne",

Its not complete yet, as I still need a SNB on 1/25, and need more studies on one of the lab markers, which leads to my question: As the Her-2/neu is 2+ or borderline, another lab test called a FISH will be done. I am hoping that the positive Her-2/neu was an error, and this will be discovered when they do the FISH. Is this very likely? I am also Estrogen/Progesterone positive, and have heard, that if you are E/P positive, than more than likely you are not also Her-2/neu positive. Has anyone else heard this? Does anyone have more information on this subject that I do? Also, if I am Her-2/neu Positive, than does that make it more likely that my cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes (I am 1.2 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, lumpectomy 1/5, Histology was Grade 2 (however, the Her-2/neu is not a part of the Histology Grading system).

My Radiation Oncologist adamantly stated that this was not due to Radiation (hmmmm, if not Radiation, then what?)....My Radiation Oncologist adamantly stated that this was not due to Radiation (hmmmm, if not Radiation, then what?). Luckily, I only have 2 more weeks left; so maybe next time I get a WBC it will have increased (hope, hope, hope)....The lit. seems to indicate that the reason the 10 weeks is chosen, is that after that, the tumor bed is more difficult to ascertain.
