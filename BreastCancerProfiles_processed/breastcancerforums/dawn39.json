      "Content": "thank you for taking the time to reply, im sorry if what i typed seemd off, but am so frightened at the moment and convinced i have breast cancer, already been through hell for 11 weeks waiting for lymph node to be removed and biopsied i was certain then i had lymphoma what with the hot flushes and itchiness as well, i suppose my mind at the moment is sure that everything is going to be cancer, the worst outcome. totally stressed out cant cope with the smalles of things it is really having a bad effect. i was completely reasured with the breast ultrasound and mammogram when the results came back no sign of malignancy, but im in the uk and i paid privately to have the mammogram and ultrasound as couldnt wait on the nhs, because i only paid for the xrays the consultant never explained fully to me what the results meant and what other reasons there could be for the bad pain and nodules , and after reading of peoples experiences on this site that they had clear mammograms and ultrasound it really frightened me, i guess im just looking for some reasurance to get me through another day until my doctors appt, because even if he does agree to sending me to a breast cliniic there will probably be a delay of 2/ 3 weeks, andcoming on top of the last 11 weeks with the last problem dont know how i am going to get through this. thanks again dawn x",

      "Content": "hello, can you tell me if your doctor could actially find a lump? i have had two doctors feel my breast now and both said thay can feel no lump just nodules and this is what the mammogram and ultrasound have picked up, surely they must have some accuracy other wise why carry these tests out, i am totally confused now i have my doctor telling me i do not have cancer and there would be no where to actually stick a needle in to aspirate . i have quite small breasts, so i cant understand how two doctors would miss this, and risk being sued by me, surely if they had any doubts they would play it safe, the main thing that is worrying me is this really painful area in my breast that has been there for two weeks now, i dont know what to do we cant afford to pay for anymore private investigations and in the meantime i am beside myself with worry, and because of what the doctors have said my family think i am just being really silly and to just accept what the doctors have said. thanks dawn",

      "Content": "thank you for taking the time to reply, im sorry if what i typed seemd off, but am so frightened at the moment and convinced i have breast cancer, already been through hell for 11 weeks waiting for lymph node to be removed and biopsied i was certain then i had lymphoma what with the hot flushes and itchiness as well, i suppose my mind at the moment is sure that everything is going to be cancer, the worst outcome. totally stressed out cant cope with the smalles of things it is really having a bad effect. i was completely reasured with the breast ultrasound and mammogram when the results came back no sign of malignancy, but im in the uk and i paid privately to have the mammogram and ultrasound as couldnt wait on the nhs, because i only paid for the xrays the consultant never explained fully to me what the results meant and what other reasons there could be for the bad pain and nodules , and after reading of peoples experiences on this site that they had clear mammograms and ultrasound it really frightened me, i guess im just looking for some reasurance to get me through another day until my doctors appt, because even if he does agree to sending me to a breast cliniic there will probably be a delay of 2/ 3 weeks, andcoming on top of the last 11 weeks with the last problem dont know how i am going to get through this. thanks again dawn x",
