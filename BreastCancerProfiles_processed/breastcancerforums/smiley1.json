    "Content": "Hello everyone, I am new to this site basically I am up late tonight searching for answers that my doctor cannot give me. I have had a armpit swelling in my right armpit for 2 years. When looking at it, its a puffy lump that is visable and you can feel it. My first ultrasound came back as all clear nothing was found dispite you could feel this lump. I have had a recent ltrasound on this lump and the results have came back stating that it is a lymph node that measures 1.5 x 1.8cm. I should note that this lump of lymph node does NOT go away it is permant. It has been quite painful for approx the last 6 months. I have had bloodwork done which came back within normal ranges. I went to get a second opinion and the doctor woudl not even look at it or feel it, she said since i had a ultrasound done on it i need not worry and that it is JUST a lymph node. SO, my question is, how accurate are these ultrasouds? I am only worried because it is painful, you can feel it and see it, and it is not going away. In my mind there has to be a reason why this node is swelled up and is not going away... any insight on this ?? thanks.",
