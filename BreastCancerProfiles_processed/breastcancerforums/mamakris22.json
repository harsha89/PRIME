      "Content": "Thanks so much for the reply!!!! It was a really hard choice to get a bi-lateral mastectomy. Everyone kept saying \"It'll be okay, you'll have new perfectly matched boobs and perky!!\"..stuff like that...but it doesnt change the fact that youre losing yours. (Its more difficult than I thought looking down at my new body and still trying to feel whole?) But after reading so many posts of reoccurence on other breast and considering my own family history with cancer, I figured better safe then sorry right?! I wish you all the best on your appointment...waiting is one of the worst parts!! Somehow easier when you know exactly what youre up against and have a plan. I cant wait yet Im dreading it Please keep me posted!!! [HUGS] ~Kris",

      "Content": "Hey Cindy and Kat, Hope all is well with you both. I received my PATH report and just wanted to say that Im SO glad I went with bi-lateral mastectomy!! My tumor was very small(1.6 cm) but spread to 8 out of 11 nodes under my arm...aggressive lil bugger!!! Theyve changed me to Stage IIIa with all the node involvement...even doc said they werent expecting to find any let alone 8!! Somehow I just knew that I should go the drastic route to fight this and I WAS RIGHT!! Goes to show that u really can and should trust those instincts!! I start my chemo on the 25th of this month...4 rounds of AC, 12 roundsof Taxol followed with rads and hormone therapy. I hope its ready...cause Im gonna kick its ass!!! Hope you both keep in touch and let me know how your doing...take care!!! ~Kris",
