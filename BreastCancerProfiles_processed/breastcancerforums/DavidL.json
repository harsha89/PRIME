    "Content": "Hi there! I was wondering if anyone has any good recommendations for a breast cancer oncologist at MD Anderson. My mom has undergone 12 chemo treatments in Taiwan and we feel the doctors there have reached a dead end since their medical technology and choice of medication is not quite up to par with the US. Therefore, we're thinking of moving her to MD Anderson based on their stellar reputation and the fact that we already have family living in the Houston area. We've already contacted the facility and was sent all the necessary paperwork, but now we'd need to choose an oncologist and hope to get some opinions from you folks before we make the choice. Any suggestions are welcome and very much appreciated! Also, any general suggestions or experiences you'd like to share with regards to MD Anderson is more than welcomed! Thanks in advance, David",
