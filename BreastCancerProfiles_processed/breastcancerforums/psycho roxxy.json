      "Content": "My name is Muhammed Akbar and I am a resident of Karachi, Pakistan .The reason I am writing this is concerning my mother.She was recently diagnosed as having a left breast nodule(carcinomatous) and had a modified radical mastectomy done .She is currently on a chemotherapy schedule and has had 4 sessions completed with 2 more remaining .Her Complete blood counts are showing falling levels every time it's done as a requirement before each scheduled chemotherapy session.The most effected levels in her CBC's are those of White Blood Cells .Apart from this she is taking well care of staying clean ,and clear of any surroundings that may compromise her immune suppressed state. She takes plenty of fluids and food and is starting to gain weight even but her reports are'nt showing much improvements.Is there anything that you would prescribe to include in her diet that would bring about improvements in her blood report levels and especially boost her W.B.Cs ?????",
