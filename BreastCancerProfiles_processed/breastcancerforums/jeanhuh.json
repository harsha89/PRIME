    "Content": "I lost my mother when I was 21 to breast cancer, she was the youthful age of 53. I felt as though there was nothing that I could do during her 8 month battle with the cancer to help her. I felt as though I was watching from the sidelines as my mom was disappearing before my eyes. Now I know there are things that I can do to help myself and to help other families such as mine. I am participating in the susan g. Komen 3-day. I am raising money to benefit breast cancer in hopes that my children and grandchildren will never have to live their life without a mother. I hope that you will read my personal story and find it in your heart to donate whatever amount you may be able at www.The3day.Org/tampabay06/ginawitte thank you for your time and consideration.
