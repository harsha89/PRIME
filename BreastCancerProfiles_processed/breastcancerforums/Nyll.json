    "Content": "Hi all. It's a great help to have found this site. I have read through some of the conversation here. We have received Mum's biopsy result yesterday (from Left Mastectomy). As a nurse, I understand what is written in the result, and the possible stage of her Breast Cancer. We are scheduled for a meeting with an oncologist on Monday. It was her 5th operation.. she has been dealing with benign cystic mass since 2002. October 2015 biopsy result was negative for malignant cells. Come January this year, she is operated again and it came back cancerous. The doctors scheduled her for another operation and removed the entire left breast along with 6 lymph nodes. The biopsy result reads: -Invasive ductal carcinoma, Nottingham Histologic Grade 2 - Tumor size: 3 cms - High Grade Intraductal Carcinoma in Situ - Presence of Lymphovascular Invasion - Nipple and Skin Positive for Tumor - 6/6 Lymph Nodes, Positive for Tumor - PT4N2MX I know what these mean, but I do not want to just give in to these result. I want to stay strong and positive. I haven't told my Mum about the interpretation of the result - I do not know how to; and it is really really difficult to deal with this kind of situation, and being a nurse did not help a lot. I want to talk to somebody who has gone through the same thing. Not just relying on what I learned from college.. - What is the prognosis of this? - What are the possible modes of treatment? - Do you recommend herbal medicine? Admittedly, I am scared. My Dad just passed away last November 2014 from colon cancer that has mestastasised to his lungs. I know most of all that Mum will find it difficult to take in all these. I want to help her, but what is the best thing I could do for her? Please help, I am currently lost with all these. Thank you all. xx",
