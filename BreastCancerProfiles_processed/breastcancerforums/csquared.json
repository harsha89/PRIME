      "Content": "Hello, My mother under went surgery on the 22nd April having her right breast removed. She left the hospital on 30th April, before her discharge we met with her oncology nurse who informed us about her cancer. Type of Breast Cancer: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Size: 4cm Stage/Grade: 2 Lymph Nodes Removed: 30 Lymph Nodes Involved: 20 Receptors: Estrogen Positive My mother also had an ultrasound performed on her abdomen while in hospital, they said this was a routine test, this came back clear. She also has to go for a bone scan in a week or two. The lymph nodes that were taken from my mother, ten of them were found clear of cancer but twenty of them had some cancer cells in them. Question: What does this mean? Could the cancer be somewhere else? The nurse told my mother that her cancer was gone and anymore treatment that she will be recieving will be preventative measures. And that regardless of what other treatment she will be recommended to have she will be going on hormone treatment. Is she right in saying the cancer is gone??? Thanks for all your support and help, its great to find comfort in people who have knowledge and wisdom of these situtions",

      "Content": "Please i need advice or true live experiences, to help my mother through her mastectomy and also how to help my dad and family cope. Hi Everyone, My mother who is 62 years old, was diagnosed 2 weeks ago with breast cancer. She had a mastectomy on tuesday 24th April and is currently recooperating in hospital. They removed all the glands/lymph nodes from her arm as well as the entire right breast. She has had an ultrasound on her abdomen and is going for a bone scan next week. She has drains still attached to her. We have not got the cancer stage back yet (it is Ireland and the health care system is inadequate to deal with things promtly). I have visited everyday, except today as i had to work 12hrs. I have gone with her for all her hospital appointments. She has been positive for the most part, but tonight when she rang me on the phone i got the feeling that she was really down. I know this is to be expected, she has been through a huge ordeal, with more to come. She has been getting alot of visitors, do you think we should limit the people calling to see her? She is also not sleeping very well (she was never good to sleep in the first place) but as the drains are in her right, that is the side she usually falls asleep on, it is making things that little more uncomfortable. Do you think she needs time to herself to think and deal with the operation, to mourn her breast? Yesterday i think was the first time my dad spent some time alone with her and i think he feels awkward around her. How do i help him see she is still Mam, only one breast less. My question is, what can i say to her what can i do for her to let her know its ok to cry, its ok to hurt and its alright to talk about it? I am from Ireland and the irish way of dealing with things is sweep everything under the carpet and hope for the best. But i am don't want that, i want my mother to be able to express herself she needs to. Also what can i say to my dad i don't think he is dealing to well with this, what can i do? I need help to get my family to open up and talk if not it will divide us and we need to be united for this fight. Has anyone gone through what i am going through has anyone any advice on what to say to my mother to get her to open up and talk, what to say to my dad. Do i sit him down and explain what my mother has gone through and what the next steps are? Help me please...........!! Thank you",
