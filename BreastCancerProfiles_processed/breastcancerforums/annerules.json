Mom has a cold now and this I see as a major detriment. The possibility of pneumonia is now looming over her head and might make it harder to treat the cancer itself. Thank you everyone for the hope that you have offered me. For letting me know that all life is worth saving-even if you are past your prime as defined in this society. I have arranged a nurse to come in once a week to monitor her blood pressure, take some readings of her health and in general-take some pressure off of my Father and sister who live with her. There are a lot of questions that I have daily-and she is very patient with me when I present my lists... Thank you again! I will still be keeping an eye on this site for further replies if any do come.",

      "Content": "It's December 13th, 2 days ago my Mom called me to tell me that the Oncologist told her that she has terminal cancer and that they were going to hopefully start treatments soon. The problem arises once I calm down and start to ask questions about her life expectancy. There is no radiation offered because the radiologist feels that she is not properly displaying the symptoms. The Chemo therapy cocktail that is offered is also not explained as to whether it is hormonal or other. Just that they will offer her 4 months of treatment to alleviate the breathing problems. So, they are alleviating her breathing problems but not trying to \"cure\" her of cancer? I gather that my Mom has advanced breast cancer which has spread to her right lung. When discovered in the spring- it was 5 cm and since the biopsy (which all three were gong shows) has enlarged to 8 cm. Does that mean that it's in her lympnode system? 30% of the people that receive the type of treatment that they are recommending to her respond and.... we all know the rest. Am I going to lose her in 4 -6 months to this terrible beast because the oncologist and radiologist feel that she has reached her life expentancy and should be happy that they are alleviating her breathing problem and \"keeping her comfortable\"? I have asked several questions and am quite frustrated! I was not in the room when the doctor gave his diagnosis and he cannot infringe on her rights by telling me details. She is 79 - and up until this year has been quite active and often mistaken for 60. They just got back from a trip to Ireland in the spring!!! From what the different cancer diagnosis and treatment web sites say - my Mom has stage 4 cancer-what is the prognosis for stage 4 cancer? Is this it? All the web sites generalize and I gather that cancer diagnosis' are based on previous cancer stats. I want her to at least have the option to \"live with cancer\". That would be more tolerable than what I've reiterated earlier. I am partially venting but, am seeking views and opinions. We are born to die-but, we all die trying to live - right? Please-someone shine some light on me. Anne-rules",
