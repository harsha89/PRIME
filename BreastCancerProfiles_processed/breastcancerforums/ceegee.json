      "Content": "Hi, I started this post as a guest. I have been to my gyno and she examined my breast and felt some lumps, I think she called them nodules. She recommended that I go see my surgeon and see if she will schedule a MRI, as I just had a mammogram in Sept. My questions: 1. What are the differences between a mammo, songram, utrasound and MRI? 2. I was told that I can't get a MRI in the city that is closest to me, but other people I know have gotten them for other things, so is a breast MRI different than another kind? 3. How common is it for cancer to reoccur in the same breast that had DCIS, but all was removed, and radiation treatments done and tamoxifen therapy (16 months). I go to the surgeon on Monday the 29th and would just like to be prepared with good questions to ask. Thanks for all your help.",

      "Content": "Hi I would like the opinion of anyone out there and/or Dr. Leo on the following. I have been on tamoxifen for 2 1/2 years. Since going on the tamoxifen my periods have been very heavy. My iron is always low even with taking a multi-vitamin with iron supplement. I had to have a D&C and polyp removal in May of 2004. Now my uterine lining is thickened again and I have four more polyps. My gynocologist has recommended a procedure called an endometrial ablation in which the lining of the uterus is destroyed. She said that this would make my periods lighter or perhaps stop them all together. This sounded wonderful to me. The only drawback is that after the ablation it is harder to test for uterine cancer which is another side effect of the tamoxifen. I talked to my oncologist and she suggested that I have a complete hysterectomy. I really don't want to go through major surgery if the ablation would work. Any thoughts or has anyone else gone through this? Thank you.",
