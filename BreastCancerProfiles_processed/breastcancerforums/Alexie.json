    "Content": "Hi all, I've popped in from the Lymphoma forum to ask a question. To try and save my ovaries, my oncologist gave me injections of Zoladex (goserelin) to suppress oestrogen production while I was undergoing chemo. Many people apparently gain weight on this drug, which I haven't yet (touch wood). My question is, has anybody had hormone treatment and then gained weight after they stopped it? I'm just wondering what I'm in for when the injection wears off. I sure won't miss the hot flashes! Thanks in advance, Alexie",
