      "Content": "You have to let your doctor view the report, because in my opinion, I am a doctor by the way, it needs special attention. Normal morphology of lymph nodes is actually a very good sign because it denotes that there is no abnormality suggesting a tumor process. As the lymph node in the right axilla enlarged from 2.1 to 3.5, this means an ongoing process which can be inflammatory. The right breast has a mass which is heteregenous--------> this means that there are more than one type of tissue in the mass hyperechoic----------> this means that the mass reflects the ultrasonic waves efficiently which suspects the presence of fluid or cyst. In my opinion, you should undergo a fine needle aspiration cytology to rule out the presence or absence of malignancy, especially if you are above 45 years. LINK REMOVED AS PER FORUM POLICY.
