I really hope she at least decides to go for a second opinion to see if she is indeed in condition to continue the fight. Again, thanks a lot, and I will write again when I know more.",

      "Content": "Hello, My mother's good friend was diagnosed with breast cancer about 2 and a half years ago. She had a mascectomy, but about a year ago the cancer metasticized to her collar bone area. She underwent chemotherapy treatment for 6 months and had been off it for the past 6. Her last visit showed that she now has mets in her lungs. The doctor has recommended that no further chemo be undergone (stating that it would be a waste because it seemed to not help the first time around), and basically that there is nothing more to be done. He has put her on hospice and has given her a timeframe for around 6 months. I find this troublesome because she is 56 years old, and is in pretty strong condition (ie, still gets around on her own quite well, etc.) and in very good spirits considering the docs prognosis. I was under the impression that hospice would be for someone whose physical condition had deteriorated much more than hers. And that if someone is in well enough physical condition to continue to fight the disease, that that should be the recommended course of action (I don't know that much, but know that there are different chemo-drug combinations, new drugs, etc). She has not gotten a second opinion, and I have urged my mother to insist that she does. Any input/advice/experiences are greatly appreciated. Thank you so much, and sorry for lack of details, as I do not know all of them...",

      "Content": "Hello Cindy, Sorry for the delay in responding/updating you and the others who posted and/or sent PM's. My mom's friend passed away about 4 months after my original post here. She was in good spirits and with people she loved and who loved her all the way to the end - truly amazing was her level of positivity all the way through the entire process. Everyone is thankful that she did not suffer and was able to spend what precious time she had left with those closest to her. It is unfortunate that more could not be done, but the cancer had just spread too far and was extremely aggressive. I want to thank everyone here for maintaining this forum, as it is a great place for advice, support, information, etc. And thank you very, very much for the concern, advice and kind words as they related to this particular case. Keep up the good work and best wishes to all. John",
