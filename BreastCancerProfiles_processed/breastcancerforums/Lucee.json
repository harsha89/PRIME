      "Content": "Leo, I got the results back from my core biopsy and they called it \"suspicious\" IDC. My Dr. has arranged an appt. with the surgeon on the 29th with the recommendation to go back in and take a larger sample. Can you elaborate on this? I find it strange to come back suspicious but then have them type it. Thanks, Lucee",
