      "Content": "Age: 79 (will be 80 on September 17) 30 yrs. postmenopausal Invasive lobular carcinoma - Stage 2 I had a needle biopsy last Tuesday. He took 3 samples from my breast and 2 from an armpit lymphnode. He said the pathology report indicated that I would need to have a mastectomy followed by chemo plus radiation. I have heard terrible things about the effects of the treatments, but I have also heard that they do not agressively treat women my age. We're going to die soon anyway so why bother. I have lumbar spinal stenosis and have been in a wheelchair for 17 years. I have a duodenal ulcer and hemorrhagic gastritis. I have trigeminal neuralgia and am taking Gabapentin for that. I have mildly high blood pressure. I have COPD. I've been smoking for 60+ years and still am. If I was going to get a cancer, I would have expected it to be in the lungs. I'll be seeing the surgeon next Tuesday to schedule the mastectomy. I guess he'll give me more information on the pathology report. Then I'll have to make decisions. Am I going to have to go through a lot of pain and suffering and then die anyway? I'm more afraid of the pain and suffering than of the dying. And I know this is not a nice thing to say, but I'm afraid that I'll be wanting a cigarette so badly and won't be able to have one at times. Sorry, but I'm just stating an honest feeling. I don't have anyone to talk to and it's feels safe to talk about my fears to someone I don't know. As I said, I haven't even had the mastectomy yet, but can anyone tell me what to expect next?",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for your kind and understanding sympathy. And for your encouragement. I was beginning to feel that I might become more of a victim of the medical profession than of the cancer. I've always had a problem with being assertive in the face of *authority*. That's just the way we were raised *back then*. I don't feel like I have to cling tenaciously to this life - I know there's a better one ahead for me. But dying is an *unknown* and thus I fear it. I have executed a \"Living Will\" so my first choice would be to die on the operating table, without having to go through the awareness of pending doom. I have always had a problem with making choices and decisions. My daughter has my Medical POA and knows my feelings in the matter of resuscitation and will respect them. Although she doesn't want to lose me yet, she agrees that if I HAVE to die from this, I shouldn't have to suffer before it happens. We feel that if a small amount of pain will keep me alive for a period of years, I should go that way. But if it's only a matter of months then I should take the paliative route and let it end quickly. But will the surgeon or oncologist tell me the truth? Who can explain to us exactly how this whole thing will play out? What I'm asking from you dear people is to try to give me some scenarios of what you've been through, or know about, that might apply to my situation - if possible. Something that might help me decide just how far I want to go before throwing in the towel. I truly appreciate your kindness. I feel such a warmth emanating from your posts. It's more than I had anticipated. Thank you.",
