      "Content": "I am currently a graduate student at California School of Professional Psychology at Alliant International University in San Diego, CA working on my PhD in clinical psychology. My passion is to work with women who are breast cancer patients and survivors to improve quality of life during/after treatment. I am conducting my dissertation research study in the area of breast cancer survivors and predictors of depression. I am seeking women breast cancer survivors between the ages of 18 and 80 to participate in my study. Eligibility includes completion of initial breast cancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiation, surgery) within the last 4 years (being on hormone therapy is ok). This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of Alliant International University. As a participant, you will be asked to complete a one-time series of questionnaires. The study may take between 60-90 minutes depending on how fast/slow you work. I do ask that the questionnaires be completed in one sitting, but you may take as many breaks as needed. Although I live in San Diego, CA, you may participate outside of San Diego. I will mail you the packet of questionnaires along with a self-addressed stamped envelope to return the packet to me. I am in need of 130-140 breast cancer survivors. Currently 62 amazing women have been generous with their time and have contributed enormously to this research study. I would greatly appreciate any help you may be able to provide whether it be participating or sharing my contact information with someone who is eligible to participate. Although there is no direct benefit to you in participating in this study, it will provide more information regarding depression in breast cancer survivors and improve the literature which is lacking in this area. The ultimate goal of this research is to help improve quality of care for breast cancer patients and survivors by not only addressing physical issues, but emotional issues as well. If you meet the above criteria and are interested in participating in the study, please send me a message. If you do not qualify for the study but you know others who might be interested in participating, feel free to forward my information. Sincerely, Emily A. Meier, M.A. Graduate Student (4th year) Clinical Psychology PhD Program CSPP at Alliant International University (APA accredited) San Diego, CA",

My passion is to work with women who are breast cancer survivors and improve quality of life during/after treatment. I am conducting my dissertation research study in the area of breast cancer survivors and predictors of depression. I believe that the mind and body should be treated simultaneously. I am seeking women breast cancer survivors between the ages of 18 and 80 to participate in my study investigating the predictors of depression. Eligibility includes completion of initial breast cancer treatment within the last 4 years. You will be compensated for your time with a small cosmetic gift bag, as well as entry into a drawing for one of two prizes following completion of the study: $100 cash prize or a spa gift certificate. If you are interested in participating or would like more information please contact me at: *********Information was deleted per forum posting policies. Please review in top section of main forum and comply. Thank you. *********** I am located in San Diego, CA, however, it is possible for participation outside of San Diego. I think it is important that we don't forget survivors in the fight against breast cancer! More research is needed to understand what difficulties breast cancer survivors may experience after diagnosis and treatment. Please feel free to forward my information to any breast cancer survivors that may be interested! I currently have 30 women and am in need of 176!",
