    "Content": "We are helplessly trying to find a cure for our mom, 64, whoa has breast cancer that metastasized to bones and liver. After various natural and chemotherapy treatments she is now suffering from water retention in her abdomen and a great fatigue. She has become hopeless. We heard of Cesium Chloride treatment. So many people report in forums that they've started it, but the threads are always cut in the middle... bad news? On the other hand, sites like cancertutor.com fully recommend it and various vendors around the US are selling it for years. Does anyone out there have an experience or knows someone who has an experience with CC? Please help! Time is so short on us.",
