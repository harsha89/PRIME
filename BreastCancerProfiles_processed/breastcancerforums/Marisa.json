      "Content": "Dear Rachel, Thank you so much for your reply. I called my Mom and read the whole thing to her! I told her it was nothing short of a miracle that I was able to successfully post something since I am technologically challenged. We have decided to get two opinions on my Mom's tests. One at the local hospital here in Vermont and the other at Sloane Kettering. I was amazed at the response from our small community from friends and our church. People have offered their help, support and prayers. But I will tell you, when a complete stranger offers encouragement and words of comfort, I am touched in a very deep way. I thank you for your kindness. It went a long way. I will keep everyone posted and let you know how our experiences went at each hospital. Regards, Marisa",
