    "Content": "Hi; I just joined this forum and I have no idea how to go about communicating with anyone. -- I am a breast cancer victim who has already gone through twelve weeks of chemo and who had a double mastectomy on the 16th of December, 2008. I am still in a lot of pain and, because of side effects, can't endure any pain killer other than Advil. The breast surgeon tells me that I should not be experiencing so much pain at this time and actually seems to be out of patience with me. My husband and I are trying to maintain a positive attitude but, in the face of a lot of discomfort, it isn't easy to keep a good attitude. -- I would appreciate a response -- although I have no idea how to find my way around this site. LoLo",
