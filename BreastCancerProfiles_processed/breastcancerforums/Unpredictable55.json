    "Content": "Hello. I am new here. I was called back after a routine mammo. Followup showed suspicious calcifications on both breasts (plemorphic is the word the radiologist used). These were not on previous mammogram, but that was standard and this one was digital. I have extremely dense breasts and I doubt these would show up on a film mammogram. The right appeared to be more extensive than the left. I am premenopausal (44). I have three questions. 1) the radiologist says surgical biopsy is the only option as the calcifications on both breasts are very far back, close to the pectoral. Has anyone heard of this? 2) If this turns out to be cancer, is this a more dangerous place to get it? 3) how common is it to have bc in both breasts at the same time? Thanks so much!",
