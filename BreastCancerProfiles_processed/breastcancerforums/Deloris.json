      "Content": "Hello, I was diagnosed Oct. 1, 2004 with breast cancer, I had bi-lateral mastectomy and have went through 4 A/C treatments and today I'm going for my 3rd of four taxol treatments. Since the second treatment, I have this itching, feels like pins and needles, nvery bothersome. I'm taking the meth pack and benadryl every four hours and it is barely keeping it away. Has anyone else out there had this side effect? If so, I was wondering if they are going to change my treatment. I just want it to all be over with, but don't think I can take this for another month. Your posts are such an inspiration, I just found this website. Thank you all, Deloris",
