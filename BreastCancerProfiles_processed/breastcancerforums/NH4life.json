I agree, though with Cindy about getting a second opinion. it is always prudent. Whether or not, however, these are mere allergies or any sort more disturbing, the body's immune system is really the first line of defense if not really our defense of the first order against diseases of all kinds including those we dread. May i share with you this site on the body's immune system and its abilities to altogether protect or help the body recover throm such illnesses . http://www.natureheals4life.bravehost.com/TFinfo.html here's something more specific on allergies: http://www.powerbod.com/asia/orlan/?...ials#allergies i hope you find this useful and helpful",
