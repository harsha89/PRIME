      "Content": "I (52 y.o. ) have been referred to a breast oncologist next week. I have a mass in my right breast which is suspicious as it is attached to the overlying skin. It is firm and movable, no spiculated edges to palpation. I have had the mass 2.5 years, another story. The finding of affixation almost always indicates malignancy. I would like to know if there are any other types of breast cysts/tumors which attach to underlying and overlying structures. I'll settle in later this afternoon and catch up on the forum. All the best, Veronica",
