    "Content": "My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer this week. The \"lump\" she has in her her left breast. Today, she developed a blister inside her left nostril. Her left eye is also swollen. We do not yet know what the official diagnosis or stage of her cancer is. Does anyone know what is happening to the rest of her body? Has anyone gone through this? Thank you!",
