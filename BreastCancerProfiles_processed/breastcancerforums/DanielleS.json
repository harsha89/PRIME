      "Content": "Well we went to the doctor wednesday. She will be going in for surgery next week to get a masectomy and reconstructive surgery. They say its Stage 1 right now but they will check her lymph nodes during surgery next week. She will for sure have to have chemotherapy . But we will make the best of it! She went back today to talk to the doctors about surgery. I'm really worried about it, but I know everything will be ok. She is ok with the surgery and everything, but she's scared of chemotherapy (like anyone would be) We are going to be looking for wig specialists to see if we can get her a wig b/c they told her for sure she would lose her hair. If anyone has any info on wig specialists somewhere in North Carolina. Please let me know. I appreciate all the messages and emails you guys have sent. It means so much. I look forward to getting more! Thanks so much, Danielle",

      "Content": "thanks for responding everybody. I did check out the websites you guys recommended and she found 2 she loves and look just like her hair. She will be ordering them soon. Seeing that she could find wigs like that, I think makes her feel better about chemo. She goes thursday for surgery. They will remove 2 lymphnodes to test them. The doc says its only a 20% chance it spread to the lymph nodes. So i'm hoping and praying he's right. She goes the following tuesday to have a mast. on her right breast and reconstructive surgery following it. Thanks again for all the help and support. If anyone has any more info on chemo or anything, please let me know. Thanks again everybody Danielle",

They say it will last 5-6 months and have treatments every 2 weeks. But, last time we went, they said it would last 12-16 weeks and she will get treatment every 3 weeks. We're confused. Has anyone had this type of chemo. I know its pretty aggressive If anyone has any information on this or experiences, please let me know. She will be starting it in about 2 weeks. Thanks, Danielle",

I don't know your job or m oney situation, but there is soemthing called breast cancer medicaid for people with out insurance. It pays for EVERYTHING. Bill Clinton passed it a few years back. If you are under these circumstances, you should definitely check into this. My mom had a lumpectomy. She was back to work the next day, never sick or anything afterwards. So you should be fine. I think its a pretty simple and routine surgery. My mom is going to have a mastectomy tuesday b/c she still had some calcium deposits scattered around in her breast, they're not sure if they're cancer until they take them out and since they're scattered, if they took them out piece by piece, it would already take off half of her breast so for precaution, they are going to go ahead and to a mast. I hope everything goes ok with you. I will certainly be praying for you and you will be in my thoughts. Please let us know how everything goes when you recover from surgery. Do they know if its cancer yet? let us know! Danielle",

      "Content": "Hey everybody! Well my mom had her first chemo treatment this past thursday, May 5th. So far so good. They told her her hair would start clumping out by the 3rd day, but fortunately, none of that yet. She's doing great. She's doing all the things she was before she even started chemo. She feels a little weak at times, but thats it. We are very thankful so far. She is having dose dense AC Taxol. 4 weeks of AC and 4 weeks of Taxol. Is it normal to h ave dose dense although she has such an early stage?? She is also doing the Neupogen shots every other day to boost her white blood cell count. They are very expensive. $2,600 for only 2 of them (thats only a 4 day supply) (WHOA) Luckily my job has worked with me around my mom's sickness, so I am able to have off whenever I want just to be at home with her in case she needs anything. That makes things so much better. Someone please let me know if you have had the dose dense AC Taxol and let me know how everything went. Thanks so much Danielle",

It's bearable though. She had a lymph node biopsy last thursday, they removed 2 lymph nodes. They got back the path report and one of the lymph nodes they took out had a tumor on it, but fortunately it was less than a millimeter in size. They went on ahead while they were doing the mast. and reconstruction and took out all of the lymph nodes. We will find out about the results April 6th. the oncologist told us depending on how many lymph nodes were affected will determine the stage of cancer. We are hoping and praying for positive news. I will put an update after the 6th to let everyone know the news. Thanks for everything you guys!",

      "Content": "Hey everybody. Well my mom was driving back and forth for chemo 2 hours away every 2 wks. But she found a doctor in our town that she could go to for chemotherapy. She just had her first taxol dose this past wednesday. She's done good so far, just really tired. When she started out.. it was decided she was going to have dose dense (every 2wks) AC Taxol. The doctor she's going to in our hometown, we've heard he has a major ego problem. Instead of giving her chemo every 2 wks, he wants to give it to her every 3 wks. She received the AC every 2 wks from the onc. 2 hours away. I've heard doing the dose dense is much more effective. He really doesn't have a reason why he decided on the 3 week dose. My question is: Is the Taxol just effective if taken every 3 wks rather than every 2 wks. Please let me know. Love, Danielle",

      "Content": "Hey everybody! Well my mom had her first chemo treatment this past thursday, May 5th. So far so good. They told her her hair would start clumping out by the 3rd day, but fortunately, none of that yet. She's doing great. She's doing all the things she was before she even started chemo. She feels a little weak at times, but thats it. We are very thankful so far. She is having dose dense AC Taxol. 4 weeks of AC and 4 weeks of Taxol. Is it normal to h ave dose dense although she has such an early stage?? She is also doing the Neupogen shots every other day to boost her white blood cell count. They are very expensive. $2,600 for only 2 of them (thats only a 4 day supply) (WHOA) Luckily my job has worked with me around my mom's sickness, so I am able to have off whenever I want just to be at home with her in case she needs anything. That makes things so much better. Someone please let me know if you have had the dose dense AC Taxol and let me know how everything went. Thanks so much Danielle",

She did realy good with that just really fatigue. She has jsut started taxol. She's had a lot of bone pain, but nothing too terribly bad. How have you done with this. Do you have to have Taxol too?

We go tomorrow for them to surgically remove 2-3 lymph nodes to test them. I see on everyone's profile on here about the PR/ER statuses. They haven't tested her for any of this. Do they not do this until after the mast.?? We have had one doctor say it was .6cm and another say it was 1cm.. we are leaning more toward the doctor that is saying its 1 cm. Again, I appreciate the advice, encouragement and concern. Thanks so much to everyone!! Danielle I will let everyone know thursday night how everything goes with her surgery.",

Her onc. told her to stop the neupogen injections b/c she was breaking out all over her body. SHe has always had eczema on her back, but its spread to her legs, arms, chest and all over her back. its so hard seeing her like this.

All my professors are VERY understanding. That helps a lot. On February 4th, my mom had a lumpectomy, she got results back a week later. They sent it to our local hospital lab, and it came back benign. We were so happy. BUT three weeks later, the radiologist found out that it came back benign and had the lab work sent to another hospital ( a much better more known hospital) and it came back malignant. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. How are you doing now? Did you have cancer treatments? If so, how did you do with them? Let me know!! THanks for responding, Danielle",

Could this be fluid retention or weight gain? Thanks Danielle",

      "Content": "Hey everybody. Sorry I haven't posted anything lately. My mom had her lymph node biopsy 2 weeks ago, they took out 2 nodes, one came back with a very small cancer on it. She went last thursday and had her mast. reconstruction and they took out a lot of her other lymph nodes. She was pretty sick after surgery but got to come home 2 days later. She's doing much better. We went this past wednesday (the 6th) and got a good report. The cancer had not spread to any of her other lymph nodes except that one. Her cancer is also estrogen receptive positive. She starts chemotherapy in about 3-4 weeks. She's not looking forward to it, but we will get through it. She will have 4 treatments over a period of 12-16 wks. I know some people do ok with it, but some people don't. She is having second thoughts b/c she believes by what the docs said that they got all the cancer, but we hate to take that chance just in case it had spread somewhere else. Danielle",
