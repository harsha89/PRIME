    "Content": "So I'll be honest, I only registered to get some input from those who would know. I have been dating a girl for nearly a year and we are not real serious but she was recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer. She is a young woman, not even 30 yet. She will be getting a double mastectomy and has recently lost her hair from the chemo. I want to do something nice for Valentines day and could use some insight. I have a decent job and two kids so I'm on a budget. I was thinking about getting her a day at the spa, maybe for her and her daughter so they could spend some time together. I don't know what to expect to pay or what kind of services would be good. I'm not even sure she would really like it. I know she is suffering because she moves like she is 40 years older than she is. My thought was something to make her body feel better since I know she is uncomfortable. I can not possibly understand how she is feeling physically or mentally. So if anyone has any ideas or insight I would love to hear it. Thx",
