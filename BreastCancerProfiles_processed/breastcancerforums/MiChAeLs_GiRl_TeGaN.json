    "Content": "Hello my name is Tegan Watchorn and i just found out my mum has breast cancer again. My mum has been suffering from breast cancer for about 2 and a half years now and she has had breast cancer about 5 times now but its because its the same lump that has the cancer on it. my mum had a biospy a week ago and she rang up to found out the results but the doctor wasnt there but then the doctor rang her back and told her she has breast cancer again. everyone in my family is so upset but im the only one to seem to be brave. my mum has got her right boob removed and now that she has breast cancer again that has came back in the left boob she has to maybe get it remvoed again. my family and myself is so upset. i have always wonder why she got it. i dont like my mum getting it it upset sets me to see her this way. i know this is going to sound nasty but she doesnt feel like my same person i knew before she got breast cancer. i want my old mum back i know she is going through alot but im so upset and dont know how to deal with this. can anyone help me please. Best Regards Tegan Watchorn",
