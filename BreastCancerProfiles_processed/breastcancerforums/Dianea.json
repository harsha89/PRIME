    "Content": "Of course you're freaking out. The UNTHINKABLE has become THINKABLE. It has become real. Suddenly, or not so suddenly, that safety net that we assume is strong and trustworthy has a BIG gaping hole in it! Your body has turned on you and you're tragically vulnerable, maybe for the first time in your life! The fact that you're NOT exempt from the horrible and you're NOT immune to tragedy has hit you right between the eyes! You can no longer assume that things like this don't happen to people like you. CANCER, the UNTHINKABLE HAS happened to you. Pretty SHOCKING if you ask me! So of course your \"heart\" FREAKS OUT and starts jumping to conclusions! That's what \"hearts\" do when given such a shock. The heart being your emotional center. But this too shall pass...YOU'RE NOT ALONE. Take a deep breath and begin to think with your BRAIN and let your \"heart\" eventually come to terms with the truth. YES, all those things are possible but they are NOT probable. THEY'RE NOT. Slow down and take another breath. Using your BRAIN, start feeding your heart the facts and NOT the fears. And if you need help with the task, do talk to those you trust. (doctor, pastor, family, friends, this forum, ETC...)",
