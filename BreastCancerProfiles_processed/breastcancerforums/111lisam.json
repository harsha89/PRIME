Should I get it cut short to get used to the idea of having less hair? I have my first appointment with the oncologist on 10 Nov so I don't know which chemo I'm having yet. I'm sorry if I sound vain. Thanks in advance, Lisa x",

My name is Lisa & I am 29yrs old(30 on 15 Nov) I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 20 Aug and had a mastectomy with ANC on 5 Oct. My results were as follows - 3cm tumor, grade 2, 16 lymph nodes removed 2 involved, er/pr-. I've been told I don't need radiotherapy but I'm having chemo. I was just wondering if there is anybody else with a similar diagnosis to mine. What type of chemo are you having? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Lisa x",
