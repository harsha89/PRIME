      "Content": "Thankyou nancy, I just wanted to thankyou for your reassuring words, I really need to hear them, I am on my way to see her now and I'm not really sure what to expect other than the fact that she is my mum and I love her and that will never change no matter what. I will keep updates as to how things go ok? So fingers crossed..i am praying she will survive this. Amy. Originally Posted by Muttsmom Hi, I had both breast removed. One a week after my dx and the other a year later. I had chemo and radiation as well. There is no cure for this disease, but they have come a long ways. I was high risk for recurrence because I was \"young\" and had 9+ lymph nodes. I will hit the 6 year mark before I see my onco again (saw him last month and I'm doing great). Yes, this disease can kill, but MANY of us are alive and living a full and happy life and I plan on living to be 90 Your fears are normal and your mom is on an emotional roller coaster from hell, but the roller coaster does slow down. I have no regrets about having both breasts removed or going through treatment. The hardest part for me was losing my hair, but once it was gone, the worst part of that was over. Then, my 1st bad hair day was awesome !!!!! The time will go by faster then you'd think. I can't believe it's been over 5 1/2 years since I heard those words, you have cancer, but it has. Best wishes to you both.",

She had her op, had her right breast removed, she's healing very well, she's able to lift her arm above her head after only 2 weeks...docs are very happy. They found 5 lumps all up and they removed all the cancer and there's none in her lymphnodes so she doesnt need kemo...YAY She does need some radiation and hormone tablets but she has been so lucky to not need kemo. She also has another appointment tomorrow with the docs, they want to do another scan on the left side to check for lumps so shes a bit worried..she doesnt want to go through this all over again and have no breast left at all. But so far my mum is cancer free and wont be losing her hair at this stage so yay for us. Please feel free to reply if you like...I can use all the feedback I can get. Talk to you all soon xx.",

      "Content": "Another update on my mums situation...as you know she was given great news 2 weeks ago..that she doesn't need kemo only some radiation. Well it turns out that the doctor is an idiot and she DOES need kemo...in fact she is at very high risk of it coming back and she has 5 different types of cancer and she will be starting kemo and radiation next friday..we are very upset and angry about this. My mothers hopes were high and she was feeling very blessed and lucky about her first lot of news. I mean she was already prepared for it before they told her she didnt need it but it's just very disappointing and upsetting to be told you were misinformed..I don't really know how to get past it..I am so angry for my mum & I'm not happy about what that doctor has done. He has completely turned my mums world around in a matter of 2 weeks and he will see nothing of it and just continue on with his daily life. Please comment if you want..I am having trouble coming to terms with this.",

I feel exactly the same as you do because I've been unable to stop crying. I feel I need to be stronger for my mum but I'm finding it extremly difficult, and I keep worrying that I'm going to lose her because she's my best friend and she's only 49. She is being quite positive about it, only because she feels that if she isn't then she will be letting it get her and she doesn't want that to happen. But I really think I need to talk to some people who have/are going through the same thing. She is looking into having reconstructive surgery, and her humorous side has come out because she says it's an excuse for her to finally get a boob job . So if you or anyone else could post a comment for me and this may just be a way of helping me get through this pain for my mum. Thankyou.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your comments..I don't really know too much about breast cancer just yet but i do know that the doctor who gave my mum her original \"you don't need chemo\" speech isn't the doctor who did her surgery and he will no longer be telling my mum anything about her needs etc. The surgeon said he will be taking care of all my mums needs and he will be her doctor for the next ten years. I know there is human error...it happens all the time but that's a pretty huge thing to get wrong and i just don't think that doctor should be practising when he does things like this. I think the 5 types of cancer is probably 5 differnt lumps but the way my mum said it is...she has 5 different cancers under her arm & breast. Well anything else you guys can tell me I'd really appreciate it. It's good to talk to people who have gone through or is going through similar situations. Amylee.",
