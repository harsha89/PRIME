    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to the forum. dx with bc in Sept. 2005, LCIS, DCIS, Her2neg, ERPR+, intramammary lymph node involvement with possible two more. Doctors recommend mastectomy, chemo and radiation which I refuse to allow poison injected into my system and destruction of my immune system when it needs to be functioning at its best. I was wondering if anyone has been treated successfully with the laser treatment at LASE MED, Inc. (hope that's okay to mention names but I believe it is the only place that uses the technology and only ones that have a patent). The treatment is FDA approved and I have spoken to two of their patients who are happy with the results and have not experienced any side effects. Would like to get additional testimonies before trying myself. Thanks!",
