Although I'm 58, I look much younger and care about how my body looks. Plus I have panic attacks, so I'm having a lot of them even with medication to control them. I'm not sleep well and crying a lot. But as I said, I've had two opinions and both of the drs. were reassuring about how it is in it's early stage. There are so many decisions to make, and I can't even think straight.",
