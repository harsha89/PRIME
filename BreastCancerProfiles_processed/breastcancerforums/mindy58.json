    "Content": "Hi all, I'm new to the forum and would be interested in finding out information on the use of Femara in control of Breast Cancer. I have been on this drug for a couple of months and my tumor has decreased in size from 7cm to 3cm which is terrific. I have some side effects but nothing too worrying. However my question is (which my oncologist and surgeon are not really answering) can this drug completely eradicate my cancer cells or will I have the need to have chemo and radiation therapy? Love to hear someone who has been through this procedure. I have stage 11 invasive lobular cancer with several glands effected. Hormone receptive. Thanks in advance. Mindy",
