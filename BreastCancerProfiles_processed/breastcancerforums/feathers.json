    "Content": "Hi I don't have bc but I'm concerned about the risk I have. I had a mammogram a couple of months ago and it came back abnormal so I was sent for another digital mammogram and an ultrasound. It came back as normal shadowing. I requested my medical notes and noticed that the Radiologist stated Breast density both breast but didn't indicate the percentage. looking at the x-ray it looks quite high. Due to my family history and the density I'm thinking of a double mastectomy. Is this too extreme ? I know I'm 5 times more likely to develop breast cancer due to my breast density. My mum was diagnosed 10yrs ago and 2 aunts. I'm 38. Is this quite common?",
