      "Content": "Dear Kristen and AA, Try to look at your healthcare team memders not only as doctors but, as something you are buying. It may seem odd to hear that but, they do earn their living providing health. When you feel they missed the boat polietly let them know ! You are one of the \"heads\" of the team and it is, of course, your life. Don't let it go until you are satisfied. As a therapist that was once a nurse I know this can be hard but it is empowering! This comes at a time you can use all the power and control over decisions as you can get. AlaskaAngel, you should go back to school and become a therapist! You are great with support and practical advice. Regards, Pat",
