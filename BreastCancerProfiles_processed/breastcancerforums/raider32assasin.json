      "Content": "My mom went to the hospital on Thursday for constipation. They did a catscan on her and found cancer in her breast, liver, lungs and abdomen. She has stage 4 cancer. She immediately went to an oncologist. he gave her Anastrozole to stop the growth of the cancer and percodan for the pain. The Oncologist also made an appointment for a month later. Also, she is too weak for chemotherapy. Is this normal? 1 month till her next appointment? she has no appetite and is always wore down. Can I get some advice on anything. I am lost and have no idea what to do. Is there certain foods she should eat. Any homeopathic stuff I can get her to make her comfortable? I was also thinking of trying edibles (marijuana) or trying to get a prescription for the marijuana pill to help with her appetite. Any help or advice would be much appreciated.",

      "Content": "I talked with the doctor today over the phone, and he informed me that she has infiltrating ductal cancer, stage 4. It started in her breast and spread into her liver, lungs and abdomen. Currently, she is on Anastrozale to stop the growth. He told me that she is too weak to have chemo at this time. She has stopped living after my dad died, and just sat and slept on a couch for the past 5 years, and her health has declined. She is in a hospital bed in her living room and has a portable toilet right next to her. My question is, are there alternatives to the treatment she is currently receiving. I did get her some edibles to help with her pain and mostly her appetite. I am going emotionally crazy right now and am so lost. My mind is racing yet is at a standstill.",
