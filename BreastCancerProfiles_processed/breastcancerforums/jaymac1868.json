    "Content": "A good friend was diagnosed with metaplastic carcinoma in December 2005 and they performed a mastectomy. They followed it up with chemo (6 treatments) and radiation (35 treatments). They told her she was cancer free. She had a C/T scan in December 2006 and they found three nodules in her lung. The biopsy is malignant. The doctor has told her the breast cancer has come back in the lung and because its in the lining of the lung tissue he doesn't see surgery as an option. He says this particular cancer has the characteristics of both a sarcoma and a carcinoma. He is suggesting another series of a stronger chemotherapy that would require her to be admitted to the hospital for a week at a time for treatment. He is also suggesting she go to M.D Anderson in Houston to explore treatment options. She leaves for Houston on Thursday. She is unsure about treatment at this time. Does anyone have experience with M.D. Anderson or advice on treatment?",
