They are notorious for giving pain, particularly in the lower back and the \"long\" bones.....actually a lot more severe than pain from taxotere.I experienced severe pain with my first lot of neupogen shots, but the subsequent ones were a lot less painful, more like aches and not really a problem.

      "Content": "I have just been switched to aromasin after 2 and a half years on tamoxifen (for early bc). My oncologist said that the trials have looked at this protocol, rather than tamoxifen followed by arimidex, which is what I was expecting to get. My question is - is there a disadvantage to aromasin, as I know it is the only one of the 3 aromatase inhibitors which is steroidal, and that the effects are supposedly \"irreversible\". (Which effects???) Also, could you tell me about potential side-effects..... Is there anyone else out there who has done a similar switch, or been taking aromasin from the start? I am feeling a bit nervous about taking this...... Thanks! Sam",

What does it signify that aromasin is the only \"steroidal\" aromatase inhibitor? (I have read that it should more accurately be called an aromatase inactivator) If you could answer these questions I would be very grateful. Thanks, Sam",

      "Content": "Hi Dr. Lu! I have posted on this subject before......but what I am looking for is an answer to a very specific question.....I'm hoping you will be able to help. Aromasin/exemestane works in a different way from the other aromatase inhibitors; it is both steroidal and its effects are irreversible.Indeed, it is described in some literature as an aromatase inactivator. My question is - what exactly does it signify that its effects are irreversible? Does this mean that when I stop taking it, the aromatase enzyme will still be inactivated? What implications might this have for my future well-being ? If you could explain this to me, I would be very grateful. Sam",

      "Content": "This was all over the news yesterday here in the UK - I think they always over-emphasise the potential benefit, but nevertheless it is there. I just have to try and convince my oncologist to switch me over from tamoxifen to arimidex - I have been trying (unsuccessfully) for over 2 years. She keeps saying \"not enough long-term reporting\", but now surely this will be enough? No doubt our socialised, and therefore free, Health Service will put a block on switching women from a drug that costs £25 per annum to one that costs £1000 ; but I intend to persuade her if I can .
