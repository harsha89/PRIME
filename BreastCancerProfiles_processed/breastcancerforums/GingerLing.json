      "Content": "Hi Heather That's OK, a moderator will move the post to the appropriate place. I've re-read your post several times because there's a lot of specific information which is really great. No physician can predict when someone will pass away; however, if you have a real 'need to know' like I do (former sr systems analyst) if pressed they will give you a range. The range I got was completely wrong - but to my advantage! Since I have no expertise with breast cancer, I'm going to defer to others with expertise in breast cancers. We are all tripping over this uber scary cancer thing. I wish you well in your journey; pop in and keep us up to date or vent if needed.",

However, cancer isn't what it used to be, and there are many, many survivors. This is truly a new era for healing. Share with your PCP all that you know, do your best to support your Mom & Dad and make sure you take care of yourself. Hugs!",
