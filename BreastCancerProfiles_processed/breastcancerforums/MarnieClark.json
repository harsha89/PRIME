      "Content": "Hi there - Yes, I'm an 8-year breast cancer survivor and I used thermography but only after my breast cancer diagnosis. I loved it. I found it to be an incredibly useful diagnostic tool and in fact I wrote a blog post about it which you can check out here: < link deleted as per policy...please read our policies and comply> The reason I used it after the breast cancer diagnosis was because I liked the idea of seeing potential hot spots that might become a problem later on down the track (I didn't have any, luckily!). It's sad that the cost of this treatment usually isn't covered by insurance - at least in America it isn't, it was by some insurance companies in Australia. I believe we should have better access to this mode of diagnostic imaging.",

Just for future reference, you might like to know about Thermal Imaging as another form of diagnostics for dense breasts. I wrote a blog post about it and here's the link to it:Link removed as it is not to a personal blog. I am an 8-year breast cancer survivor and I write a daily blog about getting through breast cancer, but also tips on how to keep yourself healthy. Hope you find it helpful.
