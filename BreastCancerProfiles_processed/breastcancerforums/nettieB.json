      "Content": "I have not been diagnosed and I am 41 yrs old.....Hello back in April I had my baseline mammograms and they saw something and brought me back in for a compression test and a u/s then decided that I didn't need the u/s that I needed to have a biopsy..I went to a well known breast cancer center and they did a 3D mammogram and an u/s..now the first place had me listed as a birads 3 then at the 2nd place still has me as a 3 but in the next breath they tell me they didn't see anything on the ultra sound and told me to come back in 6 months...now I am more confused then ever...my breast is still bigger than the other and now I can feel a lump and now it is swollen in my arm pit..I have no rash and no pain but I have had pain in my shoulder that is real sharp and I have night sweats while even sleeping with the a/c on and I have lost 13pounds with out changing anything in my life...my Dr got my report back from the second place and called me to ask me to please seek a second opinion which I am thankful for cause I didn't agree either with the findings of the second place...a couple of questions I have is what would make my one breast larger than the other and is it possible that BC doesn't show up on an ultrasound? Has anyone else had the same symptoms I have.",

      "Content": "Does anyone else have the symptoms I have had...just looking for a little insight....one breast noticeably bigger, whole arm pit area swollen ( I guess I should say it's more like a thickening more than swollen) night sweats , slight pain in upper back around shoulder blade ,unexplained weight loss ( but I think that is done now) lump that was picked up on mammogram that I couldn't feel back in April but can now, started out as a little pea size but has gotten about the size of a bean. Like I said just looking for a little insight as I have been dealing with this since April and have gotten no answers as of yet and I have a 2nd opinion Dr' s apt on July 11th....",
