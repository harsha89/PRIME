      "Content": "Hello I am new to this forum and would like to ask a question. I am three years in remission from Breast Cancer in january. I was always told by my dr's that i am high risk, i had 8 lymph nodes positive and they took all the rest. I had a lumpectomy and chemo and radiation. I have been on 3 monthly checkups. My last checkup they took my tumour marker, (ca15.3) the result showed that the marker had gone just above normal, normal being 30 mine was 34, march this year the readin was 17, 3 weeks ago my dr rang and said we need to re check the reading so i went and had another blood test to find my reading is now over 60! so he sent me today to have full body ct scans full bone body scans, the results of the scan is saying numerous pleural based nodules and thickening of the pleura bilaterally it also states small nodules in the right lung. I dont see my dr again till monday, can anyone shed any light as to does thismean my cancer is back? and advice would be so appreciated thank you",
