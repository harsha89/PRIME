    "Content": "Hi all, I am 51 and have had numberous fibroids in alot of places, including my breasts. They have always caused pain. Had a large one surgically removed many years ago. After a number of them were found I also had a hysterectomy in 08. No breast problems too bad since then, tenderness etc. but that's about all. I've recently felt pain under left armpit but assumed it was from that long ago surgery and scar tissue, radiologist says no scar tissue. Anyway, I found a lump (showering) under my left breast and it seemed to be attached abit to the wall by my rib. It did not hurt and did not feel like those other fibroids. It doesn't move either. I had a mamo and ultra sound done and was told it could be fatty tissue. They wrote \"A palpable mass should be evaluated clinically, preferably by a breast surgeon.\" The mamo showed no evidence of cancer however. If it is \"fatty tissue\" should I be concerned that it just means they do not know what it is? Their words were, we just interpert, we are not surgeons. Anyone else experience this type of lump? And what advice does anyone have for me, please respond as I am very anxious and my daughter is getting married this october and I am trying very hard to keep a smile on my face! Any advice would surely be appreciated. Thank you, JenDon",
