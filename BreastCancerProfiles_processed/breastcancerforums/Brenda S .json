    "Content": "Hi all, Just found this forum....I am now a 5 year BC Suvivor!...just ended my 5 year tamoxifen plan...was wondering if anyone had any comments on the side effects of stopping the tamoxifen? My BC was at age 52, I found the lump myself through self-exam, it had only been 3 months since my mammogram, which showed nothing....went for diagnostic screening and ultrasound....had biospy, which came back Neg., but Dr that did the biospy was feeling unsure that she had removed enough tissue to get a good reading., so she sent me to a surgeon..He did a lumpectomy and removed the 2mm lump.....2 days later, surgeon called to tell me it was cancer, and fast growing....he suggested doing another lumpectomy but I decided on mastecomy with reconstruction...you see my Mother has 3 sister that already have had BC..one is deceased now from a recurrence of BC.....I had chemo and put on 5 year plan of tamoxifen...
