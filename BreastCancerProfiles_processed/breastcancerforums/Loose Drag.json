    "Content": "My 49 year old sister had a double mastectomy about 6 years ago and has been in remission and doing fine until late last year when she began having low back pain. A bit in denial, she delayed having it checked out until June 2011. Her \"cancer indicators\" were off the chart at 385 and her cancer was determined to be in her bone in the pelvis. Her oncologist has been giving her \"Hormone Therapy\" with monthy painless and no side effect infusions. She has been told this is not a cure but he is very encouraged that her scores have dropped to 104 with a goal of getting under 50. My poor sister does not have the heart to tell our elderly father who lost his wife/our mother to breast cancer way back in 1974 when my sister was only 12 years old. I will be speaking with our father and realize there will be many questions. Is anyone familiar with this scoring of \"cancer indicators\"? What does it really mean? Is it similar to PSA scoring in men? It appears the Hormone therapy is very conservative treatment and I fear that the cancer may slowly grow to an incurable state when more traditional aggressive treatment such as radiation/chemo should be considered now. All indications are the tumor is confined to the pelvis. Thank you for your imput.",
