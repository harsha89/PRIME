      "Content": "I had a mammogram two years after a sterotactic biopsy was negative. Now they recalled me in for additional views for a very small density of soft tissue associated with the biopsy. WHY? There is always scar tissue isnt there after these biopsies. I hhad a bad hematoma which left a residual lump there, and was confirned non pathological. Im going nuts here.They said Probably benign but we want to evaluate?????????????",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by brainman suedonny, I am very sorry that you have this too worry about. Since it has been 2 years, maybe it is just a routine follow-up? I have to have an MRI every 9-12 months to make sure my brain cancer has not recurred. Better safe than sorry. Jim I know, my husband has lymphoma I never had cancer but each test scares me, when something isnt quite right, thank you for following up my question. God Bless",
