    "Content": "Good Morning! I have an appt tomorrow afternoon with my Dr to check a lump I have found in my left breast. I also believe I feel a lump in my left armpit. I am scared and concerend. I was diagnosed with fibroid cysts about 12 years ago via mamogram and ultrasound. I have not had a mamo or ultrasound since then..the dr. at the time did not tell me it was something I would need to recheck. I was young ( I am 39 now) and thought that I would just have lumpy breasts. When I called my current Dr about this lump she was a little upset that I have not done any follow up on my breasts since then. Because it has been so long since I was last seen about this issue the nurse said to come see the Dr and she would get a mamogram scheduled. I had an episode of double vision and vertigo this past year. They did blood work at that time and tested me for a bunch of scary things. It turns out my Vit D levels were extremely low. After looking on \"scary google\" I see that low levels of Vit D can increase your risk of breast cancer. I have no family history. My mom does have fibroids as well. She can not feel hers the Dr just tells her about them when she goes in for her check ups. The lump I am feeling is about the size of the pad of the thumb and it is on the outer side of my breast toward the armpit. I am not big breasted by any means and am wondering if that area can even be scanned in a mamogram? Also, if what I am reading is correct as far as Vit D levels and BC. Thank you for your help!",
