    "Content": "I'm 39. I am waiting for the results of my biopsy. I don't know why I feel like its a forgone conclusion that I have cancer & that's it's just a matter of how bad it is...but that's how I feel. I rationally know that I can't jump to any conclusions and that it's important to have a posative attitude (and I always do) but in this case it's impossible. There are 2 lumps totally irregular shapes...doesnt take a medical degree to know that's NOT good. Also inflamed lymphnode. That one just scares the pants off me. Won't find out until Friday...don't know how I'm supposed to deal!!!! So today I'm going to Disneyland. Seems like a solid distraction! So ladies...any advice? Any words of wisdom? Thanks so much!!!!",
