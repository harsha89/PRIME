      "Content": "Guys, I am new here and need some advice. I have metastized PC, which was diagnosed in July 2010. PSA 254, now 5.1, Gleason score 4+4 with some 4+5, treatment has been Cosudex for 1 month and then Zoladex 3 monthly since. I have no pain or sympthoms other than urinary frequency and of course the total package of SE from the HT. My PSA got down to 3.2 in April 2011, since April my PSA see sawed up and down to 6.1 in June 2012, I joined the Prevail clinical trial of MDV3100 in December 2011. My PSA still continued to see saw but finally peaked at 6.1 in June and then dropped in July to 5.9 in August to 5.1, maybe the MDV is starting to influence my PC's PSA number. My urinary frequency has been progressively getting worse, I am now voiding 12-14 times per day. This includes 3-4-5 times getting out of bed at night. I am on Flomaxtra, but this doesn't seem to be making a difference. My question is, the pros and cons of a standard TURP, greenlight laser or holmium laser . Which should give me the best outcome, shortest time in hospital, shortest time with catheter, and least likely to make my PC worse ? I understand the holmium laser gives the opportunity for pathology testing of the removed bits of the prostate. But if the procedure will likely effect my PC I may be better to put up with the frequency. Thanks",

I am still bleeding a little but it is not a concern, I need to wear a light pad because I am still dripping a little. My flow has improved drammatically and I am now only getting up once or twice a night, whereas prior I was getting up 5-6 times a night. The only downside is the urgency, when I feel the need to void I have to make tracks to the toilet because there is no holding back. I hope this will improve with time.",

      "Content": "Sequoiaranger, I have been on MDV3100 since December 2011. My PSA started in July 2010 at 254 by 1/4/2011 had come down to 3.2, then progressively increased until May 2012. Bone and CT scans in July 2010 confirmed metastized PC to lymph nodes and bones. Scans in December 2011 showed increased PC in my bones. MDV3100 didn't seem to do much until June 2012 when scans still showed evidence of PC but were classified as unmeasurable. This is a miracle. My PSA has stablised at around 6.4, I am very fortunate that so far I have no bone pain. The SE from MDV are very manageable, Hot flushes, headaches and diarrhoea. In my case these come and go. The hot flushes I get from Zoladex anyway, the headaches and diarrhoea are now getting less frequent, in fact in September were virtually non existent. My PSA didn't follow the trend shown in the Affirm trial where 80% of the guys showed a dramatic drop in their PSA, naturally I fell into the 20% where there was no reduction in PSA. Zoladex basically only worked for about 8 months for me before my PSA was on the increase.",

      "Content": "Sequolaranger, I was Dx with PC in July 2010 aged 66, my PSA was 254, my biopsy result was Gleason 9 in 50%, Gleason 8 from 40% and 1 negative from 12 cores. CT and Bone scans confirmed Metastized PC in my bones and lymph nodes. I started Cosudex late July 2010 for 4 weeks and had my first Zoladex injection mid August 2010. I am still on quarterly injections, my next is in November. I am very fortunate I am not in any pain, the only symptom I have is urinary frequency (and this is not necessarily a symptom of PC). The only indicator I have of PC is my PSA, Biopsy results and the evidence of my scans. About the same time I found I needed cardiac surgery requiring a double bypass and a new valve. The rehabilitation for the heart surgery and subsequent doctors visits, tests and physical rehabilitation in the hospital gym kept me fairly busy and I didn\u2019t have time to worry too much about my PC, even my cardiologist said to me your heart is more important it could kill you, your PC won\u2019t ! My PSA started to come down and the urologist was happy with the results, I still was very naïve and knew almost nothing about PC and the SE of the treatment. In hindsight I am very disappointed with the quality and amount of the information I was given at the time of diagnosis. I was given no information about the SE, particularly the sexual side. I remember rather casually being asked, have you finished your family? At the time I didn\u2019t put any emphasis on this because I was 66, married 39 years and have 3 daughters in their 30\u2019s and soon to become a grandfather for the first time I also was in shock and it was all a blurr, I didn\u2019t know what questions to ask so you just go along with the diagnosis and recommended treatment. I do remember being told because of the stage of my PC it was a waste of time removing my prostate. Also my PSA \u201cshould\u201d come down to well under 1 and he would be seeing me for many years. Again in hindsight very sugar coated. After about 8 months my PSA was down to 3.2 (April 2011) this was as low as it got. After April my PSA started to rise again and over the next 6 months my PSA almost doubled. After getting over my cardiac surgery I thought more about my PC and decided to do some research and find out more about this cancer. I was shocked to see the information and the information I wasn\u2019t told about. I also discovered information about clinical trials and decided that I would join a trial in the future when my cancer started to take off. Little did I know that this was going to be sooner than later. I had follow up scans in November 2011 which confirmed the cancer in my bones had progressed. I had read about MDV3100 and was impressed with the results of the Affirm trial and decided that the Prevail trial sounded like the suitable trial for me, that is if I was selected. I had my physical, blood tests, and medical reports assessed and I was told I qualified. I think there were less than 10 positions available at my hospital. I took all of 10 seconds to accept the offer. I started the trial mid December 2011, I was fully aware and worried that I would get the placebo but was prepared to take the risk. My PSA continued to go up and down over the next 5 months, my bi-monthly scans indicated no change from the starting scans. I was getting depressed and worried that I had made the wrong choice and had scored the Placebo. However, come June 2012 the scans still showed evidence of my PC but the cancer was now classified as unmeasurable. This is a miracle; my August scans showed no change from June and again was classified as unmeasurable. My October 2012 PSA is now back to about the same as in October 2011. My PSA hasn\u2019t showed the dramatic drop in level that about 80% of the Affirm Trial participants enjoyed. I obviously fall into the other 20%. The PSA number is difficult, your life hinges around this number, if it is up you are down if the number is down you are up. (bit like an umbrella in wet weather !) From the SE side of things on Zoladex, I suffered from hot flushes, fatigue, ED, penile shrinkage,depression, short term memory loss, weight gain, loss of stamina, loss of muscle strength, got irritable, am very emotional, easily upset over trivial times. All this has put a huge strain on our marriage and I find that my wife really doesn\u2019t understand what I am going through emotionally. On the sexual side of things I really didn\u2019t notice any real change until after my cardiac recovery, because I was forbidden to have intercourse until November/December 2010 because of the breast bone still knitting together. I did notice that I wasn\u2019t waking up with my usual morning erection but really didn\u2019t put 2 and 2 together. After I started the MDV3100 trial, the only changes to the existing SE was a little more fatigue, headaches and diarrhoea. Also an increase in my blood pressure. I am still receiving quarterly Zoladex injections, I still work full time and work 10+ hours per day 5 days a week. Some of the fatigue can be attributed to my working hours. But prior to my PC Dx I really didn\u2019t suffer from much fatigue. I am project manager responsible for the maintenance of the plant and equipment, building maintenance, equipment purchasing and factory expansion, so I have a very active working day. The headaches and diarrhoea are getting less frequent, infact I had no diarrhoea in September. My body must be getting accustomed to the drug. The SE as far as I am concerned are easily manageable and there is no way I could class the fatigue as extreme. I still have the other SE from the Zoladex but I suppose I am slowly getting a little more tolerant of these. My BP has been another story, my Doctors have spent from January 2012 until now tweaking my BP medication in an attempt to keep my BP down. I have been changing, reducing, increasing or adding BP medication to lower and keep my BP down. The last 2-3 weeks has been a lot better and my BP seems to be much lower and an acceptable level. I have also joined a gym in an attempt to increase my muscle strength and stamina in my legs, I have been finding even though I am active the (Zoladex) treatment is effecting my stamina. I am on the standard dose of MDV3100 (I can\u2019t get used to calling it by it\u2019s new fangled name) this is 4 x 40mg once a day, I take mine every evening around 6.30pm. The initial trials seemed to indicate that 4x40mg was the optimum dose, it doesn\u2019t need to be taken before or after food, just around the same time each day. I am also allowed to take my other medication at the same time. I don\u2019t notice any effects of the MDV after taking it. The only thing is the capsules are huge and they need to be swallowed one at a time, my other medication I take a handful in one gulp ! I hope this gives you some insight into my experience with my Dx, PC and the trial. It is still early days, but so far the drug seems to have put a slow down to the advancement of my PC. For this I am eternally grateful and am very thankful to the developers of MDV3100.",

      "Content": "What the others have said is true, there is no use having a prostatectomy if the cancer has moved on. There is no benefit of doing the operation in an attempt to cure the cancer, all you are going to do is go through a major operation, suffer from incontinence all for nothing, initially the standard treatment is hormone treatment, this can work for a short period or many years. At this stage there doesn't seem to be a way of determining easily what sort of PC you have and the likely timeframe hormones are going to be effective or infact if you require any treatment at all other than active surveilence. The time just depends on the individual cancer, in my case it only worked for about 9 months before my PSA started to rise. Initially my PSA went from 254 to 3.2 over 9 months, it then went up to 8.1 in 18 months. HT for me is still sort of working, it has slowed the cancer down, but I have also joined the Prevail trial of Xtandi which I have been in for some 15 months now, this has also helped shrink the metastised cancer in my bones.",
