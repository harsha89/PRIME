He also said that the cancer was \"close\" to the wall of the prostate, but it did not break the wall of the prostate. My father had prostate cancer. He went the radiation route (1980 ish), and ended up with a bag for both pee and poo, which I do not want to go through.

      "Content": "Thanks for all the input. You guys are great. This forum really helps a lot. BTW, I was Gleason (3+3) before the operation.... post mortem on the prostate was (4+3). I went to the Doc today.... He again urged me to do the radiation. He said he was not concerned with the doubling of the PSA , since the numbers were so small, but he did say that the results indicate to him that there is some cancer cells remaining. We discussed the radiation and what was involved... he thought the comment made earlier about the shotgun and sighted rifle was a perfect analogy.... They have come a long way. For now, we have decided to have another blood test in 6 weeks. In the meantime I can check on the doctor for the radiation treatment, and can get a second opinion if I wish.... I think this is a good approach. I am getting past the radiation stigma that I have from my father's experience. If the numbers rise, I will do radiation. If they stay steady... we will just keep doing the tests. Thanks again to all!",

      "Content": "Hi. I had the DaVinci prostatectomy June 2013. I had a post PSA reading of .02 (Jan 2014). My doctor was concerned for he said he expected a <.02. At the office visit he was even suggesting radiation as an option. YIKES! I had another test last week (April 2014), and the # has gone to .04 I will be seeing him in a few days... I am 62 years old. I do not remember all the results/pre tests, but after the operation he did say the cancer was worse than the biopsy indicated - as expected. He also said that the cancer was \"close\" to the wall of the prostate, but it did not break the wall of the prostate. My father had prostate cancer. He went the radiation route (1980 ish), and ended up with a bag for both pee and poo, which I do not want to go through. Options that I read about do not look good and I really worry about the radiation operation. Any suggestions or advice? Are my numbers that bad?? Thanks much.",

      "Content": "First, check out the sticky at the beginning of the forum regarding the surgery. You will get through it OK. That's what they told me too. For me, the lessons learned are: Only eat soft foods after the surgery. I found pudding and fresh fruit to be my friend. Your first BM is supposed to be a bit rough, but it was absolutely fine for me!! Call the doctor's office if you have pain. I ASSUMED that it would be painful, and ended up putting up with catheter pain for 10 days! The hospital did not give me proper instructions on dealing with the catheter. Best wishes!",
