    "Content": "I changed doctors this year and my new doctor took a psa test. It showed a psa score of 5.72. She sent me to a urologist who thought I was a good candidate for a biopsy. The biopsy report showed that the right half of my prostate is cancer free. The left side has signs of cancer in three of the 6 samples with a gleason score of 3+4=7. My follow up with the urologist was yesterday. He told me that I have moderate prostate cancer and my only course of action is surgery or radiation. I asked about watching it for a while, and he said that that only puts off the enivitable. I am 67 years old. My reading has been that this is a slow cancer and the side effects of surgery or radiation could be worse that the cancer at this point. I am looking for people who have had similar readings to help me decide what to do.",
