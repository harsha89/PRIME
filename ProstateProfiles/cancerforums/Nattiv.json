The last result level (2 weeks ago) was 0.01 - elvetion of 2.5. The PSA level befor my RP was 2.8 and the Glison index was 6. The patological test of the gland after in had been removed showed that the cancer was inside it only and it did not penetrate outside. PSA Cancer is a family story - my bother, my father, some of my uncles and some of cousins had PC. All my blood test are OK. My weight is 75 kg and my BMI 24.5. I am worried. What should I do?",
