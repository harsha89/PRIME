      "Content": "Hi everyone got the news 3-1-13. Basically i have two options radiation or surgery. Told the doctor we were going on vacation in 3 days and he said go away and try to enjoy ourselves that it was caught early. Easier said then done because he also wanted a cat scan and bone scan done. Came back from vacation and saw the doctor 3-22-13 and found out the scans were negative. (Longest days of my life) Had a lot of time to research and try to ask the right questions at the next appointment. He told me I was a T1C,3 of the 12 biopsy's were positive. 3+3 3+4 and a 4+3. Forgot to ask percentage. Dre was negative and my PSA was 5.6. And that the cancer was right side confined. Was concerned about the 4+3 but he was very reassuring we caught it early and because i already decided on da vinchi that almost always the gleason score changes after surgery and try not to get to stressed out. I really liked my urologist he is on the younger side and have read good things about him. He is in a larger group of urologist that all have some sort of awards. My only concern is that he has close to 300 surgeries with the Da vinchi and he has a senior doctor with him and they both do the surgery. I feel really comfortable him as so does my wife. Oh and i'm 56 years young. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Rudy",

After reading a lot of posts on this sight and meeting a friend who had the surgery one and a half years ago with great success. I called for an appointment and got one yesterday only by luck or Devine intervention. Saw Dr David Lee at the University of Pennsylvania. All i can say is WoW. What a awesome doctor with up to 3500 plus surgeries and the most humble doctor i have met. Also Met some of the team that will be helping with the producer. Took their time and explained as much as the could. He ordered a mri of my just the prostate due to my 4+3 Gleason. Said it was necessary so when he goes in he will know exactly what he's up against. (No surprises) I wanted to go to him originally but didn't think they excepted my insurance. They even hold classes for free for you and your spouse or who ever you want to explain the whole process from start to finish. They also have pryer patients come and talk to you. Just a great experience all the way around. Surgery is scheduled for 4-24-13. I liked a quote on this sight that said better to have the teacher than the student. I feel like i not only got the teacher I got the master. Thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "Like Ilance suggested use neosporin or Vaseline on the tip and rub a little on the catheter so when the cath moves around it keeps it lubricated. Keeps it from drying up and makes it much easier and less painless when they pull it. Try to get up and walk as much as you can asap, for me it really seemed to help. Just let the healing begin and you'll be yourself in no time.",

Really liked my first doctor but only had about 300 robotic surgeries....Was concerned about the 4+3 but he was very reassuring we caught it early and because i already decided on da vinchi that almost always the gleason score changes after surgery and try not to get to stressed out. I really liked my urologist he is on the younger side and have read good things about him....And that the cancer was right side confined. Was concerned about the 4+3 but he was very reassuring we caught it early and because i already decided on da vinchi that almost always the gleason score changes after surgery and try not to get to stressed out....",
