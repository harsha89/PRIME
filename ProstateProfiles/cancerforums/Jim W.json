The statistical information shows up in several internet web sites, but is easiest to understand there. It utilizes PSA doubling time, Gleason score, and time from surgery to return of PSA as the basis of the observations. It is completely different than the Prediction Tool of the Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Both of these facilities are high on the list of quality care hospitals. How can they be so divergent?

I have run the Sloan Kettering\"Risk of dying of prostate cancer in men with a rising PSA after radical prostatectomy\" nomogram. Basically, PSA 3.8 before surgery, G3+4, 65 years at surgery and now 72,PSA .238 at recurrence, 17.7 months doubling time, and 81 months from surgery to recurrence. Cancer contained to prostate. No further therapy. With that inputed, the SK nomogram suggests I have a 99% chance of dying in 5 years from prostate cancer. Inputing arbitrarily 1 month to recurrence rather than the 81, it suggests a 2% chance dying in 5 years and only 12% in 15 years. Something seems backwards to me. Has anyone else come across this?

So, we all would like to get to our use by date without something like this intervening. I'm just looking for qualified, informed, information as to the future possibilities.

Ps after was .008 until 12/6/13 when it increased to .044. Then .057,.079,.112,.115,.151,and finally .238 at 6 month intervals. I have a appointment to see a radiation physician this month, but I am a little apprehensive. I'm 71 and in fair health other than the prostate glitch. My older brother went through this same program about 8 years ago and had some unfortunate side effects to the radiation. It also only temporarily set back his psa increase. So, given I'm 71, is the possible trade off of side effects vs possible inhibited psa worth the program? If I was younger, I'm told this would not be a difficult decision. Thanks for your opinion. Again, this is a remarkable site. My meter was leaning more towards the pessimistic side but not any more.
