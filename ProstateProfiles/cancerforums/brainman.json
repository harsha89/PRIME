I can only imagine how devastating Prostate Cancer is to anyone with it. Did you get your Eligard from a reputable pharmacy or over the Internet? It really does make a difference as to how much trust you can put into the product you are using. However, I assume you are getting it from a pharmacy, so that is just a rhetorical question that you do not need to answer. I have read a couple of other posts about men with higher than expected PSAs who also had total resection of the prostate with no signs of metastasis. I do not think they ever found the reason so I cannot even commend on that other than to say that their PSAs were about 10 (if memory serves me correctly). Sorry I could not be of more help. Maybe someone who has more experience with PC will reply soon. My thoughts and prayers are with you.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. The question of a return of PSA after a total Prostatectomy has come up several times in the last few months and again just today. I did some research and this is what I found: In an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association reporting on a study done at John Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, only prostate cells produce PSA. However, on average it took 8 years for the metastasis to show up and cause any problems. According to the authors of that article, in consultation with your medical team, you have two options: 1. Begin Hormone Therapy 2. Wait until the cancer reappears on scans There seems to be four factors to consider in making a decision: 1. Is the PSA above 0.2? 2. Was the original Gleason score 8 or higher? 3. Did the PSA return in less than 2 years? 4. How fast is the PSA rising? Is it doubling in less than 10 months? All of these seem to be negative indicators, that is, depending on the answer to these questions, hormone treatment should begin soon. The link below has all the details including a way to balance the above factors in order to determine how likely it is for you to develop a metastatic prostate cancer. You can find more detailed information at: http://www.phoenix5.org/Basics/psaPostSurgery.html Reference: Pound, CP; Partin, AW; Einsenberger, MA; Chan, DW; Pearson, JD; and Walsh,PC. ''New Method to Assess Risk of Advanced Cancer After Prostate Removal,'' Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol.281, pp.1591-1597. I hope you find this information helpful.",
