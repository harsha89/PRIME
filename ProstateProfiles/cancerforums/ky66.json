      "Content": "Am 56 and for the past five years been chasing an steadily rising PSA. Multiple MRIs inconclusive. Two different biopsies came up with nothing. PSA kept climbing up to over 30. Finally had saturation biopsy. One needle showed positive with Gleason 3+4. Had bone scan that showed clean. No enlargement of prostate. Been doing lots of reading and research...probably too much. Have talked to four physicians. Surgeon says RP. Radiologist says definitely brachytherapy. Another Urologist says RP and ADT. (Was not kind in my response to him) And finally one more says that I am a candidate for localized HIFU to only the affected area, sparing the rest of the Prostate. Surgeon says that HIFU will cause tragic results and strongly recommends against. It looks to me given the near certainty of bad side effects that it is Hobson's choice. Right now I have elected active surveillance, mostly to put off any decisions. However, I feel certain that my PSA will continue to go through the roof. My wife says she will support whatever decision I make, including no treatment at all. At this point, I am running out of rope. My wife is a young, vital woman and sex is extremely important to her. She says that if I get treatment that causes permanent ED that she will still love me and will stay with me forever. I cannot imagine depriving her of an intimate relationship for the rest of her life and having her settle for a cuddle. I cannot imagine trying to continue with the other potential side effects like incontinence, etc. from picking among all of these bad decisions. I already find myself withdrawing. Now they have taken my testosterone medication. It seems like everyone takes about a \"cure\" and \"successful outcome\" which means continuation of life, but at what cost? I keep reading that \"look at every day as the best one yet\" and \"there is much more life to live.\" I am not sure that I want to roll the dice with the side effects. Having struggled with depression most of my life, I find myself looking down into a pit of despair. \"Therapy\" and \"Counseling\" will have no impact on the reality of the decisions to be made. My physician tells me that I can likely live ten years with few symptoms. My boys are grown. I have my wife financially set. Not sure I want to read the end of the story. Not really sure why I am posting. Not interested in a pep talk and no one here can give me an answer on what to do with any certainty...certainly the physicians can't. Guess I just needed to vent.",
