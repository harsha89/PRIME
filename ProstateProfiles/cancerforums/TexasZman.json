    "Content": "Hello, new member first post. In August 2011, I was diagnosed with stage T2B prostate cancer. I had no symptoms, but my PSA was elevated, which was found during annual physical. The cancer was treated with 45 radiation sessions, and since then I have had the expected slight rise and fall of PSA, averaging around 2.3 over time. So, why am I here? In May, I noticed rust-color in my semen. Took me a day to realize it was blood. This was immediately after a nasty case of the flu, and I chalked it up to lingering effects from that. In September, again, I saw blood. This lasted for 2 or 3 days. And now, in October, I am having the same symptom. Is it possible that cancer has returned? I hope not, but I fear that is the case.",
