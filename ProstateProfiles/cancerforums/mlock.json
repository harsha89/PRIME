    "Content": "First and foremost, I wanted to thank everyone on this forum for helping over the last 4 months, learning how to deal with and proceed with my prostate cancer. While I have not posted prior to this, I read a lot of other posts, and it helped me get perspective and understand of what was going on and helped me to think about how to proceed. Because of this, I decided to write up my journey in hope that it will help others that go through this. I\u0092m 51 years old and had my first PSA test in June (about 6 months ago). The PAS was 5.15 with a 11% free. I saw a Urologist late in July, who re-tested my PSA with almost identical results. They then scheduled a biopsy for Mid September. The biopsy led to sepsis. I got multiple infections and spent 11 days in the hospital. I was out of work for a month, and it took me an additional 2 months to get back to almost normal (that brings me to now). While I feel almost normal again, 1 month of no activity and 2 months of almost no activity has really go me out of shape. The biopsy came back positive for prostate cancer (4 of 12 at 3+3, about 30%, some on the left and some on the right). I had an MRI W/WO contrast with a PI-RADS 2 result. Additionally, the Polaris test on my biopsy was (as my urologist said) average. Not high or low risk. After a lot of discussions (doctors, wife, etc.), a lot of research (there is a lot of information out on the web, but sometimes almost too much, and a lot of older information is out there), and a lot of soul searching; I decided to go with a RP instead of active surveillance. My decision was mainly based on the fact that my father has prostate cancer, and it was very rapid. (His PSAs went from around 2 to around 40 and his prostate doubled in size in 4 months, and it was metastasized. That was 11 years ago, and he has been fighting with it ever since.) Additionally, since I am relatively young (51) and my biopsy showed cancer on both sides of my prostate, it would make more sense to have an operation before it starts to spread and while I am young. I scheduled my RP in late February. I wanted to push it out a bit to give me a chance to get back into shape prior to my surgery. My doctor said that they do not like to operate more then 6 months after a biopsy, so if I go past mid-March, I would need to get another biopsy. I am getting a laparoscopic robotic surgery. I am being seen through Lehigh Valley hospital network, and my doctor is very experienced. I had been in shape prior to my sepsis, but it really drained me. I found it difficult to get back into shape, so I joined a good Gym and got a personal trainer. I learned a lot going through this journey. - First, how much the testing is just indicators, not definitive. - Second, how far cancer treatment has come since 11 years ago since my father started going through it. - Third (and most importantly), how important it is to deal with the human side. I read a lot about people who have a lot higher risk PC then I do, and my heart goes out for them. That does not mean it is easy going through this for anyone. I know how hard it was for me to deal with this, and I found it early enough to have a lower risk and more options, but that does not make it easy. It is cancer and there is always risks, emotions and unpredictability\u0092s. I had a lot of sleepless nights and discussions with my wife that lead to tears. Starting to talk to others about it was difficult for me. I tend to be someone who likes to talk to people but keeps my feelings inside. So, I found it difficult but helpful to talk to others. Talking with close friends first was helpful, since it took me a long time to be able to say \u0093I have cancer\u0094, without tearing up. That\u0092s not something I (or anybody) should be ashamed of, just a fact. At this point, I am in a good mental place. I am open with discussing it with friends and co-workers. I am fortunate to have a very loving wife (of 23 years) who has always supported me and been my best friend.",
