      "Content": "Hi everyone my FIRST Post! On Valentines night. I am a prostate cancer survivor. Having a ball of a time on hormone therapy - But at 72 I don't mind as I have a loving wife and a fantastic laptop. Anyway my journey has been easy, the hot flushes keep me warm in winter and I try not to get tired between studies as I nap for half an hour or sometimes an hour in the afternoon - but catch up on my study and research until about 11.30. That nap is a wonder. It rejuvenates me and I don't feel guilty as I catch up later in the day. I don't know what the future holds I have been having cadex 50 mg. daily and prostap every six months. Two years have gone by and being positive about the future is encouraging. So any guys out there have a good Valentines day and I look forward to reading your contributions and supportive blogs.

B I didn't get a chance for a scotch but here in Ireland we have Bushmills, beautiful creamy stuff. So might have one tomorrow. Thanks for the replies and the welcome. I will try and make some contribution, but there are a lot of knowledgeable people on the Board. Dropping a few lines on the Board is really therapeutic. I spent the day today giving a class to junior nurses, and after reading the replies to the thread it put a spring in my step and really I had a great class. the students are all overseas, from Phillipines, Nigeria , Romania and all of them so young. I felt renewed in myself in front of the class. So thanks to all who replied with such a beautiful welcome. I am two years down the road but only seems like yesterday when the GP said give me a bell Brian, sooner rather than later!!! And so the rest is history. Everyone have a good night or a good day.
