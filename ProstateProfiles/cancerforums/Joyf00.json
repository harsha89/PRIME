My man pulled out the questions I had prepared for him and the doctor started completing it for him.

He did (I sent him well prepared lol). As for the discussion... Doctor said I have to offer you surgery and radiation but my best suggestion is Active Surveillance (answered prayer). He commented that it was unlikely for the cancer to spread. Where I asked about the genetic testing he wrote (I think.. doing the best I can with his writing) PTEN/ERG Promack -- very low risk catagory. He is a stage T1c... core was 12% cancerous. Prostate is 60 gms (not sure what it is suppose to be as I was thinking before he said 60 cc). He noted his last PSA was 5.5 (which must have been off bloodwork we don't have a copy of). My guy goes in July for bloodwork and then to his GP in August. October 26th he goes back to Uro and is to get PSA a week before.
