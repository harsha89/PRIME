      "Content": "My father had surgery and radiation therapy in 2014 for 2 cancerous tumours in the prostrate. He had the prostrate removed. His levels went down to undetectable after a few months. They remained that way until his test in April this year, where they had risen to 0.017. He had another test in June and it had doubled to 0.03. Now, he had another oncology appointment today (October 10th) and they have risen to 0.3. That is 10 times what they were 3 months ago. He is feeling physically well, other than severe pain in the hip that he has had since last year. After scans, he has been on the waiting list for a hip replacement at the end of the year. Now, they're concerned this wasn't caused by the damaged hip joint and that the cancer has metasized to the bones. I don't understand this, given that the symptoms presented before his PSA started to rise again and given an orthopaedic surgeon has determined he needs the replacement. We won't know about this until he has a scan in a fortnight. Has anyone else been through something similar to this? Why have the levels gone up so suddenly in the last 3 months and what are the chances that it has metasized with a reading of 0.3? Why hasn't he experienced any new symptoms? (In fact, he has got a lot better lately). I want to be realistic about the possibilities. What sort of treatment could there be and what would be the chances of it working? Thank you so much in advance.",
