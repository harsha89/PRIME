      "Content": "Well, no one wants to get a phone call from their Urologist at 5:00PM, not expecting this until some time Wednesday of the next week, but I did get the call and although I knew the chances were high I still hoped for the best. Yes, I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer. Being very new to this I am still learning about the scoring and what it means. My only experience with Prostate Cancer was 35 years ago with my father who is no longer with us today. A little history; for the past 10 years my PSA has been steady around 2.6 - 2.8 until April 2014 when it had a spike to 5.3, My Dr said I needed to see a Urologist, I did and he said we should do a biopsy. This was something I was scared to death of and ask if it would be reasonable to wait 3 months and run another PSA screen on to see if it was caused by something else. he agreed and in 3 months I went back to the Lab for a draw, well the results came back at 7.0. Now I am really scared but still did not want the biopsy so I asked about an MRI to see if anything can be seen. He and I agreed that if nothing was indicated in the MRI I would come back for another PSA in 3 more months, fat chance, and if there were indications I would let him do the biopsy. The MRI showed 2 indications one on both sides of the Prostate. I was scheduled for the biopsy 4 days latter and was told it would be 4 days before results would be back, go home rest and all that kind of stuff and he would call Wednesday or Thursday with results. That was on Thursday and Friday I got the call with the news no one wants to hear, \"Paul you have Cancer\" I have what he referred to as a medium aggressive cancer in both sides of the prostate, T2C with a Gleason of 3+3=6. being late on a Friday He was unable to set up an appointment with either a surgeon of radiologist to discuss the next steps but he would set that up as early as possible next week. I have told him that I do not think I want to go with anything other than a surgical removal and he said that would be one of the options but wants me to talk with both next week.

      "Content": "Hay folks, I did survive��. Sorry it has been so long that I have not responded but I do want to thank everyone for all the well wishes my day of surgery. So thanks to all. As a progress report what my Dr said should run 3.5 to 4 hours actually lasted 6.5 do to known but greater than expected scar tissue caused by bladder surgery 58 years ago. This extra time in surgery earned me an extra day in the hospital. I have had very low to no pain from the actual surgery but have had high pain levels do to swelling of testicles and my right testicle retracting into my groin. Due to that pain I did return to ER Sunday as I was afraid that something was going terribly wrong. After CT scans and an ultrasound and conference with my surgeon they determined that nothing was a fowl and had me use a hand towl or simular cloth to use as a sling for my 2 grapefruit, I mean testicles and once swelling goes gown all should be better and also suggested that when walking I might want to support them with my hand, which actually helped. That evening my swelling diminished and parts assumed their proper positioning. The next day I had an appointment already with surgeon for evaluation and cath removal, a very welcome thing. Everything went great, cath out and feeling much better. Dr did say he was very glad his assistant urologist was able to talk with him at my ER visit, we discussed the swilling and displacement and was glad it resolved. But if it reoccurs to contact him. Thanks again for the support Paul",
