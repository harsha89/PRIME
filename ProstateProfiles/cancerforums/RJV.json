As the cancer may be outside the prostate ( one lymph node is 1mm oversized) I have opted for hormone and radiation therapy. I have been on hormones now for a couple months and have had a recent CT scan. I\u2019ll get the results on Nov 13th and map out a strategy from there. I opted for the radiation treatment because if they remove the prostate and there is any spread you my have to undergo radiation at that time. Also the less time I spend in hospital the better I like it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ezhelp712 I am a 63 year old (soon to be 64) white male. In August 2012, after experiencing a difficult time urinating, I sought a urologist. My PSA result was 50.11 A biopsy confirmed 6 of 10 samples were positive. CT and bone scans were negative. A Gleason score of 8. The doctor claims I'm a candidate for either surgery (removal of the prostate) or seed/hormone therapy. Would someone please be so kind and share their experiences with the \"seed\" therapy? Advice would be greatly appreciated - I thank you in advance. I have close to the same thing. Gleason 8 (4+4); Prostate isn\u2019t enlarged and PSA was low (2.7) and dropping at the time of diagnosis. CT and Bone scan showed nothing in the bones but slightly enlarged lymph nodes in proximity to the prostate. I chose External Radiation as there was a possibility the cancer had moved outside the capsule. Started hormones (Zoladex) at the end of August and hope to start the radiation early December. To date the Hormones have reduced my PSA to 0.14 Side effects for Hormones have been annoying but not impossible to live with. I will be getting off the Hormones as soon as the radiation is over. The original plan was to do hormones for 2 years but I will be quitting them as soon as the radiation treatments are done as I have some issues with the side effects that are troubling. Memory loss and loss of balance convinced the Dr. to pull me off them. I have a friend who had seeds implanted over 10 years ago and he is going strong today. I also have a cousin who underwent surgery and he swears it is the way to go. I chose radiation because if the surgery failed to get the cancer I would have to do radiation later and I thought that there was a good chance of getting cancer into the blood stream with an operation. The less time I have to spend in a hospital the better.",
