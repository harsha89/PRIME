    "Content": "At the risk of redundancy, something baggy w/ stretch wasteband. In my case I opted for \"fashionable\" leisure / pajama pants thus giving you room to strap on the \"travel\" smaller catheter bag they give you onto your leg. Your title made me think you were asking for more general information about what to bring. I was surprised at how little of the distractions (books, ipad, portable dvd player...) I actually needed. The days I was in the hospital flew by. By the time you're getting bored, if all is going well, they're ready to kick you out. That said, here's one recommendation: an extension cord so that if you bring ipod/pad/phone you can use it while it's charging!",
