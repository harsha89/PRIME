I was told they will fax it over to me or provide it on the next visit. As soon as I have some more details I will post it here. Should I ask for 2nd opinion on biopsy samples that were taken ? Of what I read you guys highly recommend Jonathan I. Epstein, M.D at Johns Hopkins. Also if surgery is my father's choice I will try to get him to Dr. Ashutosh Tewari. Any recommended radiation oncologist is NY? My task will be to educate my father as much as I can and let him make a decision on his own.

      "Content": "Thanks Pratoman. How are you doing post surgery ? Any leaking or other side effect worth knowing ? Should I make an appointment in advance to Dr. Ashutosh Tewari prior he got his test back ? Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. Thanks for book recommendation I will get it today. I still feel like someone punched me in my stomach but you guys are great and I really do appreciate your help.",

Should I make an appointment in advance to Dr. Ashutosh Tewari prior he got his test back ? Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. Thanks for book recommendation I will get it today. I still feel like someone punched me in my stomach but you guys are great and I really do appreciate your help.",

      "Content": "Thanks Pratoman. How are you doing post surgery ? Any leaking or other side effect worth knowing ? Should I make an appointment in advance to Dr. Ashutosh Tewari prior he got his test back ? Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. Thanks for book recommendation I will get it today. I still feel like someone punched me in my stomach but you guys are great and I really do appreciate your help.",

Should I make an appointment in advance to Dr. Ashutosh Tewari prior he got his test back ? Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal.

      "Content": "Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ?",

      "Content": "Thanks Pratoman. How are you doing post surgery ? Any leaking or other side effect worth knowing ? Should I make an appointment in advance to Dr. Ashutosh Tewari prior he got his test back ? Guys what do you think I should do about that other doctor that my father went to about 4.5 psa. He didn't recommend any test. Should I seek legal advice ? I am angry that he didn't tell him to repeat psa sooner nor he did any other test to figure out why psa is above normal. Thanks for book recommendation I will get it today. I still feel like someone punched me in my stomach but you guys are great and I really do appreciate your help.",

      "Content": "After reading few research papers and digging deep into the 4-Methylumbelliferone itself I strongly believe that they are talking about is Silymarin, a flavonoid-rich extract of milk thistle plant seeds. Prevention and therapeutic intervention by phytochemicals are newer dimensions in the arena of cancer management. In this regard, the cancer chemopreventive role of silymarin (Silybum marianum) has been extensively studied and has shown anticancer efficacy against various cancer sites, especially skin and prostate. In skin cancer, silymarin treatment inhibits ultraviolet B radiation or chemically initiated or promoted carcinogenesis. These effects of silymarin against skin carcinogenesis have been attributed to its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action as well as its inhibitory effect on mitogenic signaling. Similarly, silymarin treatment inhibits 3, 2-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl-induced prostate carcinogenesis and retards the growth of advanced prostate tumor xenograft in athymic nude mice. In prostate cancer, silymarin treatment down-regulates androgen receptor-, epidermal growth factor receptor-, and nuclear factor-kappaB- mediated signaling and induces cell cycle arrest. Extensive preclinical findings have supported the anticancer potential of silymarin, and now its efficacy is being evaluated in cancer patients. http://www.lef.org/en/Magazine/2005/...e-01?checked=1 http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/p.../Patient/page2 May have direct anticancer effects against prostate, breast, and cervical cancer cells. May slow down cell growth, as shown in prostate cancer cell lines. Originally Posted by lancepeace I saw this last week from Univ. of Miami.

      "Content": "http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/conte...7/djv085.short Seems like this is very popular supplement for liver in Europe. I would like to find where can I buy that since all studies I found don't reveal actual name of supplement under name is being sold. This just showed up today but this study was already done and published in 2010 Lokeshwar VB, Lopez LE, Munoz D, Chi A, Shirodkar SP, Lokeshwar SD, Escudero DO, Dhir N, Altman N (2010) Antitumor activity of hyaluronic acid synthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone in prostate cancer cells. Cancer research 70, 2613-2623 [PubMed:20332231] [hide Abstract] 4-Methylumbelliferone (4-MU) is a hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis inhibitor with anticancer properties; the mechanism of its anticancer effects is unknown. We evaluated the effects of 4-MU on prostate cancer cells. 4-MU inhibited proliferation, motility, and invasion of DU145, PC3-ML, LNCaP, C4-2B, and/or LAPC-4 cells. At IC(50) for HA synthesis (0.4 mmol/L), 4-MU induced >3-fold apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, which could be prevented by the addition of HA. 4-MU induced caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, upregulation of Fas-L, Fas, FADD and DR4, and downregulation of bcl-2, phosphorylated bad, bcl-XL, phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated IKB, phosphorylated ErbB2, and phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor. At IC(50), 4-MU also caused >90% inhibition of NF-kappaB reporter activity, which was prevented partially by the addition of HA. With the exception of caveolin-1, HA reversed the 4-MU-induced downregulation of HA receptors (CD44 and RHAMM), matrix-degrading enzymes (MMP-2 and MMP-9), interleukin-8, and chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR4, and CXCR7) at the protein and mRNA levels. Expression of myristoylated-Akt rescued 4-MU-induced apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth and interleukin-8, RHAMM, HAS2, CD44, and MMP-9 expression. Oral administration of 4-MU significantly decreased PC3-ML tumor growth (>3-fold) when treatment was started either on the day of tumor cell injection or after the tumors became palpable, without organ toxicity, changes in serum chemistry, or body weight. Tumors from 4-MU-treated animals showed reduced microvessel density ( approximately 3-fold) and HA expression but increased terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells and expression of apoptosis-related molecules. Therefore, the anticancer effects of 4-MU, an orally bioavailable and relatively nontoxic agent, are primarily mediated by inhibition of HA signaling.",
