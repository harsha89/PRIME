    "Content": "Tomorrow I go in for my quarterly appointment with my Oncologist. No one is lucky to have cancer, especially small cell prostate, the prognosis is depressing. But, for some reason, I am heading into my 5 year of recession and my PSA has been .1-.3 over the past four years. I went through what seems to be the only option for treatment, chemo with Cisplatin and Etoposide along with radiation and hormore therapy. It was a tough 3 months, there were many times where something came up to complicate things, like DVT and numerous blood and platlet transfusions. My cancer had metasticized to some lymph nodes which did not bode well, but so far all my tests have come back positive. The reason I decided to post on this forum is that from what I can ascertain from all the reading and research I have done, I am one very lucky man. I was diagnosed a week before I qualified for Medicare and will celebrate my 70th BD in July. It has been a year since my last scan and I am thinking of asking for a bone scan to see if the cancer has snuck back in. Not sure of the protocol of requesting a scan, but for some reason, I want more evidence than the normal blood tests. I have been told by the Doctors that if the cancer returns it will most likely be in the bones or the brain, but I have worked really hard to stay active and healthy to keep this evil at bay. My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of those whose Father and Husband has been going through this ordeal, it is hard on the family and friends.",
