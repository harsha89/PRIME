      "Content": "Thanks HighlanderCFH and Jnight72. I appreciate you taking the time to read my thread and feel a little more relieved you think they may not be related. I plan to be around here so i hope i can offer some advice too at some point. Especially about the speed of the NHS system. Jnight72, wow you were young..was yours an incidental finding by blood test or were you having symptoms? Is a 0.5 jump in PSA quite a large jump for 3 months? Yes i dont seem to follow the norm, Im very young for this but have a very enlarged prostate yet no urinary symptoms whatsoever.... and apparently a low psa to boot. Trying not to overthink it but could it be that its only enlarged in one area and not near the uretha and thats what the endo doc felt in the DRE? The urologist referral cant come quick enough, The endocrinologist who performed the DRE stated i would get an urgent referral but this is the NHS we are talking about so it could be a while. I really wish i had known more about the prostate when i had the DRE so i could have asked him if it was smooth or hard and lumpy. It just came totally out of the blue during a chat about me having testosterone patches...wow! I am nervous that the 0.5 psa could be wrong and fully expect the urologist to test me again once i get to see him. It may be a little while after the appointment as he will want to give me a DRE during the referral. I seem to read about certain things that can make a psa high but not much about it being falsely low. Does this happen very often? Like Highlander stated, its the trend thats important but i also dont want the starting point to be high either. Well the Ultrasound on my abdomen didnt happen. My GP originally gave me a form and told me to ring the clinic and book an appointment which i did. When i arrived yesterday they informed me that it was a mistake and my GP should have sent the form to the clinic when the sonogramist would look it up and decide on a date. Suffice to say i wasnt happy and now have to wait until i get a new date....More waiting!! Been struggling with the abdomen/groin pain. I think the pain is lower than i first thought, Its just above and to the side of the pubic bone. Does your intestines/colon even go that far down. Also would i get pains in my back/pelvis and rectum/underneath my scrotum if it was prostate related rather than front abs. I cant seem to find anything about it on the NHS website. Sorry, im asking questions again. The waiting is the worst part. Your brain goes into overdrive! Thanks again",

      "Content": "I agree what you are saying highlander, however im talking about me NOT having any urinary problems so was stating i was worried that mine could be a tumour that is not central and started on the edge of the prostate and can be felt during a DRE without any urinary symptoms. Im sure this happens quite alot. As strange as it seems i would be less anxious if i was getting urinary symptoms as it would suggest BPH. Can i ask you about your ibs pains. My pain is a constant ache whether ive had a bowel movement or eaten or not eaten. It is central just above the pubic bone and never fluctuates from that small spot. Everything i read suggests ibs should subside with a bm and the place of pain is all over the bowels. This is why i dont think mine is ibs. Furthermore, the only rest bite from the pain is if i sleep on my side and the pain is just slightly less. This makes me worry that its something pressing against something but is aleviated slightly dependant on my position.",

      "Content": "Hi Im new to this site but have spent last night reading these threads and am thankful that there are so many caring and smart people on here. I just have a few questions regarding my prostate problem. I havent been diagnosed yet and suffice to say at my age i didnt even think about my prostate until yesterday at the docs. Heres my story...... I am just 44 (B/D in August) and live in England so all my medical needs are met by the NHS here. I have been feeling weak, lack of energy and lathargic for a few years now and had many blood tests, all fine. I also get shortness of breath and 18 months ago had a CT on my lungs but all came back fine. Ive also been getting bone pains in my lower back/sacrum for the last 18 months and around 12 months in my hip. The pains are mostly a constant ache but get more painful if i stand or walk for long periods of time. I cannot workout so limit myself to 30 minute walks. The pains feel worse in bed when i guess i think about them more and i cant lay on the side of my left hip as it hurts too much after a period of time. i had put the pains down to getting older and all meds ive taken in the 12 months havent done anything. A month ago i have developed a bone pain in my TMJ. Im hoping its not linked. I also have had abdominal pains for a while now but recently has become a constant ache. 2 years ago the doc told me it was ibs (without any tests) but trying 3 different lots of ibs meds have done nothing. The pain is central directly below the navel. Due to having Gynecomastia (even though im slim) and low vitamin d levels i have been under the endocrinologist dept at my local hospital. They also found i have low testostone levels. Impotantly they did a PSA test last week and it came back at a low 0.5. It was only when i mentioned the bone pains and abdominal pains that the endocrinologist did a DRE on my prostate as it hadnt been done before. He found the prostate to be very enlarged but didnt mention if it was hard or lumpy. I could tell by his face he was concerned and is making an urgent referral with a urologist whch has now got me spooked. I have had no other prostate problems. No problems urinating or ejaculating, good urine flow, no stop start, no night-time bathroom visits etc. This really just came out of the blue to me. So at home i started reading about enlarged prostate but when i put in bone pain all google kept bringing up was prostate cancer!!!! so here are my questions.... Firstly, Am i over-reacting here? am i reading Dr Google too much? Everything online suggests 0.5 is a good psa but has anyone on here had a low psa and still been diagnosed with PC? Can someone really have bone mets with a psa of 0.5? Could the psa result be incorrect? ive only ever had this one. Shouldnt i have urinary problems if i have such a large BPH? Should my psa be higher than 0.5 with BPH? Is BPH common in a 44 year old male? Is the fact that ive had these bone pains for 18 months (back) and 12 months (hip) without too much progression a good thing regarding it being linked to my prostate? Did anyone have abdominal pains prior to diagnosis? im having a normal ultrasound tomorrow on my abdomen for this. Should i mention that the endo doc said my prostate is enlarged? Will they even be able to see anything with my prostate with a normal ultrasound? Im just so shocked by all this. Im just worried that if all these are linked it could be a death sentence and its all happened in a day. Stats for the UK show only 69 out of 2.1m males in my age group were diagnosed with PC in 2011. And surely the stats are even lower for PC to be in bones at diagnosis. So sorry for venting my worries and all the questions. I just feel numb at the moment as i have a young family.",

      "Content": "Hi Im new to this site but have spent last night reading these threads and am thankful that there are so many caring and smart people on here. I just have a few questions regarding my prostate problem. I havent been diagnosed yet and suffice to say at my age i didnt even think about my prostate until yesterday at the docs. Heres my story...... I am just 44 (B/D in August) and live in England so all my medical needs are met by the NHS here. I have been feeling weak, lack of energy and lathargic for a few years now and had many blood tests, all fine. I also get shortness of breath and 18 months ago had a CT on my lungs but all came back fine. Ive also been getting bone pains in my lower back/sacrum for the last 18 months and around 12 months in my hip. The pains are mostly a constant ache but get more painful if i stand or walk for long periods of time. I cannot workout so limit myself to 30 minute walks. The pains feel worse in bed when i guess i think about them more and i cant lay on the side of my left hip as it hurts too much after a period of time. i had put the pains down to getting older and all meds ive taken in the 12 months havent done anything. A month ago i have developed a bone pain in my TMJ. Im hoping its not linked. I also have had abdominal pains for a while now but recently has become a constant ache. 2 years ago the doc told me it was ibs (without any tests) but trying 3 different lots of ibs meds have done nothing. The pain is central directly below the navel. Due to having Gynecomastia (even though im slim) and low vitamin d levels i have been under the endocrinologist dept at my local hospital. They also found i have low testostone levels. Impotantly they did a PSA test last week and it came back at a low 0.5. It was only when i mentioned the bone pains and abdominal pains that the endocrinologist did a DRE on my prostate as it hadnt been done before. He found the prostate to be very enlarged but didnt mention if it was hard or lumpy. I could tell by his face he was concerned and is making an urgent referral with a urologist whch has now got me spooked. I have had no other prostate problems. No problems urinating or ejaculating, good urine flow, no stop start, no night-time bathroom visits etc. This really just came out of the blue to me. So at home i started reading about enlarged prostate but when i put in bone pain all google kept bringing up was prostate cancer!!!! so here are my questions.... Firstly, Am i over-reacting here? am i reading Dr Google too much? Everything online suggests 0.5 is a good psa but has anyone on here had a low psa and still been diagnosed with PC? Can someone really have bone mets with a psa of 0.5? Could the psa result be incorrect? ive only ever had this one. Shouldnt i have urinary problems if i have such a large BPH? Should my psa be higher than 0.5 with BPH? Is BPH common in a 44 year old male? Is the fact that ive had these bone pains for 18 months (back) and 12 months (hip) without too much progression a good thing regarding it being linked to my prostate? Did anyone have abdominal pains prior to diagnosis? im having a normal ultrasound tomorrow on my abdomen for this. Should i mention that the endo doc said my prostate is enlarged? Will they even be able to see anything with my prostate with a normal ultrasound? Im just so shocked by all this. Im just worried that if all these are linked it could be a death sentence and its all happened in a day. Stats for the UK show only 69 out of 2.1m males in my age group were diagnosed with PC in 2011. And surely the stats are even lower for PC to be in bones at diagnosis. So sorry for venting my worries and all the questions. I just feel numb at the moment as i have a young family.",

      "Content": "thanks shittingbricks (love the username) it also fits me at the moment. I see you are a fellow Brit, how did you find the NHS? My problem is im a worrier and so the NHS does not fit in well with me as its bureaucratic and you cant get answers easily. For example i cant get hold of the endocrinologist to check the psa level is definitely 0.5. It was handwritten in his notes and i'm finding it hard to focus on anything else as that changes everything. If that was written wrong then it goes from small problem to possible prostate cancer with mets. Its a deal changer. He wasnt concentrating on the psa so it may have just been a quick scribble. His face after the DRE is what spooked me, his manner changed, even his voice. Would he send me to a urologist anyway once he found the prostate was enlarged? Its his words \"urgent referral\" that bothers me. Is it possible that the prostate is only enlarged in a certain area (tumour) and thats why im not getting any urinary problems. there i go again, over thinking!! I would rather ask here than start looking through Dr Google as all i ever see is bad news on there. Well at least its nearly the weekend and i can kill a few more braincells with beer to stop me worrying. and breathe!",

      "Content": "Thanks HighlanderCFH and Jnight72. I appreciate you taking the time to read my thread and feel a little more relieved you think they may not be related. I plan to be around here so i hope i can offer some advice too at some point. Especially about the speed of the NHS system. Jnight72, wow you were young..was yours an incidental finding by blood test or were you having symptoms? Is a 0.5 jump in PSA quite a large jump for 3 months? Yes i dont seem to follow the norm, Im very young for this but have a very enlarged prostate yet no urinary symptoms whatsoever.... and apparently a low psa to boot. Trying not to overthink it but could it be that its only enlarged in one area and not near the uretha and thats what the endo doc felt in the DRE? The urologist referral cant come quick enough, The endocrinologist who performed the DRE stated i would get an urgent referral but this is the NHS we are talking about so it could be a while. I really wish i had known more about the prostate when i had the DRE so i could have asked him if it was smooth or hard and lumpy. It just came totally out of the blue during a chat about me having testosterone patches...wow! I am nervous that the 0.5 psa could be wrong and fully expect the urologist to test me again once i get to see him. It may be a little while after the appointment as he will want to give me a DRE during the referral. I seem to read about certain things that can make a psa high but not much about it being falsely low. Does this happen very often? Like Highlander stated, its the trend thats important but i also dont want the starting point to be high either. Well the Ultrasound on my abdomen didnt happen. My GP originally gave me a form and told me to ring the clinic and book an appointment which i did. When i arrived yesterday they informed me that it was a mistake and my GP should have sent the form to the clinic when the sonogramist would look it up and decide on a date. Suffice to say i wasnt happy and now have to wait until i get a new date....More waiting!! Been struggling with the abdomen/groin pain. I think the pain is lower than i first thought, Its just above and to the side of the pubic bone. Does your intestines/colon even go that far down. Also would i get pains in my back/pelvis and rectum/underneath my scrotum if it was prostate related rather than front abs. I cant seem to find anything about it on the NHS website. Sorry, im asking questions again. The waiting is the worst part. Your brain goes into overdrive! Thanks again",

      "Content": "I agree what you are saying highlander, however im talking about me NOT having any urinary problems so was stating i was worried that mine could be a tumour that is not central and started on the edge of the prostate and can be felt during a DRE without any urinary symptoms. Im sure this happens quite alot. As strange as it seems i would be less anxious if i was getting urinary symptoms as it would suggest BPH. Can i ask you about your ibs pains. My pain is a constant ache whether ive had a bowel movement or eaten or not eaten. It is central just above the pubic bone and never fluctuates from that small spot. Everything i read suggests ibs should subside with a bm and the place of pain is all over the bowels. This is why i dont think mine is ibs. Furthermore, the only rest bite from the pain is if i sleep on my side and the pain is just slightly less. This makes me worry that its something pressing against something but is aleviated slightly dependant on my position.",

      "Content": "Thanks HighlanderCFH and Jnight72. I appreciate you taking the time to read my thread and feel a little more relieved you think they may not be related. I plan to be around here so i hope i can offer some advice too at some point. Especially about the speed of the NHS system. Jnight72, wow you were young..was yours an incidental finding by blood test or were you having symptoms? Is a 0.5 jump in PSA quite a large jump for 3 months? Yes i dont seem to follow the norm, Im very young for this but have a very enlarged prostate yet no urinary symptoms whatsoever.... and apparently a low psa to boot. Trying not to overthink it but could it be that its only enlarged in one area and not near the uretha and thats what the endo doc felt in the DRE? The urologist referral cant come quick enough, The endocrinologist who performed the DRE stated i would get an urgent referral but this is the NHS we are talking about so it could be a while. I really wish i had known more about the prostate when i had the DRE so i could have asked him if it was smooth or hard and lumpy. It just came totally out of the blue during a chat about me having testosterone patches...wow! I am nervous that the 0.5 psa could be wrong and fully expect the urologist to test me again once i get to see him. It may be a little while after the appointment as he will want to give me a DRE during the referral. I seem to read about certain things that can make a psa high but not much about it being falsely low. Does this happen very often? Like Highlander stated, its the trend thats important but i also dont want the starting point to be high either. Well the Ultrasound on my abdomen didnt happen. My GP originally gave me a form and told me to ring the clinic and book an appointment which i did. When i arrived yesterday they informed me that it was a mistake and my GP should have sent the form to the clinic when the sonogramist would look it up and decide on a date. Suffice to say i wasnt happy and now have to wait until i get a new date....More waiting!! Been struggling with the abdomen/groin pain. I think the pain is lower than i first thought, Its just above and to the side of the pubic bone. Does your intestines/colon even go that far down. Also would i get pains in my back/pelvis and rectum/underneath my scrotum if it was prostate related rather than front abs. I cant seem to find anything about it on the NHS website.
