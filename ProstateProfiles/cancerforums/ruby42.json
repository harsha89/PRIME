We are considering either Dr. Tewari or Dr. Samadi in NYC and I was curious about any experiences users have had with either doctor and factors you looked at in making the decision. One question that has seem to come up on prior posts was whether either of the doctors run multiple rooms or have residents perform some of the surgery. Would appreciate providing of first hand experience on any of these questions. Thanks for any advice.",
