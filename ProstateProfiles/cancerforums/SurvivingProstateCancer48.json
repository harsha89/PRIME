There is a really good article about this latest study here at http://www.prostate.net/2013/prostat...-cancer-study/ There is so much more evidence saying that Omega-3 helps prevent prostate cancer, but the media loves to jump on the one study that finds the opposite. There is a lot of interesting information. Hope you find it helpful.",

      "Content": "I have done a lot of research on these medications. What I recently learned about Provenge is that is works really well on patients with prostate cancer that has spread but who have lower PSA and no symptoms to almost no symptoms. When I broke down the data I saw that patients with PSA less than 22.1 ng/ml they survived a median of 41.4 months compared to 28.3 for the placebo. That is over a year difference. Men with higher PSA like over 134.1 the difference between placebo group was only 2.8 months. So if you don't have symptoms, immunotherapy is the way to go. Also, I learned that the drug company will help you pay for the treatment or even help with copay costs if it is covered by insurance.
