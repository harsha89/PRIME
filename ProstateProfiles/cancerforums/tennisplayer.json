      "Content": "I'm no doctor, but from all I've read you have a pathology that indicates treatment is necessary. I believe both surgery or radiation are options, and I'd encourage you to learn about the various types of radiation available for your case. Radiation side effects are different than surgery, and you should consider that as well. Get another surgical opinion, and look for an experienced person in open surgery. There should be someone in your area of Canada. When I was doing my due diligence I met with a surgeon at Loyola U in Chicago. He is the same age, 67, and had done open all his life. He concluded he was too old to learn the robotic skills when robots came on stream. However he acknowledged robotic surgery as effective and the prevailing choice in medicine now. He was well regarded in Chicago. Chicago also has one of the area's most experienced open surgeons, Dr. William Catalona. Google him, he helped develop the PSA test. Make the decision that works for you. Good luck.",

As such, I did have a surgical complication- bleeding- and ended up with blood clots. Still in all, a year later I'm in fine shape, off blood thinners, undetectable PSA, fully continent, still some ED issues. From what you say, you have a more aggressive form of PC. You are over 70, and seem a little heavy, making you a less than ideal surgical patient. I have read that a combination of hormone therapy and radiation may be the way to go for you. I like that you visited MSKCC. They are one of leading centers for PC care in the US. You are wise to get another opinion from a MO and a Radiation Oncologist. One of the two would probably coordinate your treatment. You should do well if you address your treatment soon.",

You are lucky in that all your cores are Gleason 6, which is less aggressive. In my case I did a lot of research on surgery, and not as much on radiation. I guess I was biased in a way. I had several friends and acquaintances who were prostate surgery survivors. I opted for surgery. I was in pretty good shape and a good surgical candidate. My outcome was good cancer wise, and I've had remarkably good continence. ED is still an issue though. I did have some complications after surgery: some internal bleeding and blood clots. Those delayed my recovery and made the three weeks post surgery somewhat of a challenge. By 6 weeks though I was feeling much better. What I know now is that radiation was a viable option with less SE's initially. You would most likely have an effective treatment if you chose either surgery or radiation. Do consult with some radiation oncologists. They can better explain the pros and cons of the various kinds of radiation therapy. If you are a good candidate for surgery, then weigh that as well. Most patients don't experience the surgical complications I did. However, robotic prostate surgery is still major surgery, done in an area of the body where a skilled surgeon makes a difference. Just remember, a Gleason 6 diagnosis provides you with plenty of time to make a decision. There is no rush! Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi, I used Dr. Arieh Shalhav at U of C. After a year I'm happy with my choice. Shalhav told me he does all the important parts of the surgery, especially removal of the prostate. I interviewed Zagaja, and he said he only does prostate removals. Maybe I caught him on an off day, but he seemed a bit too matter of fact for me. Shalhav consulted with me twice prior to my decision and spent a lot of time answering my questions. I recall Zagaja saying he did the whole operation himself. Don't know anything about the doctor at Rush. I've heard North Shore Univ. Health System has a couple good surgeons, but their names escape me.",

I had an eventful surgical experience as well. I had some post-op internal bleeding, that finally stopped late the afternoon of my surgery. I got a transfusion of 2 units the next day, and was discharged later that second day. I experienced fainting spells- about 4 of them - starting in the hospital and a couple of time at home the first week. The blood loss left me with a large hematoma on my sides. I looked like I'd been beaten. I was also pretty weak and didn't have the energy to walk. I saw my internist 10 days later, just as a follow-up, and he ordered an ultrasound of my legs, just to check for clots. Well, I did have clots in both legs and a small one in my lungs. I was admitted to the hospital immediately and remained for the next 6 days while they established the right level of thinners in my blood. I then was on thinners for the following 6 months. I'm doing very well now, and improved quickly after I got home from the hospital stay. However, the first 3 weeks after surgery were a real challenge. Hang in there. Hope you turn the corner soon.",

Everything I'd read advised choosing a surgeon with lots of experience and good outcomes. I was comfortable with Zagaya, but I knew several people who had used Shalhav, all were very happy with him, so that's who I picked. I got an opinion from an open surgeon at Loyola, Dr. Bob Flanigan. He was recommended as a \"Doctor's doctor\", and I liked him. However he only did open. I think you have good choices in the Chicago area, with several excellent teaching hospitals.",
