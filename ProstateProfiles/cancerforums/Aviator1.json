      "Content": "Hi Everyone. Sorry to have been absent. Will be here more often for the next few weeks. I had the AMS 800 installed a few hours ago. After the typical get there early and wait for several hours, the surgery went very well. Got home about 8 PM. Probably shouldn't have driven at night after getting that last shot of Dilaudid......just kidding, my wife drove home..... So far, I'm having some discomfort in my crotch due to swelling. I was a bit dehydrated from having an afternoon surgery and no liquid intake since last night. Add to that the meds they give you to dry up stomach fluids, etc, and I was thirsty. Haven't been excessive in fluid intake, am getting the urge to void regularly. Flow is a small stream, and I sometimes have to help a little. I again presume this is from swelling in the crotch. Am keeping an ice pack on my crotch for now. Actually feels good. About 6 weeks after surgery last year, I took a fall out of the back of my pick up while washing it. I started passing blood, which quickly stopped. Up until that time, I was making progress towards continence with the Kegels, After that, they did little good. Doctor thinks I tore some internal muscles. We gave it another year and thousands of Kegels, plus a 25 pound weight loss. Could use more more, but. I'm not obese. I'll post another update tomorrow. Would like to hear from guys who have one of these. Regards to all, Dave",
