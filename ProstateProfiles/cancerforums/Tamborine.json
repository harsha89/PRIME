      "Content": "Originally Posted by azsunshine My husband originally thought radiation, but if that didn't work, then surgery was not an option. And honestly, he wanted the cancer out of his body asap, so he can go on with life. He's 6 months post op. Does not leak at all. As far as sex goes, has it changed? Yes. But it is soooooo much better than I ever thought it would be prior to surgery. I think the lack of spontaneity is the biggest change because he does the Trimix injections, we have to plan intercourse. There is life in his penis so as time goes on, we hope we can use a combination of pills and Trimix. I think this sums up our sex life pretty well after surgery. After a particularly wonderful afternoon, he held me and said he knows we don't make love as often, but each time is better and better and he loves me more everyday. I'm glad he chose surgery and now we can focus on life again. Thanks for the response. A few more questions if you don't mind: 1) So, if you get the surgery, does this mean you will definitely have E.D. and require injections? Or does it just depend how the prostatectomy goes? 2) Also, why did you say that if radiation did not work, then surgery is not an option? 3) Does insurance usually cover a prostectomy fairly early in the process if you want it? 4) I take it you were implying that sometimes the surgery can lead to some urine leak? NOTE: I don't really have E.D. now, although I am off of HRT due to this high PSA, so I may get my venous leakage back over the next few weeks/month as I had it before I went on testosterone therapy.",

      "Content": "I was just diagnosed with an elevated PSA of 6.5 and a week later after abstince 5.1. The doctor scared the crap out of me by saying that a) I was pretty young (early 50's), b) no BPH, c) no sign of prostatitis and so I really needed a biopsy because I was probably at increased risk for prostate cancer. Of course, I'm all for the biopsy and already have it scheduled next week. In the meantime I've been reading about prostate cancer and here is what I have noticed: 1) Usually you have time to diagnose it and often it takes multiple biopsy procedures to find that cancer 2) because the biopsy procedure is far from perfect, often PC metastatisizes between procedures 3) once it metastasizes you are in deep doo doo and your odds of survival go down dramatically. So I'll ask the obvious question: Why not just get a prostatectomy early in the process and avoid the risk? Is it because insurance won't pay for it? Is it because it is unusually risky? I've got the wife and kids and am the sole breadwinner. I need to be around in five years and I don't really need my prostate as far I know. Thanks for any perspectives on this.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by azsunshine My husband originally thought radiation, but if that didn't work, then surgery was not an option. And honestly, he wanted the cancer out of his body asap, so he can go on with life. He's 6 months post op. Does not leak at all. As far as sex goes, has it changed? Yes. But it is soooooo much better than I ever thought it would be prior to surgery. I think the lack of spontaneity is the biggest change because he does the Trimix injections, we have to plan intercourse. There is life in his penis so as time goes on, we hope we can use a combination of pills and Trimix. I think this sums up our sex life pretty well after surgery. After a particularly wonderful afternoon, he held me and said he knows we don't make love as often, but each time is better and better and he loves me more everyday. I'm glad he chose surgery and now we can focus on life again. Thanks for the response. A few more questions if you don't mind: 1) So, if you get the surgery, does this mean you will definitely have E.D. and require injections? Or does it just depend how the prostatectomy goes? 2) Also, why did you say that if radiation did not work, then surgery is not an option? 3) Does insurance usually cover a prostectomy fairly early in the process if you want it? 4) I take it you were implying that sometimes the surgery can lead to some urine leak? NOTE: I don't really have E.D. now, although I am off of HRT due to this high PSA, so I may get my venous leakage back over the next few weeks/month as I had it before I went on testosterone therapy.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago The bottom line is that most men with a 5.0 PSA such as your last test, don't have prostate cancer that will result in treatment. Hey, thx for the comforting words, but what would cause a big jump in PSA? I neglected to mention that I have had my PSA read a couple of times per year for the last four years (that I've been on HRT) and my reads have always been less than 1.5. Now I suddenly jumped up to 5.0 and 6.3. I eat incredibly healthy - just trust me on that - and am a follower of Pritikin. I also exercise regularly. But the only explanation I see for the above would be \"prostate leak\" or possibly inflammation. But I don't think \"prostate leak\" is common from what I have read and I live quite healthy, so I can't imagine where inflammation would come from. And thanks for the time...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bob_R Welcome Tamborine, Quite a number of questions in there, I have to guess you are early into the learning curve. The Biopsy is probably the best way of advancing the answers to your questions, given your PSA is elevated this is a flag to say something is not right and needs further investigation. The Biopsy is not perfect however they have improved its application and it has a pretty good hit rate. In my case it painted a very positive picture however post op pathology showed is was much worse. For a PC to metastasize that quickly post biopsy means it was well underway already, they will get you scanned if the biopsy comes back positive anyway. As for your key question why not?, it generally is not a case of why not, more a case of what are my options, what are the impacts/ side effects and have I done all I can to assure myself that what I am being told is accurate. Yeah, I just started reading on all of this. Are you saying that a prostatectomy may not be an option in some cases? Do you mean if it has metastatiszed or what?",

      "Content": "I was just diagnosed with an elevated PSA of 6.5 and a week later after abstince 5.1. The doctor scared the crap out of me by saying that a) I was pretty young (early 50's), b) no BPH, c) no sign of prostatitis and so I really needed a biopsy because I was probably at increased risk for prostate cancer. Of course, I'm all for the biopsy and already have it scheduled next week. In the meantime I've been reading about prostate cancer and here is what I have noticed: 1) Usually you have time to diagnose it and often it takes multiple biopsy procedures to find that cancer 2) because the biopsy procedure is far from perfect, often PC metastatisizes between procedures 3) once it metastasizes you are in deep doo doo and your odds of survival go down dramatically. So I'll ask the obvious question: Why not just get a prostatectomy early in the process and avoid the risk? Is it because insurance won't pay for it? Is it because it is unusually risky? I've got the wife and kids and am the sole breadwinner. I need to be around in five years and I don't really need my prostate as far I know. Thanks for any perspectives on this.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by azsunshine My husband originally thought radiation, but if that didn't work, then surgery was not an option. And honestly, he wanted the cancer out of his body asap, so he can go on with life. He's 6 months post op. Does not leak at all. As far as sex goes, has it changed? Yes. But it is soooooo much better than I ever thought it would be prior to surgery. I think the lack of spontaneity is the biggest change because he does the Trimix injections, we have to plan intercourse. There is life in his penis so as time goes on, we hope we can use a combination of pills and Trimix. I think this sums up our sex life pretty well after surgery.

I'm glad he chose surgery and now we can focus on life again. Thanks for the response. A few more questions if you don't mind: 1) So, if you get the surgery, does this mean you will definitely have E.D. and require injections? Or does it just depend how the prostatectomy goes? 2) Also, why did you say that if radiation did not work, then surgery is not an option? 3) Does insurance usually cover a prostectomy fairly early in the process if you want it? 4) I take it you were implying that sometimes the surgery can lead to some urine leak? NOTE: I don't really have E.D. now, although I am off of HRT due to this high PSA, so I may get my venous leakage back over the next few weeks/month as I had it before I went on testosterone therapy.",

Now, the fact that your psa is tested twice a year and always has been about 1.5, is all the more reason to believe that the 5.0 and 6.3 are just spikes caused by inflammation. Inflammation can come from many sources and need not be even noticed by the patient. There is a common \"asymptomatic inflammation\" that is as it says, just there, cause unknown. very very common. When a psa goes from 1.5 to 5.0 or 6.3 in a short time, that indicates it is probably from a non-prostate cancer causation. Not always the case, as there are some exceptions. BTW, you should realize that the spike in psa can take time to calm down and return to normal. Weeks, months or so. You eat healthy, Pritikin style. I eat in a similar fashion. Hope you have a good reason to be on HRT. Its becoming very popular. Too popular if you ask me, but I know that is a controversial matter.

Many multiples of men are part of this large ongoing experiment, compared to usage in past decades. However there are some real sound usages for certain men. I know they say HRT is not connected to PCa, but I'd still be very careful about using the product. And I'd double check my psa as you are doing often. I cannot thank you enough for the comforting words. Of course, I will continue on with my urologist to make sure it is not an issue. By the way, I had a calcium score of 0 recently thanks to a low fat diet I am sure. I have been on HRT for years and had all the classic low T symptoms and was very miserable pre-HRT.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bob_R Welcome Tamborine, Quite a number of questions in there, I have to guess you are early into the learning curve. The Biopsy is probably the best way of advancing the answers to your questions, given your PSA is elevated this is a flag to say something is not right and needs further investigation. The Biopsy is not perfect however they have improved its application and it has a pretty good hit rate. In my case it painted a very positive picture however post op pathology showed is was much worse. For a PC to metastasize that quickly post biopsy means it was well underway already, they will get you scanned if the biopsy comes back positive anyway. As for your key question why not?, it generally is not a case of why not, more a case of what are my options, what are the impacts/ side effects and have I done all I can to assure myself that what I am being told is accurate. Yeah, I just started reading on all of this. Are you saying that a prostatectomy may not be an option in some cases? Do you mean if it has metastatiszed or what?",

Or does it just depend how the prostatectomy goes? 2) Also, why did you say that if radiation did not work, then surgery is not an option? 3) Does insurance usually cover a prostectomy fairly early in the process if you want it? 4) I take it you were implying that sometimes the surgery can lead to some urine leak? NOTE: I don't really have E.D. now, although I am off of HRT due to this high PSA, so I may get my venous leakage back over the next few weeks/month as I had it before I went on testosterone therapy.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bob_R Welcome Tamborine, Quite a number of questions in there, I have to guess you are early into the learning curve. The Biopsy is probably the best way of advancing the answers to your questions, given your PSA is elevated this is a flag to say something is not right and needs further investigation. The Biopsy is not perfect however they have improved its application and it has a pretty good hit rate. In my case it painted a very positive picture however post op pathology showed is was much worse. For a PC to metastasize that quickly post biopsy means it was well underway already, they will get you scanned if the biopsy comes back positive anyway. As for your key question why not?, it generally is not a case of why not, more a case of what are my options, what are the impacts/ side effects and have I done all I can to assure myself that what I am being told is accurate. Yeah, I just started reading on all of this. Are you saying that a prostatectomy may not be an option in some cases? Do you mean if it has metastatiszed or what?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago The bottom line is that most men with a 5.0 PSA such as your last test, don't have prostate cancer that will result in treatment. Hey, thx for the comforting words, but what would cause a big jump in PSA? I neglected to mention that I have had my PSA read a couple of times per year for the last four years (that I've been on HRT) and my reads have always been less than 1.5. Now I suddenly jumped up to 5.0 and 6.3. I eat incredibly healthy - just trust me on that - and am a follower of Pritikin. I also exercise regularly. But the only explanation I see for the above would be \"prostate leak\" or possibly inflammation. But I don't think \"prostate leak\" is common from what I have read and I live quite healthy, so I can't imagine where inflammation would come from. And thanks for the time...",
