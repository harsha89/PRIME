      "Content": "I was also a great candidate for watchful waiting... According to my biopsy/MRI reports I barely had cancer. But... as small as it was, I HAD CANCER. 6 months later I had the surgery. Get it gone. At my 8 week follow up with the doctor he basically said that he couldn't believe he had suggested that we could wait up to 2 years for surgery. My cancer was 70% of one of my seminal vesicles, 20% of my prostate & 1mm away from metastasizing. It's just not worth the gamble. I'd rather take my odds on the Lotto, the \"what-if's\" are a lot more pleasant. I'm not trying to scare you, each & everyone on here has a different story & outcome, our commonality is prostate cancer. But I think that of all the different cancers out there, we're pretty lucky to be able to just get it cut out. Peace & prayers",

This is why they call it Active surveillance. The problem is that even with a MRI & MRI guided biopsy, my MRI didn't reveal cancer and my biopsy was <5%, Gleason 3+3.

      "Content": "Hello all, This is my first post & wanted to relay my story. I am 40 now, but diagnosed and had prostate surgery at 39 years old. One thing that has made all the doctor's visits & hospital stays more interesting has been my having my 18 month old son tag along. We just got back from my 8 week post-op visit with Dr. Patel at Florida Hospital. He stressed that it was cases like mine that show how vigilant we all need to be with our health. My first biopsy of 12 samples showed only one area of atypical cells, not cancer... The surgeon said that 50% of doctors would have sent me home saying, \"You don't have cancer\". But my doctor, a urologist at Cleveland Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, had found upon examination that my prostate felt flat on one side. Hardly a red flag for most doctors, but my doctor felt that with the increase in the PSA that it required further investigation. So I underwent a MRI in an attempt to locate a specific target zone. But this too proved inconclusive. My second biopsy of 12 samples showed that only one sample had an area of less than 5% of cancer within. Again, nothing here really worth getting crazy over. My doctor gave the choice to us: surgery, radiation or \"watchful waiting\". Even my surgeon on our first visit said that we could do the surgery at our leisure, waiting as long as 2 years. It made sense for us to have the surgery a couple of months later in July. At 39yo radiation & watchful waiting seemed too risky as a husband & father. The problem with watchful waiting was that my prostate was 20% cancer. How the biopsies missed it is odd. Technically we should have had at least 5 samples that were 100% cancer. My surgeon said that at this point 50% of the doctors would have performed prostate surgery & removed my prostate & declared me cancer free. The problem here is that my cancer had spread to my seminal vesicles and had even engulfed one side to 70%. My cancer was 1mm away from exiting my vesicles & metastasizing. The cancer here in the seminal vesicles was the extremely aggressive type, it is literally a miracle that we caught it before it spread further. For my surgeon it is a no-brainer, if he is removing the prostate then he is also pulling out the seminal vesicles, every time. We didn't even know to ask about this. It's been 9 weeks since my surgery now. I've had 99% continence from about 5 weeks. I have complete ED due to the nerves being \"plastered\" on to the prostate & the difficulty getting them off. But I have faith that this too will be restored. I thank God for bringing us through this storm & for my wife pushing to have a baseline PSA test when I was 36. Had I waited as they recommend not having a PSA until 45 or 50 it would have been far too late. If anyone has questions or more, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thank you for the opportunity to share, Oz",

      "Content": "Thanks Fran Originally Posted by ddayglo Did not realize that biopsies could affect nerves that way. Interesting. Also did not realize that some surgeons will automatically remove the seminal vesicles. What use are they after your prostate is removed? Hey Dayglo, According to my surgeon my prostate was inflamed, probably due to the biopsies & my nerves were encrusted by the inflammation. We also didn't know about the removal of the seminal vesicles, until just last week. Dr. Patel has done over 7000 Da Vinci operations and he always removes the vesicles, and my case proves his point as to why he does this. And they are in fact pretty useless without the prostate... might as well get them out too. Originally Posted by MartyAtx Oz, Thank you for sharing your story. You're fortunate to have a very good Urologist.....And, persistant wife! Marty Thank you Marty Originally Posted by Fairwind There are areas off the prostate that the trans-rectal needle biopsy simply can not reach..100% of the gland is NOT sampled, so a needle biopsy can not be relied on to give a 100% reliable result.. It is quite common that after surgery when the entire gland can be examined, 30% of the patients are upgraded to a higher grade of cancer or a more extensive cancer..This is what makes AS a real gamble unless you spend the time and money to verify the needle biopsy results..... Fairwind, that has been my understanding as well and my experience too. It makes sense that if your shooting a ball from one side, not all of it will be represented. But that is where my urologist suggested the MRI. She said it was a relatively new procedure being developed to help pinpoint possible areas for biopsy.",

      "Content": "Yeah it happens. We were in Orlando for my surgery so walking around Downtown Disney with my cath bag was a little funky, by about 10 minutes into walking around my tube started looking pretty bloody. I never used the leg bag as it seemed too restrictive for sitting/lying down & I was given a \"shopping bag\" to carry the cath bag around in. ENJOY it now, drink as much as you possibly can without a worry. Flush out your system. It really was nice to have drank as much as I did & not have to worry about getting out of bed. Some nights I did have to get up & empty it though. Good luck on the recuperation, it's not awesome but it does get better. Good luck on the pooping, I know I was scared out of my mind to finally poop, just take those softeners.",
