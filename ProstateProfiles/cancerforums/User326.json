      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. Just to answer the questions on the delay, there was a plan to do the surgery in Dec 2016, but lost my insurance, my old Urologist did not except my new insurance, which put me back at he beginning looking for a new Doctor who could perform the surgery. It turns out, where I live, there are not many Urologist that perform prostate surgery, and with my new health insurance, I had to stay in network and pick from the list of urologist they provided. After seeing two Urologist, the option I was being pushed toward was Radiation treatment, which was not what I wanted at my age (59) They stated that all their patients did radiation, which worried me a little when I heard that. It was only last month that I met with the only two Urologist Surgeons under my insurance plan that did surgery. One only performed open Prostatectomy, and the second one used the Da Vinci robotic surgery, but had only done a few prostate surgeries using the device, so I was not really comfortable with that. So, I was reaching out because I have an appt on Jan 11, and i'm going with the Dr. that performs the open prostatectomy, seeing he had more experience and time, I but wanted to see if I had time to find a little better option. I tried to go outside my plan, but it was money I did not have. So, this was the reason for the delay, So I did have a plan to take action earlier, but I was disappointed and frustrated, when things went in a different direction. But I guess that's what it is.

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. Just to answer the questions on the delay, there was a plan to do the surgery in Dec 2016, but lost my insurance, my old Urologist did not except my new insurance, which put me back at he beginning looking for a new Doctor who could perform the surgery. It turns out, where I live, there are not many Urologist that perform prostate surgery, and with my new health insurance, I had to stay in network and pick from the list of urologist they provided. After seeing two Urologist, the option I was being pushed toward was Radiation treatment, which was not what I wanted at my age (59) They stated that all their patients did radiation, which worried me a little when I heard that. It was only last month that I met with the only two Urologist Surgeons under my insurance plan that did surgery. One only performed open Prostatectomy, and the second one used the Da Vinci robotic surgery, but had only done a few prostate surgeries using the device, so I was not really comfortable with that. So, I was reaching out because I have an appt on Jan 11, and i'm going with the Dr. that performs the open prostatectomy, seeing he had more experience and time, I but wanted to see if I had time to find a little better option. I tried to go outside my plan, but it was money I did not have. So, this was the reason for the delay, So I did have a plan to take action earlier, but I was disappointed and frustrated, when things went in a different direction. But I guess that's what it is. Thanks for the input. Please add any other info that might be helpful. Wish me luck! Thanks again! report 12/28/2016 Prostate: A-E Benign Prostatic Tissue F.
