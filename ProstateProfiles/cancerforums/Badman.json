      "Content": "Now 7 months post-op and almost completely dry. Still a squirt when I sneeze hard or strain hard. Rarely use a pad unless going social and maybe having a few cocktails. Alcohol relaxes me and then I need more trips to the bathroom. As for sex it's been only possible with TriMix. I do sometimes get \"semis\" but they don't last, however it's a start. Have orgasms and it's different. Hard to explain but I guess it's what it's going to be from now on. Any thoughts on this? All in all I much happier, no more waking up soaked, which is the most frustrating part of RP, in my opinion. And, should I continue with Kegels, as I have lately been lax in doing them?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jfredfc As most have read, I had DaVinci on 1/20//16. Had some issues with UTI'S, including one a week ago, but that has cleared up and I am down to one pad a day. The frustrated part is that at time, I feel like a sexual cripple. I have tried Cialis and Viagra and they dont help but part of the problem there is that anytime, I try to self-stimulate or my wife tries to, I had leak badly. All I hear from the DR is that it just takes time. It got so bad yesterday when we tried, after completely voiding, I leaked real bad, she said she wanted to stop and I got up and left the house for while so I could go scream and cry for a few minutes. At times I just want to beat my head against the wall. Any thoughts guys? Understand what you're going through. I'm 7 months post op and just about completely dry. A few drops when I strain or exercise but that's it and that may be the way it will stay from now on. As for the ED, I'm still about 50%. I now am on a regimen of Cialis and have TriMix injection med when I need it. Being patient and not getting frustrated is hard to do but it does get better. Yes it takes time and you will get tired of hearing that, but it's the truth. Exercising and losing those extra pounds will help also. And lay off the booze if applicable. Hang in there.",

      "Content": "I'd say it's the alcohol in the Nyquil. When I've had a few drinks(Crown Royal), I've had a few accidents like you did. So I have no cocktails or any fluids within 2-3 hours of going to bed. I recently had my left thumb operated on for Basal Joint Arthritis and was given Vicoden for the pain. Had the same experience as you did with the Nyquil. So my theory is that these products relax you to the point that you don't awaken in time when your bladder is full and you leak due to the pressure of a full bladder. So if you drink or are on meds before bed, put a pad in your undies.",
