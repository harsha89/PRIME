      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm a 59 year old guy who just had my first PSA test and scored a 29. The DRE my doctor gave me noted that my prostate was definitely enlarged but didn't feel hard or lumpy. The doctor described it as \"spongy.\" I have my first ever appointment with a urologist a week from tomorrow and I am scared to death about pretty much every aspect of this. My wife is also concerned. I had a physical last week and told my primary care physician I had been experiencing some issues I figured were related to my prostate. Intermittent symptoms of weak urine steam, incomplete emptying of my bladder, sometimes difficulty starting urination, dribbling afterwards, etc. I noted to my doctor that I have been a professional courier driver for 35 years (smaller vans and passenger cars) and a long distance courier for about the past 5. Professional drivers often develop very flat backsides and there is a pretty clear sensation of sitting on my perineum or scrotum which gets pretty uncomfortable at times. We also sometimes have to hold our pee for hours - which is something I've done my whole life anyways I told the doc about 3 months ago I suddenly started having nothing come out when I ejaculate and I said the symptoms with urination probably started 6 months ago or maybe a little more. This is what prompted the DRE and PSA test. The results came back with a 29 which immediately got me a referral to a urologist. The urologist nurse who called to make an appointment also seemed to have a little urgency in getting me an appointment. Of course I am assuming the worst and have been reading everything I can possibly find, including a lot of posts on this forum, trying to figure out if there's a possibility that a greatly enlarged prostate, which is also constantly irritated by my job and which possibly harbors some sort of infection from the endless pee-holding, might shoot PSA up that high. It might be paranoia but all the statistical things I find seem to point to a fair certainty of PCa when a number is that high. Does anyone have any idea what may happen at this first urologist appointment? I don't have any family history of cancer that I know of but I also have a very small sample size for family. In case it matters, I am classified as obese, I have arthritis in several places, I am a severe asthmatic and a fairly heavy drinker of alcohol. Thank you to everyone here. You have already been a valuable resource before I registered today and of course if I get the diagnosis I don't want, this forum and its members will become even more invaluable.",

      "Content": "Thanks, Djin! It's very helpful to have some idea what to expect on that first visit. My wife and I have been together for five years and got married almost exactly a year ago, her previous spouse was an older gentleman who was a lifelong diabetic and had a lot of other medical issues, so she is insisting on coming to the appointments and already mentioned writing everything down.I am definitely the kind of person who tends to trust my memory but maybe I should trust some other smart people once in awhile too. I realize it's sort of pointless conjecture, but I have not yet been able to figure out if some of the non cancer conditions that I know can cause an elevated PSA can push numbers up that high. When I see numbers like 5 or 6 being called high, having a 29 leaves me thinking it can't be anything but cancer. Can a BPH prostate that's also got prostatitis end up in that range? I guess I'm just trying to figure out if that's even a possibility, just to calm myself down until my appointment 8 days from now.",

      "Content": "Thank you to the other folks who responded. I have an appointment with the urologist a week from tomorrow, so whatever is going to happen is going to start happening that day. As far as the weight issue goes, I'm down 68 lb from my highest weight but that was many years ago. I actually have a pretty good diet and I've been steadily shedding pounds for the last five or so years. It doesn't help that my job is very sedentary The alcohol is a problem but I have also stopped drinking for several years a couple times in the past. If I end up having to battle Cancer and a bunch of related things, it only makes sense to stop again. It's no fun to hear that I likely have cancer. If that's the case, I guess the focus kind of shifts to hoping it's contained within the prostate and hasn't spread. I have decent health insurance through work, so what I can do for testing and how I have to go about it is probably largely dictated by what they will pay for. I have little or no resources of my own to pay for anything else. Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm a 59 year old guy who just had my first PSA test and scored a 29. The DRE my doctor gave me noted that my prostate was definitely enlarged but didn't feel hard or lumpy. The doctor described it as \"spongy.\" I have my first ever appointment with a urologist a week from tomorrow and I am scared to death about pretty much every aspect of this. My wife is also concerned. I had a physical last week and told my primary care physician I had been experiencing some issues I figured were related to my prostate. Intermittent symptoms of weak urine steam, incomplete emptying of my bladder, sometimes difficulty starting urination, dribbling afterwards, etc. I noted to my doctor that I have been a professional courier driver for 35 years (smaller vans and passenger cars) and a long distance courier for about the past 5. Professional drivers often develop very flat backsides and there is a pretty clear sensation of sitting on my perineum or scrotum which gets pretty uncomfortable at times. We also sometimes have to hold our pee for hours - which is something I've done my whole life anyways I told the doc about 3 months ago I suddenly started having nothing come out when I ejaculate and I said the symptoms with urination probably started 6 months ago or maybe a little more. This is what prompted the DRE and PSA test. The results came back with a 29 which immediately got me a referral to a urologist. The urologist nurse who called to make an appointment also seemed to have a little urgency in getting me an appointment. Of course I am assuming the worst and have been reading everything I can possibly find, including a lot of posts on this forum, trying to figure out if there's a possibility that a greatly enlarged prostate, which is also constantly irritated by my job and which possibly harbors some sort of infection from the endless pee-holding, might shoot PSA up that high. It might be paranoia but all the statistical things I find seem to point to a fair certainty of PCa when a number is that high. Does anyone have any idea what may happen at this first urologist appointment? I don't have any family history of cancer that I know of but I also have a very small sample size for family. In case it matters, I am classified as obese, I have arthritis in several places, I am a severe asthmatic and a fairly heavy drinker of alcohol. Thank you to everyone here. You have already been a valuable resource before I registered today and of course if I get the diagnosis I don't want, this forum and its members will become even more invaluable.",

      "Content": "Thank you to the other folks who responded. I have an appointment with the urologist a week from tomorrow, so whatever is going to happen is going to start happening that day. As far as the weight issue goes, I'm down 68 lb from my highest weight but that was many years ago. I actually have a pretty good diet and I've been steadily shedding pounds for the last five or so years. It doesn't help that my job is very sedentary The alcohol is a problem but I have also stopped drinking for several years a couple times in the past. If I end up having to battle Cancer and a bunch of related things, it only makes sense to stop again. It's no fun to hear that I likely have cancer. If that's the case, I guess the focus kind of shifts to hoping it's contained within the prostate and hasn't spread. I have decent health insurance through work, so what I can do for testing and how I have to go about it is probably largely dictated by what they will pay for. I have little or no resources of my own to pay for anything else. Thanks again!",
