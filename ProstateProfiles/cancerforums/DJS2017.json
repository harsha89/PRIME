      "Content": "Well, I never expected to be posting on a cancer forum, but here I am at 69 years of age, diagnosed with prostate cancer. I have always had good health, not overweight, plenty of energy and very active. Never had any type of surgery, and no prostate cancer(or any other cancer) anywhere in either side of my family. A little heart trouble in both sides of the family, but I have escaped that. We have good family genes and lots of relatives made it to 90 and past. I went from normal psa scores of under 2 over many years to 18 in a 2 year timespan. My GP(after a complete blood and urinalysis, all normal)sent me to a local urologist who has a good rep, but he likes to do surgery and has done over 900 radical prostatectomies. He did the usual DRE and said though enlarged prostate was soft and no lumps. Prostate size was about double normal. He put me on Rapaflo for 3 weeks and had another PSA. It dropped to 15, so he did a biopsy. Sure enough, cancer. 12.9% involvement of the prostate. One spot on each side G 3+4=7 and a few other spots 3+3. A week from today Dr. and I will discuss treatment. He says surgery is the only option as far as he is concerned. I'm looking at other solutions, especially Proton, as I'd rather not be whittled on. My biggest fears are permanent incontinence and ED. What say you good folks?",
