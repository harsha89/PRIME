      "Content": "Hi Guys I have been having groin/testicular pain for almost a year now. My primary doc had me go for an ultrasound on my boys and everything looked good. This was six months ago and I am still having pain. It seems to be more in the groin area. About 4 weeks ago I saw my primary doc and he asked me if we had done a DRE and I said about 3 years ago. He then proceeded to do a DRE and found a lump on the left side. He then had me wait a week to do a PSA that came out at a .7 He also had me set up an appointment with a urologist. I saw the urologist two days ago and of course wanted to DRE and he felt the same lump/mass. He then explained to me that having a low PSA with the mass it concerned him. He said having a low PSA could mean that if this is cancer that it could be an aggressive one. He had me schedule a biopsy but its not till Nov.27 . If this is an aggressive cancer should I be concerned that the biopsy is so far off 8 weeks ?? Oh by the way I am only 49.",
