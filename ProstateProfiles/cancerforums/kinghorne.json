    "Content": "Greetings - and the very beat of Great Health to All ! As a new member, I would appreciate being able to partake in the experience, knowledge and suggestions of you all. Having received my (positive) diagnosis today, things are still very rather emotional ... I have just turned 65 (Sept) - otherwise in excellent health, active etc PSA's - 2008 - 1,94; 2010 - 2,97; 2012 July - 4,36 DREs all negative till 07/2012 - small nodule on prostate Biopsy Oct 2012 ;- 12 cores, 3 positive (no details) PSA 4,36, Stage T2a, Gleason 7 (3 + 4) My preferred option (of course !) is to Wait & Monitor ...but after studying the Forum here its apparent that I should/must consider a form of treatment - the most obvious and effective perhaps being Surgery and Radiation (IMRT) ? I do not know for sure but must assume that the cancerous cores were from the nodule ? I did not verify or ask the urologue at the time (in shock I guess). Many thankls in advance for your advice. +++",
