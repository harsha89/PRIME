If I have learnt one thing, it is that you can deal with most cancer-related issues - PROVIDED you find them early, and deal with them appropriately and soon.

This is my second cancer in my mid-50s, a bit daunting. I also had colon cancer, a hemi-colectomy, 6 months of chemo - but it looks all clear so far a year or so after my treatment stopped for CCa. Also much to be thankful for. I am winning on the incontinence side, very little left to deal with there. My main challenge left is erectile function. I realise this is early days, but I am keen to learn from the experience of others. I have been on combinations of low dose Cialis, 100mg Viagra, with some reaction recently, but nowhere near penetration levels. My questions are - for those who have regained or are busy regaining erectile function - how did it work in your case? When did you get the first real signs of life down there? My doctor tells me only 15% of men react sufficiently to tablets in the early months, as the nerves take many months to repair. We are now progressing to Trimix, with planned re-testing of tablets every month or so. As a relatively young guy, with an even younger wife, this is still quite important to me...

      "Content": "I have just had another PSA test. While I realise that these numbers are still very low, and I understand that ultrasensitive PSA measurements have issues, etc, I find it hard to ignore the fact that it has increased from an undetectable number (<0.008 ) to 0.013 in about 4 months. The doubling time is about 6 months. (I realise that DT calculations using uPSAs also have issues, but that is the number at this moment.) The fact that my PSA started rising so soon after my RP (about 6 months) leaves me in that grey area where it could be either localized or distant disease. (If it never became undetectable, we would know it is likely to be distant. On the other hand, if it took more than a year or two before rising, we would know that the disease is likely to be local. But at 6 months, it is a guess.) Scans are probably useless at this stage (PSA too low for scans) and I am also not keen to get radiation before I know for a fact that the disease is localized. So, I can't really have a scan and expect to learn something conclusive, I do not want radiation before I know for a fact the disease is local. I am mortified by the idea of radiation, I would really need to convince myself to do this in any event. I most definitely do not want radiation if there is a chance that I just take the risks, but get no benefit, as would be the case if the disease turns out to be distant. So, is it just waiting for me? Anything else I could do in the meantime? Am I missing something? Your comments would be appreciated... D.",

      "Content": "Thank you all for your reassuring comments. Let me pick up on a few points: Radiation. It is good to hear that so many of you have had no or little side-effects. Maybe my issue is that I have had a pretty 'un-statistical' (no such word, I know) run over the past two years. It feels to me as if I have the knack to achieve a poor outcome with these things, almost against the odds. Yes, I know that is not particularly rational. The previous coin-flip does not influence the next one. I have to deal with it and put these thoughts behind me. Having said that, if things eventually do point to SRT, I will definitely ask for your views again. Yes Jim215, I do check my PSA like a hawk now. It feels to me as if I did not do a good enough job of it earlier in my life, and now bear the consequences. Another thing I am busy making peace with. Michael F, I find your case intriguing. I think it is fair to say that there are not too many men in your category (low, detectable, stable PSA). Post RP, mostly men's PSA's are either undetectable, or detectable and rising if not treated. Do you know why your PSA is at the 0.02 mark, and stable? Some benign prostatic tissue? I would really like to be in that category too, now that I seem to be (possibly) waving goodbye to 'zero'.

Maybe some of the brothers with radiation experience will make stab at it. Your question is about the possible impacts of prostate radiation on the ileostomy reversal. As radiation often does irritate the rectum, I guess the answer in principle is yes - assuming the reversal you talk about is to reconnect your bowels as it was before. The actual anastamosis (reconnecting your small intestine to the colon - again I assume) will probably be well outside of the impact zone, so to speak. Maybe those with radiation experience could chime in. Best wishes, <D",

      "Content": "More or less the same information, as reported in the Telegraph: Prostate cancer tumours 'shocked' to death by flood of testosterone: researchers London: A man with advanced prostate cancer is believed to have been cured after doctors \"shocked\" his tumour to death with huge amounts of testosterone. The result has been described as \"unexpected\" and \"exciting\", as most prostate cancer therapies work by depriving tumours of the hormone, which cancer uses as a fuel. Other men taking part in the trial also showed responses that astounded scientists, with tumours shrinking and the progress of their disease halted. Levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), a blood marker used to monitor prostate cancer, fell in most of the 47 participants. One individual whose PSA level dropped to zero after three months, and who shows no remaining trace of the disease after 22 cycles of treatment, appears to be cured, the researchers said. Professor Sam Denmeade, from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore in the US, who led the study, said: \"Our goal is to shock the cancer cells by exposing them rapidly to very high, followed by very low, levels of testosterone in the blood. The results are unexpected and exciting. \"We are still in the early stages of figuring out how this works and how to incorporate it into the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer. \"Many of the men have stable disease that has not progressed for more than 12 months. I think we may have cured one man - his disease has all disappeared.\" All the patients had spreading cancer that was resistant to treatment with two of the latest hormone therapy drugs, abiraterone and enzalutamide. The trial involved three cycles of \"bipolar androgen therapy\" (BAT), which involves alternately flooding the body with, and starving it, of testosterone. The men received high-dose injections once every 28 days. At the same time, they were given a drug that stopped testosterone from being produced naturally. Dr Matt Hobbs, deputy director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: \"This research is intriguing because it offers a hint that - somewhat unexpectedly - for some men whose cancers have reached that 'hormone-resistant' stage, it may be possible to kill or stop growth of the cancer cells.\" The early findings from the study were presented at a symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Munich.

Dr Matt Hobbs, deputy director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: \"This research is intriguing because it offers a hint that - somewhat unexpectedly - for some men whose cancers have reached that 'hormone-resistant' stage, it may be possible to kill or stop growth of the cancer cells.\" The early findings from the study were presented at a symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics in Munich.

In the meantime, do not dismiss the use of the injections - trimix or similar. The thought might put you off, but it is much less of a deal than you might expect. It is easy to do and works very well. It also provides vital blood flow, and helps to preserve the health of your penis while natural healing takes place. Were your nerves spared? D.",

Since it is a single nodule, as I understand it, and they know exactly where it is, why can't they surgically remove it? Imagine a laparoscopic approach where the nodule is targeted, and cut clear from the substrate. Why is that not possible? Or is some highly focal ablation (radiation, cryo-ablation, etc.) possible? Hope you find an effective solution. D.",

      "Content": "Despite the small numbers, my urologist is nevertheless quite concerned about the early rise in my PSA post-op. The timing of the rise, within 6 months of RP, is the first issue we discussed. This is of course not conclusive, but earlier leans more to distant disease, later to localised. The second one is something I have not seen significant discussion of. The larger the tumour volume, the more cancer cells shed before RP. Stands to reason. He said that my tumour volume, 3.9 cc in total (three tumours, one was 2.4cc) was one of the highest he has encountered. This also makes him concerned that the disease started metastasising before RP, and we are now seeing the PSA rise. Tumour volume is more important than percentage involvement, because a larger/smaller prostate size can change the percentage a lot - the ACTUAL VOLUME = DISEASE BURDEN. Despite my small, Gleason 3+3 margin, he is feels that localised disease is less likely. Any views? Could you post your tumour volumes, for comparison? I was hoping for a cure, but now it looks like I might have to start hoping I have 'only' localised disease... Best, D.",
