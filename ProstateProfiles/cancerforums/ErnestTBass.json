      "Content": "First I want to say I've been a reader for years and have always been in awe of willingness to help ones fellow man I've seen here. Now I guess it's my turn to come forth asking for help. I have 2 questions. 1. As you can see I'm having a little PSA issue currently (it ain't really little to me...worrying the stew out of me). My Uro, who has reportedly done 3000 robotic prostatectomies, is very calm about my PSA fluctuations...I'm not. He says he has many patients in this same boat whose PSA is bouncing around but is not progressing. He has always been very confident that I probably wouldn't recur. I believe him but I also know that this is a very personal disease that is different in every man. For the record I talked to a radiation oncologist in Feb who at the time agreed to give more time to see if a trend develops (I have another appt with him next week). Have you guys had much experience with my type situation ? 2. As I just stated my uro/surgeon is a high volume guy who is very good at what he does. When I met with my RO I made the statement that I was also thinking about enlisting a medical oncologist since my surgeon's work was done. He informed me quickly that my uro/surgeon would also be the one who would administer any ADT etc if it was needed down the line. I love my surgeon and would have him do my surgery 100 out of 100 times but he now has so many patients I'm concerned I need another team member on my side to watch this thing closely. What say yall ?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman One other thought\u2026 How does a PSA go from .11 to undetectable in six months? Was it the same lab? I wonder if there was a lab error on the .11. On the other hand probably not because you had the .09 as well. That's a big drop. Thanks Pratoman and best of luck to you too. I was thinking the same thing about the big drop. The urology group my surgeon is with has it's own lab and although they are a top flight, high volume outfit I've wondered the same thing. Getting PSA test results in 45 mins however is nice if they are accurate. I've even wondered if some of my doctor's lack of concern comes from the fact he knows their lab has problems their test results are unreliable as hell anyway LOL. I think I'm going to let my RO submit a sample to another lab as he offered last time.",

There also seems to be an overwhelming majority that agrees exercise should be an integral part of everyone's regiment to fight our common enemy PC. We all know testosterone feeds PC. To my question....can starting a moderate exercise program induce enough additional testosterone production to effect any residual cancer after treatment to the point it would cause a PSA \"bounce\" ?",
