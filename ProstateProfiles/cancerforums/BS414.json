      "Content": "Hello Everyone, I have been diagnosed with highly aggressive Prostate Cancer. I am 72 years old and weigh 310 lbs. My PSA scores went from 2.3 in January 2016 to 5.1 in May 2017. In July 2017 my score had increased to 6.1. I was then sent to get a KPSA that measured 7. After CT scans, MRIs, Biopsy, and Bone scans, it was determined that I have two tumors that are confined to the Prostate. My Gleason scores are 9's and 8's with with one 6. They took 14 samples for the biopsy. They found seven Adenocarcinomas out of the 14 samples. 1.) Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 9(4+5), measuring 1.1cms. in maximal length, 3 of 3 cores, and 50% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 5 2.) Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 8(4+4), 2 of 2 cores, measuring 2.5mms, , and 12% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 4 3.) Adenocarcinoma core (4+4) 3mm. length, 15% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 4 4.) Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 9(4+5) measuring 9mms. in length, and 5% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 5 5.) Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 8(4+4) measuring 3mms. and involving 15-20% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 4 6.) Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 8(4+4) measuring 6.5mms. in length and involving 30% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 4 7.) Adenocarcinoma, Gleason 6(3+3) measuring 1mms, in length and involving 3-5% of the submitted tissue. Grade group 1 My doctor (affiliated with South Nassau Communities Hospital)who is a medical oncologist/urologist said there were 4 types of actions. Active surveillance Cryo Surgery Radiation He said that surgery might be too risky due to my age, weight, a recent bout with respiratory failure/copd, and Factor Five Leidon which requires me to be on Coumadin blood thinner. He recommended Radiation and Hormone Therapy. I went to Memorial Sloan Kettering for a second opinion from a medical oncologist. She agreed with my doctor for the same reasons, risks of surgery vs. benefits of radiation and hormonal therapy. My problem is that my sons and ex wife think I should see a surgeon for another point of view. I basically think I should begin the radiation and hormonal therapy ASAP. Since there appears to be a lot of patient experience in this forum, I'm open to any opinions that you guys might have.",
