      "Content": "Greetings - I was diagnosed yesterday (Mon, 21st) and spent most of last night reading posts on this forum before becoming a member today. I searched the forum to try to zone in on my specific concerns but I feel I need to submit a post of my own as my main concerns may be a little different than most, but I'm not sure. I've had a lifetime of physical trauma injuries from several seperate accidents over a 25 year span, many of which required major reconstruction surgeries in which several internal fixation devices were utilized, skin graphs from being burned over 40% of my body, compound fractures, fractured skull, broken spine, pseudomonis spinal infection from one of 11 spine surgeries and then dealing with the psycological impact of all of these injuries. I've also battled spine cancer that I think was caused by the probably hundreds of Xrays I've had of my spine...I went through chemo and radiation for that.... Anyway, with all the past situations, I was determined to fight back each time but I must tell you, with each seperate episode, I found it harder and harder to find the inner strength to bounce back. I mean you just get tired, you know? My last reconstructive surgery was in 2007 and for the past 5 years I began to feel assured that maybe the worst was over now and just MAYBE now I can finally start enjoying my life. Now at age 58, I got the news yesterday that I have PC. It's like I spent the last 5 years rebuilding the house of cards and now I feel like the wind just came through and blew 'em all down again. My biggest reaction to the news of the PC was an immediate depression plunge, I mean like when the f#*k is it ever gonna end? And I can't help but think that this PC may also be a result of the multitude of Xrays that I've had in my pelvic region over the years?? So I may have sounded shallow or negative to my doctor when I told him today that at this point in my life I'm just tired of the bad news, tired of the pain, tired of the operations, tired of the long recoveries....At this point in my life I'm concerned most with quality of life than quantity. I don't find it good news that my doctor said my cancer is very treatable with several options, all of which will likely leave me with incontinence and impotency. But despite all the physical stuff I've been through, one thing I've always been able to maintain was an enjoyable sex life and it's one of the few pleasures in life I haven't lost....yet. I've rebounded from my tragedies remarkeably, I keep active, watch my diet, I'm in excellent physical shape and I'm proud of my reconstructed body. I now have a wonderful fiance' who thinks I'm incredible and the two of us enjoy our sex life more than at any other time in either of our lives. So now I've got PC and the research I've done on it over the past couple nights has given me little hope of surviving it without losing the ability to ever be able to (for lack of a better term) sport wood again. I was able to find several posts here from guys who say they have regained some of their erection ability, and some say they have lost it completely, and some saying they lost it but can still have an orgasm. Again, I feel shallow in seemingly being concerned mainly with this aspect of it but that's how I am feeling. It's very important to me. I've not had a lot of good s#*t go on in my life, but I have always had great sex, so it's not hard to reason that I am very upset (scared) of losing that too. So, today I went back to my Urologist who spent almost 2 hours with me discussing options. I told him flat out what I basically said here. I'm more interested in quality over quantity. He understood and mentioned that radiation may be something to consider because he says it does less damage to the nerve bundles that control erection than does surgery. I can't really find anything here on this forum or anywhere in the cosmos of Google that confirms this, but that's what he said. I guess the first of many questions I have here would be, is there any consensus from any of you guys that radiation is a better option for ending up with the least sexual side effects, mainly maintaining erection ability? Have any of you chosen the radiation option and have ability to ...obtain wood?....Have any of you had any of the surgery options whether it be Open, Da Vinci, Nerve Sparing with favorable erection outcome afterwards? Any thoughts and advice would be appreciated....And, I truly appreciate the fact that this forum exists for me to be able to confide and seek support.",

      "Content": "This is wonderful, 3 very informative responses. I thank you fellows. Bob R, thanks for the reassurances. I re-read your post and didn't see what option you went with, or maybe you're still considering options? Very informative about the radiation long term breakdown of surrounding tissue. Interestingly, my doc told me today that brachy was something that is not being done so much anymore? I forgot the reason but I got the feeling it was like becoming obsolete? More interestingly, I've read online and perhaps here in this forum that Cryosurgery hasn't been proven so much yet so many don't even consider it a viable option. But my Doc said today he does it regularly and I should consider it as an option....So I do think I have much to investigate. ILance, my Gleason score is 7 for all six of 14 positive samples. And by the way, where did the term \"Gleason\" originate, I wonder? I should have asked my doc today. Was it the Docs name who pioneered the scoring system? Or perhaps Jackie Gleason was the first who they used it on? My Doc told me today exactly what you said about your uncle. Once radiation option is used, very few surgeons are willing to operate for removal due to heavy scarring so my doc said that Cryosurgery would be the next option. Highlander - I read many of your posts last night and today before I joined the forum. I learned lots from you already, so thanks for writing! I failed to include my staging in my signature which I just did, btw. It is T-2a. Both you and ILance mention sex and orgasms with lack of erection. Totally blunt here but I guess I can't fathom that. I mean I have definitely had my share of (shamefully admitting) drunken and illicit drug use sex over the years and I recall a few times where I was very sexually arroused but totally unable to....well, pitch the tent...and I embarrassingly couldn't do anything with my flacid unit. A definite case of the mind being willing but the flesh just unable. So I guess I just need to learn more about this. I am so pleased to hear ILance say that his orgasms are better than ever....Again, as I say in my opriginal post, I feel embarrassed that I may sound so shallow to anyone who reads this that I'm seemingly more worried about my ability to gain/maintain an erection than I am living a very long life.....It's not really exactly like that....but again, shallow or not shallow, at this point in my life and thinking back over the decades of the many operations, reconstruction surgeries and subsequent recoveries and the spine cancer treatment and recovery, I am definitely focusing on quality of life right now over quantity. I've lived my last 5 years very happy and I don't want to see that go....I've lived many more years in pain, uncertainty, on the brink of dying, along with the machinations of the many long term physical therapies and rehabs.....I guess I've learned not to be so afraid of death anymore. However, I'm not that hopeless, I'd ultimately like to continue living with some more very happy years before I die.....That's why I'm so depressed right now...It just seems whenever I have any sort of an extended spell where I'm finally doing well and feeling well, some major dibillitating health issue always comes along and takes me back down. Thanks again fellows : )",

      "Content": "This is wonderful, 3 very informative responses. I thank you fellows. Bob R, thanks for the reassurances. I re-read your post and didn't see what option you went with, or maybe you're still considering options? Very informative about the radiation long term breakdown of surrounding tissue. Interestingly, my doc told me today that brachy was something that is not being done so much anymore? I forgot the reason but I got the feeling it was like becoming obsolete? More interestingly, I've read online and perhaps here in this forum that Cryosurgery hasn't been proven so much yet so many don't even consider it a viable option. But my Doc said today he does it regularly and I should consider it as an option....So I do think I have much to investigate. ILance, my Gleason score is 7 for all six of 14 positive samples. And by the way, where did the term \"Gleason\" originate, I wonder? I should have asked my doc today. Was it the Docs name who pioneered the scoring system? Or perhaps Jackie Gleason was the first who they used it on? My Doc told me today exactly what you said about your uncle. Once radiation option is used, very few surgeons are willing to operate for removal due to heavy scarring so my doc said that Cryosurgery would be the next option. Highlander - I read many of your posts last night and today before I joined the forum. I learned lots from you already, so thanks for writing! I failed to include my staging in my signature which I just did, btw. It is T-2a. Both you and ILance mention sex and orgasms with lack of erection. Totally blunt here but I guess I can't fathom that. I mean I have definitely had my share of (shamefully admitting) drunken and illicit drug use sex over the years and I recall a few times where I was very sexually arroused but totally unable to....well, pitch the tent...and I embarrassingly couldn't do anything with my flacid unit. A definite case of the mind being willing but the flesh just unable. So I guess I just need to learn more about this. I am so pleased to hear ILance say that his orgasms are better than ever....Again, as I say in my opriginal post, I feel embarrassed that I may sound so shallow to anyone who reads this that I'm seemingly more worried about my ability to gain/maintain an erection than I am living a very long life.....It's not really exactly like that....but again, shallow or not shallow, at this point in my life and thinking back over the decades of the many operations, reconstruction surgeries and subsequent recoveries and the spine cancer treatment and recovery, I am definitely focusing on quality of life right now over quantity. I've lived my last 5 years very happy and I don't want to see that go....I've lived many more years in pain, uncertainty, on the brink of dying, along with the machinations of the many long term physical therapies and rehabs.....I guess I've learned not to be so afraid of death anymore. However, I'm not that hopeless, I'd ultimately like to continue living with some more very happy years before I die.....That's why I'm so depressed right now...It just seems whenever I have any sort of an extended spell where I'm finally doing well and feeling well, some major dibillitating health issue always comes along and takes me back down. Thanks again fellows : )",

      "Content": "Greetings - I was diagnosed yesterday (Mon, 21st) and spent most of last night reading posts on this forum before becoming a member today. I searched the forum to try to zone in on my specific concerns but I feel I need to submit a post of my own as my main concerns may be a little different than most, but I'm not sure. I've had a lifetime of physical trauma injuries from several seperate accidents over a 25 year span, many of which required major reconstruction surgeries in which several internal fixation devices were utilized, skin graphs from being burned over 40% of my body, compound fractures, fractured skull, broken spine, pseudomonis spinal infection from one of 11 spine surgeries and then dealing with the psycological impact of all of these injuries. I've also battled spine cancer that I think was caused by the probably hundreds of Xrays I've had of my spine...I went through chemo and radiation for that.... Anyway, with all the past situations, I was determined to fight back each time but I must tell you, with each seperate episode, I found it harder and harder to find the inner strength to bounce back. I mean you just get tired, you know? My last reconstructive surgery was in 2007 and for the past 5 years I began to feel assured that maybe the worst was over now and just MAYBE now I can finally start enjoying my life. Now at age 58, I got the news yesterday that I have PC. It's like I spent the last 5 years rebuilding the house of cards and now I feel like the wind just came through and blew 'em all down again. My biggest reaction to the news of the PC was an immediate depression plunge, I mean like when the f#*k is it ever gonna end? And I can't help but think that this PC may also be a result of the multitude of Xrays that I've had in my pelvic region over the years?? So I may have sounded shallow or negative to my doctor when I told him today that at this point in my life I'm just tired of the bad news, tired of the pain, tired of the operations, tired of the long recoveries....At this point in my life I'm concerned most with quality of life than quantity. I don't find it good news that my doctor said my cancer is very treatable with several options, all of which will likely leave me with incontinence and impotency. But despite all the physical stuff I've been through, one thing I've always been able to maintain was an enjoyable sex life and it's one of the few pleasures in life I haven't lost....yet. I've rebounded from my tragedies remarkeably, I keep active, watch my diet, I'm in excellent physical shape and I'm proud of my reconstructed body. I now have a wonderful fiance' who thinks I'm incredible and the two of us enjoy our sex life more than at any other time in either of our lives. So now I've got PC and the research I've done on it over the past couple nights has given me little hope of surviving it without losing the ability to ever be able to (for lack of a better term) sport wood again. I was able to find several posts here from guys who say they have regained some of their erection ability, and some say they have lost it completely, and some saying they lost it but can still have an orgasm. Again, I feel shallow in seemingly being concerned mainly with this aspect of it but that's how I am feeling. It's very important to me. I've not had a lot of good s#*t go on in my life, but I have always had great sex, so it's not hard to reason that I am very upset (scared) of losing that too. So, today I went back to my Urologist who spent almost 2 hours with me discussing options. I told him flat out what I basically said here. I'm more interested in quality over quantity. He understood and mentioned that radiation may be something to consider because he says it does less damage to the nerve bundles that control erection than does surgery. I can't really find anything here on this forum or anywhere in the cosmos of Google that confirms this, but that's what he said. I guess the first of many questions I have here would be, is there any consensus from any of you guys that radiation is a better option for ending up with the least sexual side effects, mainly maintaining erection ability? Have any of you chosen the radiation option and have ability to ...obtain wood?....Have any of you had any of the surgery options whether it be Open, Da Vinci, Nerve Sparing with favorable erection outcome afterwards? Any thoughts and advice would be appreciated....And, I truly appreciate the fact that this forum exists for me to be able to confide and seek support.",
