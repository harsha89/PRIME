      "Content": "My Psa was 6 and rising (up from 3 a couple years ago, then 5+, then 6+ a few weeks later). Doc seemed optimistic after my biopsy and didn't mention any major concerns (I'm 56). Also, my CRP was high (2.9) on my most recent blood test. My concerns are these: 1) the freak show that is my semen (pure blood, after about five days). Been afraid to see it since then and am uncertain how to normalize. Should I be regularly ejaculating to empty things out or refrain? Everything else (urine, bowel) has checked out with no blood. 2) if no cancer was found, then what the heck else could be going on to make those numbers so bad? 3) what sort of special supplements, protocol should I be following? Thanks, in advance.",
