I had my first PSA reading come back at a 3.1 after going to a urologist because of bladder problems. I was never called back to know that it was a concern of the dr so I didn't find out until I went back for a follow up a couple months later. We did another PSA test it came back 4.5. Went to another doctor to get a second opinion after 2 months. Numbers came back 5.2 did the biopsy and found I was a high 7 on the Gleason scale with aggressive . Surgery was scheduled for Nov 29, 2016 and other than the machine failing during surgery all seems to have went well. The stomach pains and the constipation after I can honestly say was the worst part. The scariest part was going for a CT scan and being told I had a blood clot and needed to rush straight to the ER. Thankfully nothing was found. I am now 2 months post op and now this depression. Part is sexual function is diminished, having sex has been able to work but not even 20% erection. My wife has been real supportive but at age 47 to feel so \"inadequate\" in this capacity has played a number on my head. I need to get over this and I was hoping for some ideas for the depression that doesn't involve pills. Thanks in advance!",

My hold up on pills is just that I have been taking so many over the years and that it seems I need a pill to help the last one. I was given one pill because of the urinary problems which has gotten me to this point now. The Cialis I don't feel worked and the fact that it is going to be generic in the coming month or so I'm not sure it's my answer. I have an appointment coming up and I will be sure to talk to the doc about all my concerns. Time to get some help as well some sunshine. Thanks again all!",

      "Content": "Just to get some feel for what can I do to ward off this depression that keeps smothering me more than I can take at times? I had my first PSA reading come back at a 3.1 after going to a urologist because of bladder problems. I was never called back to know that it was a concern of the dr so I didn't find out until I went back for a follow up a couple months later. We did another PSA test it came back 4.5. Went to another doctor to get a second opinion after 2 months. Numbers came back 5.2 did the biopsy and found I was a high 7 on the Gleason scale with aggressive . Surgery was scheduled for Nov 29, 2016 and other than the machine failing during surgery all seems to have went well. The stomach pains and the constipation after I can honestly say was the worst part. The scariest part was going for a CT scan and being told I had a blood clot and needed to rush straight to the ER. Thankfully nothing was found. I am now 2 months post op and now this depression. Part is sexual function is diminished, having sex has been able to work but not even 20% erection. My wife has been real supportive but at age 47 to feel so \"inadequate\" in this capacity has played a number on my head. I need to get over this and I was hoping for some ideas for the depression that doesn't involve pills. Thanks in advance!",
