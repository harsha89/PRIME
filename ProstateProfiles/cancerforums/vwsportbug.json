      "Content": "I just visited my Urologist/Oncologist Friday and sounds like I have 3 options to consider for my PC treatment: 1) The most recommended is open surgery rather than DaVinci. Apparently, I have a couple of Lymph nodes that need to be looked at and they are not where the DaVinci robotic surgery can easily reach. The open surgery option necessitates an extra day of hospital stay (so 4 days instead of 3), catheter insertion for at least 2 weeks (not looking forward to that), and who knows what all else I'll run into. 2) Radiation treatment is another option but even the Radiation oncologist said that in my particular case, he would recommend surgery rather than radiation. 3) No treatment at all. Live with whatever comes. Got to make a decision! Now what to do? Wayne",

      "Content": "Not sure what else to expect next. In August, I started a 2 month period of Hormone therapy (30 days of pills and then one injection in abdomen that is supposed to be good for 6 months) prior to the Radiation Treatment starting on Oct 24th. Today is the 2 week date from the start of the radiation and I'm experiencing difficulty urinating, painful rectal burning, occasional blood in stool similar to what I've previously experienced with hemorrhoids, an almost constant feeling of needing to have a bowel movement, etc. I always prepare for the radiation sessions with a full bladder and after a recent bowel movement. At last weekly clinic appointment the doctor suggested regular Advil to treat the urinary issues (that should relieve the inflammation somewhat). The bowel issues have started since then and will be the topic of discussion at this week's clinic I'm sure. I'm beginning to wonder what else I can expect. These are starting to feel like pretty severe issues and I'm still in the fairly early days of my radiation therapy. What else is likely to happen and how bad are my current symptoms likely to get. Any insight would be welcome....",

Why would I subject myself to a biopsy and/or treatment if cancer is indicated? I really don't know what to do here but I have been referred to a different Urologist for a 2nd opinion next week.

      "Content": "Completed my radiation treatments on Dec 1, 2017 and just got the results of my follow-up PSA test that was done on Feb 6, 2018. The PSA level was 3.6. I was expecting it to be much lower than that after having the radiation treatments. I have my follow up appointment with the radiation oncologist on Feb 26th and just wondering what to expect to hear. Anyone know if this PSA level would be normal after the radiation treatments?",
