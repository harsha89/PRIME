Just got the results from a 12 core biopsy and it came back with a 3+3. Surprisingly enough I am ok with this - I would have of course preferred a clean slate but based on my rising PSA I had a feeling it was PCa and if that would be the case and if there was a number I was hoping for it was in fact of course a 6. Thanks to weeks of reading through this forum I know that a 6 is far from the end of the world - granted it does have to be addressed but I can take my time to make an informed decision which I believe is best for me(which not having to cancel my trip to Cancun next month!) . Without finding this board before hand just being told I have PCa would have knocked my socks off. In a sense I feel relieved that I finally know what is going on and I can start contemplating things I will do, not worrying about things I may do pending the while worrying about the results (while having the knowledge that the biopsy is not always spot on also). A couple questions and observations: 1) Don't believe everything you read/hear. I had an 3T MRI 6 months ago which came back clean. My Uro still suggested a biopsy afterwards even though they did not see anything. A few people pointed towards a recent study from a top Doc in Switzerland showing in the study that 100% of the people with a clean 3T MRI who had a biopsy afterwards came back with a clean biopsy. Taking that into account (or perhaps using that as an excuse not to risk the biopsy infection possibility) I waited 6 months for another PSA and when it came back even higher I called my doc to schedule the biopsy. Looking back without reading that survey I may not have waited. 2) My Uro basically gave me three choices - Removal , radiation and AS. The order he put them in one removal, AS then radiation. He did then recommend I go see one of the top oncologists in the area to discuss radiation which tells me he is not really pushing his agenda for surgery (I do like the guy which means a lot to me - although I will seek a second opinion). Regarding radiation he said generally they look at a person's age and use 15 maximum year life expectancy as a general rule for radiation (although he said that maximum number is going up in some circles). Has anyone heard this before? 3) My Uro is also telling me he wants me to get a cystoscope so he can see whats going on in my bladder. I didn't think much of it until I saw what it was (ouch!) and almost everything I read said that was usually done pre-surgery. Was anyone else here asked to have one prior to making a decision for surgery? If no surgery would I even need one? 4) I have seen countless recommendations for Dr. Walsh's book and reading the reviews on Amazon although most are positive some comments I saw was it was a little outdated and a little more geared towards surgeons and not to the average layman. Are there other books that anyone also recommends? 5) General health aside (sounds crazy heh?) has anyone found prostate benefits by changing their diet? I realize that ship probably has sailed but I would still be interested since I really need to change my eating habits and true or not if someone has a good story for me it sure as hell won't hurt me! 6) Since I am probably getting a second opinion could anyone tell me where and who the top Prostate centers/doctors are in the NY/NJ area?

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I am 57 and in October I found out my PSA had increased from 2.5 two years ago to 5.0 . Went to Urologist and DRE was normal - he put me on antibiotics and 5 weeks later PSA down to 3.8. Just had a 3T MRI which came back relatively clean with Pi-RADS score of 2 (and no significant lesions). He now wants me to get a biopsy (standard 12 core). I am wondering if it is my best course of action to just jump into an invasive procedure or if anyone else with a similar circumstance went a different route? He didn't really give me any other options (he strongly suggested the biopsy) but I really want to do some homework before I get this done. Right now I am thinking the good from it (either a little more piece of mind or perhaps something being found that the MRI did not catch) most likely outweighs the bad (slight chance of infection and an uncomfortable 15 minutes!) but I would love to hear others thoughts or experiences.",

      "Content": "Just had my first biopsy yesterday and crazy as it sounds I am more worried about the threat of infection than the results. Most things I read say 3 to 5% of people get hospitalized with infection after a biopsy which I find to be a pretty big number. A friend in work had one a few years ago and developed sepsis the next day and had to be taken by ambulance from work for a two day hospital stay. He said it was so bad if he ever had another biopsy he would only do so if he was admitted for two days right after the procedure! I decided to work from home the next couple days since my commute could range from 60 minutes each way to two hours depending on traffic and I don't want to be hit with that as I am driving. My doctor told me it really is only the first 24-48 hours after the biopsy I need to look out for but I am reading that it could happen up to a month afterwards. Anyone have an infection and if so how long after the procedure? Thanks in Advance!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Mark! Guessing that since you are able to submit your inquiry today and are not experiencing any symptoms, that you are quickly approaching the clearing! Did you take ALL of your prescribed antibiotics? Not to scare you further; however, the prescribed antibiotics to confer protection during biopsy can also put you back into the hospital for several days if they wipe out a portion of your \"good\" gut bacteria which then allows c diff to flourish. This condition usually manifests starting a few days after starting the antibiotics with diarrhea being one of the more recognizable symptoms. Both conditions have been reported by a few of your new Forum Brothers. Fortunately, the incidence of each is very low. Good luck on 3 fronts: - Good Biopsy Results - No infection - No c diff Keep us updated! MF No symptons yet...I think?! I am around 25 hours post biopsy as I write this response. Have been taking Cirpro for a few days and have enough left for today and tomorrow (which doc said was fine).",
