      "Content": "Hello, this is my first time visiting this board. Thank you all for the information you provide to help others. Nov 22 we got the call that my husband has prostate cancer. He was out of state for 3 weeks. The doctor said no reason for him to come home. Three weeks wouldn't matter. He arrives home 3 weeks later and we get the news that he has prostate cancer and it is a rare form. He has signet cell and his Gleason is 5+5 a big 10! We spoke of options and he said with the type and aggressiveness of this cancer the best move was surgery asap. He is a very good surgeon and we were comfortable with what he said but wanted a second opinion. Called MDA to get a second opinion but then the doctor scheduled surgery before we could get an appt at MDA. Hubby had surgery, a week ago. Doctor called today saying prostate was definitely a 10. Lymph. Odds were normal but the cancer leaked out of the top and they couldn't cut it away? Those were hubbys words. I'm guessing there is a margin? The dr is recommending radiology when he is healed from surgery. My questions are: should we explore other options? Should we contact MDA ? The surgeons job is done should we now seek an oncologist ? My husband works out of state 3 weeks gone then 3 weeks home, will these treatments keep him at home since he can't fly back and forth daily? My head is spinning and we are only 2 months into this long journey.. we appreciate any help that is given.",

      "Content": "I am so very glad I found this forum!!! My first post was yesterday and I had great feedback and feel so fortunate to be able to come here to read and ask questions. Thank you to all that continue to help others through this journey. My husband had his surgery a week ago today. He continues to bruise on both sides of his abdomen. It's creeping it's way to the front and it's a very dark purple. Seems every morning it's bigger and darker. He's still very much bloated. It's about from his ribs down to his belly button and looks aweful! I haven't read where others have mentioned this. He wants to wait to call the doctor until Monday and we couldn't call today because they are closed on Fridays. Anyone experience this or know if it might be normal? Thanks in advance!!",
