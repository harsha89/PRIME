      "Content": "Good luck. I will be checking in to see how this goes for you. My urologist (referring me out for potential robotic surgery) is not very sympathetic to my experience. He thinks it is ridiculous to use the SPC and has not heard of it recently. I have a neighbor that is an MD in anesthesiology. Does a lot of pain management work (injections, etc). He was not surprised in the least when I told him it was the most painful thing I could ever imagine (going in, being in, coming out, and now even days after I still feel like it got hit with a hammer). He said it happens a lot in the hospital and they have to use strong pain meds to calm down the patient. This sound terrible. I hate taking pain meds. They make me feel like crap during, and for days afterwards. And what happens if you get released and it comes back? Call 911 and got to the ER for a morphine drip? Yikes. I was also surprised to see that starting 24 hours with the Foley in there was blood in the urine bag. Once the Foley came out there were blood clots in the first pee. I wonder if the thing they call spasms is the feeling you get that you are peeing while the Foley is in. It was about 24 hours after it was in I had the feeling I was peeing but nothing was going into the bag or out of my penis. After about the third time the fluid in the bag got red and it was then that the whole urinary track from tip to belly was in pain. By the next morning I was doubled over in wrenching pain despite vicodin. I hope I can find an experienced robotic surgeon that is sympathetic to urinary tract hyper sensitivity to Foley's and has had experience with SPCs or otherwise can manage the pain. I am in Florida.",

      "Content": "I am pretty convinced that my urethra is just to sensitive for a Foley. I could not make it 48 hours after a biopsy with one in. I had extreme pain at the tip and eventually along the entire urethra, bleeding (post removal), spasms, and cramping. Peeing afterwards was extremely painful. I am pretty concerned about any upcoming treatments. Is the supra pubic catheter permanent or does it eventually come out and you get to pee normally?",

BPH with coexisting overactive bladder dysfunction--an everyday urological dilemma. Djin Thanks for the article. I might have only had overactive bladder, When I read the symptoms for overactive bladder vs BPH/obstruction. I was definitely more in the overactive bladder category. And the BPH meds did not help much. BTW, I checked in with my surgeon last evening and they said that they do proscribe mybetriq (more expensive and extended release) or oxybutynin (older and potentially more side effects and not ER) for some patients but it takes a week or more to see results. Not me. I got them PDQ.",

      "Content": "Many years prior to my cancer diagnosis (1/17, DaVinci 7/17) I was diagnosed with BPH. My prostate was not huge but big. I was put on BPH medicine that did not help much -- occasional frequency, burning, urgency, low volume & stream, some dripping and leaking after urinating. Night time I was up only once or not at all. Not terrible most of the time, but I went pretty often. A few weeks after the surgery I was 98% dry at night, I did get up to urinate more frequently at night (one to two hours after going to sleep and typically again three hours later). These night time urination episodes were with good volume and flow and good voluntary control. But during the day the \"BPH symptoms\" were pretty intense, including lots of \"leakage\" and somewhat frequent uncontrollable mini squirts into the diaper. I assumed surgery recovery normal incontinence. But after months of kegals things have not improved and even the night time went down to about 80% dry. I went to see my regular uro. I told my story (methodically with details so I did not get the \"it takes time\" response) and he had his nurse do a bladder scan. Completely empty bladder, but as soon as I got off the table a mini squirt. That got his attention. Ah, maybe over-active bladder. He gave me samples of VESIcare 5MG and within a three days BPH was gone. A few spot leaks but that was it. Completely dry at night. Did my thing in the AM and was dry all morning. Was my BPH really over-active bladder all the time!!!!. The VESIcare ended up causing huge heartburn and acid reflux so I had to stop it. I tried Mybetriq 5MG; it did the same thing. I am now trying generic Oxybutynin 5MG which comes in split-able, non-ER formulations so I can meter it out slowly. It does not work as well, but definitely calming the bladder is doing what kegals don't. Any other men have this experience? Use of over-active bladder meds during recovery? I'm curious as to why this was not thought of before. I can see how the surgery irritates the daylights out of the bladder and makes it super sensitive. If you look how the autonomic nervous system works the urinary tract, I'm not surprised about any of this. Having a urinary sphincter strong enough to lift a small car does you no good if the autonomic nervous system is screaming \"bladder full, open up\" even if it isn't. I hate to think I will be on these things forever. And I am not all back to normal, but for sure, the autonomic nervous system seems much more functional. The bladder is signaling \"I gotta go\" when I got to go. Not just at random.",

      "Content": "There reason I ask: During my first biopsy in 2013, which came back negative, the urologist had issues. He could not ever find the right nerve to deaden(OUCH x !2), and he hit some sort of vein or artery in my colon that left me bleeding for days. After a while I got into the shower and there was a protrusion from my behind the size of the tip of you little finger. Quite painful when walking or sitting. It was said to a hemorrhoid. After about three weeks with various butt meds it \"went away.\" After the second biopsy, under general, it popped back out. A few weeks later it went \"away\" again. Six weeks before my surgery I was to do Kegels -- I see all the anatomy pics and get the concept. I started the flow then stopped it and \"felt\" what muscles are moving and held them for a few seconds then released them. I \"thought\" I was doing these right. The surgeon's instructions are 150 per day for incontinence before and after surgery. However, after about two weeks of kegeling like a madman (following instructions) my \"hemorrhoid\" came back. Stopped keels and two weeks later is was \"gone\". I say gone in quotes because I think it is not gone completely but hanging out up inside where the sun doesn't shine waiting for a chance to drop down and wreck havoc. So how do you all do kegels? 150 per day sounds wonderful, but for me it would be complicated. Do you think there is a way to strengthen the muscle in the pelvic that works on the incontinence without squeezing on the other biological portal? How many reps do you do? How hard do you squeeze? How long do you hold them? How many sets? I see some videos recommend only one set per day and do them only every other day? But the big question is can you do the pelvic work effectively isolating only the muscles that work the urinary tract and not the colonary tract? Anyone try it. I am, it is hard and uncertain. Thanks, Sunny",

      "Content": "The good news is my PSA is undetectable. This is not that surprising since the pathology report post-surgery was not that bad. But the incontinence is not improving very much, if at all. After a few weeks after surgery nighttime was pretty good. 1.5 to 2 hours after going to sleep I woke up with a strong urge. I mean strong urge and I go. I really go. Only a tiny wet diaper or completely dry. About fours later one more trip. I go but not as much. In the morning I go again and if I changed the diaper during the night it is dry. During the day a whole 'nother issue. I work at my desk and I seem to have only limited control. Sometimes I get the urge and I get up and go but it is not very much, and I dribble at the end most times. If I put on a new diaper is has wet spots in minutes most times. Sometimes I feel the urge but no control it just goes. Sometimes it goes with no warning. There are odd times the diaper does stays dry -- I cannot put my finger on what is different between wet and dry. If I am doing active house work or moving around the diaper gets soaked with no warning or sensation. My surgery was 7/10. Catheter out 7/15. The doctor has done thousands of these.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tennisplayer You are about 3 months out now. Stats say you should start noticing improvement. I've heard things can change for the better suddenly. I believe I read that 90% of men are fully continent 12 months after surgery. Hang in there. I'm wondering if fully continent just happens. I posted a survey on this forum on the topic of continence a few months ago and some people were dry in days or weeks. Others took time. I'm wondering for those that did not get fast relief what did they do to eventually recover. Or if you do nothing do you eventually get better. In other words does any of this (kegels, lots/little water, no booze, etc) do a darn thing. Or is it just a time thing or what?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Sunny -- No expert here, but why should that stop me Perhaps you're overdoing the Kegels? There are medications that might help (aimed at stress or urge incontinence) -- have you talked to your Uro about the problem and possible meds? However, he/she may want you to wait more time before trying them. Yes, there are artificial sphincters for a worst-case scenario down the line, but I believe there are other procedures that can be done if time and meds don't work. Thanks. I thought I might be overdoing the Kegels and took a few days off. I don't think it helped. I'm doing the recommended amount in a book the surgeon recommended. Also my PT is very good and he has me doing what should be the proper amount. I do about eight times 10 reps. I can isolate the front and rear kegels. I make sure I get the front since that is where the sphincter is. I was told to gradually over time hold them longer and to move from laying down to sitting to doing other things such as squeezing a pillow between the knees and doing mini squats. It is all in this book the surgeon recommended. I made an appointment to see the Uro on Friday (my regular one, not the surgeon). He is friendly and a bit of a\"don't worry\" type, but I am going to press him on this. I want to understand how all this plumbing works. Before the PC diagnosis I had years of urgency from a somewhat large prostate. This is like that time 2 most of the day. I took bhp medicine before surgery but there is no P anymore. Maybe there is some drug that can tell the bladder to chill out. Yeah for sure I do not want to be opened up again unless last option.",

      "Content": "The good news is my PSA is undetectable. This is not that surprising since the pathology report post-surgery was not that bad. But the incontinence is not improving very much, if at all. After a few weeks after surgery nighttime was pretty good. 1.5 to 2 hours after going to sleep I woke up with a strong urge. I mean strong urge and I go. I really go. Only a tiny wet diaper or completely dry. About fours later one more trip. I go but not as much. In the morning I go again and if I changed the diaper during the night it is dry. During the day a whole 'nother issue. I work at my desk and I seem to have only limited control. Sometimes I get the urge and I get up and go but it is not very much, and I dribble at the end most times. If I put on a new diaper is has wet spots in minutes most times. Sometimes I feel the urge but no control it just goes. Sometimes it goes with no warning. There are odd times the diaper does stays dry -- I cannot put my finger on what is different between wet and dry. If I am doing active house work or moving around the diaper gets soaked with no warning or sensation. My surgery was 7/10. Catheter out 7/15. The doctor has done thousands of these.

However, he/she may want you to wait more time before trying them. Yes, there are artificial sphincters for a worst-case scenario down the line, but I believe there are other procedures that can be done if time and meds don't work. Thanks. I thought I might be overdoing the Kegels and took a few days off. I don't think it helped. I'm doing the recommended amount in a book the surgeon recommended. Also my PT is very good and he has me doing what should be the proper amount. I do about eight times 10 reps. I can isolate the front and rear kegels. I make sure I get the front since that is where the sphincter is. I was told to gradually over time hold them longer and to move from laying down to sitting to doing other things such as squeezing a pillow between the knees and doing mini squats. It is all in this book the surgeon recommended. I made an appointment to see the Uro on Friday (my regular one, not the surgeon). He is friendly and a bit of a\"don't worry\" type, but I am going to press him on this. I want to understand how all this plumbing works. Before the PC diagnosis I had years of urgency from a somewhat large prostate. This is like that time 2 most of the day. I took bhp medicine before surgery but there is no P anymore. Maybe there is some drug that can tell the bladder to chill out. Yeah for sure I do not want to be opened up again unless last option.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tennisplayer You are about 3 months out now. Stats say you should start noticing improvement. I've heard things can change for the better suddenly. I believe I read that 90% of men are fully continent 12 months after surgery. Hang in there. I'm wondering if fully continent just happens. I posted a survey on this forum on the topic of continence a few months ago and some people were dry in days or weeks. Others took time. I'm wondering for those that did not get fast relief what did they do to eventually recover. Or if you do nothing do you eventually get better. In other words does any of this (kegels, lots/little water, no booze, etc) do a darn thing. Or is it just a time thing or what?",

Meanwhile, no matter what the MRI shows, I think the urologist is going to want to do another biopsy. The last one was a killer. I'd rather be flogged. The urologist said that the next biopsy would be in the surgery center and I will be under anesthesia. I will also get a catheter for 24 hours, or so. This is freaking me out a bit. I have a very sensitive urethra. I was diagnosed with BPH/chronicUrethritis a few years ago and the cystoscope dang near killed me. (I am not normally sensitive to pain -- had multiple orthopedic surgeries and PT with almost no post-op pain meds). I have gotten used to a slight burning sensation and moderate irritation every time I go (before and after). I do not have any other symptoms of BPH except for an enlarged prostate since forever. Most every night I sleep through the night without a visit to the head. I am wondering what the penile catheter feels like. I just cannot imagine something shoved up there, again.",

      "Content": "My PSA kept climbing so I had the robotic surgery last Monday. The pathology was not terrible but I am glad I did it, so far. It looks like they got it all and there was more cancer than found in the MRI guided biopsy. The one issue was, of course, for me -- the catheter. I am extremely sensitive down there, or should I say, \"up there\". I had a cystoscopy after my first negative biopsy in 2013 and I nearly jumped out of my skin. And the last biopsy required a foley for 36 hours. It was extremely painful (though out the urethra, penis tip, and bladder spasms). A foley was back in after the surgery and came out Friday morning. It was hell. Way way worse than the six holes & stitches punched my belly. I tend to be very pain tolerant. I have had many sports and other injuries without ever needing pain pills, and the surgical sites from the robot are not painful at all. But get anything up the penis and it is blisteringly painful. How unique is this? The pain is still quite extreme. Neither the surgeon or my regular urologist seem concerned. I guess I am 1:1,000,000. Has anyone found anything (OTC, home remedy or Rx) that dulls this sort of pain even a bit? 12/2016 PSA 10 1/2017 MRI Positive 2/2017 MRI Guided PSA Positive Gleason 6",

      "Content": "[QUOTE=FeatherBoy;339395]Hi Sunny, No, you are not one in a million. Your issue is quite common, actually. Thanks everyone for responding. Maybe to become a board certified urologist these guys should have to walk around a few days with one of these things inside them, because the way they sluff you off is pretty amazing. Meanwhile, foley was out Friday and the darn penis is still sore as hell and burns like crazy especially when I try to go to sleep. I saw my regular urologist yesterday and told him about it and he was like, [BLANK STARE], I said seriously it hurts like a mother and it has been out since Friday and he said, \"let me look at you stitches. They look good.\" I said are there any meds for a very painful and burning urethra, he just grinned. Seems like medical science could do something about this, but frankly none of them seem to give a darn.",

      "Content": "My PSA kept climbing so I had the robotic surgery last Monday. The pathology was not terrible but I am glad I did it, so far. It looks like they got it all and there was more cancer than found in the MRI guided biopsy. The one issue was, of course, for me -- the catheter. I am extremely sensitive down there, or should I say, \"up there\". I had a cystoscopy after my first negative biopsy in 2013 and I nearly jumped out of my skin. And the last biopsy required a foley for 36 hours. It was extremely painful (though out the urethra, penis tip, and bladder spasms). A foley was back in after the surgery and came out Friday morning. It was hell. Way way worse than the six holes & stitches punched my belly. I tend to be very pain tolerant. I have had many sports and other injuries without ever needing pain pills, and the surgical sites from the robot are not painful at all. But get anything up the penis and it is blisteringly painful. How unique is this? The pain is still quite extreme. Neither the surgeon or my regular urologist seem concerned. I guess I am 1:1,000,000. Has anyone found anything (OTC, home remedy or Rx) that dulls this sort of pain even a bit? 12/2016 PSA 10 1/2017 MRI Positive 2/2017 MRI Guided PSA Positive Gleason 6",

      "Content": "I got some lidocaine gel last evening. Did not help much if at all. The tramadol was not working so I tried a half a vicodin. I hate the stuff. It makes me feel terrible. But it knocked me out and I got to sleep. Woke up about 45 mins ago (5:15) and the tip was hurting like a fire stick was jammed up it and it feels like I am trying to pass a stone. I think the bladder is trying to push out the folly. The bladder is draining into the bag pretty well. It was nearly full when I woke up. I see the nurse at the doctor at 8am. They are supposed to take it out. I hope I can pee after they do. I cannot imagine going very long with this in unless they put me back under general. I have had lots of pretty bad injuries from sports, etc. and surgeries and PT and this is ten times worse. None of this was explained as a possibility. Update: Standing up and walking around seems to help the spasms, but makes the tip worse. I took another tramadol, also. Does any of this seem normal?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Sunny! Highlander provides an excellent suggestion with the Mayo. J-ville may be a long haul from where you are located in SW FL. You may want to check with Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. I suggest that you contact various Large Hospitals or Cancer Centers that specialize in Prostate Cancer (PC). Inquire about having 1) a \"Multiparametric 3T MRI\" of the prostate gland that can be \"fused with a TRUS Biopsy\" and 2) ask if there is a \"Uroradiologist\" with a lot of experience imaging PC. If local institutions can not fulfill these 2 requirements, then go to the Mayo! Good luck! Hope your experiences moving forward are far more pleasant! MF Called both Moffitt and Mayo JAX today. Did not get very far. Basically appointment weeks and weeks out. Sounded like Big-Medicine. I was told more or less told to call back after the holidays. it sounded like first appointments would be in February. I also called over to Boca Regional Cancer Center and up to Bradenton to inquire about an MRI and they are swamped with snowbirds also. Getting sick in Florida in winter is no fun. Doctoring is rationed. Sad state of affairs. I can do without the snowbirds. Traffic is also a mess. I was hoping I could find some one in Fort Myers, Naples, Venice, Miami, or Sarasota that was good -- even to talk to. Thanks so much for that info on the MRI. What does \"coil\" or \"coils\" or \"rectal coils\" mean. Is this something they shove up your nether regions before they do the scan. And why would I have to be on a clear liquid diet the day before and fast the day of. I have had MRIs with contrast before of my pelvic region to my brain and did not hit this diet regime. It is worse than a colonoscope. I meet with the urologist today and I was probing why not try to use a different imaging center and get more specifics on just what is being ordered. I failed. I think he is like: get MRI, if is shows something get biopsy, if it does not show anything get biopsy. If anything shows up out comes the prostate. Just like that. YIKES. I am still feeling the side effects of that first one in 2012 which was completely unnecessary. I want to have more info before I let them go probing around any more -- and for sure cutting out a body part. This is not tonsils. Right? BTW, Atlanta is just a plane ride away. Do you have anyone you recommend?",
