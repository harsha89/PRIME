      "Content": "Hi-My name is Jose and I am 59 years young, and I have IBS and prostate cancer. I will be starting my prostate cancer treatments the last week of October and my doctor prescribed me Viagra that I am supposed to take beginning the week before my treatment begins. I don't have a lot of money (the treatment is taking every bit of my HSA) and he told me there were places online I could buy it and save some money, as Im going to be working a lot less during the treatments. Also, I am wondering if anyone has taken Viagra and if it affected your IBS at all? I found a place that sells it but I don't know how to order something like this. I'm also a bit embarrassed and I dont want to call their customer service line. Can someone help? I have a 20% off coupon code that is \"CPRX20\" and I have no idea what to do with it.
