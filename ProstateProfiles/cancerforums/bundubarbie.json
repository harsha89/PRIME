      "Content": "my husband had a radical prostatectomy in January 2011. while the catheter was in he started bleeding, the blood looked like coco cola. we landed up in the emergency room twice. During this time he had a terrible burning sensation in his groin area. The catheter was removed even though the blood was still black.Now he has terrible burning pain in his groin (mainly on exertion) and his right testicle is incredibly painful all the time. He has had an xray , scan and Mri , the only thing they found was a blood sack in abdomen which they tried to syringe out with no success. The urologist says he doesnt know whats wrong. This sounds very similar to what you had except for the intense constant pain in testicle.",
