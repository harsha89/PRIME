I'm actually Rhonda (Steve's wife) - he doesn't use a computer! : ) With the lymph node metastases, decided to go to MD Anderson in TX (sister and cousin both live north of Dallas - cousin is a patient at MD Anderson and insisted he go there). MD requested tissue from biopsy and surgery and upgraded diagnosis from a Gleason 7 (3+4) to a Gleason 7 (4+3) and also identified extra prostatic extension. Not good news, but better to know what you're dealing with than not. The oncologist then referred him to a radiation oncologist there at MD. He requested a colonoscopy (which has been done - 5 polyps removed and all negative) and a 7-week post op PSA which came back 0.0. Well, we're 1,000 miles away and having difficulty trying to explain to this radiation oncologist that it's a hardship to make a trip there if it's just for a consult. But, car would be packed in an hour if scans or radiation would begin. hms03049's post is informative - would be nice if the radiation doctor would just tell us that over the phone so we'd know how to plan.
