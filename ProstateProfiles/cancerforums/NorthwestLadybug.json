      "Content": "\"The thing that bothers me, though, is that PSA reading.\" (Chuck) Yes, the PSA was bothersome (and that's an understatement!) to us, as well! As you'll recall from my blog post, Tom had what our PCP called \"a raging case of prostatitis\" which, it seems, caused his PSA to spike at the very high reading of 49. About three weeks after that PSA test was done (and about five weeks after his symptoms had subsided), he had another one, on the recommendation of the specialist at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. (We were told that if the score had not gone down significantly, he wouldn't be a candidate for the AS study.) That reading was 11.89. Just last Wednesday, he had yet another PSA test, this one part of his regular physical. We are anxiously awaiting that score. Our hope and expectation is that it will be lower (albeit likely just slightly lower) than the 11.89 reading. Tom is scheduled for a second biopsy on February 5, 2015, through SCCA. He is extremely nervous because, although he was given general anesthesia for the first biopspy (with another doc), this doctor feels that a general is overkill, er... unwarranted - even for the very nervous, like Tom. He has agreed to prescribe Xanax for the evening before the procedure and Valium for the procedure itself. Tom was so relaxed for the initial biopsy, knowing he'd be out cold (\"If you don't knock me out,\" he joked with the doctor, \"I'll knock myself out!\"), but I'm quite concerned about this next one, in which he'll be awake. I won't \"allow\" him to cancel, don't worry! Any words of encouragement and/or wisdom are welcome! Thanks again! Carol",
