      "Content": "Glad I found this forum. 54, 4 months out from RP. I have a good buddy who is a surgeon so he was very helpful with the \"what to expect\" questions and, in general, things have gone well. I was on casodex for 5 months because I chose to hold off till the summer was over to have the surgery; PSA jumped from 3.5 to 7.7 from the previous October till a March test and the biopsy in April had me at 3/4 (by the way I have not figure out how to put my \"stats\" at the bottom). Post op PSA is undetectable, no probs with incontinence and happy to have my energy back after getting off the casodex - back to running with my buddies in our regular running group. I thought I was prepared with expectations of a long road on the ED front until I saw the doc for a checkup recently. He indicated some concern over the fact the low dose Cialis was not making a dent and put me on the 25 mg 3 times a week and said if this does not do the trick after 3 weeks or so I should come back for the injection. That got me a little concerned; having been somewhat content to ride it out for a year or so. It sounds like the idea of the injection is worse than the actuality and now, the thought of the possibility of an erection again sooner rather than later has my spirits up a little. My wife made a comment the other day how much time and effort is put into that 6 inch or so appendage and I agreed, until it was not working as advertised. I was not prepared for how much the, I guess frustration is the best word I can come up with, was going to affect me. So far the 25 mg is not doing much except maybe producing a \"fullness\" and I have to really work at it to get there. Funny how the pump the doc said I should do regularly gives you some enjoyment at the idea of what it used to look like. It is encouraging to hear the very positive responses I have seen from just about everyone about injections. My wife and I have stayed on the bike sexually despite my flat tires so I am very curious how a 60 minute or longer erection is going to affect our intimacy. I can't imagine. At any rate thanks to all the fellow buds on this forum.",
