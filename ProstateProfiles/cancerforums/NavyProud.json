      "Content": "Good day to everyone, I just received my first PSA test results since my surgery two months ago. The PSA level is shown as <0.13 in the test report. Per my quick research, it appears the PSA test was only sensitive enough to test down to the 0.13 level. It seems I should have been given a more sensitive test, at least to the 0.1 level. I would appreciate some help on this test result. I am meeting with my medical oncologist late this afternoon and I am trying to decide if I need to take a more sensitive test to correctly establish my post-surgery PSA baseline. Thank you, Jim",

      "Content": "I truly want to thank everyone for your comments and sound advice. From your postings and my reading of Dr. Walsh's book, I am gaining a much better understanding of prostate cancer and the best options for treatment. Two days ago I had my appointment at George Washington University Hospital. I was armed with a long list of questions and thankfully my doctor took time to address all my questions and concerns. He has done several hundred surgeries using the da Vinci robotic-assisted technique and he has trained over 60 surgeons in the use of the da Vinci robot. He willingly discussed the use of Partin Tables for guidance. He also entered my information (e.g., PSA, Gleason grade/score, tumor stage, # of positive/negative biopsy cores) into to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prediction tool. This monogram can be used to predict what will happen after receiving treatments such as radical prostatectomy and brachytherapy. My doctor examined me regarding two prior surgeries I had for colon cancer and a ruptured appendix. He said I needed to have an Endorectal Coil MRI and his office helped me schedule the MRI. He will review the results of the MRI and we will have more discussions on April 3. Good day and good luck to all of you, Jim",

      "Content": "Hello to each of you here on this Prostate Cancer Forum, In the Navy after arriving at a new command, we are required to muster onboard. So even though I am now retired, this is my first official muster onboard this forum. I have been reading many of your threads/postings. I am most impressed with the wealth of information being provided and the camaraderie, goodwill, and fellowship that exists here. I didn't request this set of orders to your forum, but here I am none-the-less. Prostate cancer is my third battle with cancer. As you'll see in my signature line below, I faced salivary gland cancer in 2003 and colon cancer in 2009. Now I join each of you in a new battle for me, prostate cancer. You are the veterans in this war against cancer and I'll need your expertise and advice. I have already received some great advice from HighlanderCFH and drakebullet when I made my first posting in another thread in this forum. Less than two weeks ago I received the bad news from my local urologist when he told me about the results of my prostate biopsy. I have an appointment on Monday, March 11 at George Washington University Hospital in Washington, DC to discuss my treatment options for prostate cancer. So far, the da Vinci prostatectomy looks like my best option. But for now, I'm still doing my homework and looking at all the treatment options. I did order Dr. Walsh's book on surviving prostate cancer. May we all be blessed with fair winds and following seas as we make this journey together, Jim",

      "Content": "I truly want to thank everyone for your comments and sound advice. From your postings and my reading of Dr. Walsh's book, I am gaining a much better understanding of prostate cancer and the best options for treatment. Two days ago I had my appointment at George Washington University Hospital. I was armed with a long list of questions and thankfully my doctor took time to address all my questions and concerns. He has done several hundred surgeries using the da Vinci robotic-assisted technique and he has trained over 60 surgeons in the use of the da Vinci robot. He willingly discussed the use of Partin Tables for guidance. He also entered my information (e.g., PSA, Gleason grade/score, tumor stage, # of positive/negative biopsy cores) into to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prediction tool. This monogram can be used to predict what will happen after receiving treatments such as radical prostatectomy and brachytherapy. My doctor examined me regarding two prior surgeries I had for colon cancer and a ruptured appendix. He said I needed to have an Endorectal Coil MRI and his office helped me schedule the MRI. He will review the results of the MRI and we will have more discussions on April 3. Good day and good luck to all of you, Jim",
