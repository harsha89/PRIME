      "Content": "My dad 74yrs old currently was diagnosed with prostate cancer metastasis (Gleason 9) in Dec 2013. He had taken before Lupron, Bicalutamide, Casodex, Abiraterone during the past 3 years. When his cancer couldn't be control by Abiraterone, his doctor recommend for Chemo for the next visit. Sadly, he was infected by Salmonella in June 23 when he was doing his grocery and was warded in the hospital. He has become weaker, his muscles are getting smaller and he could not longer walk or stand up on his own. With his Salmonella infection clear from his blood, there is still Abdominal Abscess in the stomach causing him having mild fever now and then.. The doctor recommended to keep giving antibiotic and not draining out the pus through his back (near to the spine). We were told by the Chemo doctor that the current condition of my dad will not be suitable for Chemo, it will do more harm than benefit. The doctor apologies and said that my dad may only have a few more months to go as Cancer will slowly shut down his body and rarely the cancer cell will go to lung or the brain. Upon hearing this, my family want my dad to return home ASAP. But now, my dad left eyes start to get swollen. The eye specialist came and look at him and told us that from the scan, it seem that there is \"something\" behind the eyeball. From the scan itself, it doesn't look like infection. So the Specialist asked whether do we want to do a surgery on his left eyes to take a sample out for diagnose or continue with the steroid antibiotic. We ask about the risk and the benefit. After diagnose the sample, the doctor maybe able to treat the eyes, BUT IF the diagnose show that it is the cancer, the doctors wont be able to do much. My family are devastated. All the bad things start to hit on my dad.. one and another. This coming 23 August will be his 2 months stay away from home. We only want my dad to came back home and spend his remaining day with the family. Really sad and heartbreaking..",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, My dad is 71yrs old and is being diagnoised to have prostate cancer. On 25 Nov, the doctor from uralogy took my dad's urine specimen and blood test. This is the first time in his life, he went to see a doctor. Today, he went back for TRUS biopsy and was told by the doctor that my dad PSA is 300plus. After the biopsy, he were given medication (Bicalutamide, and a urgent injection : Leuprolide). The doctor said it for hormonal therapy, to bring the hormonal down to Zero. (google about the medince and injection) My dad had not done a bone scan (whether the cancer had spread to the bones), but my dad do complain that there is slight pain on the lower back when he cough. I feel that this news is not really a good new. The doctor also said with PSA 300plus, the cancer most likely had spread to the bones. We got to wait for another appointment for the bone scaning. That mean it will be more complicated to treat if it had spread to the bones, am i right? I only start to google about prostate cancer after knowing my dad condition. So I got limited knowledge. Family members are all worry about my dad. I have a few questions to ask : 1) is there any food or drink that he can't eat/consume? oily fried meat etc.../ coffee? 2) what should I ask when we went back to the doctor on 23 dec? what information do I need to know? actually in my heart, i only want to know how many more years can my dad live. thank you from a worried son.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, My dad is 71yrs old and is being diagnoised to have prostate cancer. On 25 Nov, the doctor from uralogy took my dad's urine specimen and blood test. This is the first time in his life, he went to see a doctor. Today, he went back for TRUS biopsy and was told by the doctor that my dad PSA is 300plus. After the biopsy, he were given medication (Bicalutamide, and a urgent injection : Leuprolide). The doctor said it for hormonal therapy, to bring the hormonal down to Zero. (google about the medince and injection) My dad had not done a bone scan (whether the cancer had spread to the bones), but my dad do complain that there is slight pain on the lower back when he cough. I feel that this news is not really a good new. The doctor also said with PSA 300plus, the cancer most likely had spread to the bones. We got to wait for another appointment for the bone scaning. That mean it will be more complicated to treat if it had spread to the bones, am i right? I only start to google about prostate cancer after knowing my dad condition. So I got limited knowledge. Family members are all worry about my dad. I have a few questions to ask : 1) is there any food or drink that he can't eat/consume? oily fried meat etc.../ coffee? 2) what should I ask when we went back to the doctor on 23 dec? what information do I need to know? actually in my heart, i only want to know how many more years can my dad live. thank you from a worried son.",
