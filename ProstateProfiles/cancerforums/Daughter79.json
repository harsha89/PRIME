      "Content": "Hello all, My Dad (67) went for a PSA test in 2010 and it came back at over 60 and he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Following a course of hormone injections and radiotherapy he was given the all clear and put on annual check ups. His PSA remained below 1. He began to feel ill in 2014 and his PSA went up to 9. He had various scans and has been told it's spread 'slightly' to his bones (surrounding area so I'm guessing pelvis?). His last PSA was at 22 and he's on his second hormone injection. Latest PSA result is 25.8 (after one months treatment). Basically - I'm scared about what I've read about Metastatic prostate cancer and don't really understand it. My parents come back from his specialist appointments full of positive news about them being able to control it for 'years' ... but is this true? His results in 2010 were T2 and Gleason of 4+3 - please can someone explain this to me? And will these have changed now it's metastatic? Also - does metastatic mean it's advanced/terminal? I've read so many positive prostate cancer stories ... but it all seems to change once it's spread. Can it spread 'slightly' and be controlled/cured/offer a long life expectancy? Or does the fact it's spread at all ... change things significantly? I'd appreciate any words of wisdom and I apologise in advance if I've not understood the terminology of things or spelt things wrong Many thanks",
