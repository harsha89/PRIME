      "Content": "Thanks yet again, Pratoman -- you are an excellent guide and adviser. I do hope that you are completely cancer- and worry-free soon. Let'sdothis -- your husband does sound like mine in terms of the internet stuff. I definitely feel better knowing there are other folks out there in the same shoes, but at the same time it is a terrible thing to have in common. Aloysius -- (I like the name!) Someone posted a thread recently about comparing 2 week to 4 weeks to 7 weeks -- I found that to be really helpful. I know everyone heals differently, so here's hoping for a similar outcome. Catheter gets removed tomorrow, fingers crossed! Beeswife",

      "Content": "Hello folks, I've been lurking for a week now and I have to say how much I appreciate the knowledge, humor, and support in this community. I am looking for some advice and counsel. My husband hasn't yet come around to the idea of an internet (or real life, for that matter) support group, but I am a firm believer. My husband, who is 66, had the DaVinci surgery last week at Hopkins; he is supposed to get the catheter out Friday morning, and not a moment too soon for him. We got the path report today. He was initially diagnosed in 2011 at Virginia Urology after a biopsy with 4 of 24 cores positive, 3 cores at 3+3, and one core at 4+3. His Dad also had PC and had the surgery in his late 60s, he is now 92 and doing well. My husband didn't want to do anything when he was first diagnosed and he did not hit it off with the urologist, and he refused to do a second biopsy a year later. Fast forward three years: me steadily nagging, PSA steadily rising to 14 in January 2015, DRE = \"not subtle\" nodule, 2d opinion at Hopkins on 4/1, surgery on 4/20, path report today. Tumor extent: Extensive; No lymph node involvement, but 2 tumors: Secondary = Gleason 6, Dominant = Gleason 7. The left seminal vesicle was positive, and the report says \"Margins = equivocal\" \"Positive where it is difficult to distinguish extraprostatic extension versus intraprostatic extension.\" Highest grade at margin = 4+3.\" To me, admittedly not a medical professional, this seems disturbing. Doc says we wait three months for first PSA test, and then discuss options. Anyone out there with advice -- what does all this mean? Anyone with similar results? What did you do? How did you cope? What can I best do to be supportive? Thanks in advance. BeesWife",

      "Content": "Many thanks, Pratoman, Chuck, and Fran -- I really appreciate the sense of confidence you have conveyed as you worked your ways through this. It is reassuring to think that this will all be behind us at some point -- kind of hard to see it that way at the moment. My husband is an active 66 and had the surgery 4/20 at Johns Hopkins. He doesn't get the catheter out until tomorrow (hopefully -- there is still some blood in the bag) but I think life will improve immeasurably once that happens. Fran, he is resigned to wearing men's depends and pads, so it is good to know from your post that it really isn't such a big deal after all. He is also committed to doing the Kegels. The Kegels thread here seems really helpful, Chuck, and thank you so much for posting it. I am going to renew my efforts to have my husband join this group or at least read the posts -- he hasn't been in the mood to do so thus far, and I can't say I blame him. I have every confidence in the surgeon, who said he was able to preserve the nerve bundles, but given the path report, now I don't know that that is necessarily a good thing. It is good to know that others who have been through this think the path report is kind of vague -- we will be talking to the doc again early next week. And Pratoman, thank you so much for saying that \"a Gleason 7 rarely takes a life\"! That really helped. We do have a lot to be thankful for, I reckon, since at least it didn't show up in the lymph nodes. And your comment about taking it week by week rather than day by day is sound advice since so far some days are good, but the next, not so much. My husband is pretty depressed -- he rides motorcycles and plays guitar as his favorite hobbies, two things that require seated positions that are extremely uncomfortable at the moment. We have been taking long walks but he has been frustrated at his slow pace and relative lack of stamina. One thing that concerned us was when the doctor said radiation was likely in the future but he wanted to wait in any event to get as much continence back as possible. Does anyone know why that would be? How does radiation affect continence/ED? Or is radiation the beginning of a parade of horribles I shouldn't worry about right now? Again, I can't thank you all enough for your support. it is great to know there is a place to go with folks who understand and have practical advice for dealing with these issues. In the meantime, I will read the post on stats in signatures and figure out how to incorporate them. Beeswife",

He has made a great recovery -- almost completely back to his normal, pre-surgery self. He just got the results of his first PSA, and the nurse read it to him over the phone = 0.3. He went to his primary care doc here in Virginia for the blood test, because he had the surgery at Hopkins in MD but we live in Virginia. We haven't had a chance to discuss the lab results with the surgeon yet, so perhaps I am \"troubling trouble.\" In anyone's experience, does a 0.3 PSA post surgery mean he needs radiation immediately, or do we wait another 2 or 3 months for another PSA data point to see if it is going up? Not having seen the actual report, I don't know what kind of test of how many decimal points it reported. If radiation is indicated, what for does it take and where on the body do they \"radiate\"?
