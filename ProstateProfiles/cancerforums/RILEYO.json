      "Content": "Is it possible to accurately calculate PSA doubling time with an ultrasensitive assay at very low PSA levels? For example, my PSA level was at 0.028 in April 2013 and went to 0.055 in October 2014 with tests given every 2-3 months apart. Given that information, is it 18 months? Or is the standard assay more reliable at calculating PSA doubling time? I had RP August 2012 only negatives on path was 3+4 gleason positive margin at apex .Should i go ahead with salvage radiation now at such a low level and risk overtreatment or wait un BCR ( 0.2 AND RISING ) is evident ?

      "Content": "I am 15 months ( august 16 2012 ) post RP and my psa has been BOUNCING first using standard assay undetectable <0.05 , <0.05 then with the ultrasensitive assay detectable .028 ,0.30 , .030 now .040 which has me worried because of the increase all of the psa tests has been 2-3 months apart . Could the latest increase eventhough a slight increase and no doubling time from .030 to .040 be a lab error ? Is it time to radiate ? ANXIETY ANXIETY PLEAS HELP !",
