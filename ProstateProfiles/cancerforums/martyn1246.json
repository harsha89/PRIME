      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi Martyn. Could you post your surgery pathology report findings and clinical staging? A confirmed rise in PSA can mean there is biochemical recurrence (BCR). This is from PSA produced by remaining healthy and/or cancerous prostate tissue left behind in the prostate bed or prostate-cancer cells elsewhere in the body (metastases). Some men with BCR go on to clinical disease recurrence in 5-8 years on the average. The usual treatment for BCR after surgery is radiation and possibly ADT (hormonal treatment), depending also on the suspected location of the PSA-producing tissue. Your urologist might refer you to a radiation oncologist IF the PSA upward trend is confirmed. Note that some men have an increasing PSA which then stabilizes and which doesn't require further treatment. The PSA level at which treatment is advised often depends on the number and type of adverse findings in the prostatectomy pathology report. Another factor is the rate of PSA rise. Newer PSMA-PET scans can help identify the location of the PSA-producing tissue. You and your doc will have more to go on after your next PSA test. You may want to speak to your uro about switching to a more sensitive PSA test (with 2 or 3 decimal places). This would make it possible to detect smaller changes: if the 0.2 was accurate, you may want to treat sooner than a 0.3 as measured by a one-decimal test. The right-most digit of any test is subject to inaccuracy and rounding. Keep us posted, please. Djin Hello Djin here is the Pathology report Macroscopy 1. Right no. of cores 5 2.

Your urologist might refer you to a radiation oncologist IF the PSA upward trend is confirmed. Note that some men have an increasing PSA which then stabilizes and which doesn't require further treatment. The PSA level at which treatment is advised often depends on the number and type of adverse findings in the prostatectomy pathology report. Another factor is the rate of PSA rise. Newer PSMA-PET scans can help identify the location of the PSA-producing tissue. You and your doc will have more to go on after your next PSA test. You may want to speak to your uro about switching to a more sensitive PSA test (with 2 or 3 decimal places). This would make it possible to detect smaller changes: if the 0.2 was accurate, you may want to treat sooner than a 0.3 as measured by a one-decimal test. The right-most digit of any test is subject to inaccuracy and rounding. Keep us posted, please. Djin Hello Djin here is the Pathology report Macroscopy 1. Right no. of cores 5 2.
