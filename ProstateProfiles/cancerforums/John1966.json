      "Content": "Ralph, Thank you for sharing your story. I am 52 was sent to urologist after my psa went from 1.3 to 4.3 in one year and then to 5,2 when the irologist tested it. I met w urologist at Yale on 7/3/18. He told me that most prostate cancer is slow growing and thatall in all is 99% survivable for 19 years and 95% survivable for 15 years. He also told me that if treated with surgery or radiation erectile distinction and incontenance both urinary and bowels is possible and experienced in 60% of patients. Higher in anonymous survey by cancer society because some men aren\u0092t comfortable discussing with their doc. He also told me that if treated the ability to ejaculate is gone. He said that was way down the road and I was more likely to not have cancer than to have it but definitely said with radiation or surgery your prostate makes no fluid and there is nothing tonejaculate. I didn\u0092t ask about ability to have an orgasm or what it would feel like. I was still getting my head around the fact This was me we were talking about. I was far more concerned about survival and finding out if I have cancer than y ability to have sex lter. I was scheduled for MRI 7/14 and biopsy 7/30 regardless of mri findings to be as thorough as possible. Biopsy was to be wide awake and that scared the hell out of me. He also advised of blood in urine, stool and ejacukation for up to a month, up to 6 months in ehacuktion. 6 months?? I asked if you could flush it out w frequent masturbation, I was half joking half curious he laughed and said nobody ever asked him that before and said I would want to wait several days before trying but to let him know and I laughed and said I would. On the forum I saw men reporting the biopsy was not too bad but also that some had it wile sedated. I called and requested this and was rescheduled for 8/14/18 to have biopsy in OR while I thought MRI results would take several days but technician said doc would have them Monday. I called and was advised they were in and doc would call later in the day. No call. Today I called at 11:39 am and was told the nurse had asked his permission to give me results but not heard back and that he was in surgery today and someone would call me by tomorrow. I said I would wait if I had to but would really appreciate it if they could just give me the results and asked if I could give that permission. I was very nice to he girl on the phone but I felt like I was being very pushy. But I also felt like it shouldn\u0092t take 3 days to let me know the results. A man called at 4:45 said he was a physicians assistant and that my mri result was as follows: One lesion, scaled 1-5 5 is most worrisome looking mine was a 2. Not big but he didn\u0092t say size and I didn\u0092t ask. He said this lesion might or might not be cancer. (The doctor had definitely told me MRI detects more tha. 80% of cancer if present, but he also told me if they see anything on the MRI it\u0092s 90% some kind of cancer. Almost all slow growing and, all of them treatable and survivable). He also said some men wait up to 8 years to treat and it statistically does not shorten their life span. So I have one lesion, a grade 2 out of 5. They did a blood draw on 7/14/18 and psa was a 4.2 - down a full point! I didn\u0092t know that was a thing! My FREE PSA WAS A 9.6 (down from a 12 a month ago. And my phi index a 27 meaning I had an overall 38% chance risk. I\u0092m second guessing waiting an extra 14 days to be put under but it doesn\u0092t seem like that matters, in the back of my mind at some point you waited too long... I very much am wired for if I have cancer let\u0092s take it out tomorrow. This mentality would remove the option to wait and watch and put off treatment. So I guess the main two questions on my kindness are can you have a lesion and have it not be cancer? If your psa triples in one year can it not be cancer? Or just \u0093not be cancer yet\u0094 if you treat prostate cancer with surgery or radiation can you still orgasm? Does it always mean you cannot ejaculate? Can you feel it? (Your penis) does cialis/viagra just make you get an erection, or make it possible to enjoy sex? My father died of a heart attack when I was very young. I\u0092m asking all if these questions about sexual function and incontenance because I got the impression that treating prostate cancer would cost me my sex life, at least my enjoyment of it. And that\u0092s a trade I\u0092m more than willing to make if it means my kids have a better chance of having me there to walk them down the isle some day. If the side effects are different or not as bad as I was told I\u0092d like to know that also. My experience at yale has been very good. I very much liked the plan to biopsy even if MRI was totally clear. My mri wasn\u0092t totally clear so we do the 12 plus target the lesion. Thank you all for sharing your experiences I know it\u0092s theraputic but it helps those of us starting this journey and in that God is using this for good. John",

Family doc does a DRE every feb and always says \u0093your prostate is perfect\u0094 On Friday I got an amail from my life insurance agent tellin me that I had an elevated risk of prostate cancer and that my prices were a little high but not too bad for insurance. I was surprised because I was not aware I\u0092d had a psa and didn\u0092t really know what it was. I assumed the life insurance company ran the test when they did my blood test 6 weeks ago. Agent told me they got the info from my medical records. I called my dr office and explained I had been advised by my insurance agent that I had an elevated risk of PC.. Nurse said my psa was 4.29 in feb of 2018 which was only slightly elevated and that dr wanted to re test in 4-6 months. She explained that many things can cause a false high reading including sex the day before the test. Then I asked if I had ever had a psa prior and she checked and told me that one year earlier it was 1.3, and then said \u0093that\u0092s a big jump in one year you should have been called\u0094 So that was litterally Friday at 4:55pm. I went to get my blood tests from the dr office right then. So I have found very conflicting info online but it seems that a jump of 2.8 in one year is at the very least cause to see a specialist and get a current psa screen this week. How alarmed should I be? And should I push for an MRI or biopsy? And what if it goes down, would that mean all is well? I live in Connecticut. Lots of good hospitals and doctors in the Northeast. It seems PC is very treatable from what I have read, I also read that a psa increase of 2 points is single most indicator of fatal prostate cancer, and that it\u0092s better to catch it when it goes from 3-5 and not from 10-12. But I\u0092m not really sure who or what kind of doc to see. My first thought is to seek a biopsy ASAP and then treat aggressively. Is there a downside to haveing a biopsy? Or more than one over a course of time? And does all treatment lead to impotence? Just occurred to me I had a lump in right Testical about 2 years ago. Had an ultrasound and was told it was a benign lump. Other than this concern I am in good health and not on any meds. Thank you for reading my post.",

      "Content": "I\u0092m 52 was not at all concerned about PC and was not aware that I had a psa ever done. Family doc does a DRE every feb and always says \u0093your prostate is perfect\u0094 On Friday I got an amail from my life insurance agent tellin me that I had an elevated risk of prostate cancer and that my prices were a little high but not too bad for insurance. I was surprised because I was not aware I\u0092d had a psa and didn\u0092t really know what it was. I assumed the life insurance company ran the test when they did my blood test 6 weeks ago. Agent told me they got the info from my medical records. I called my dr office and explained I had been advised by my insurance agent that I had an elevated risk of PC.. Nurse said my psa was 4.29 in feb of 2018 which was only slightly elevated and that dr wanted to re test in 4-6 months. She explained that many things can cause a false high reading including sex the day before the test. Then I asked if I had ever had a psa prior and she checked and told me that one year earlier it was 1.3, and then said \u0093that\u0092s a big jump in one year you should have been called\u0094 So that was litterally Friday at 4:55pm. I went to get my blood tests from the dr office right then. So I have found very conflicting info online but it seems that a jump of 2.8 in one year is at the very least cause to see a specialist and get a current psa screen this week. How alarmed should I be? And should I push for an MRI or biopsy? And what if it goes down, would that mean all is well? I live in Connecticut. Lots of good hospitals and doctors in the Northeast. It seems PC is very treatable from what I have read, I also read that a psa increase of 2 points is single most indicator of fatal prostate cancer, and that it\u0092s better to catch it when it goes from 3-5 and not from 10-12. But I\u0092m not really sure who or what kind of doc to see. My first thought is to seek a biopsy ASAP and then treat aggressively. Is there a downside to haveing a biopsy? Or more than one over a course of time? And does all treatment lead to impotence? Just occurred to me I had a lump in right Testical about 2 years ago. Had an ultrasound and was told it was a benign lump. Other than this concern I am in good health and not on any meds. Thank you for reading my post.",
