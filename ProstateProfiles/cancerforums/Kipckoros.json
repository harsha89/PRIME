The abnormal glands are lined by moderately pleomorphic epithelial cells, some of which contain nuclei exhibiting large prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are noted in the neoplastic cells. Many of the glands have irregular shapes and cribriform pattern is seen in some areas. The tumor has been graded Gleason 4+3 and involves 20-40%of five of seven cores and extends extends to periglandular fat. There is focal perineural infiltration but no lymphovascular invasion.
