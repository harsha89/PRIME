After a couple of trials I chose not to. He then talked about \"Lead Time Bias\" with respect to research into Survival Time with respect to early or late intervention with ADT. He said originally Hormone Theraphy (ADT) was for late stage palliative treatment, and it then became fashionable for early intervention to take place. He said most people would take anything and everything on offer to try and ensure their survival .... He eventually supported my position, as does my current Medical Oncologist. For me personally I'm glad I have done it as I have ...... my current treatment is palliative, but who knows what would have happened if I had done it differently. When I first took ADT in 2010, I was immediately very unwell, physically and emotionally ..... Apart from those few months, I have enjoyed a very good quality of life since diagnosis and treatment in 2010. My choice is to live well as I can for as long as I can ....

My sexual rehabilitation and recovery from erectile dysfunction has been one hell of a journey for me, and I did it all with the help of a very caring and understanding doctor here in Brisbane. Michael Gillman is a good man. I am also blessed with a wonderful caring, considerate and understanding wife. Still with both of these fine souls in my corner it was a very confronting and emotional journey. Before treatment and during ADT, I started on 5 mg Cialis daily. Post treatment I was physically messed up a fair bit. The HDR Brachytherapy caused complete numbness to the whole genital area, from memory it lasted a couple of months. I mean complete as in when you have an injection at the dentist. Also suffered Climacturia for a while \u0085.also very confronting. Tried tablets post radiation, but daily Cialis started causing muscle pains, and other single tablets sometimes worked, but with a lot of performance anxiety. Now mainly use Alprostadil injections, and after much ado they are now effective and simple to use. The Sloane Kettering site has good articles on all this. Rightly or wrongly I put quality of life ahead of survival, and I still do. I can fairly confidently say I will die from this cancer, and if it is the case my life is somewhat shortened, I want to live it as well and enthusiastically as I can. So just for today, that is what I am doing. My sexual function continues to get better as time goes on, which is a direct contradiction to what is supposed to happen post radiation. My cancer prognosis would appear to deteriorate as time goes on, but we will deal with that as time progresses. There is a solution to erectile function \u0085\u0085 our cancer is another story.

      "Content": "Thanks to all who read and replied. Snuffy Myers and his practices are well know here in Brisbane. Their is a very active support group here and the internet makes all other accessible. http://www.prostate.org.au/articleLi...Support-Groups I know of one person here that has been over to Snufffy Myers within the last 2 months. My wife and I have researched a lot over the last 3 years, with Sloane Kettering being a wonderful site. October will be a crunch time for me, although the Urologist might be prepared to let me scratch through to April 2014 .... seem it is debatable as to the advantages/disadvantages of early or late intervention. I admit I am having a lot of trouble getting my mind around it .... Below is an interesting article which appeared yesterday. I would be much more likely to try something experimental which may or may not work .... than to submit to existing ADT therapy. But I have to keep an open mind. I am here to listen and learn, so I will try my best. Regards Jim. http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-2...humans/4851234",

      "Content": "Cranberry capsules. Ural. Both worked pretty well for me, and are recommended for Cystitis. 3 years later I still regularly take Cranbrerry, and sometimes Ural. Nothing is a cure in this game, but it helps a lot with symptoms. I tried the tablets prescribed by Oncologist but they actually made symptom worse. I think using the likes of daily Cialis also helps, as it improves the blood flow to the area and could reduce scaring. Maybe Zinc also? Regards Jim",

      "Content": "History from August 2010, aged 54 years. After Blood Tests, MRI, Transrectal biopsy, cystoscopy, bone scan etc. Diagnosis: PSA: 050810: 8.1 Gleason Score 9 (4+5), with cancer in 15 of the 18 tissue cores, ductal adenocarcinoma present, peri neural invasion present, extra prostatic extention identified. Prostate volume was 71cc. Stage 3a/b Prostate Cancer (second opinion) Seminal vesicles, lymph nodes and bone scan clear. I was advised that surgery would not be a good idea, as there would be positive margins, and the risk of incontinence, and impotence almost 100%. I said I would prefer Quality of life over quantity. Started hormone (Cyproterone ... 100 to 300 mg daily) therapy August to November 2010 After 3 months Hormone Therapy, into hospital for 3 days HDR Brachytherapy (Nov 2010), then 25 treatments of External Beam Radiation (Dec 2010/January 2011) \u0085. 66.25 Gy (or 83 Gy, some confusion) of Radiation, (20.25 Gy HDR brachytherapy and 46 Gy EBR) Subsequent PSA readings: 060411: 0.49 (Oncologist said I was in remission) 250811: 0.63 061011: 0.75 (6 month *1.5) 040412: 1.6 (6 month *2.1 \u0085.. 12 month * 3.25) 191012: 2.7 (6 month * 1.68 \u0085.. 12 month * 3.60) \u0085.. Urologist said it appear the cancer has metastasized. 090413: 6.5 (6 month *2.4 \u0085.. 12 month *4) \u0085\u0085 both urologist and Oncologist said it is indicative of Metastatic prostate cancer) Due for another PSA in October 2013, and as of April 2013, Bone Scans and MRI are clear. I have resisted hormone therapy, expect for the original 3 months, which was to reduce size of prostate to avoid damage to surround organs. I sort help from alternate therapies in conjunction with the medical approach, taking Selenium, zinc, Pawpaw leaf extract, Cranberry, Chromium, Bio-Curcumin, Lipoec etc. Recently in desperation, after 4 successive 6 monthly rises in PSA, and doubling time currently just over 4 months, I have started taking Baking Soda/Maple Syrup mix. I am no great believer in alternate therapy, but the medical approach from here on does not excite me much either. I am currently in good health. Some bladder irritation, but Bladder and Bowel not a problem, and sexual function fine. Sometime use Cialis or Alprostadil injections. Live on a farm and still work well, ride horses etc. A long an overly detailed post I know, but no point in telling half the story. Don't know if it is helpful to anyone, but I am open to any suggestions. Feel free to shift this post to the appropriate thread. I am getting a little lost on the site. Regards, Jim",
