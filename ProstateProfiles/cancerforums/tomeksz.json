      "Content": "Hello My partner's father has been suffering from prostate cancer for two years now with metastasis to the bones diagnosed suspected 2 years ago and confirmed several months ago. Ever since father fell ill his condition had been deteriorating slowly, until a recent operation of drilling in his bone to collect a sample of medulla. Now, it has got much worse in a very short period of time. Could drilling in the bone have made his condition get worse? If yes, what is the mechanism? Thank you. Tom",
