      "Content": "Hi new to the this and probably jumping the gun with this question. Like the title says I am 43 years old. I went in to my GP on 1/9/15 for routine physical. Ran labs Dr. e-mailed me and said my labs looked good except for testosterone which was 239. The Dr. made no mention of my PSA level which was 1.15. My previous one 14 months ago was .69 (this was my initial PSA). Should a be concerned, should I find a urologist, or just wait until next years physical and recheck then. I don't ride a bike, didn't have sex the night before, I feel fine. I know its way to early to worry, but its still in the back of my head. Thanks.",
