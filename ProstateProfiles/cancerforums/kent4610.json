He said the all three options would work for now, but he wanted a bone scan and a ct scan,,, NOW this is where I freak out, the cancer part I was okay with once I found out only 1 was positive, but silly me, I googled bone scan and now I am worried to death ( pardon the term) that it has spread,, I keep thinking of the aches I had in my thighs on and off over the \"years\", a little pain on my knee cap going down stairs sometimes, the shoulder ache I had a few months ago, all mean it has spread,, I am not getting the bone scan for another 2 weeks, but I don't know how I am going to handle this,, I am obsessing over this.. I know no one knows for sure, but does anyone have a clue what the % of it being spread to my bones? I'm I freaking out myself ? I remember the the day the dr. told me and talked about the cancer and he did not seem concerned at all, that he orders the test on all positive pc patients.... PS I have been reading alot of them members post on all post and have learned so much, it really eased my mind on the pc part,, just the bone part is the hard part right now for me....
