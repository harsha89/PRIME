      "Content": "Hi all, A year ago I had PSA levels tested and they were above ~7 (can't remember exact number). I had a biopsy and it showed no cancer. I had another blood test 2 days ago and the lab just text me to say my PSA was above 7 (don't know by how much) Will I have to have another biopsy and how likely will it be that I have cancer? And if it comes back negative will I have to have one every year until they find cancer? I'm 60yo. thanks",
