      "Content": "Thank you both for the kind words. I believe his PSA was a 4.7 (unfortunately I don't know the history of his PSA's). The gleason score being a 10 was certainly nerve-rattling but the fact that the scans showed that it hadn't spread was welcome news. Although my mother spoke to someone in the medical field who said that with a gleason score of 10 it almost certainly has spread but the scans might not be showing the severity of it.",

      "Content": "My dad was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer (gleason score of 10), however the bone scan and CAT scan showed no signs of spreading. He's in his late 50's and generally healthy but of course I'm still worried considering this is an extremely aggressive form of prostate cancer. Has anyone here knew someone who was going through the same ordeal? Thanks for reading",
