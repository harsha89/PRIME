    "Content": "I've joined the cancer forums to be supportive and to assist anyway I can. As a nurse it's in my nature to be nurturing and do my best to educate at the same time. Prostate Cancer is a heavy diagnosis for men ... it's important to be informed and do your research so you know what the best treatment options are for YOU. If anyone is interested, one of the top Physicians in the Country for Prostate Cancer, Dr. David Samadi, will be on The TODAY SHOW at 7am tomorrow morning, on NBC.",
