I am now also aware, after reading it many times, that ct scans usually only find advanced cancers that have spread.

      "Content": "My husband has had a rising psa for years. He had 4.5 separate biopsies, with all of them being negative. The last one was around 4 years ago. He started seeing a new urologist who thought my husband was suffering from prostatitis. In fact, anytime he took the antibiotics, it would lower his psa a couple of points. Two weeks ago, my husband had total hematuria. He had a ct scan last Friday that showed some \"suspicious spots\" near his prostate. It was also slightly enlarged. His psa in September was 6. His highest psa ever was was 8. I do know they took his psa when he went in with the bleeding, I don't know what it was, but the doctor said all the urine and blood tests were fine. I should mention that his percent free psa has varied from 17-24. I should also add that his dre is normal. Now I think he has advanced prostate cancer. He is going in to have a cytoscopy on Friday and we will know more then. I keep reading though that when prostate cancer shows up on a ct scan, it is advanced. I just don't know how this happened. He has always done his follow-ups as he should and now this. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Om my gosh, thanks so much for your responses. My husband is 61. I guess that I am not much worried if he has cancer that is still in the prostate. My husband insists though that he thinks the doctor's nurse said that their were suspicious spots near the prostate and that is why they are scoping him. That doesn't sound too good to me. I am concerned that it is something more advanced. However, I am hoping that maybe he misunderstood and she said on the prostate (big difference). I am nearly hysterical thinking it is advanced and that is what caused him to have hematuria. I am also worried that maybe it spread to his bladder or something. I guess we will find out more Friday. I just wish my husband would have thought to ask some questions and I also wish the doctor himself would have called to explain things more. I guess he is going to explain the results of the ct scan right before the cytoscopy. Thanks again for all of your responses. I wish I could be more precise about it instead of speculating. Another thought for me is if he had that advanced of a cancer, wouldn't that have shown up in a dre that he had about 2 month's ago? That was normal.",
