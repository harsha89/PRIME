      "Content": "Hello All, I\u0092ve been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. My stats are posted in my signature and will update as things change. Like most guys under 50, I had not done much research about prostate cancer until the last couple of months. I found this forum about two weeks ago and did a lot of reading. I like how active, professional and helpful you guys have been and some of the information has been useful. I will add my story and update in hopes that it can help others. I\u0092m 43 and married with a 2 year old daughter and a 5 year old son. I started the family later in life but I was having too much fun in my 20\u0092s and then had to find the right girl. I ended up marrying a good friend and someone that I even dated over 20 years ago. Early detection with cancer is the key. It greatly increases the chances of a successful treatment. There were two major factors that allowed me to find the cancer early. First was \u0093The Wife\u0094. Without her trying to keep me alive, I wouldn\u0092t be doing PSA tests and probably missing most of my yearly checkups. The next is family history. Due to my father having prostate cancer, I started doing PSA tests and prostate exams around age 40. My father had open prostate surgery at 64 and is now 76 and still going strong. I was initially worried about the biopsy. Not necessarily about the results but for the procedure down there. The procedure was more uncomfortable and not really painful and took about 10 minutes. Not as bad as I had imagined. Good thing I don\u0092t embarrass easily as the assistant was cute and looked like she was about 25. I also had another first as I needed to perform my first enema before the biopsy. Was just hard to get into the right position and in my house some privacy. One of our dogs kept barking at the bathroom door to come in and see what I was doing. My urologist is professional and a great guy. The only medical issues in recent years, other than slightly high blood pressure, have been in the \u0093bad region\u0094 of my body. Kidney stone removal, vasectomy and now prostate cancer. I have to stop seeing him and told him as much. Why couldn\u0092t it be something wrong with my foot\u0085 When the results of my biopsy came in, it was not that hard for me to deal with emotionally. There is a history of cancer on both sides of my family and knew a long time ago that I would probably get it in some form or another. I also solve problems every day as I run the operations for a manufacturing company. This is just another problem to solve. I\u0092m not saying that it didn\u0092t affect me at all as there were a few restless nights, but easier than if it was a complete surprise. I am planning on doing the Da Vinci surgery with Dr. Vipul Patel in Orlando, FL. I have a consultation appointment scheduled in a few weeks. Luckily he is only about 2 hours away. My urologist who has performed a few hundred of these surgeries, recommended Dr. Patel mostly due to my age and the experience of the other doctor. I have done a lot of research and believe he is one of the leaders and most experienced in the world with over 10,000 surgeries performed. I am comfortable that I made the right decision. More information to come as my journey continues\u0085 Chris",

I don't mind how \"gory\" they are as it gives us better insight on the recovery and possible issues. I even watched a 90 minute YouTube video of Dr. Patel narrating a surgery for training purposes. Dr. Patel will also be my surgeon and I have a consultation with him next week. Good luck on the recovery and keep the information coming, good or bad. Chris",
