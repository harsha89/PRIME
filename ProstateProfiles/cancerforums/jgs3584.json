      "Content": "Hi all, This is my first post and I am seeking any insight that everyone can share regarding my Dad's prostate cancer. This is a bit of a long story, but I will try to make it as short as I can. My Dad is 81 years old. He and my mother have been religious about health screens and caring for themselves. Generally healthy and active. Over the past five years, however, Dad's PSA levels had gone up. Without going into the background too much, late in 2016 he went for a biopsy on his prostate. The results came back with an aggressive cancer (Gleason 9 on almost all results). There were a number of additional tests and scans done to confirm if the cancer had spread. Indications were it had not. The doctor advised that surgery was not an option. They did say that without treatment, he would not make it more than a year. Given the options, they opted for radiation therapy. He was booked in for a daily radiation treatment (IMRT) that began in late June 2017. He rapidly developed diarrhea. Working with the doctors, they advised my mother on dietary choices and taking Imodium to help control it. The situation deteriorated very quickly. They kept going to treatment, telling the doctors and nurses how bad it was getting, but they said it was normal. Nothing was normal about this. He was unable to control himself at all, no warning and explosive, liquid diarrhea almost immediately upon ingesting food. He was wearing adult diapers and soiling more than 10 a day. I could go on, but you get the picture. It finally ended about 30 days into treatment when he had dehydrated so badly that he was hospitalized for 3 days. At the time, they told him he was less than 24 hours from dying due to the dehydration. After a few days, they released him and sent him back to finish radiation therapy. He lasted less than 48 hours before being readmitted to the hospital. He was diagnosed with radiation colitis. They told my folks this was extraordinarily rare and that they had never seen someone so sensitive to the treatment. After another 6 days in the hospital, he was released. He had developed AFIB and was wearing a heart monitor. They stopped radiation as well even though the course of treatment had not been completed. Here is where it get's puzzling. He is home now and is essentially just existing. They have him taking Creon to control/stop the diarrhea. Apparently, his pancreas is not producing enzymes to help digest food. They have told him they will not treat him for cancer (saying what the did was enough). He had low-level diabetes for many years that was controlled through diet (no drugs at all). They have told him to eat what he wants, take his Creon as instructed and do what he wants. The weird part is they have told him that he \"has a lot of other problems that will kill him before the prostate cancer does\", even though that contradicts what he was originally told and why he decided on the treatment in the first place. Needless to say, we are all confused. Even though he's home and sustaining a daily life, he's very weak. Hasn't gained any weight and still has flares of diarrhea every day or so despite the Creon (which they have recently increased the dosage on). The doctors (Gastro, GP, Urologist and Cardiologist) have all said make an appointment in 2018 for a checkup and call us if anything changes. My folks live in Pittsburgh and are going to some of the best doctors. Despite all of our research and questions, we still believe there is something else missing from the equation. Sorry for the long background, but this has been a painful journey for my family. Here's my questions to this forum: - Does this story make sense? This seems unusual given the number of other prostate cancer survivors I know and the research I have done. - There is no end/tapering off of the Creon planned. This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this. - Could he have pancreatic cancer? My mom keeps asking that (as does my Dad). He wasn't tested for it and the doctors don't seem interested in any more tests. We have a lot more questions, but I was hoping for some insight from this forum. My family and I would appreciate any help/suggestions.",

      "Content": "Thanks very much for both of your responses. That's what I thought. There is no plan, at this time, other than what appears to be HT and the use of Creon, which I rate as only moderately successful. He is still having pains in his side and around his back. He's up most of the night urinating and has sudden explosive diarrhea episodes. I am going to talk to them about getting a trip planned to Mayo. I hope I can convince him of that as he has already said he's done with doctors. Old Pittsburgh steelworkers can be very stubborn. I will update this thread as I learn more. Thanks again for helping confirm my suspicions that we need more tests.",

      "Content": "Hi all, This is my first post and I am seeking any insight that everyone can share regarding my Dad's prostate cancer. This is a bit of a long story, but I will try to make it as short as I can. My Dad is 81 years old. He and my mother have been religious about health screens and caring for themselves. Generally healthy and active. Over the past five years, however, Dad's PSA levels had gone up. Without going into the background too much, late in 2016 he went for a biopsy on his prostate. The results came back with an aggressive cancer (Gleason 9 on almost all results). There were a number of additional tests and scans done to confirm if the cancer had spread. Indications were it had not. The doctor advised that surgery was not an option. They did say that without treatment, he would not make it more than a year. Given the options, they opted for radiation therapy. He was booked in for a daily radiation treatment (IMRT) that began in late June 2017. He rapidly developed diarrhea. Working with the doctors, they advised my mother on dietary choices and taking Imodium to help control it. The situation deteriorated very quickly. They kept going to treatment, telling the doctors and nurses how bad it was getting, but they said it was normal. Nothing was normal about this. He was unable to control himself at all, no warning and explosive, liquid diarrhea almost immediately upon ingesting food. He was wearing adult diapers and soiling more than 10 a day. I could go on, but you get the picture. It finally ended about 30 days into treatment when he had dehydrated so badly that he was hospitalized for 3 days. At the time, they told him he was less than 24 hours from dying due to the dehydration. After a few days, they released him and sent him back to finish radiation therapy. He lasted less than 48 hours before being readmitted to the hospital. He was diagnosed with radiation colitis. They told my folks this was extraordinarily rare and that they had never seen someone so sensitive to the treatment. After another 6 days in the hospital, he was released. He had developed AFIB and was wearing a heart monitor. They stopped radiation as well even though the course of treatment had not been completed. Here is where it get's puzzling. He is home now and is essentially just existing. They have him taking Creon to control/stop the diarrhea. Apparently, his pancreas is not producing enzymes to help digest food. They have told him they will not treat him for cancer (saying what the did was enough). He had low-level diabetes for many years that was controlled through diet (no drugs at all). They have told him to eat what he wants, take his Creon as instructed and do what he wants. The weird part is they have told him that he \"has a lot of other problems that will kill him before the prostate cancer does\", even though that contradicts what he was originally told and why he decided on the treatment in the first place. Needless to say, we are all confused. Even though he's home and sustaining a daily life, he's very weak. Hasn't gained any weight and still has flares of diarrhea every day or so despite the Creon (which they have recently increased the dosage on). The doctors (Gastro, GP, Urologist and Cardiologist) have all said make an appointment in 2018 for a checkup and call us if anything changes. My folks live in Pittsburgh and are going to some of the best doctors. Despite all of our research and questions, we still believe there is something else missing from the equation. Sorry for the long background, but this has been a painful journey for my family. Here's my questions to this forum: - Does this story make sense? This seems unusual given the number of other prostate cancer survivors I know and the research I have done. - There is no end/tapering off of the Creon planned. This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this. - Could he have pancreatic cancer? My mom keeps asking that (as does my Dad). He wasn't tested for it and the doctors don't seem interested in any more tests. We have a lot more questions, but I was hoping for some insight from this forum. My family and I would appreciate any help/suggestions.",

I could go on, but you get the picture. It finally ended about 30 days into treatment when he had dehydrated so badly that he was hospitalized for 3 days. At the time, they told him he was less than 24 hours from dying due to the dehydration. After a few days, they released him and sent him back to finish radiation therapy. He lasted less than 48 hours before being readmitted to the hospital. He was diagnosed with radiation colitis. They told my folks this was extraordinarily rare and that they had never seen someone so sensitive to the treatment. After another 6 days in the hospital, he was released. He had developed AFIB and was wearing a heart monitor. They stopped radiation as well even though the course of treatment had not been completed. Here is where it get's puzzling. He is home now and is essentially just existing. They have him taking Creon to control/stop the diarrhea. Apparently, his pancreas is not producing enzymes to help digest food. They have told him they will not treat him for cancer (saying what the did was enough). He had low-level diabetes for many years that was controlled through diet (no drugs at all). They have told him to eat what he wants, take his Creon as instructed and do what he wants. The weird part is they have told him that he \"has a lot of other problems that will kill him before the prostate cancer does\", even though that contradicts what he was originally told and why he decided on the treatment in the first place. Needless to say, we are all confused. Even though he's home and sustaining a daily life, he's very weak. Hasn't gained any weight and still has flares of diarrhea every day or so despite the Creon (which they have recently increased the dosage on). The doctors (Gastro, GP, Urologist and Cardiologist) have all said make an appointment in 2018 for a checkup and call us if anything changes. My folks live in Pittsburgh and are going to some of the best doctors. Despite all of our research and questions, we still believe there is something else missing from the equation. Sorry for the long background, but this has been a painful journey for my family. Here's my questions to this forum: - Does this story make sense? This seems unusual given the number of other prostate cancer survivors I know and the research I have done. - There is no end/tapering off of the Creon planned. This means to me that his pancreas is no longer working correctly or at all. Is this something that happens during prostate treatment? I cannot seem to find any other instances of this. - Could he have pancreatic cancer? My mom keeps asking that (as does my Dad). He wasn't tested for it and the doctors don't seem interested in any more tests. We have a lot more questions, but I was hoping for some insight from this forum. My family and I would appreciate any help/suggestions.",
