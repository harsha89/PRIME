      "Content": "In early 2015 I had two HDR brachytherapy procedures along with five weeks of IMRT (daily treatments). The first brachytherapy was okay. I did have trouble urinating afterwards for about two weeks but just walking around was enough to get the flow going (along with taking tamsulosin [Flowmax]). However, after the second brachytherapy, I could barely urinate but was able to urinate enough to let them let me out of the facility without a catheter. Later that night I was back in their emergency facility because I couldn't urinate. They gave me a Foley catheter (on a Friday night) and removed it on Monday. They also showed me how to self-catherize for a couple of more days (not a big deal actually). I was told that about 15% of men who undergo the HDR brachytherapy have to use a catheter. I think it depends on the size of your prostate and the strength of your urinary stream. If your stream is pretty good prior to the treatments, you probably won't need a catheter and, if like me, your stream is only fair, you might need the catheter due to the swelling of the prostate after the procedure. In retrospect, I am really glad I had the HDR brachytherapy boost along with the IMRT rather than eight weeks of the IMRT which another radiation oncologist offered. It made a lot of sense to me so I have no regrets even with what I might call a minor inconvenience due to the need for the catheter. Frankly, I wish they had simply catherized me before leaving the hospital after the second brachytherapy instead of making that Friday night a little scary and painful not being able to urinate. In any case, it was a small price to pay for what I think was a good treatment - at least based on results so far. Hope that helps. Let me know if you want more details. Mark",

      "Content": "One additional point you might want to know. I choose HDR brachytherapy plus IMRT because my radiation alternative was 8 weeks of IMRT but I also had to have hormones for 2 - 3 years. Initially the hormones were to shrink the prostate and make it a better target for radiation. Afterwards, I guess they helped to kill cancer cells, at least those that were susceptible. When I discussed the brachytherapy plus IMRT with another radiation oncologist, he said that, for my case, hormone therapy wasn't needed and wasn't part of the protocol. It probably had to do with the size of my prostate or my biopsy results but, for me, the protocol didn't call for hormones. I choose the brachytherapy option because I wouldn't need to get hormone therapy which I preferred not to get due to the potential side effects. I also chose the brachytherapy option because the facility that provided it is very highly rated for treating prostate cancer and I had read about HDR brachytherapy in the Walsh book. So your situation is a little different since you are already receiving hormone therapy. In any case, I wanted you to know the whole story. Mark",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with an intermediate unfavorable prostate cancer. I had two sessions of HDR brachytherapy and 25 sessions of IMRT/IGRT. You can take a look at my signature for timing and PSA progression. It's been 27 months since the end of treatment and so far things are good. This forum is, I believe, made up of primarily guys who chose surgery over radiation. There are other forums out there that are skewed more in the direction of radiation. As noted, overall outcomes between surgery and radiation are similar. It's really up to you. As for the HDR brachytherapy, it's important to find a good center. I had mine done at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa but there are Centers around the US which are very good. Sloan Kettering in NYC would be one. Of course, it's also to find a good surgeon with lots of experience if you decide on surgery. Either way, do your research and then do what's right for you. Finally, whatever you decide, don't look back afterwards.",

However, in some facilities I've read about, two or more HDR procedures done during a single hospital visit. That is, tubing into prostate set up and you get dosed on a few occasions. So everything at once. I think it doesn't matter. Might be for patient's convenience or facility's efficiency. As long as the requisite amount of radiation is delivered to the prostate, that's what counts, not the sequence. Ask your radiation oncologist why brachytherapy after the IGRT in your case.",

      "Content": "David, In Dr. Pat Walsh's book (3rd edition), he says \"in general, HDR brachytherapy (with external beam radiation) has been used for men with more aggressive cancer or with cancer that extends slightly beyond the prostate... when compared with the results of external-beam therapy alone, the cancer control rates are about the same or better\". When I first read Walsh's book, he said that HDR brachytherapy was mainly used in Europe although a few centers in the US were also using it. I get the feeling that more centers in the US are now using it. In any case, for me, the HDR brachytherapy had more temporary side effects than the daily external beam radiation but I think I had an intermediate, bordering on aggressive, cancer. I have no regrets with the brachytherapy in conjunction with the external beam treatments. In your case, ask as much as you need to, make a decision on how you want to proceed with treatment, and then do it and don't look back. Also, please continue to post to describe your experiences with treatment so that others behind you can benefit. Mark",

      "Content": "David, Here's my take on your treatment options and how they evolved although I am not a medical person. I think your RO originally recommended the Lupron + 9 weeks of IGRT. Nothing unusual about that. Your second opinion RO suggested the possibility of HDR brachytherapy coupled with 5 weeks of IGRT which is standard and nothing wrong with that either. Then your first RO said, okay that's fine, so we'll do the 5 weeks of IGRT first and then follow it by the HDR brachytherapy. As far as I know, nothing wrong with that. I believe the overall objective is to get the requisite radiation to the target (i.e., the prostate). Now, in my case, I had the first brachytherapy initially, then the IMRT, then a follow-up brachytherapy and then finished with the IMRT. I later found out that I should have told to prepare for each daily IMRT by going in with a full bladder. However, the technical staff never told me that and I found out later by reading and asking. So I do worry about long term effect on the bladder. My point here, however, is that after the brachytherapies, there's a significant urinary urgency and it's hard to not have to urinate frequently, at least that's what I experienced. So I don't know how full I might have been able to get my bladder prior to the daily IMRTs. In your case, it won't be an issue because you'll be through with the IGRTs before you do the brachytherapies. So the sequence they're suggesting for you might be better than the sequence I went through. Mark",

Moffitt is part of the National Cancer Institute and is also a research institution. Rated highly on a national scale. My understanding is that this combo approach is only used in some centers in the US and used more widely in Europe. I had two HDR brachytherapy procedures and five weeks of IMRT on a daily basis. Unlike permanent seeds, in HDR brachytherapy, they insert the seeds into the prostate for only about 15 minutes and then remove them. It requires general anesthesia. In my case, they placed a \"spacer\" made of a dissolvable material between the prostate and the rectum to minimize side effects to the rectum. My side effects were mainly urinary (frequency as well as retention after the 2nd HDR procedure). I needed a catheter for a few days after the 2nd procedure but most of my side effects were gone after two weeks. I had little in the way of side effects from the IMRT besides being tired for about a month afterwards. Note that I was given tamsulosin to improve urinary flow which worked very well. It's been a year since my treatment. I get monitored for PSA every three months. I am still taking the tamsulosin although at a lower dose. I thought the HDR brachytherapy plus IMRT went well as long as it works! The protocol did not call for ADT.",

My side effects were mainly urinary (frequency as well as retention after the 2nd HDR procedure). I needed a catheter for a few days after the 2nd procedure but most of my side effects were gone after two weeks. I had little in the way of side effects from the IMRT besides being tired for about a month afterwards. Note that I was given tamsulosin to improve urinary flow which worked very well. It's been a year since my treatment. I get monitored for PSA every three months. I am still taking the tamsulosin although at a lower dose.

I told him I also wanted to talk with a radiation oncologist before I did anything. I did talk to someone who wanted me to first do some hormones to shrink the prostate a little and then do a combo of external beam radiation and hormones, the latter for a few years. I then went to the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa to get two more consults, one from a surgeon and one from a radiation oncologist. I was really pleased that I got the consult. First, Moffitt has a good reputation for treating prostate cancer. That's important. Second, both the surgeon and the radiation doctor had a lot of experience. Based on my age, biopsy, size of the prostate and other criteria, I qualified for either approach. Note that at Moffitt, they offered a combo of high dose radiation brachytherapy (temporary seeds) plus external beam radiation (IMRT for 5 weeks). In my case, HT was not required (which made me happy). In any case, I chose the HDR brachytherapy plus daily IMRT during and after. The important thing is to make a decision based on as much research as you can muster and don't look back on whether you did the right thing. This is really easy to say of course. In my case, after finishing treatment, I saw my PSA go low and then begin to increase a couple of times before it most recently went substantially lower (see my recent post under the brachytherapy \"sticky\"). This phenomenon is called \"PSA bounce\" and is relevant to radiation treatment. While I knew that 30% of men who get this kind of treatment experience the bounce, it was a source of high anxiety for me for at least three months. In any case, both surgery and radiation have upsides and downsides. Read Pat Walsh's book, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer, 3rd Edition\", and other available sources of information. Then make a decision. Good luck to you.",

Treatment (brachytherapy + IRMT) seems to be successful, at least to this point. It's been nearly four years since I completed treatment. I go back in a year. I have continued to follow the threads from this Forum, particularly those threads having to do with brachytherapy and/or external beam radiation treatment. I find the forum incredibly useful and wish everyone a good holiday season. P.S. After posting, I have second thoughts about my \"good news\" post. However, I couldn't figure out how to delete my thread. Here's the thing. For me, my results are great and I have another year not to worry about recurrence. However, there are many guys on this forum who are waiting for results/procedures or have to deal with bad results. I do feel guilty and didn't make my post to make anyone feel worse for their own situation. I posted, in part, because I was admittedly excited for my own results and, in part, to show others that my treatment approach provided by Moffitt Cancer Center can be successful.",

      "Content": "I had a question for you guys. I've had blood in my semen for six months now. The first time, it was bright red and I went to the Cancer Center that treated me (HDR brachytherapy plus IMRT) and they prescribed an antibiotic thinking it was an infection. However, it's continued although the color is dark brown and not red. I am going to follow up with the Cancer Center but I was wondering if anybody had seen or heard something similar. Note that my PSA has been going down and the latest value, actually taken as part of an annual physical with my primary physician in March, was 0.3 ng/mL. This represents a continuing decrease after an initial PSA bounce. Anyway, like I say, I'm planning on following up with this with the treatment center but I was wondering if guys on this forum have either experienced something similar or heard about it.",

      "Content": "I had HDR brachytherapy plus 5 weeks of IMRT (external beam radiation) in early 2014. I had one HDR procedure, started daily IMRT a couple of days later I think, then had the second HDR procedure three weeks after the first one and then finished the daily radiation. I think that's basically how it was scheduled. The HDR resulted in difficulty in urinating and having to urine frequently. I woke up 5 - 6 times a night for a week or so and had to walk around to get a stream going. Also some changes in bowel movements but the urinary symptoms were the most pronounced. I did agree to get a dissolvable spacer between prostate and rectum which minimized any side effects to the rectum. It worked well. Things started to calm down after a week or so and then I had the second HDR. After that one, I couldn't urinate later that night and had to go back and get a catheter which I used for three days. Things got better, I was shown how to self-catheterize for a couple of more days, and then I was okay. During this whole time I received tamsulosin, a generic Flomax which I still take although I only take it every other day. I didn't really have any issues with the daily radiation process except I was tired for a few months afterwards. All in all, the urinary side effects of these procedures lasted a few weeks and then slowly got better. I feel it was worth it given the alternative of not seeking treatment. I did not receive hormone therapy for this treatment. It was not warranted according to protocol for my case. I had explored nine weeks of daily radiation without the HDR \"boost\" where I would have to have hormone therapy before and for 2 - 3 years afterwards. I opted for the HDR plus daily radiation without HT. So far, so good. However, with radiation, there is a possibility of PSA \"bounce\" which I posted in more detail under the sticky. Hope this helps.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed exactly three years ago and chose HDR Brachytherapy + 5 weeks of IMRT at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. I also had an intermediate-risk cancer. Brachytherapy initially is no walk in the park. I had two treatments combined with the IMRT. The first few days after each HDR brachytherapy I was pretty sore. After the second treatment, I had significant urinary retention and needed a catheter for 3 - 4 days. Afterwards, I needed to urinate pretty frequently. For instance, I was getting up 4 - 5 times a night for a few weeks or maybe more. They gave me tamsulosin (generic Flomax) which helped. In fact, I still take it although now once rather than twice a day. I had no rectal issues although they did insert a \"spacer\" to minimize the radiation reaching the rectum. As for the IMRT, I had no significant side effects except for being cold and tired a lot. My PSA went from 7.4 (just before treatment) to ~0.3 this past June. I go back for my next visit a little later this month. I did see my PSA bounce during the first year or so (go up and then down) which is not so unusual after this treatment. If I had to do it over again, I would choose the same kind of treatment. But everyone is different. One last point. While not experiencing it too much in my first year after treatment, ED got worse over time. It would have been problematic for my situation if I had chosen surgery as well. The difference is that it's immediate after surgery (if it's not nerve sparing) and comes on slowly after radiation treatment.",
