      "Content": "Bit embarassing for me to talk about, but I figure here is probably the best place! I've had ED for about 5-6 years. It started after my first major bipolar episode and my collection of doctors think it's psychological and also related to the various drugs I've had to take. Recently I've tried to \"work on it\" (I'll let you fill in the gap) and have had some sucess. Definitely not like when I was 25, but better. I know from reading that a man's ejaculation gets \"weaker\" as we age. But mine is both weaker and less in volume, even with increasing the frequency of ejaculation. Is this possibly a symptom of BPH, prostatitis, prostate cancer? My uro is aware of the ED issues, but I haven't brought up this subject yet (see him next week for my biopsy). Bear in mind I'm only 46. Thanks guys.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mark H. Hi, I am new here. Yesterday I received a lab test back that stunned me. For many years I have had been treated for adult onset diabetes and high blood pressure (along with meds for cholesterol and lipids). I was so focused on those problems and the related tests that for several years (or more) I went without a PSA test; so I really don't know what my original baseline was after 2011 or so (when it was normal). Today, at nearly 67 my PSA came back at 9.5 and will be seeing my GP in a few days for followup. I don't even know if it is possible to have a 9.5 without cancer, but I am a nervous wreck. It would seem that one should not delay action and while I think a PC3 test and imaging might be useful, would it not be safest to have an ASAP removal of my prostate and lymph nodes? I really don't care if I have ED, but I fear I have waited to long. Will the doctor insist on a full battery of tests before such a procedure? Also, Id appreciate any feed back on MRI vs. color Doppler and whether or not both would compliment each other? Hi. Welcome to the forum. If you've read the first part of this thread, you'll know I'm still in the diagnosis stage. Someone more experienced will likely chime in after me, but I want to try and help you. It must be quite upsetting to unexpectantly get a PSA result of 9.5. Most doctors consider 6.5 to be the upper limit of the PSA range for caucassians (less if you're asian or african American) your age. So yours is definitely elevated, but don't panic just yet! One thing that can definitely raise levels dramatically is prostatitis. This is why, before my first PSA test, I was given a urine test and bacterial culture followed by a course of Cipro. So maybe this is a conversation you should have with your doctor, \"should we rule out prostatitis?\". The other thing that it could be is BPH (super common as we age). Your doctor should be able to tell if your prostate is enlarged with a Digital Rectal Exam (DRE). I'm not going to lie, it's not the most fun thing in the world (having another guy stick their finger up your bum), but it only lasts a few seconds. Imaging and biopsy can also be helpful here from what I understand. It's possible you've already had a DRE. DRE can also find suspecious portions of the prostate. So, to answer your question: I don't think you need to rush into removing your prostate and lymph nodes until you know what you're dealing with. Even if it's cancer, it could be a slowly growing form (most are) that might never even ever bother you health-wise. I would push for imaging and a biopsy. You'll note that a lot of people replied to my worries about the biopsy by saying it's not that much of a big deal. Finally, it sounds like your GP is stick-handling this right now? One thing I would say you need to be really forceful of with your primary physician is that you want to see a urologist ASAP. And if you don't like the urologist you get referred to, get referred to anohter one who hopefully you do like. A urologist is much better able to help you with diagnosis. I nearly didn't get referred to a urologist for my original PSA test because my GP said \"anything under 4 is fine\" -- most urologists would use a cutoff of 2.5 for a 46-year old. I can't answer your question on dopler versus MRI as I haven't had either done. But I know there's likely someone here who has and will. Let us know how you're making out. Celebrate your successes with us like \"I found a uro!\" or \"my biopsy was a breeze!\". Peace.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mark H. Hi, I am new here. Yesterday I received a lab test back that stunned me. For many years I have had been treated for adult onset diabetes and high blood pressure (along with meds for cholesterol and lipids). I was so focused on those problems and the related tests that for several years (or more) I went without a PSA test; so I really don't know what my original baseline was after 2011 or so (when it was normal). Today, at nearly 67 my PSA came back at 9.5 and will be seeing my GP in a few days for followup. I don't even know if it is possible to have a 9.5 without cancer, but I am a nervous wreck. It would seem that one should not delay action and while I think a PC3 test and imaging might be useful, would it not be safest to have an ASAP removal of my prostate and lymph nodes? I really don't care if I have ED, but I fear I have waited to long. Will the doctor insist on a full battery of tests before such a procedure? Also, Id appreciate any feed back on MRI vs. color Doppler and whether or not both would compliment each other? Hi. Welcome to the forum. If you've read the first part of this thread, you'll know I'm still in the diagnosis stage. Someone more experienced will likely chime in after me, but I want to try and help you. It must be quite upsetting to unexpectantly get a PSA result of 9.5. Most doctors consider 6.5 to be the upper limit of the PSA range for caucassians (less if you're asian or african American) your age. So yours is definitely elevated, but don't panic just yet! One thing that can definitely raise levels dramatically is prostatitis. This is why, before my first PSA test, I was given a urine test and bacterial culture followed by a course of Cipro. So maybe this is a conversation you should have with your doctor, \"should we rule out prostatitis?\". The other thing that it could be is BPH (super common as we age). Your doctor should be able to tell if your prostate is enlarged with a Digital Rectal Exam (DRE). I'm not going to lie, it's not the most fun thing in the world (having another guy stick their finger up your bum), but it only lasts a few seconds. Imaging and biopsy can also be helpful here from what I understand. It's possible you've already had a DRE. DRE can also find suspecious portions of the prostate. So, to answer your question: I don't think you need to rush into removing your prostate and lymph nodes until you know what you're dealing with. Even if it's cancer, it could be a slowly growing form (most are) that might never even ever bother you health-wise. I would push for imaging and a biopsy. You'll note that a lot of people replied to my worries about the biopsy by saying it's not that much of a big deal. Finally, it sounds like your GP is stick-handling this right now? One thing I would say you need to be really forceful of with your primary physician is that you want to see a urologist ASAP. And if you don't like the urologist you get referred to, get referred to anohter one who hopefully you do like. A urologist is much better able to help you with diagnosis.

      "Content": "Hi, I'm currently 46-years old. About 18-months ago I bullied my doctor (I mean that literally) into giving me a PSA/Free PSA test because I had some urinary issues and wanted to understand if they were possibily prostate related (BPH/prostatitis). Before the PSA test I was given a course of Cipro, urinalysis and a urine culture test. (The urinary issues turned out to be diabetes insipidus (Google it) due to lithium. I also have some ED issues, but everyone feels that's probably due to the cocktail of drugs I take for bipolar disorder.) My PSA came back at 2.9 with a Free PSA % of 16. I personally felt the PSA number wasn't super for my age and bullied her into sending me to a urologist (I feel that I need to be my own health advocate). The urologist said that my GP didn't know what she was talking about and that he'd want to see any patient my age with a PSA level over 2.5. He mentioned that my prostate was \"slightly\" enlarged but that he didn't seem to think I had prostatitis or BPH at that point. He said he'd keep me under observation and wrote me a lab requisition for approximately a year in the future. Fast forward 14-months and I had that second PSA test. My Total PSA came back at 5.2 (nearly doubling) and my Free % plummeted to 7%. My urologist was concerned with both the doubling and velocity and shuffled me into an extraordinarily long wait for a biopsy (I'm in Canada, things are different here compared to the U.S.). My biopsy is scheduled for August 15th and my results for August 30th. It'll be a 12-core TRUS with periprostatic nerve block. I'm so nervous about it my psychiatrist has prescribed sedatives for the day-of. I've been told by folks from the U.S. that I should do a PHI. This doesn't seem to be available in Canada (although there's a prviate lab in Montreal that could do a PSA3 test for me) and definutely not in Ontario. So, my questions: (1) Are there any other folk from Canada who can share their experience navigating diagnosis within our health care system. Bonus points if you're in Ontario. (2) If anyone knows how to get a PHI or mpMRI in Ontario without first having a TRUS biopsy, I'm all ears. Or should I just bite-the-bullet on the biopsy? (2) Are there any of you who found that Free PSA % dropping rapidly was indeed a predictor of PCa? In the meantime, I'm trying to keep myself busy and optomistic.",

I'm so nervous about it my psychiatrist has prescribed sedatives for the day-of. I've been told by folks from the U.S. that I should do a PHI. This doesn't seem to be available in Canada (although there's a prviate lab in Montreal that could do a PSA3 test for me) and definutely not in Ontario. So, my questions: (1) Are there any other folk from Canada who can share their experience navigating diagnosis within our health care system. Bonus points if you're in Ontario. (2) If anyone knows how to get a PHI or mpMRI in Ontario without first having a TRUS biopsy, I'm all ears. Or should I just bite-the-bullet on the biopsy? (2) Are there any of you who found that Free PSA % dropping rapidly was indeed a predictor of PCa? In the meantime, I'm trying to keep myself busy and optomistic.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm currently 46-years old. About 18-months ago I bullied my doctor (I mean that literally) into giving me a PSA/Free PSA test because I had some urinary issues and wanted to understand if they were possibily prostate related (BPH/prostatitis). Before the PSA test I was given a course of Cipro, urinalysis and a urine culture test. (The urinary issues turned out to be diabetes insipidus (Google it) due to lithium. I also have some ED issues, but everyone feels that's probably due to the cocktail of drugs I take for bipolar disorder.) My PSA came back at 2.9 with a Free PSA % of 16. I personally felt the PSA number wasn't super for my age and bullied her into sending me to a urologist (I feel that I need to be my own health advocate). The urologist said that my GP didn't know what she was talking about and that he'd want to see any patient my age with a PSA level over 2.5. He mentioned that my prostate was \"slightly\" enlarged but that he didn't seem to think I had prostatitis or BPH at that point. He said he'd keep me under observation and wrote me a lab requisition for approximately a year in the future. Fast forward 14-months and I had that second PSA test. My Total PSA came back at 5.2 (nearly doubling) and my Free % plummeted to 7%. My urologist was concerned with both the doubling and velocity and shuffled me into an extraordinarily long wait for a biopsy (I'm in Canada, things are different here compared to the U.S.).

My biopsy is scheduled for August 15th and my results for August 30th. It'll be a 12-core TRUS with periprostatic nerve block. I'm so nervous about it my psychiatrist has prescribed sedatives for the day-of. I've been told by folks from the U.S. that I should do a PHI. This doesn't seem to be available in Canada (although there's a prviate lab in Montreal that could do a PSA3 test for me) and definutely not in Ontario. So, my questions: (1) Are there any other folk from Canada who can share their experience navigating diagnosis within our health care system. Bonus points if you're in Ontario. (2) If anyone knows how to get a PHI or mpMRI in Ontario without first having a TRUS biopsy, I'm all ears. Or should I just bite-the-bullet on the biopsy? (2) Are there any of you who found that Free PSA % dropping rapidly was indeed a predictor of PCa? In the meantime, I'm trying to keep myself busy and optomistic.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm currently 46-years old. About 18-months ago I bullied my doctor (I mean that literally) into giving me a PSA/Free PSA test because I had some urinary issues and wanted to understand if they were possibily prostate related (BPH/prostatitis). Before the PSA test I was given a course of Cipro, urinalysis and a urine culture test. (The urinary issues turned out to be diabetes insipidus (Google it) due to lithium. I also have some ED issues, but everyone feels that's probably due to the cocktail of drugs I take for bipolar disorder.) My PSA came back at 2.9 with a Free PSA % of 16. I personally felt the PSA number wasn't super for my age and bullied her into sending me to a urologist (I feel that I need to be my own health advocate). The urologist said that my GP didn't know what she was talking about and that he'd want to see any patient my age with a PSA level over 2.5. He mentioned that my prostate was \"slightly\" enlarged but that he didn't seem to think I had prostatitis or BPH at that point. He said he'd keep me under observation and wrote me a lab requisition for approximately a year in the future. Fast forward 14-months and I had that second PSA test.

I also have some ED issues, but everyone feels that's probably due to the cocktail of drugs I take for bipolar disorder.) My PSA came back at 2.9 with a Free PSA % of 16. I personally felt the PSA number wasn't super for my age and bullied her into sending me to a urologist (I feel that I need to be my own health advocate). The urologist said that my GP didn't know what she was talking about and that he'd want to see any patient my age with a PSA level over 2.5. He mentioned that my prostate was \"slightly\" enlarged but that he didn't seem to think I had prostatitis or BPH at that point. He said he'd keep me under observation and wrote me a lab requisition for approximately a year in the future. Fast forward 14-months and I had that second PSA test. My Total PSA came back at 5.2 (nearly doubling) and my Free % plummeted to 7%. My urologist was concerned with both the doubling and velocity and shuffled me into an extraordinarily long wait for a biopsy (I'm in Canada, things are different here compared to the U.S.). My biopsy is scheduled for August 15th and my results for August 30th. It'll be a 12-core TRUS with periprostatic nerve block. I'm so nervous about it my psychiatrist has prescribed sedatives for the day-of. I've been told by folks from the U.S. that I should do a PHI. This doesn't seem to be available in Canada (although there's a prviate lab in Montreal that could do a PSA3 test for me) and definutely not in Ontario. So, my questions: (1) Are there any other folk from Canada who can share their experience navigating diagnosis within our health care system. Bonus points if you're in Ontario. (2) If anyone knows how to get a PHI or mpMRI in Ontario without first having a TRUS biopsy, I'm all ears. Or should I just bite-the-bullet on the biopsy? (2) Are there any of you who found that Free PSA % dropping rapidly was indeed a predictor of PCa? In the meantime, I'm trying to keep myself busy and optomistic.",
