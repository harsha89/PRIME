      "Content": "Hi, I also had 39 treatments about 7 years ago. The most i remember is having to pee every 15 minutes literally. I guess i could have called it a burn it was an intense urge and then couldn't get much out each time. Fitting because how much i went through the day. The doc prescribed ambian for the bad nites so i could stay asleep longer. Towards the end i got really bad gas and diarrhea. I was pretty wore out by the last few weeks because i work weekends so i was running 7 days aweek. All in all it was tolerable compared to what i thought it it would be. But we all respond differently to any treatment so it could be different for you. The lupron kicked my butt way more than radiation and still dose today 7 years later. The best of luck with remainder of your treatments. Thomas",

Nobody can really know the feeling of hearing the words you have cancer. You are no different from the rest of us we all went through it just like yoh are now. One thing you have going for you it is most likely contained within the postate and you can get rid of it. If for any reason it may return you can then go with radiation salvage.

It's uncomfortable for sure to even think about getting a biopsy, and all the other stuff done. Heck, even a digital rectal exam can scare the hell out of a guy that has never been to the doctors much. That was me 5 years ago. I swear he can make it through all of the embarrassing stuff...i did. To get this taken care of before there is any chance if it is PC, to spread beyond the postrate is very important as it can give you and your bf more options in treatment. I pray its not cancer, good luck and keep us posted.",

Incontnance and impotence are tough to deal with plus just having the cancer itself is hard to grasp early on for sure. I have had big changes in myself from hormone therapy and have been on it for seven years. The side effects of mood swings, depression and ED. Still gets to me. Its kind of like the new normal we have to live with. You would think after 7 years i would be an old hand at this stuff but in october i had a psa spike which in january ill have another psa done and scans. if it rises again their talking chemo. Actually this second time around is is no easier than the first. This crap aint easy. Thomas",

      "Content": "Hi pretzel, I have been on lupron for almost 5 years. The side effects really hit me hard right from the get go. Moody, hot flashes every 20 minutes and sex for the first year i couldnt even think about. I also have heard that the majority of the side effects are from the absence of testosterone. The bone issue and weight gain and muscle loss im not sure. Thats a good question for the docs. I am lately experiencing increased loss of energy and forgetfulness and just feeling weird. Im sure its not good to be on any drug for this long. To finish i never thought of surgical castration till recently. Im mostly thinking on my bones and weight gain and possible increased chance of senility down the road. Maybe others know more about HDT here then me, i just know it kinda sucks but better than the other result. Keep us posted! Thomas",

      "Content": "I suppose i was to smug with my condition the past 4 years. The only thing i cared about was the terrible side effects the Lupron had on me and when i could stop them. I did elect to skip an injection to see if i could return to my old self. Well, going through puberty again was just about as bad having zero T. It did get better at the six month visit to the urologist. I felt good then, and planned on not getting another injection but my Psa jumped to 4. Of course i back on the lupron. The next visit Psa back down to 0.1. The next two 6 month visits 0.9. The following visit 6 months later is 2.9. In Febuary 2017 will see what goes and probably have some bone scans then. I had never been on any fourms before and like i said before very nonchalant about my PCa. I think this will change next visit not sure. Thanks for all on this fourm as i am learning more about my PCa. Thomas",
