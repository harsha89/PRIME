I know about 5 guys in that boat, that have opted for brachy and all are doing well. I know that there are a lot of variables with PC as in other cancers but when I was doing my research, I found that the life expectancy at 10yrs (and I believe there was also a 15yr study) was the same as if surgery was chosen. The recovery time and side effects are also a lot less than surgery. Granted you still have your prostate, but I have no regrets having the brachytherapy done. I will be going to the doc every 3 months for 2 yrs with a PSA chk each time. My second apt is this month.",

I then traveled to Stanford Cancer Center and met with a robotic doctor and received more information. My next step was to travel to the Seattle Prostate Institute and met with a doctor who explained about Brachytherapy. He explained their procedure and how it compared with the other options. I was very undecided, jumping from one option then another and very stressed out. After hearing what the Seattle Prostate Institute said it was like a light came on and that was it, LDR Brachytherapy is what I picked. My procedure is tentitively set for 9/3. They told me what to expect, but of course I am still a little nervous, but just making a decision has taken a lot of stress off of me. Has anyone gone through LDR Brachytherapy?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by blank Hi there, I had brachytherapy in March 2013 - 66 Pd-103 seeds. It was an agonizing decision of bouncing between the three modalities (with all their variations) but I finally settled on brachytherapy because, based on research, I strongly feel that brachytherapy is near being the \"Gold Standard\" for treating PCa. My top three concerns were/are: cancer control continence sexual function (although as crazy as it sounds - and it does sound crazy but a lot of men feel this way - this is almost #1 for me) I was riddled with anxiety pre-surgery (I never had surgery before). Once I received the IV pre-surgery 'cocktail' (I believe it was Versed) they could have done anything to me. Shortly afterward, they wheeled me into the surgery room and the anesthesiologist put me out. I woke up a bit groggy about an hour later. As soon as I could pee, I was allowed to leave and my wife drove us home. I burned for about 2-3 days when I urinated (catheter burn). That's it. I was sore but needed no medication outside of an occasional Tylenol. The doctor put me on Rapaflo to help me urinate (which I am now weening off of without too much of a problem). Sexual function: Erections are strong. No medication needed for them. If anything, my sex life has gotten better post-cancer. I feel stronger and harder than ever - \"harder than penitentiary steel.\" My desire has increased. The only disquieting thing about sex was orgasms with little to no ejaculate. It took me some time to get used to it but we were having sex a few weeks post-surgery. I was concerned about shooting one of the seeds out of me but they're stranded together these days so little chance of that. Continence: I have no real urinary issues. Cancer control: My PSA was cut in half first post-brachytherapy PSA. I get another one in about a month or so. I consider myself cured. Time will tell the tale. Sometimes if feels like *something* is going *in there* but this is the radiation working. It feels like a low sort of burning. Good luck. I am sure you will be fine and afterward be happy you picked brachytherapy. Thank you Blank for the information on your Brachytherapy. The more I know going in the better I feel. Your progress sounds great! I do not know as yet the number of seeds or the strength, but he did say that they were stranded and that being stranded he could place them closer to the edge to prevent positive margins. I forgot to ask and can't figure out how they get \"stranded\" seeds in without an inscision? As for the burning urination, the doc's nurse told me she has heard guys describe the first urnination as \"pissing fire\" or \"pissing razor blades\" but she assured me that the burning will decrease and to drink a lot. Blank, may I ask you about how old you are? And again congradulations on your great progress, I hope to be right behind you!",

      "Content": "In a new research paper (dated August 30,2013) the author states there is evidence that when prostate cancer is slow growing it will not proceed to the more aggressive type. If this is true?? it will most likely change the way we deal with PC. The author does say at the end of the paper that more research is needed. The concept to me is intriguing.Remember research papers are a dime a dozen,but they are interesting and to me it is better to stay informed. Here is the first part of the paper: Home » Genitourinary Cancer » Prostate Cancer EMAIL | PRINT | PDF | REPRINT | SHARE FacebookStumbleuponTweet thisRESEARCH REPORT Aggressiveness of Prostate Tumors May Not Change as Cancer Evolves By Anna Azvolinsky, PhD1 | August 30, 2013 1Freelance Science Writer and Cancer Network Contributor. Follow Her on Twitter -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Prostate tumors may not readily evolve from low to high grade, according to a research study published in Cancer Research. Kathryn Penney, ScD, epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Channing Division of Network Medicine at Brigham and Women\u0092s Hospital in Boston, and colleagues show that the aggressiveness of a prostate tumor could be established at the time of tumor formation. The results have important clinical implications for prostate cancer patients and clinicians when deciding on whether to choose active surveillance or treatment. If the aggressiveness of a tumor does not change drastically in the course of the disease, patients diagnosed with early-stage and low-grade prostate tumors may be more likely to avoid overtreatment and choose surveillance.

      "Content": "I am scheduled for LDR brachytherapy on Sept 4. My doc started me on Cialis a week before the procedure, 5mg every day. After the 2nd day my lower back started to ache,and it was worse at night in bed resulting in little sleep. I just thought that I had strained my back. After the 3rd day my back got worse and my legs felt sore like I had the flu.I could not sleep tossing and turning all night.After the 3rd day of Cialis I quit taking it. Last night (4th night) the pain was still there, took a couple of ibuprofen and laid on the heating pad, that seemed to help. No more Cialis for me. I have not told the doc about this yet so I do not know what he will say. I am supposed to start Flomax on Monday. Has anyone else expierienced this side effect from Cialis?",

It took 2-3 days to finally get back to normal as the half life of Cialis is around 17 hours. I gave it a while and tried again with the same results. Viagra has been offered but is short lived for intercourse, I was hoping to help recovery by using Cialis, instead I am now using a penis pump. Only pain now is when the the rings snap around the shaft, ooh that hurts. All the best Tony Thanks, I was wondering how long this would stay in my system, guess I will have to wait another couple of days......",

      "Content": "I am scheduled for LDR brachytherapy on Sept 4. My doc started me on Cialis a week before the procedure, 5mg every day. After the 2nd day my lower back started to ache,and it was worse at night in bed resulting in little sleep. I just thought that I had strained my back. After the 3rd day my back got worse and my legs felt sore like I had the flu.I could not sleep tossing and turning all night.After the 3rd day of Cialis I quit taking it. Last night (4th night) the pain was still there, took a couple of ibuprofen and laid on the heating pad, that seemed to help. No more Cialis for me. I have not told the doc about this yet so I do not know what he will say. I am supposed to start Flomax on Monday. Has anyone else expierienced this side effect from Cialis?",

Get opinions from your own doc then second and third opinions from other docs. Read Dr Walsh's book, surviving prostate cancer (get the latest edition). My brother in law at age 50 had PC 3+3=6 and opted for brachytherapy, this was 5 years ago and he is very pleased with his choice. The last I checked Brachytherapy has the same 15yr survival rate as surgery. Living where you do in S. Cal you have a wealth of good docs, hospitals, and universities.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jassythedog Hi Some 8 weeks post LP operation I had the same problem with Cialis plus really bad heartburn. It took 2-3 days to finally get back to normal as the half life of Cialis is around 17 hours. I gave it a while and tried again with the same results. Viagra has been offered but is short lived for intercourse, I was hoping to help recovery by using Cialis, instead I am now using a penis pump. Only pain now is when the the rings snap around the shaft, ooh that hurts. All the best Tony Thanks, I was wondering how long this would stay in my system, guess I will have to wait another couple of days......",

My brother in law at age 50 had PC 3+3=6 and opted for brachytherapy, this was 5 years ago and he is very pleased with his choice.
