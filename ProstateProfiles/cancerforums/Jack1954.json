At least you now know the facts and will generate a gameplan to be cured. Now is the time to be highly proactive! Let's consider some of the good news: - Be very thankful that you did not put off \"First PSA test ever\" until July 2017!!! - Your latest PSA (12) is at a level where metastatic PC is unlikely - \"Urologist advised me it doesn\u0092t look like cancer has spread OUTSIDE\" the prostate Your PSA is rising, so time is not your ally. Keep in mind that you now have only \"1\" good opportunity to get this done correctly from the start. You must be in the hands of a top expert URO surgeon who is highly experienced and specializes in PC surgery. He/she should be doing 3-5 RPs per week. If this Uro surgeon is doing RALPs, simply be sure that they have done at least 300 to date. Take immediate action, exactly as you are doing!, and set an appointment for 2nd opinion surgical consultation NOW. If you can get an appointment before your PET scan, take it! The PET scan results can be forwarded. Once you have found an excellent URO surgeon and you are scheduled for surgery, the rest is actually quite easy! If not currently on an exercise regimen, start one today with your MDs advice and approval. At the very least, get on a walking regimen and build up the daily time, pace and duration as you will need to do this following surgery. Also, loose as much excess weight as possible. Exercise and weight loss will be beneficial to recovery as well as your overall health status. You will also need to learn the 'the fine art of The Kegel' as this will become a daily regimen post surgery. Relax and stay positive and optimistic! Worry and anxiety are bad for one's health. So simply remain calm and have fun as you progress along the path to a complete cure! Your Forum Friends are with you every step of the way! MF",

      "Content": "Hi All I\u0092ve been for my first ever 12 core biopsy. It was not comfortable at all and I\u0092ve felt all the needles taking samples from my prostrate. However the findings during the exams are: hypoechoic lesion prostate in the peripheral zone which correspond to the MRI findings which shows heterogeneous signal in the same area. However the size difference is around 10gm as MRI shows 32gm and now its 42gm and MRI was done last week. I am now waiting for the report results (takes around 7-10) days. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Jack, It probably varies from case to case. For example, if a man has an extremely high PSA (double digits) and a biopsy report of aggressive prostate cancer, it could be suspected that it has spread. Probably the main way, however, to know if it has spread is through the ongoing PSA tests after treatment is complete. As I said, there are various ways such a thing could be confirmed. If post-op pathology shows there are no positive margins, no extraprostatic extension, no lymph node involvement, it could further state that the disease was organ confined (still restricted to the prostate) even if it is aggressive in nature. An MRI, perhaps a 3T MRI, can offer hints at potential trouble spots in and/or around the prostate, which can be clues. Do you have a specific set of circumstances (or know of someone with them) that we might help you get some ideas about? thanks I was just wondering I am now going for my first ever biopsy. My 3t mri showed no enhancement it only pointed out heterogeneous signal in left which correlates with DRE exam finding where doctor find left lobe hard. I am just curious as at no stage no one mention any thing about lesion/signal confined or spread. I am not in favor of biopsies however based on my circumstance I've to go for one now. I was just curious as I am going for invasive techniques. And if this turn out to be aggressive don't want to make thing worst thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Jack, It probably varies from case to case. For example, if a man has an extremely high PSA (double digits) and a biopsy report of aggressive prostate cancer, it could be suspected that it has spread. Probably the main way, however, to know if it has spread is through the ongoing PSA tests after treatment is complete. As I said, there are various ways such a thing could be confirmed. If post-op pathology shows there are no positive margins, no extraprostatic extension, no lymph node involvement, it could further state that the disease was organ confined (still restricted to the prostate) even if it is aggressive in nature. An MRI, perhaps a 3T MRI, can offer hints at potential trouble spots in and/or around the prostate, which can be clues. Do you have a specific set of circumstances (or know of someone with them) that we might help you get some ideas about? thanks I was just wondering I am now going for my first ever biopsy. My 3t mri showed no enhancement it only pointed out heterogeneous signal in left which correlates with DRE exam finding where doctor find left lobe hard. I am just curious as at no stage no one mention any thing about lesion/signal confined or spread. I am not in favor of biopsies however based on my circumstance I've to go for one now. I was just curious as I am going for invasive techniques. And if this turn out to be aggressive don't want to make thing worst thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Jack, Did you get a copy of the MRI report? If so, did it state that a lesion was identified? Was a PIRADS score assigned? If so, what was that number? If the suspicious area did not contain a PIRADS lesion rated above 3, then that is a hopeful sign that you may not have a serious cancer. Still, with the positive DRE, the biopsy is probably necessary. Yes I did get a copy of my MRI report and it says no score however it says - 'heterogeneous signal intensity' which is 3 in PIRADS & says no enhancement which is negative on pirads. thanks.",

      "Content": "Hi quick update on my rrp- I had my surgery yesterday and surgeon successfully removed the whole prostrate and spared right nerves based on imaging investigations and and what he saw(I was not expecting this gleason 5+4). Ive been to hospital didn't eat for 12 hrs before surgery n 9am admission, 9.30 surgery 12.30 complete 12.30-4.30 recovery. Then to ward. When i woke up throat was very bad n very bad back pain. Ive not been to toilet yet but hopefully tomm. Morning. Gas passed on day-1. I had my drainage pipe removed today. I am feeling much better today and had walk few times. Urine flow is good however some blood spots near the entrance. Doc says nothing to worry n I will be discharged tomm. Catheter removal is 9 days from now with pathology report. As per doc he did his best n rest is based on report in his opinion its confined. Will update u further after catheter removal. Thanks",

Does this confirm that cancer is still confined within the postrate or after the surgery there could be surprises? and that will then make me regret that why I choose surgery over radiation as what I've read radiation is beneficial for grade 8-9 over surgery. cheers",

I understand the benefit of biopsy however at this stage I dont have enough evidence to say that this could be Ca as I don't have PSA history and pSA free/pca3 or any MRI outcome to suggest this can be Ca. My plan is to wait and watch for 3 months then another PSA and if this is high then go for MRI with spectroscopy or multiparametric to identify grade of tumor as high grades will apear on MRI and if this is low grade(doesnt show on mri) then there is 'wait and watch' anyways (even if its idetified using biopsy). what are your thoughts?

Here is my story \u0096 I had frequent urination problems in Oct-15 and after initial DRE test my doctor advised me to go for ultrasound and found out that my prostrate is slightly enlarged to 28gms. And he then prescribed me tamsulosin tablets for couple of months and to go for the ultrasound in Feb-16. Ultrasound in feb shows no issues and size back to 23gm classed as very normal. However my frequent urination problem and difficulty controlling urine persists and in jun-16 I decided to visit my doctor again. Ultrasound shows some infection (Cystitis) and I was prescribed antibiotics for 14 days. And that did benefit me for a week or so but my urination issues came back again. In July first week my doctor decided to do a PSA test and that came back as 7.9. I understand normal is <4. I\u0092ve seen urologist consultant and he is keen to do a biopsy. However in my opinion, I don\u0092t have enough history of evidence to say how my PSAs are elevating or any other severe issue other than urination. I\u0092ve requested if I can have free-PSA test/PCA3 test/ trans-rectal MRI before biopsy however consultant shows no interest in these test. He has advised me that other than Biopsy he can only suggest to wait for 3 months to see PSA levels and if these are still above 4 I should go for biopsy. I will say I am very healthy man, no family history of any Ca, and I do not want biopsy if there are other test and imaging available. What would you recommend should I go for second opinion or seek private MRI as this could be due to NHSs in England only follow this procedure and as read in many post biopsy is the cost effective option .

And final grade pt3b n1 mx. My current surgeon team which includes surgeons, onclogists and radio oncos suggest that wait for 4 weeks for 1st psa and then 8 weeks for the next and then to decide based on the psa values. However they did mention radiation is must all they are trying to figure out is when. I\u0092ve been for 2nd and 3rd opinions with medical and radiation oncologist and both agreed that radiation should start straight away after 6 weeks based on high gleason. Now I\u0092ve decision to make as my current team knows what they are dealing with they are experienced as well, however my opinions suggest to take next course of action and leave my old team. I am not ready for the radiation yet and need another 4 weeks before I can think of any further treatment as this will give me time to recover. One of my friends also told me to try RSO \u0096 CBD oil. Any opinions???? should I give a go? any benefits. I would like your opinion based on your experience as you all are being so helpful.

      "Content": "Analysis on Gleason 8/9/10 Anyone with higher Gleason (8/9/10) and had RALP surgery - experience please share? I understand doctors are saying that cancer is confined based on DRE/MRI/Bone Scan/Pet Ct however all the stories I\u0092ve read states, that only after surgery true picture is confirmed. As prostrate pathology can confirm that Ca has not spread outside e.g. node, body part etc. and based on the post-surgery PSA further treatment plans are decided. This proves that before surgery urologist/oncologist/surgeons are only kind of trying to guess what\u0092s best for you unless they have found something on MRI/other scans, which might lead them to avoid surgery. What I am trying to mention here is only post-surgery outcome can confirm what you are dealing with? Biopsy is kind of view which can show false negative or positives for high Gleasons where the report is showing its confined. Also I\u0092ve not able to find a single story where there is Gleason 8-10 and after surgery its been confirmed there are no positive margins. Then why all the Surgeons emphasise to get surgery done when this is not going to cure and you would need further treatment, is it just to make sure ca has spread outside in lab? Which was not captured in any of the scans or tests? What I\u0092ve read shows that post surgery shows positive margins for all the surgery cases for high grades and further treatments are required. Not a single case where surgery done and psa goes undetectable. I don\u0092t want to sound negative however I\u0092ve my RALP in few days and I think this is my only choice based on options available and I must say for higher Gleason there are not many options.

      "Content": "Thanks for your explanation and reply. My surgeon is one of the best robotic surgeons and he consulted his oncology and radiology team before taking surgery option. And I do trust him however its journals/stories and outcome of higher grade Gleason I've read. In my opinion Pros of surgery - slices confirms exact Gleason (biopsy can under or over grade) and extent of damage done (mets). - Possibility that is no further treatment is required. Cons - catheter (for around 10 days but its a setback) - if there are mets or micro mets then majority of the studies shows surgery made no difference to the survival, which means surgery pain without any gain. The other reason I opted for surgery is I can choose radiation/chemo/hormonal option after surgery however surgery is not possible after radiation. Although myths are always there that biopsy or surgery can spread the cancer cells to other parts however no studies or data is there to support this. cheers Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Jack! We feel your frustration! The PC community still needs upfront diagnostics that accurately pinpoint, quantify and qualify PC. When this becomes reality, the best treatment option for each case will be better defined. One day we will be there but for now none of us can wait! Here is a link to the AUA Guidelines on Radiation following RP. It is lengthy and viscous BUT contains a lot of valuable information and you can \"cherry pick\" the pertinent details. This site also allows one to download the PDF version: https://www.auanet.org/education/gui...statectomy.cfm Re \"Conclusion - Cancer Confined and fit for surgery (3 different opinion from 3 top urologist and oncologists - all agreed davinci):\" By getting the advice of multiple expert MDs you have taken the BEST action steps to determine the treatment modality that: offers the best chance of cure, fits your psyche and one that you are physiologically qualified to withstand. Kudos to you for your diligence! It is always a good thing to have treatment options as patients can select the treatment that 'best fits' their individual sum total of issues. RP has 2 advantages: 1) - The surgical site and surrounding 'neighborhood' is visually examined and palpated (if Open RP) by the surgeon 2) - The excised prostate gland is subjected to detailed histologic and pathologic assessment. The result is a bunch of facts that must be evaluated to determine the 'risk for recurrence' probability. The factors include: - Gleason Stage - Surgical Margin Status - Seminal Vesicle Invasion - Lymph Node Status - EPEs Surgical failure or ineptitude are rarely/never mentioned as a contributing cause of Biochemical Recurrence (BR). For this reason, one must select a highly skilled URO Surgeon who specializes in PC. With all respect and fairness to the URO Surgeons, even the very best will have cases where a perfect surgical result is not possible. Also, the surgeons have no control over the course of PC progression leading up to surgery. The \"micro\" status of progressing PC can not be visualized during surgery. The statistics show that approximately 30% of RPs require subsequent Radiation Therapy (AR or SR). Based on the assessment of the above risk factors, the URO and ONCO MDs attempt to accurately determine which patients have a high probability of BR and make recommendations for Radiation. Since your Gleason Stage is High Risk going into surgery you can predict that following RP, your MD(s) will have \"The Radiation Discussion\" with you. If any additional single or multiple above risk factor(s) is/are (+), the literature and current clinical standards of practice recommend RT. The exact findings will determine AR vs Early SR. So why elect surgery if post RP Radiation is likely? - There is a favorable likelihood that 100% of the PC will be removed resulting in cure. - Surgery usually removes nearly 100% of the PC cells! For example, a patient has a pre-op PSA = 6.52 and a post op PSA = 0.02: This suggests that 99.997% of the PSA producing cells have been excised! - In the event of BR, RT remains as a curative option. Following your RP, ask your MD to monitor your PSA using ultrasensitive methodology which will allow for early detection of a clinically rising PSA. Be sure to use The Same Lab Same Assay each time moving forward. Good luck on Nov 4 and best wishes to be in the 70% post RP group who do not need RT! MF",

Most of the time pain I experience is when I lay down or sit down. Already saw urologist last week he did ultrasound to see everything is fine inside and ultrasound was normal, PSA suggests no mets as <.008. I\u0092ve read various forums and it says pain will be there for 3-6 months. Also I am relived after taking pain killers. Anyone with the similar experience? Thanks JAck",
