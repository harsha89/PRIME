      "Content": "I'm 39yo and I've had difficulty maintaining an erection for the past 2 years. I took Viagra for the 1st time last night and It was absolutely amazing, I cut less than half off a 100mg dose and I was physically pointing to the ceiling in less than 30 minutes (when stimulated), my wife and I were \"extremely satisfied\". I could definitely feel it working almost like a high throughout my entire body, my motor skills were sharp and I performed solid for approximately 1.5 hrs without stopping. As others have indicated, my climax was highly impressive. The side effects after 2-3 hours were a slight upset stomach, tired vision , a stuffy nose and minor aches and pains. When I woke up this morning I was perfectly fine on all accounts. My only complaint is the inability to split this pill into quarters or at a minimum, halves. success stories",
