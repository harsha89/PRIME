    "Content": "Hi there, I am obviously new here and am currently waiting for my biopsy appointment in mid-August. I've already been waiting 2 or 3 weeks and it's driving me crazy. I am 54 and had a routine checkup in April which detected PSA of 3.2. My previous checkup at the end of 2015 had shown PSA of only 1.1. We did a follow-up test in June which revealed the PSA level had jumped to 5.4. At that point my PCP referred me to see a urologist who informed me I have a 25% of it being cancer (no family history). It's been a couple weeks since then and I am not feeling well. I have pain sometimes down below and a general sense of discomfort. Two DRE did not reveal anything other than that my doctor has really fat fingers . I have not had the problems with urination which usually accompany prostate issues, but within the last week I have begun to have to get up in the middle of the night more often. I've always had solid healthy blood pressure, but now it has elevated into the hypertension range. I had a nosebleed a couple months ago and I have never been prone to those. I have a lot of fatigue and can sleep 12 hours a day. Maybe it's just my brain playing tricks on me with having to wait so long for the biopsy. I'm not really worried if it turns out to be cancer. I'd be more relieved to actually have a diagnosis than to not know what's happening to my body. I looked up the doctor to whom I was referred and he's rated one of the best in the county so I guess that makes the wait somewhat palatable. I know they use the daVinci robotic machine for operation. I've read up on all the different procedures. If it turns out to be cancer I will have a lot of questions for my doctor such as how long will I need to take off from work (desk job). Once the biopsy results come in, I wonder if I have to wait another month or more to begin treatment or will they hop on it much faster. Anyway, if anyone has any suggestions or recommendations, I would appreciate hearing about your experiences. Regards, Mark",
