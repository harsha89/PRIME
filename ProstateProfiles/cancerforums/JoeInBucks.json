It's a real pharmacy not just an order filler. Cialis was a little $4 a pill for 5 mg. When refilling the 1st time I tried the generic Tadifil. It's was a little over $1 per pill and works as well as Cialis.",

Not so much the details of the upcoming surgery, but the details of what I need to accomplish before I can't, and how to recover after. Surgery is Monday.

Worked hard on pre-surgery, lost 35 pounds, been hitting the cardio hard, quit drinking and have been eating good. Now I need to come up with a post surgery plan to get back up and running ASAP. Yeah, I know, take your time to heal, and I will, but I need a plan. I wish this would't have taken so long to get to. I just got off the phone with My granddaughter, she is scared, she is losing too many family members lately, we just lost my Grandma today at 98 years old, and her Grandmother is dying of lung cancer. I told her I'm fine but she is scared. Done venting for now. Getting back to work by 10/8 should not be a problem but don't do any heavy lifting. Most doctors tell you not to lift anything heavier than 10 lbs for six weeks because of the risk of an incisional hernia. I was back to work in less than a week and a half but took the lifting instructions seriously. I'm a CPA so nothing strenuous is involved. Getting back to your normal routine is better than sitting around all day and I think speeds recovery. Start off easy but walk as much as you can.",

Not sure if it is the same for you but I found out after a hip replacement that my metabolism increase significantly during the healing process. I was able to eat a fair amount more than normal without gaining wight in spite of not working out. It was the same after DiVinci surgery to a lesser degree. The increased metabolism lasted about 2-3 months. I eased into lifting after the 6 week wait gradually over a 6-8 week period. The core muscles seemed to take longer to recover. Probably back to normal fully after 4 months.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kozmic Working on it! I'm down 20 pounds and still working at it! But I have to say, I find nothing about the torture of eating weeds and walking and riding to \"nowhere\" enjoyable. I doubt that I will ever find joy in this torture. I used to come home after work and work out in my shop doing something productive till bed time. Now I come home from work, eat weeds, and do work that accomplishes nothing, all while the work I want to do, and need to do, sits waiting. I do understand the need to lose weight, but when I said \"i don't have time for it\" I was right. Now I know why city people live in those zero lot line homes shoulder to shoulder, it's so they have time to do nothing. Kozmic sounds like you are only doing cardio type exercises. I agree that that type of work out can be extreamly boring. Try some resistance training instead or mix it in. The advantage of resistance training is that as you increase muscle mass your resting metabolic rate increases. If partook your goal is to keep your heart rate up don't rest between sets, just alternate between two different exercises.",

      "Content": "You numbers are pretty close to mine when I was diagnosed at 62. The biopsy was all 3+3. If I was older I may have made another decision but went with robotic surgery rather than radiation being somewhat concerned with the long term effect of radiation. I also have a good history in recovering from surgery and injuries which played into my decision. As it turned out in the post op examination of the prostate my Gleason was actually 3+4 so it confirmed my decision. Recovered well from the surgery, no ED or incontenence issues almost from the start. If I was 5-6 years older like you I might have considered active survailence getting PSA test every 4-6 months or so and biopsies as indicated by the PSA or maybe annually. If you make it to your 70's without a big jump in Gleason some type of radiation might be the way to go. Be realistic about what kind of shape you are in and how you will tolerate surgery. The side effects are worse early and tend to improve (although not always). In your 70's you would have less time for the side effects to develop. If you do decide on surgery I'd go with a surgeon that does the robotic (DaVinci) and does a lot of them. Also consider where in the prostate the positive cores were found. If they were near the nerves that might give me something else to consider. My positives were not near the perimeter. Take your time in deciding. No need to rush. Maybe go on AS for a year and get more educated. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind I found walking to be a great help in achieving a smooth recovery.....You have had major surgery and it takes a year to fully recover from it..Where was your surgery performed? My experience was a lot quicker than a year. I felt fully recovered at about 3 months. Had RALP surgery mid-Feb this year. Started back to lifting at the gym at 5 weeks just to go through the motions with no weight. At 6 weeks started gradually adding weight and by week twelve was pretty much at pre op levels. Core muscles a little longer to get back, probably about 15 weeks. This was a longer recovery than the hip replacement I had 9 years back and the herina repair two years back. Not because of how I felt but because of the possibility of an incisional hernia. I was a lot more careful about not pushing things to hard to fast. The incisions sometimes had an itchy pin prick feeling at times but no pain. I thinking it was just scar tissue. I'm not a real golfer just play in work related scrambles a couple time a year. If I was, I'd wait the full period the doctor recommended then start back easy with just the short irons for the first week or two then work up to the driver in another couple of weeks.

      "Content": "Mark, I had my RALPH about a week before your aborted procedure. It's about 50 years that I have been lifting weights and working out. Started at 13 which makes me 63 (which can't be right). It was lifting and football til 29, power lifting in my 30's to mid 40's, lifting and Tai Kwon Do and kick boxing till early 50's when a hip replacement put an end to the kick boxing. Since then it's just been lifting and moderate cardio. Got back to the gym in about 2 1/2 weeks after the hip replacement but after this surgery because of the concern about the potential for an incisional hernia I was pretty good about following the rules about no lifting for six weeks although at week five I did go to the gym and just went through the motions on some non core machines with almost no weight. At six weeks started with with very little weight, starting more or less with warm up weight for most exercises especially those utilizing core muscles. Gradually over another six - eight week period pretty much was using pre op weight. Never pushed it hard and if anything felt weird at all would stop. Was even more cautious with any core exercises. Still not pushing it with planks all the way. Every once in a while I'd feel a little soreness around the invisions mostly the one in the middle. Slight pin prick sensations on occasions that I figured was just stretching out scar tissue. Not having had either radiation or Lupron I dont know how that would affect working out. I was alway a big believer in trying to work out even if you don't feel the best even if you are just going through the motions. When you do feel better it's all the better. When you don't feel good dial it down when you do dial it up. Get plenty of rest, eat well and you should be good. Hope that helps.",
