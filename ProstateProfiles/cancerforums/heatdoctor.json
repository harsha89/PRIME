      "Content": "After several yearly PSA's of around 1.5, this year mine jumped to 5.6. I am 67 years young. I was scheduled for a biopsy. However, in the meantime, I did some research & found a N.Y. Times article dated 2003 which quoted a huge study showing that PSA varied significantly over time. The study recommended a 2nd PSA test 4-6 weeks after the elevated result PRIOR to having a biopsy. So, that is what I did & the result was that my PSA went back down to 1.4. I have had 3 digital exams over the past 2 months & they are more or less unremarkable. So, the BIG question is what do I do now? There seems to be no consensus. I don't want to do a biopsy if it is not needed! I decided to wait 3 months & have another PSA test along with a free PSA test. Let's say my next PSA is normal (~1.5). I would then feel pretty good about NOT having a biopsy. BUT, there are those who say I better get a biopsy because my PSA did peak once! Also, it is known that cancer can be present even with a PSA score below 2. All this PSA/biopsy info. seems to make little sense to me. Any comments would be appreciated & good luck to all who are going through this harrowing experience.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. Interestingly enough, I left out one bit of info. which could be the explanation for my increased PSA AND in line with the hypothesis of NON-BACTERIAL PROSTATITIS. For a period of about 2 weeks and right about the time that my blood was taken for the PSA test, I occasionally had the \"immediate\" urge to urinate. I had never experienced urges like that before. These urges disappeared after 2 weeks. I did tell the urologist about this. He offered to treat with antibiotics but I refused since I had no indication of an infection. He still wanted to do a biopsy. In any case, as I already explained, I refused the biopsy and my subsequent PSA (6 weeks later) was back to 1.4. I am now guessing that as you all pointed out, I did indeed have Prostatitis of unknown origin. We will see what my PSA is in 3 months. Thanks again for the input.",
