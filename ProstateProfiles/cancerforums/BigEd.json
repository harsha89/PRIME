    "Content": "A litlle over 2 years ago I found out I had Prostrate Cancer and needed it removed. Today I found out my last test which I took last week was 0.28. It's been going up a little at a time since the removal. My Dr. says if it reaches 0.3 I need to start radiation treatments. Is this what everybody goes through? Should I be concern about the 0.28?",
