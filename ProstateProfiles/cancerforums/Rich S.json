      "Content": "So was having a bit of a problem with urination, burning, weak flow, up every hour or so at night. At 56 I figured it was just part of getting older and was looking at a swollen prostate and perhaps a urinary tract infection. Doc says no problem, you have kidney stones. drink lots of water and things will be cool. Two weeks later and no improvement so back to the same practice, different doctor who rushes me off for lab work..... PSA = 180.8 The dreaded finger showed a hard lumpy prostate that really had no feeling when poked and prodded which seemed to really concern the urologist so it was immediately off for a needle biopsy. Not a pleasant process to have 16 holes punched in that part of the world but much to my surprise I did make it through. The Doc was somewhat vague in his answers (or more likely I was too rattled to listen) so I bring these questions to this forum for a answer from those that know firsthand. (1) My biopsy was yesterday morning, how long should I expect the blood in the urine to continue? It is not a huge amount but it is quite disturbing to see.... (2)I am somewhat concerned about \"doing # 2\" in light of all the punctures that were made during the biopsy, do I need to be? Thanks in advance... Oh and real irony...... I retire in four weeks, sometimes life really sucks",

After that it goes to 80-20 at $500.00 a month, still a bargain when one considers what the cost WILL be. The hardest thing for my wife and I to deal with in all this is not the illness but how fast things can change, the emotional roller coaster is exhausting.",

      "Content": "So was having a bit of a problem with urination, burning, weak flow, up every hour or so at night. At 56 I figured it was just part of getting older and was looking at a swollen prostate and perhaps a urinary tract infection. Doc says no problem, you have kidney stones. drink lots of water and things will be cool. Two weeks later and no improvement so back to the same practice, different doctor who rushes me off for lab work..... PSA = 180.8 The dreaded finger showed a hard lumpy prostate that really had no feeling when poked and prodded which seemed to really concern the urologist so it was immediately off for a needle biopsy. Not a pleasant process to have 16 holes punched in that part of the world but much to my surprise I did make it through. The Doc was somewhat vague in his answers (or more likely I was too rattled to listen) so I bring these questions to this forum for a answer from those that know firsthand. (1) My biopsy was yesterday morning, how long should I expect the blood in the urine to continue? It is not a huge amount but it is quite disturbing to see.... (2)I am somewhat concerned about \"doing # 2\" in light of all the punctures that were made during the biopsy, do I need to be? Thanks in advance... Oh and real irony...... I retire in four weeks, sometimes life really sucks",

      "Content": "So was having a bit of a problem with urination, burning, weak flow, up every hour or so at night. At 56 I figured it was just part of getting older and was looking at a swollen prostate and perhaps a urinary tract infection. Doc says no problem, you have kidney stones. drink lots of water and things will be cool. Two weeks later and no improvement so back to the same practice, different doctor who rushes me off for lab work..... PSA = 180.8 The dreaded finger showed a hard lumpy prostate that really had no feeling when poked and prodded which seemed to really concern the urologist so it was immediately off for a needle biopsy. Not a pleasant process to have 16 holes punched in that part of the world but much to my surprise I did make it through. The Doc was somewhat vague in his answers (or more likely I was too rattled to listen) so I bring these questions to this forum for a answer from those that know firsthand. (1) My biopsy was yesterday morning, how long should I expect the blood in the urine to continue? It is not a huge amount but it is quite disturbing to see.... (2)I am somewhat concerned about \"doing # 2\" in light of all the punctures that were made during the biopsy, do I need to be? Thanks in advance... Oh and real irony...... I retire in four weeks, sometimes life really sucks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace I think you should just be happy. Don't think Firmagon can cause a flare like Lupron does. Many patients do not get hot flashes. Anyway, hope it brings your PSA down for a long time. Yes there is no flare with Firmagon and they claim 99% reach the castration level by day 7 as compared to approx 28 days for lupron (from drugs.com). I get another PSA test the 17th of this month and then the 2nd injection on the 19th. My pre injection baseline was 192.1 so I am hoping for a large drop, we shall see.",

We were just wondering how long on average before it stops working. He is also taking lots of pain medication. There really is no way to tell how long it will last for each individual. There is no reason he should be in pain!! He needs to sit down with his oncologist and discuss pain management through whatever drug is needed, let me be blunt, at his stage (and mine) addiction is not an issue. I live pretty much a pain free life because I communicate and my doctor listens and together we came up with a mix that works great. One thing I did find is I need more sleep, a lot more. I went from 6 to 12 hours a night and I get up refreshed and ready to go. Things change..... go with the flow and life will get a lot better.",

      "Content": "First a little background, diagnosed one year ago at 56, PSA 190, gleason 5+4, bone mets in spine, pelvis and shoulder. Only symptom was painful urination. Firmagon took PSA to 9 where it stalled, the addition of casodex took it to 4 where it remained for a month before heading back up. Stopped casodex and started zytiga and prednisone only to have the PSA jump to 24, now on xtandi and one month stopped the climb and dropped to 23. So the question, I have noticed a slight amount of blood in my urine on occasion, tests show no infection and my oncologist seems not to be concerned. Should I be or is this part of the \"normal\" progression of the cancer?",
