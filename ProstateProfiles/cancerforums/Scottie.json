    "Content": "Hi All, 2/11 biopsy 1 core, Gleason 8 7/11 Surgery. Neg margins; Gleason downgraded to 7 10/11 psa 0.01 \"Praise God\" 2/11 psa rise to .4 \u0093Oh No\u0094 4/11 36 treatments of radiation 7/11 psa rose to .7 10/11 psa rose to 1.6 I am very scared. Seems aggressive to me. Also have some pain in pelvic area. Uros say psa too low for bone involvement and think it's arthritis. Want to know what to expect from this point. I have two uros. One from VA another from private hospital. One wants to start HT now, the other wants to wait another 90 days. I have two questions. 1. Does this quick rise mean the end is near? 2. Which uro plain do you suggest? Sincerely, scared",
