      "Content": "Hello everyone, I am in a very bad situation and I think that most of the forum members were in my situation. After some mild issues over years when urinating ( burning pain, weaker flow) some mild ED, lack of libido, back pain and sometimes pain in the crotch area I decided to see my GP. After examining my prostate referred me to the urologist. I am 40 years old. My PSA is 0.2. So, after an DRE (which doctor said he feels \"some irregularities in the right lobe\") he decided that I have an MRI. When the MRI came I was called in and explained that the prostate looks inflamed and there are \"some modifications in some cells\" and he doesn't know what to say. The modifications that he sees might be from a bacterial prostatitis that I had about 10 years ago he explained...but could be something else he added... He said that they discussed my case in doctors'meeting and they don't have a conclusion. So they left it to my decision: 1.Either do the biopsy now ( Although my PSA is only 0.2 but DRE suspicious) 2.Wait another six month to have another MRI and see if there are any modifications. I read for three days a lot of studies and forum problems and I am still not decided about how am I going to deal with that. When I decide to go for the biopsy and few minutes later I decide to wait another six months.... I really need some opinions on what do you think. Thank you in advance",
