No associated extracapsular extension. This is a Pl-RADS 4 finding. TRANSITIONAL ZONE: No focal abnormalities.

      "Content": "I was just reading on another thread about physical and sexual activity affecting PSA levels. I didn't want to hijack his thread so I thought I would start a new one. Im going in for my first PSA and MRI this month after my biopsy and diagnosis last July. Im am currently doing the AS route and would like to make sure my PSA numbers are accurate. What are activities that can raise PSA readings that I should avoid? I am a pretty active person and run several times a week and am getting into riding my bike more often since I can do that on the trainer in the basement when the weather is crap outside. The pathetic part of my life as I get older is that I would be more OK with missing sexual activity for a couple days before a PSA test than I would be with missing a run day.",

While I think that its trying to convey that AS is a viable option for early cancer, I tend to pick out the negatives from the articles just as Michael has in the previous post. I think the hardest part is trying to be patient, which isn't one of my strong points. It doesn't help when you are telling people about your prostate cancer who aren't familiar with treatment options and you tell them that you are just going to keep and eye on things for a year or two and they look at you like your f-ing nuts.",

      "Content": "So, first post here and I'm more than a little overwhelmed. I'm 47 and was just diagnosed with PC yesterday. My PSA's have been relatively low, my last one a few weeks ago was 3.1 which is actually lower than the 3.4 I had 2 years ago. My Dr discovered a nodule during a DPE and referred me to a urologist who did a biopsy last week. I didnt do enough research ahead of time so I don't know and diddn't know to ask the gleason score numbers or any of that. He basically said that everything was contained in the prostate and that if I was in my 70's he probably wouldn't do anything, but since Im in my 40's we need to figure out a plan. I go back and see him to discuss things on August 12. My father and 2 uncles all had PC and were treated with surgery and all have survived. I guess Im not sure why I posted just yet other than to jump in and join the goup. I'm sure I'm going to have many questions in the coming weeks and months. None of the treatment plans sound particularly pleasant so some experienced advice will be very helpful. Thanks for listening",

      "Content": "So, first post here and I'm more than a little overwhelmed. I'm 47 and was just diagnosed with PC yesterday. My PSA's have been relatively low, my last one a few weeks ago was 3.1 which is actually lower than the 3.4 I had 2 years ago. My Dr discovered a nodule during a DPE and referred me to a urologist who did a biopsy last week. I didnt do enough research ahead of time so I don't know and diddn't know to ask the gleason score numbers or any of that. He basically said that everything was contained in the prostate and that if I was in my 70's he probably wouldn't do anything, but since Im in my 40's we need to figure out a plan. I go back and see him to discuss things on August 12. My father and 2 uncles all had PC and were treated with surgery and all have survived. I guess Im not sure why I posted just yet other than to jump in and join the goup. I'm sure I'm going to have many questions in the coming weeks and months. None of the treatment plans sound particularly pleasant so some experienced advice will be very helpful. Thanks for listening",

Im very active and love to run, cycle an golf weekly and have enjoyed being fit. I ran my first marathon in June and would love to be able to do another one. For any runners/athletes out there that have had surgery, how long did it take afterwards to get back in the groove of things and were you able to get back to where you were before surgery? Its a double edged sword knowing that I would be able to handle surgery well being in good shape, but knowing that if I do go in the surgery will set me back a long ways and I might never be the same in some aspects.",
