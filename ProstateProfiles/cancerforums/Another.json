      "Content": "Acceptance is our access to peace. Accept that you are now in a campaign to deal with cancer or the possibility of cancer that will be with you the rest of your life. You're in very good company. Regarding the current waiting, you can always thank the doctor for his plan and ask for a biopsy now. I suspect he has to have at least one PSA test in his file to confirm your records and remove the criticism that he rushed to biopsy without one last hope it will mysteriously drop. You have put a lot of emphasis on bike riding so he now must protect himself from your bias towards it even though the idea is fast fading for you as you confront the reality of your situation. Practices have their protocols. They will abide them. When I had my two year post op appointment this morning with my surgeon I discussed this forum and the number of men seemingly unprepared for the risk of prostate cancer. He said only 17% of general practices screen for prostate cancer. He is as busy as the day is long. Become an advocate, but not a zealot. Hang around here. It helps. Begin with forgiving yourself. There is no fault here. You have to be somewhere. This is where you are.",

      "Content": "This is a situation for a skilled practitioner. If you press he will mostly likely increase his resolve. For now, don't discuss it with him. Speak only when spoken to on the topic. Your persistence at this time may only build more resistance. The manner of his dismissal of his doctor's concern in the face of obvious test results is troubling. He may also not be honest about other symptoms. If distrusting of others is a pattern he will use it towards himself as well, even more so. This goes well beyond a couple of initial tests beginning to head in the wrong direction and ignoring heart to heart conversations he's most certainly had with his doctor and you. Seek counseling for yourself for how to deal with this. Much like being in a relationship with alcoholism or dementia you will need help dealing with his mental state. It is more than denial or fear. It may be depression or a more complicated emotional state. He is showing an acute lack of care for himself. His behavior is not normal. His brother may have suffered from the same condition judging from the outcome. Look to caring for yourself first. I'm sorry this is happening to you. This is similar to the oxygen mask dropping out of the bulkhead of the airplane. Put your mask on first, meaning take care of your self first and gather information and support for dealing with him and your emotions. There is no magic bullet for this. Only work to be done. Even if you conjole, manipulate, or bully him into action he may hold you responsible for the outcome as he chooses to see it, fairly or not. Your first order of business with a counselor is to deal with your anger and frustration with his behavior and separate yourself from his emotional and irrational mental state. You don't want to go down this rabbit hole with him.",

      "Content": "So, do you have pain, discomfort, fever, chills, or any symptom associated with prostatitis? No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. Leukocytes are common in the urine for many reasons and concerns rely on the count. What was it? Simply drinking more water can help flush them out. Be careful, drinking too much water can also irritate the urinary system as can some foods and supplements. No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. I consider mention of antibiotics in the article is a remnant of a soon to end practise. Some doctors are loathed to inform their patients that biopsy and MRI tests regularly generate false negatives. I have not heard of any insurance company requiring an antibiotic be used prior to approving additional biopsy or MRI. A round of antibiotics use to be considered prudent and thorough. An old school low cost way of ruling out infection for physical discomfort symptoms. Now as we squander away the invaluable resource of antibiotics with this ineffective overuse we also corrupt the science of diagnostic medicine with myth. Use of antibiotics as an anti inflammatory is not good health policy, imo.",

      "Content": "Good news! What's your PSA testing schedule going forward? Just checking, no activities in the last 6 months to manipulate your PSA; i.e. prostate health supplements, vitamins, diet, BHP medication, antibiotics, etc? Did you restrict your activities, including the swimming, before the latest test? Going back did your urologist perform your DRE immediately before the PSA test of 4.7? This stimulation can spike a PSA number. Looking for an explaination of the PSA disparity. Is the nodule in the DRE still there? How are your urinary symptoms after another 6 months? The reason I mention this is to caution manipulating your PSA will have no impact on the cancer. Without a PSA history it's difficult to know which number is the norm or if they both are. Having a brother with PC puts you in a 1 in 4 risk of cancer. An abnormal DRE bumps that higher, as do urinary symptoms, as does a steady rising PSA, etc. Keep an eye on it until you have the history to rule out cancer.",

      "Content": "Acceptance is our access to peace. Accept that you are now in a campaign to deal with cancer or the possibility of cancer that will be with you the rest of your life. You're in very good company. Regarding the current waiting, you can always thank the doctor for his plan and ask for a biopsy now. I suspect he has to have at least one PSA test in his file to confirm your records and remove the criticism that he rushed to biopsy without one last hope it will mysteriously drop. You have put a lot of emphasis on bike riding so he now must protect himself from your bias towards it even though the idea is fast fading for you as you confront the reality of your situation. Practices have their protocols. They will abide them. When I had my two year post op appointment this morning with my surgeon I discussed this forum and the number of men seemingly unprepared for the risk of prostate cancer. He said only 17% of general practices screen for prostate cancer. He is as busy as the day is long. Become an advocate, but not a zealot. Hang around here. It helps. Begin with forgiving yourself. There is no fault here. You have to be somewhere. This is where you are.",

      "Content": "So, do you have pain, discomfort, fever, chills, or any symptom associated with prostatitis? No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. Leukocytes are common in the urine for many reasons and concerns rely on the count. What was it? Simply drinking more water can help flush them out. Be careful, drinking too much water can also irritate the urinary system as can some foods and supplements. No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. I consider mention of antibiotics in the article is a remnant of a soon to end practise. Some doctors are loathed to inform their patients that biopsy and MRI tests regularly generate false negatives. I have not heard of any insurance company requiring an antibiotic be used prior to approving additional biopsy or MRI. A round of antibiotics use to be considered prudent and thorough. An old school low cost way of ruling out infection for physical discomfort symptoms. Now as we squander away the invaluable resource of antibiotics with this ineffective overuse we also corrupt the science of diagnostic medicine with myth. Use of antibiotics as an anti inflammatory is not good health policy, imo.",

      "Content": "This is a situation for a skilled practitioner. If you press he will mostly likely increase his resolve. For now, don't discuss it with him. Speak only when spoken to on the topic. Your persistence at this time may only build more resistance. The manner of his dismissal of his doctor's concern in the face of obvious test results is troubling. He may also not be honest about other symptoms. If distrusting of others is a pattern he will use it towards himself as well, even more so. This goes well beyond a couple of initial tests beginning to head in the wrong direction and ignoring heart to heart conversations he's most certainly had with his doctor and you. Seek counseling for yourself for how to deal with this. Much like being in a relationship with alcoholism or dementia you will need help dealing with his mental state. It is more than denial or fear. It may be depression or a more complicated emotional state. He is showing an acute lack of care for himself. His behavior is not normal. His brother may have suffered from the same condition judging from the outcome. Look to caring for yourself first. I'm sorry this is happening to you. This is similar to the oxygen mask dropping out of the bulkhead of the airplane. Put your mask on first, meaning take care of your self first and gather information and support for dealing with him and your emotions. There is no magic bullet for this. Only work to be done. Even if you conjole, manipulate, or bully him into action he may hold you responsible for the outcome as he chooses to see it, fairly or not. Your first order of business with a counselor is to deal with your anger and frustration with his behavior and separate yourself from his emotional and irrational mental state. You don't want to go down this rabbit hole with him.",

The skill of the surgeon is critical, but size and the extent of the cancer is primary. Also, an enlarged prostate exerts pressure on these nerves and if large enough and for long enough the damage can be permanent regardless of surgery. A prostatectomy can not restore sexual function to already damaged nerves. Same for incontinence already established prior to surgery. I was already experiencing the beginnings of incontinence before surgery with frequency and dribbles. They persist. Fear of surgery side effects is misdirected. They are an inevitable result of the enlargement of the prostate from either BHP and/or cancer. When is a matter of time. Over treatment is the concern. I chose safe over sorry, and still, in hindsight waited too long. What is often ignored is the prostate is a major erogenous zone, similar to the female G spot, stimulated during erection and adding to the intensity and pleasure of the orgasm. This is the true sexual loss with cancer, imo.",

Or you experiencing any symptoms with a normal size prostate? For me and I'm not a doctor, you already know more than what you will find out from the drug therapy. You have cancer and via your PSA history it is progressing. The problem is you can't find a cancer via biopsy that matches the rest of your profile. It may be past time to move on to other methods; a different cancer team, second opinions on biopsy samples, second opinions on MRI scans. Change something. The drug suggestion seems like your doctor is running out of options. Even if it does what it's suppose to do it doesn't get you a biopsy sample. It just puts you in a bigger \"maybe\" debate.

      "Content": "My concern has always been it's affect on PSA when true values are critical, such as testing for BCR. A surgeon may have less investment in that question than the RO/MO. Let's assume for the moment it does have a real effect. Does it kill all cancer cells or some? Does it postpone the diagnosis of BCR to the detrimental effect of conventional treatments? Most of these tests are measuring PSA, not the cancer. My investment is in the conventional path and it's statistics. While a supplement may have some beneficial effect, what is the effect and how does it impact current treatment thresholds and clinically tested outcomes? Doing some good isn't enough, imo. If you waiting for .2 or .3 for intervention of BCR it \"may\" do no harm. The difference may be insignificant at those levels. I want to know much sooner than that. The doctor's response is telling. He answers your question with a question. He doesn't know, and the difference it makes will be too small to matter, he assumes, so why not? I ask, so why? Here's another view. Do I want to slow it's recurrence and thereby it's treatment, or, do I want it to manifest itself as soon as possible to gain treatment as soon as possible? Like antibiotics, if I don't hit first and fast with a lethal combination what advantage do I give it by tinkering at it's edges? Maybe none, but I don't know. So what harm can it do? I don't know. That's a strategy for desperation, recklessness, or nonchalance, imo. The doctor answered your question with a question he doesn't have the answer to. This isn't a right or wrong debate. It's more of the emotional component that exists between the medical and patient communities. What can I do when I don't know what to do? Waiting doesn't scratch that itch.",

      "Content": "Extreme sedentary life style and poor healthcare leads to slower metabolism, symptoms, and delayed detection or none at all. Couple obesity with less education and more poverty. A companion study would be the impact of obesity on the available study population in general. What are the statistics in general for obese men and early detection and treatment? Is obesity a sign of poor healthcare? Generally, it is. The study may be drawing from a very small subset of obese men who have had RP, who are diligent and proactive about their healthcare and treatment and may skew the population by practising a higher level of healthcare than the general population, i.e. early detection and treatment. In other words, the obese men who have had RP are a very small subset of the obese population being more successful with their healthcare than the general population. Multiply the difference by fit men who are prone to be slow to accept healthcare issues; i.e. I'm fit, exercise, and eat right, I don't have prostate cancer or I'll treat it with my lifestyle leading to late detection and delayed treatment.",

      "Content": "My concern has always been it's affect on PSA when true values are critical, such as testing for BCR. A surgeon may have less investment in that question than the RO/MO. Let's assume for the moment it does have a real effect. Does it kill all cancer cells or some? Does it postpone the diagnosis of BCR to the detrimental effect of conventional treatments? Most of these tests are measuring PSA, not the cancer. My investment is in the conventional path and it's statistics. While a supplement may have some beneficial effect, what is the effect and how does it impact current treatment thresholds and clinically tested outcomes? Doing some good isn't enough, imo. If you waiting for .2 or .3 for intervention of BCR it \"may\" do no harm. The difference may be insignificant at those levels. I want to know much sooner than that. The doctor's response is telling. He answers your question with a question. He doesn't know, and the difference it makes will be too small to matter, he assumes, so why not? I ask, so why? Here's another view. Do I want to slow it's recurrence and thereby it's treatment, or, do I want it to manifest itself as soon as possible to gain treatment as soon as possible? Like antibiotics, if I don't hit first and fast with a lethal combination what advantage do I give it by tinkering at it's edges? Maybe none, but I don't know. So what harm can it do? I don't know. That's a strategy for desperation, recklessness, or nonchalance, imo. The doctor answered your question with a question he doesn't have the answer to. This isn't a right or wrong debate. It's more of the emotional component that exists between the medical and patient communities. What can I do when I don't know what to do? Waiting doesn't scratch that itch.",

      "Content": "There you go. All good advice that concurs with your doctor. Regarding MRI, here is a recent article. Is MRI the 'Mammography' of Prostate Cancer Screening? http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/h...d57f1cd1a.html Almost all doctor/health system/insurance's protocol is for TRUS biopsy first. In general, TRUS biopsy has a 30% or higher false negative. In the case of younger men with higher PSAs (you) and smaller prostates it is lower. If you have a negative biopsy and a high PSA you can then make an argument to your insurer for an MRI. A guided MRI biopsy, if the MRI shows significant cancer, is still not available everywhere, but can be sought out. All this is further down the line for you IF your TRUS biopsy is negative. Statistically, the odds are the TRUS biopsy will find your cancer if it is there. But again, if not, you are not out of the woods. At your age and PSA it will be easier to prove you have cancer than to prove you do not. At this time, a biopsy tissue sample is the only way to prove cancer and it's grade. This disease is a sneaky bastard if you take your eyes off it. This is a bitter pill to swallow. My suggestion is you give yourself time to accept it, but do not dwell there too long, and do not use it to hesitate moving forward in your diagnoses.",

The ulcer manifested itself with minor side and lower back pain waking me with more acute pain at 3-4am. I had a fine balance between aspirin therapy, 40 mg/daily and alcohol, and it got out of balance. I'm suspicious of the Cialis and Viagra as well in combination with the others. I've stopped all for the last three months. I quit coffee and switched to one cup of green tea a day. I had also added V8 into my diet and have discovered my body does not like it, too much acid. As I age my sensitivity to all things increases and my tolerance for abusing my body decreases. Keeping the balance requires more intention than when I was younger.",

      "Content": "Just logged on to my health account and saw this report and thought others might want to see what one looks like. It was taken after my TRUS biopsy and before my surgery. The surgeon requested it and I believe I was told to map the area for his surgery. The TRUS biopsy provided enough information to choose to proceed with the DaVinci RP. This was for his information to see what he was going after. He never shared the results nor said it was available for viewing. (I never asked. My bad.) I found it after another unrelated procedure, EKG for heart palpitations that have since resolved themselves. That's another story that is a related complication from the stress of prostate cancer and treatment this past year. Point being, if you have any other weaknesses in your health this experience may bring them to the surface. End outcome, my heart is fine and ulcer is about healed up. The main contributor to the ulcer and subsequent palpitations was too much alcohol, Viagra, Cialis, and aspirin therapy. Ulcers can stimulate the Vagus nerve messing up the heart signals. I'm a little frustrated because my hospital and doctors are part of the same health system yet each has it's own online patient portal. So now I have to track two sites. Three, if you count Quest Diagnostics. Having said that, having online access to my medical records is a wonderful thing! MRI prostate, with and without contrast Indication for examination: Prostate cancer, elevated PSA Precontrast T1, T2 and diffusion-weighted images of the prostate gland are obtained. Sequential dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images are obtained. 20 cc gadolinium contrast were used. Prostate gland has a calculated volume of 69 cc. Examination of the peripheral zone reveals areas of restricted diffusion and abnormal T2 signal intensity within the left posterior aspect of the peripheral zone extending from the apex to the base. Similar-appearing areas of restricted diffusion and abnormal signal intensity are identified within the right posterior and posterior lateral peripheral zone at the apex, extending to the level of the mid gland. These areas appear somewhat hyperemic following gadolinium administration. Findings are considered suspicious for multifocal neoplastic process in the peripheral zone for which followup is required. Examination of the transitional zone reveals an ill-defined area of confluence low T2 signal intensity in the right anterior medial transitional zone at the level of the mid gland. This shows restricted diffusion and appears hyperemic. This is likewise considered suspicious and directed biopsy of this area should be considered. No other suspicious abnormality identified in the transitional zone. There are no abnormally enlarged or suspicious appearing pelvic lymph nodes. Visualized bony structures show normal marrow signal intensity. Seminal vesicles appear symmetric. Conclusion: Findings suspicious for multifocal neoplastic process within the peripheral zone bilaterally as described. Abnormal signal intensity right anterior medial transitional zone at the level of the mid gland. This is considered suspicious for a possible neoplastic process within the transitional zone as described. PIRADS 5 Component Results There is no component information for this result.

      "Content": "Feelings and emotions are not to be trusted. All the information you mention is valuable; listening, informing, accessibility, experience with your specific condition, and the same and even more so for their team. Anything more than 6 or 7 variables and we lose track of the comparison matrix so the temptation is to give up and rely on a feeling. Don't. Take notes and make a list. Drill down past the feeling. You have a brain, energy, and skin in the game. Use it. There are warning flags, and they will generate feelings like; I like this one, I don't like this one. Dismiss the feeling and back up to the warning flag; they talk too much, they talk too fast, they are arrogant and offended by questions, they don't like this or that but will do it if you want, etc. I did not like my surgeon, and I was clear in that. He made some social faux pas, but I was clear he was an excellent surgeon, on top of his game, and committed to success and his skill. He was my junk yard dog. People are good at somethings and not good at others. The challenge is to be clear in it. Intangibles are what you don't know, not what is too much work to track. In the end a choice is just that, a choice. It's not a right or wrong. It is thoughtful considered and made. A feeling is a temptation driven by your mind wanting to avoid the work and responsibility. It usually is a warning flag of some unresolved story you have about yourself. Something you don't want to take on. Relying on intuition is an avoidance technuque. Flight or fight is an example of this. On a dark street late at night with no time and few options this works. Not here, and not in long term commitments. Now for your partner, love is not a feeling. It is a commitment and responsibility to what works best for those in love. What it will generate is an experience; joy, sadness, pain, suffering, laughter, peace, satisfaction. It is the integrity and the work to the commitment that is to be trusted, not the experience of it. The experience is the outcome and you accept it in faith and peace because you've done the work.",

My ancedotal experience may lead me to think the longer it grows the greater the chance it will develop into something more. It is cancer. The salieint point is the diagnostics we have are not 100%. Nor are the treatments. There is another recent post about a delayed recurrence of many years with a RP pathology report that indicates such a recurrence is highly unlikely. However pathology reports are not 100%. They do not section the entire prostate. The time it takes is not statistically warranted. Instead they use a method that is highly effective, but not 100%. I don't recall the actual percentage, but it is significant. Cancer can and does go undetected throught out the process. Regarding the other poster, the bright spot is the pathology examination procedures for margins in the process is highly effective, 97-99%. The dark spot is it leaves 1 - 3 percent of men who get a report of no cancer at or beyond the margin with cancer at or beyond the margin. Nobody wants to be those 1 - 3 guys in a hundred yet one stands among us today, probably. There is not right or wrong here. It's a choice and one made with statistics.",

You're in very good company. Regarding the current waiting, you can always thank the doctor for his plan and ask for a biopsy now. I suspect he has to have at least one PSA test in his file to confirm your records and remove the criticism that he rushed to biopsy without one last hope it will mysteriously drop. You have put a lot of emphasis on bike riding so he now must protect himself from your bias towards it even though the idea is fast fading for you as you confront the reality of your situation. Practices have their protocols. They will abide them. When I had my two year post op appointment this morning with my surgeon I discussed this forum and the number of men seemingly unprepared for the risk of prostate cancer. He said only 17% of general practices screen for prostate cancer. He is as busy as the day is long. Become an advocate, but not a zealot. Hang around here. It helps. Begin with forgiving yourself. There is no fault here. You have to be somewhere. This is where you are.",

      "Content": "Acceptance is our access to peace. Accept that you are now in a campaign to deal with cancer or the possibility of cancer that will be with you the rest of your life. You're in very good company. Regarding the current waiting, you can always thank the doctor for his plan and ask for a biopsy now. I suspect he has to have at least one PSA test in his file to confirm your records and remove the criticism that he rushed to biopsy without one last hope it will mysteriously drop. You have put a lot of emphasis on bike riding so he now must protect himself from your bias towards it even though the idea is fast fading for you as you confront the reality of your situation. Practices have their protocols. They will abide them. When I had my two year post op appointment this morning with my surgeon I discussed this forum and the number of men seemingly unprepared for the risk of prostate cancer. He said only 17% of general practices screen for prostate cancer. He is as busy as the day is long. Become an advocate, but not a zealot. Hang around here. It helps. Begin with forgiving yourself. There is no fault here. You have to be somewhere. This is where you are.",

My ancedotal experience may lead me to think the longer it grows the greater the chance it will develop into something more. It is cancer. The salieint point is the diagnostics we have are not 100%. Nor are the treatments. There is another recent post about a delayed recurrence of many years with a RP pathology report that indicates such a recurrence is highly unlikely. However pathology reports are not 100%. They do not section the entire prostate. The time it takes is not statistically warranted. Instead they use a method that is highly effective, but not 100%. I don't recall the actual percentage, but it is significant. Cancer can and does go undetected throught out the process. Regarding the other poster, the bright spot is the pathology examination procedures for margins in the process is highly effective, 97-99%. The dark spot is it leaves 1 - 3 percent of men who get a report of no cancer at or beyond the margin with cancer at or beyond the margin. Nobody wants to be those 1 - 3 guys in a hundred yet one stands among us today, probably. There is not right or wrong here. It's a choice and one made with statistics.",

True, yet if the only sign is an elevated PSA what is there to treat? A symptomless case of prostatitis has no consequence.",

This stimulation can spike a PSA number. Looking for an explaination of the PSA disparity. Is the nodule in the DRE still there? How are your urinary symptoms after another 6 months? The reason I mention this is to caution manipulating your PSA will have no impact on the cancer. Without a PSA history it's difficult to know which number is the norm or if they both are. Having a brother with PC puts you in a 1 in 4 risk of cancer. An abnormal DRE bumps that higher, as do urinary symptoms, as does a steady rising PSA, etc. Keep an eye on it until you have the history to rule out cancer.",

      "Content": "This is a situation for a skilled practitioner. If you press he will mostly likely increase his resolve. For now, don't discuss it with him. Speak only when spoken to on the topic. Your persistence at this time may only build more resistance. The manner of his dismissal of his doctor's concern in the face of obvious test results is troubling. He may also not be honest about other symptoms. If distrusting of others is a pattern he will use it towards himself as well, even more so. This goes well beyond a couple of initial tests beginning to head in the wrong direction and ignoring heart to heart conversations he's most certainly had with his doctor and you. Seek counseling for yourself for how to deal with this. Much like being in a relationship with alcoholism or dementia you will need help dealing with his mental state. It is more than denial or fear. It may be depression or a more complicated emotional state. He is showing an acute lack of care for himself. His behavior is not normal. His brother may have suffered from the same condition judging from the outcome. Look to caring for yourself first. I'm sorry this is happening to you. This is similar to the oxygen mask dropping out of the bulkhead of the airplane. Put your mask on first, meaning take care of your self first and gather information and support for dealing with him and your emotions. There is no magic bullet for this. Only work to be done. Even if you conjole, manipulate, or bully him into action he may hold you responsible for the outcome as he chooses to see it, fairly or not. Your first order of business with a counselor is to deal with your anger and frustration with his behavior and separate yourself from his emotional and irrational mental state. You don't want to go down this rabbit hole with him.",

Leukocytes are common in the urine for many reasons and concerns rely on the count. What was it? Simply drinking more water can help flush them out. Be careful, drinking too much water can also irritate the urinary system as can some foods and supplements. No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. I consider mention of antibiotics in the article is a remnant of a soon to end practise. Some doctors are loathed to inform their patients that biopsy and MRI tests regularly generate false negatives. I have not heard of any insurance company requiring an antibiotic be used prior to approving additional biopsy or MRI. A round of antibiotics use to be considered prudent and thorough. An old school low cost way of ruling out infection for physical discomfort symptoms. Now as we squander away the invaluable resource of antibiotics with this ineffective overuse we also corrupt the science of diagnostic medicine with myth. Use of antibiotics as an anti inflammatory is not good health policy, imo.",

The skill of the surgeon is critical, but size and the extent of the cancer is primary. Also, an enlarged prostate exerts pressure on these nerves and if large enough and for long enough the damage can be permanent regardless of surgery. A prostatectomy can not restore sexual function to already damaged nerves. Same for incontinence already established prior to surgery. I was already experiencing the beginnings of incontinence before surgery with frequency and dribbles. They persist. Fear of surgery side effects is misdirected. They are an inevitable result of the enlargement of the prostate from either BHP and/or cancer. When is a matter of time. Over treatment is the concern. I chose safe over sorry, and still, in hindsight waited too long. What is often ignored is the prostate is a major erogenous zone, similar to the female G spot, stimulated during erection and adding to the intensity and pleasure of the orgasm. This is the true sexual loss with cancer, imo.",

Cipro also has some nasty potential side effects, and can set you up for future antibiotic resistance and biopsy complications. I'm not a fan. Studies have shown any drop in PSA from their use is no more frequent or larger than the control group. The risk is you may get a slight bump down, and give him cause to put off another PSA test for 6 months. You are young for such high numbers, and they do not seem to be erratic. Retesting in July is a good idea. Then it may be time for another MRI (maybe another doctor or a cancer center). MRI's are fallible as an emerging technology, and there is a learning curve in their use for detecting prostate cancer. Being concerned is a healthy and wise reaction. You have a serious potential indicator that is not resolving. I also hear a hint of frustration with your doctor. Don't ignore it.

You have cancer and via your PSA history it is progressing. The problem is you can't find a cancer via biopsy that matches the rest of your profile. It may be past time to move on to other methods; a different cancer team, second opinions on biopsy samples, second opinions on MRI scans. Change something.

      "Content": "It is my understanding the incidents of prostate cancer are increasing and are presenting at earliar ages. This story is not finished, and it's a story of public policy. In that context, basing our future on old data is continuing the same flawed thinking that only 1 in 1,000 benefit. The premise is we can't handle the truth of screening and risk responsibly. Maybe so, but do we stop creating a defense to this disease? Most men (80%) will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. Most men in this country will not live to 80. The life expectancy in this country is dropping as the disparity between access to quality education and wealth grows. Screening benefits the class in this country who have an increasing life expectancy. Sadly, these numbers reflect the shift of political fortune in this country. A shrinking middle class and a rapidly expanding lower class is creating a math that supports choicies in health care based on education and priviledge. Those with means and the education to have a responsible approach to choices will choose screening in support of their increasing life expectancy. Those who are in the growing lower class and decreasing life expectancy will benefit from less screening. This is the new America. This is the story.",

      "Content": "So, do you have pain, discomfort, fever, chills, or any symptom associated with prostatitis? No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. Leukocytes are common in the urine for many reasons and concerns rely on the count. What was it? Simply drinking more water can help flush them out. Be careful, drinking too much water can also irritate the urinary system as can some foods and supplements. No where in the Harvard article is PSA mentioned as an indicator of prostatitis. I consider mention of antibiotics in the article is a remnant of a soon to end practise. Some doctors are loathed to inform their patients that biopsy and MRI tests regularly generate false negatives. I have not heard of any insurance company requiring an antibiotic be used prior to approving additional biopsy or MRI. A round of antibiotics use to be considered prudent and thorough. An old school low cost way of ruling out infection for physical discomfort symptoms. Now as we squander away the invaluable resource of antibiotics with this ineffective overuse we also corrupt the science of diagnostic medicine with myth. Use of antibiotics as an anti inflammatory is not good health policy, imo.",

      "Content": "Often the prescription of antibiotics is used as a diagnostic tool, but it generally is bad medicine to use in these situations. I consider it a reflection on your urologist. Cipro also has some nasty potential side effects, and can set you up for future antibiotic resistance and biopsy complications. I'm not a fan. Studies have shown any drop in PSA from their use is no more frequent or larger than the control group. The risk is you may get a slight bump down, and give him cause to put off another PSA test for 6 months. You are young for such high numbers, and they do not seem to be erratic. Retesting in July is a good idea. Then it may be time for another MRI (maybe another doctor or a cancer center). MRI's are fallible as an emerging technology, and there is a learning curve in their use for detecting prostate cancer. Being concerned is a healthy and wise reaction. You have a serious potential indicator that is not resolving. I also hear a hint of frustration with your doctor. Don't ignore it. Some cancers can be hard to find and MRI's have their challenges as well. I would not hang my hat on one negative MRI, and your biopsy is almost 4 years old.",

      "Content": "Just logged on to my health account and saw this report and thought others might want to see what one looks like. It was taken after my TRUS biopsy and before my surgery. The surgeon requested it and I believe I was told to map the area for his surgery. The TRUS biopsy provided enough information to choose to proceed with the DaVinci RP. This was for his information to see what he was going after. He never shared the results nor said it was available for viewing. (I never asked. My bad.) I found it after another unrelated procedure, EKG for heart palpitations that have since resolved themselves. That's another story that is a related complication from the stress of prostate cancer and treatment this past year. Point being, if you have any other weaknesses in your health this experience may bring them to the surface. End outcome, my heart is fine and ulcer is about healed up. The main contributor to the ulcer and subsequent palpitations was too much alcohol, Viagra, Cialis, and aspirin therapy. Ulcers can stimulate the Vagus nerve messing up the heart signals. I'm a little frustrated because my hospital and doctors are part of the same health system yet each has it's own online patient portal. So now I have to track two sites. Three, if you count Quest Diagnostics. Having said that, having online access to my medical records is a wonderful thing! MRI prostate, with and without contrast Indication for examination: Prostate cancer, elevated PSA Precontrast T1, T2 and diffusion-weighted images of the prostate gland are obtained. Sequential dynamic contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images are obtained. 20 cc gadolinium contrast were used. Prostate gland has a calculated volume of 69 cc. Examination of the peripheral zone reveals areas of restricted diffusion and abnormal T2 signal intensity within the left posterior aspect of the peripheral zone extending from the apex to the base. Similar-appearing areas of restricted diffusion and abnormal signal intensity are identified within the right posterior and posterior lateral peripheral zone at the apex, extending to the level of the mid gland. These areas appear somewhat hyperemic following gadolinium administration. Findings are considered suspicious for multifocal neoplastic process in the peripheral zone for which followup is required. Examination of the transitional zone reveals an ill-defined area of confluence low T2 signal intensity in the right anterior medial transitional zone at the level of the mid gland. This shows restricted diffusion and appears hyperemic. This is likewise considered suspicious and directed biopsy of this area should be considered. No other suspicious abnormality identified in the transitional zone. There are no abnormally enlarged or suspicious appearing pelvic lymph nodes. Visualized bony structures show normal marrow signal intensity. Seminal vesicles appear symmetric. Conclusion: Findings suspicious for multifocal neoplastic process within the peripheral zone bilaterally as described. Abnormal signal intensity right anterior medial transitional zone at the level of the mid gland. This is considered suspicious for a possible neoplastic process within the transitional zone as described. PIRADS 5 Component Results There is no component information for this result.

      "Content": "This is a situation for a skilled practitioner. If you press he will mostly likely increase his resolve. For now, don't discuss it with him. Speak only when spoken to on the topic. Your persistence at this time may only build more resistance. The manner of his dismissal of his doctor's concern in the face of obvious test results is troubling. He may also not be honest about other symptoms. If distrusting of others is a pattern he will use it towards himself as well, even more so. This goes well beyond a couple of initial tests beginning to head in the wrong direction and ignoring heart to heart conversations he's most certainly had with his doctor and you. Seek counseling for yourself for how to deal with this. Much like being in a relationship with alcoholism or dementia you will need help dealing with his mental state. It is more than denial or fear. It may be depression or a more complicated emotional state. He is showing an acute lack of care for himself. His behavior is not normal. His brother may have suffered from the same condition judging from the outcome. Look to caring for yourself first. I'm sorry this is happening to you. This is similar to the oxygen mask dropping out of the bulkhead of the airplane. Put your mask on first, meaning take care of your self first and gather information and support for dealing with him and your emotions. There is no magic bullet for this. Only work to be done. Even if you conjole, manipulate, or bully him into action he may hold you responsible for the outcome as he chooses to see it, fairly or not. Your first order of business with a counselor is to deal with your anger and frustration with his behavior and separate yourself from his emotional and irrational mental state. You don't want to go down this rabbit hole with him.",

      "Content": "My concern has always been it's affect on PSA when true values are critical, such as testing for BCR. A surgeon may have less investment in that question than the RO/MO. Let's assume for the moment it does have a real effect. Does it kill all cancer cells or some? Does it postpone the diagnosis of BCR to the detrimental effect of conventional treatments? Most of these tests are measuring PSA, not the cancer. My investment is in the conventional path and it's statistics. While a supplement may have some beneficial effect, what is the effect and how does it impact current treatment thresholds and clinically tested outcomes? Doing some good isn't enough, imo. If you waiting for .2 or .3 for intervention of BCR it \"may\" do no harm. The difference may be insignificant at those levels. I want to know much sooner than that. The doctor's response is telling. He answers your question with a question. He doesn't know, and the difference it makes will be too small to matter, he assumes, so why not? I ask, so why? Here's another view. Do I want to slow it's recurrence and thereby it's treatment, or, do I want it to manifest itself as soon as possible to gain treatment as soon as possible? Like antibiotics, if I don't hit first and fast with a lethal combination what advantage do I give it by tinkering at it's edges? Maybe none, but I don't know. So what harm can it do? I don't know. That's a strategy for desperation, recklessness, or nonchalance, imo. The doctor answered your question with a question he doesn't have the answer to. This isn't a right or wrong debate. It's more of the emotional component that exists between the medical and patient communities. What can I do when I don't know what to do? Waiting doesn't scratch that itch.",

My question for the doctor regarding his reasoning around BCR PSA velocity is something I'd ask him for documentation to confirm. Never heard it before. I'd like to know more. I recommend you see the referral next and see if he concurs with another 3 month wait and test. Retesting, and waiting and retesting, are distinct. If you don't trust the number, retest immediately. If you're looking for 3 rises then wait and test, but it's a moot point since you hit .1. Now there is only to confirm it. Retest immediately to confirm the .1. See the referral immediately. If waiting is in order its his call. I see no reason to wait. It appears your margin is an issue. The earliar you give the RO your case the better the outcome.",

      "Content": "There you go. All good advice that concurs with your doctor. Regarding MRI, here is a recent article. Is MRI the 'Mammography' of Prostate Cancer Screening? http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/h...d57f1cd1a.html Almost all doctor/health system/insurance's protocol is for TRUS biopsy first. In general, TRUS biopsy has a 30% or higher false negative. In the case of younger men with higher PSAs (you) and smaller prostates it is lower. If you have a negative biopsy and a high PSA you can then make an argument to your insurer for an MRI. A guided MRI biopsy, if the MRI shows significant cancer, is still not available everywhere, but can be sought out. All this is further down the line for you IF your TRUS biopsy is negative. Statistically, the odds are the TRUS biopsy will find your cancer if it is there. But again, if not, you are not out of the woods. At your age and PSA it will be easier to prove you have cancer than to prove you do not. At this time, a biopsy tissue sample is the only way to prove cancer and it's grade. This disease is a sneaky bastard if you take your eyes off it. This is a bitter pill to swallow. My suggestion is you give yourself time to accept it, but do not dwell there too long, and do not use it to hesitate moving forward in your diagnoses.",

      "Content": "Feelings and emotions are not to be trusted. All the information you mention is valuable; listening, informing, accessibility, experience with your specific condition, and the same and even more so for their team. Anything more than 6 or 7 variables and we lose track of the comparison matrix so the temptation is to give up and rely on a feeling. Don't. Take notes and make a list. Drill down past the feeling. You have a brain, energy, and skin in the game. Use it. There are warning flags, and they will generate feelings like; I like this one, I don't like this one. Dismiss the feeling and back up to the warning flag; they talk too much, they talk too fast, they are arrogant and offended by questions, they don't like this or that but will do it if you want, etc. I did not like my surgeon, and I was clear in that. He made some social faux pas, but I was clear he was an excellent surgeon, on top of his game, and committed to success and his skill. He was my junk yard dog. People are good at somethings and not good at others. The challenge is to be clear in it. Intangibles are what you don't know, not what is too much work to track. In the end a choice is just that, a choice. It's not a right or wrong. It is thoughtful considered and made. A feeling is a temptation driven by your mind wanting to avoid the work and responsibility. It usually is a warning flag of some unresolved story you have about yourself. Something you don't want to take on. Relying on intuition is an avoidance technuque. Flight or fight is an example of this. On a dark street late at night with no time and few options this works. Not here, and not in long term commitments. Now for your partner, love is not a feeling. It is a commitment and responsibility to what works best for those in love. What it will generate is an experience; joy, sadness, pain, suffering, laughter, peace, satisfaction. It is the integrity and the work to the commitment that is to be trusted, not the experience of it. The experience is the outcome and you accept it in faith and peace because you've done the work.",

      "Content": "My concern has always been it's affect on PSA when true values are critical, such as testing for BCR. A surgeon may have less investment in that question than the RO/MO. Let's assume for the moment it does have a real effect. Does it kill all cancer cells or some? Does it postpone the diagnosis of BCR to the detrimental effect of conventional treatments? Most of these tests are measuring PSA, not the cancer. My investment is in the conventional path and it's statistics. While a supplement may have some beneficial effect, what is the effect and how does it impact current treatment thresholds and clinically tested outcomes? Doing some good isn't enough, imo. If you waiting for .2 or .3 for intervention of BCR it \"may\" do no harm. The difference may be insignificant at those levels. I want to know much sooner than that. The doctor's response is telling. He answers your question with a question. He doesn't know, and the difference it makes will be too small to matter, he assumes, so why not? I ask, so why? Here's another view. Do I want to slow it's recurrence and thereby it's treatment, or, do I want it to manifest itself as soon as possible to gain treatment as soon as possible? Like antibiotics, if I don't hit first and fast with a lethal combination what advantage do I give it by tinkering at it's edges? Maybe none, but I don't know. So what harm can it do? I don't know. That's a strategy for desperation, recklessness, or nonchalance, imo. The doctor answered your question with a question he doesn't have the answer to. This isn't a right or wrong debate. It's more of the emotional component that exists between the medical and patient communities. What can I do when I don't know what to do? Waiting doesn't scratch that itch.",

Or you experiencing any symptoms with a normal size prostate? For me and I'm not a doctor, you already know more than what you will find out from the drug therapy. You have cancer and via your PSA history it is progressing. The problem is you can't find a cancer via biopsy that matches the rest of your profile. It may be past time to move on to other methods; a different cancer team, second opinions on biopsy samples, second opinions on MRI scans. Change something. The drug suggestion seems like your doctor is running out of options. Even if it does what it's suppose to do it doesn't get you a biopsy sample. It just puts you in a bigger \"maybe\" debate.

My ancedotal experience may lead me to think the longer it grows the greater the chance it will develop into something more. It is cancer. The salieint point is the diagnostics we have are not 100%. Nor are the treatments. There is another recent post about a delayed recurrence of many years with a RP pathology report that indicates such a recurrence is highly unlikely. However pathology reports are not 100%. They do not section the entire prostate. The time it takes is not statistically warranted. Instead they use a method that is highly effective, but not 100%. I don't recall the actual percentage, but it is significant. Cancer can and does go undetected throught out the process. Regarding the other poster, the bright spot is the pathology examination procedures for margins in the process is highly effective, 97-99%. The dark spot is it leaves 1 - 3 percent of men who get a report of no cancer at or beyond the margin with cancer at or beyond the margin. Nobody wants to be those 1 - 3 guys in a hundred yet one stands among us today, probably. There is not right or wrong here. It's a choice and one made with statistics.",

      "Content": "There you go. All good advice that concurs with your doctor. Regarding MRI, here is a recent article. Is MRI the 'Mammography' of Prostate Cancer Screening? http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/h...d57f1cd1a.html Almost all doctor/health system/insurance's protocol is for TRUS biopsy first. In general, TRUS biopsy has a 30% or higher false negative. In the case of younger men with higher PSAs (you) and smaller prostates it is lower. If you have a negative biopsy and a high PSA you can then make an argument to your insurer for an MRI. A guided MRI biopsy, if the MRI shows significant cancer, is still not available everywhere, but can be sought out. All this is further down the line for you IF your TRUS biopsy is negative. Statistically, the odds are the TRUS biopsy will find your cancer if it is there. But again, if not, you are not out of the woods. At your age and PSA it will be easier to prove you have cancer than to prove you do not. At this time, a biopsy tissue sample is the only way to prove cancer and it's grade. This disease is a sneaky bastard if you take your eyes off it. This is a bitter pill to swallow. My suggestion is you give yourself time to accept it, but do not dwell there too long, and do not use it to hesitate moving forward in your diagnoses.",

Imo, you have found your way to the most supportive and knowledgable site available for this conversation. Here is my advice - Get the biopsy! As Chuck says, the biopsy risks are very low, and trading the risk of biopsy for the risk of cancer does not work. You can not avoid risk. You can manage it. This is a disease managed by statistics. PSA numbers approaching 10 are indicative of significant cancer (50%). Your young age with your numbers is more indication this may be significant cancer and less likely to be infection or BHP. Of course, you may be a statistical exception and it is something to wish for. However, this disease is \"curable\" if detected early. Your doctor's advice is solid. Being aggressive with diagnosis gives you whatever advantage you are going to have. While this is upsetting news, you are fortunate to have it sooner than later. This is just the beginning. Take this on now and the advantage is yours to enjoy a long and fruitful life.",

If it indicates cancer find it and track it. The odds are you will eventually need treatment and a reliable PSA history is valuable. Some with cancer do not have a reliable PSA. If you do, protect it. It is valuable, imo. My PSA proved to be right on track with the progression of my cancer.",

As Chuck says, the biopsy risks are very low, and trading the risk of biopsy for the risk of cancer does not work. You can not avoid risk. You can manage it. This is a disease managed by statistics. PSA numbers approaching 10 are indicative of significant cancer (50%). Your young age with your numbers is more indication this may be significant cancer and less likely to be infection or BHP.

      "Content": "There you go. All good advice that concurs with your doctor. Regarding MRI, here is a recent article. Is MRI the 'Mammography' of Prostate Cancer Screening? http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/h...d57f1cd1a.html Almost all doctor/health system/insurance's protocol is for TRUS biopsy first. In general, TRUS biopsy has a 30% or higher false negative. In the case of younger men with higher PSAs (you) and smaller prostates it is lower. If you have a negative biopsy and a high PSA you can then make an argument to your insurer for an MRI. A guided MRI biopsy, if the MRI shows significant cancer, is still not available everywhere, but can be sought out. All this is further down the line for you IF your TRUS biopsy is negative. Statistically, the odds are the TRUS biopsy will find your cancer if it is there. But again, if not, you are not out of the woods. At your age and PSA it will be easier to prove you have cancer than to prove you do not. At this time, a biopsy tissue sample is the only way to prove cancer and it's grade. This disease is a sneaky bastard if you take your eyes off it. This is a bitter pill to swallow. My suggestion is you give yourself time to accept it, but do not dwell there too long, and do not use it to hesitate moving forward in your diagnoses.",

The ulcer manifested itself with minor side and lower back pain waking me with more acute pain at 3-4am. I had a fine balance between aspirin therapy, 40 mg/daily and alcohol, and it got out of balance. I'm suspicious of the Cialis and Viagra as well in combination with the others. I've stopped all for the last three months. I quit coffee and switched to one cup of green tea a day. I had also added V8 into my diet and have discovered my body does not like it, too much acid. As I age my sensitivity to all things increases and my tolerance for abusing my body decreases. Keeping the balance requires more intention than when I was younger.",

      "Content": "Extreme sedentary life style and poor healthcare leads to slower metabolism, symptoms, and delayed detection or none at all. Couple obesity with less education and more poverty. A companion study would be the impact of obesity on the available study population in general. What are the statistics in general for obese men and early detection and treatment? Is obesity a sign of poor healthcare? Generally, it is. The study may be drawing from a very small subset of obese men who have had RP, who are diligent and proactive about their healthcare and treatment and may skew the population by practising a higher level of healthcare than the general population, i.e. early detection and treatment. In other words, the obese men who have had RP are a very small subset of the obese population being more successful with their healthcare than the general population. Multiply the difference by fit men who are prone to be slow to accept healthcare issues; i.e. I'm fit, exercise, and eat right, I don't have prostate cancer or I'll treat it with my lifestyle leading to late detection and delayed treatment.",

I recommend a cancer center. Your situation is very serious. At your age, PSA, volume, and G4, this is not your garden variety prostate cancer and you may be in for a long haul. Starting with surgery may give you a longer game plan for treatment which you may need. Once you start with radiation you can't go back to surgery.

      "Content": "I agree that characterizing someone's intent is to scare people is a reach. My volume was high and it was upgraded. My ancedotal experience may lead me to think the longer it grows the greater the chance it will develop into something more. It is cancer. The salieint point is the diagnostics we have are not 100%. Nor are the treatments. There is another recent post about a delayed recurrence of many years with a RP pathology report that indicates such a recurrence is highly unlikely. However pathology reports are not 100%. They do not section the entire prostate. The time it takes is not statistically warranted. Instead they use a method that is highly effective, but not 100%. I don't recall the actual percentage, but it is significant. Cancer can and does go undetected throught out the process. Regarding the other poster, the bright spot is the pathology examination procedures for margins in the process is highly effective, 97-99%. The dark spot is it leaves 1 - 3 percent of men who get a report of no cancer at or beyond the margin with cancer at or beyond the margin. Nobody wants to be those 1 - 3 guys in a hundred yet one stands among us today, probably. There is not right or wrong here. It's a choice and one made with statistics.",

      "Content": "This advice column which I read and appreciate, until now, indicates the general public awareness of prostate cancer. If you want to treat your prostate cancer screening will be harmful to you. While this statement is simple on the surface it assumes one's approach to prostate cancer remains the same whether you know your status or not. My personal experience has been learning I had prostate cancer made a big difference in my efforts to educate myself and make decisions regarding it. While the outcome may have been the same, to choose treatment or not, the quality of my choice improved dramatically once it was real. Time and studies will eventually determine the impact of the current over diagnosis and treatment mantra. My own experience and watching my brothers, the impact I see is an information campaign that is misused to buttress a dangerous pattern of denial. For example, if I screen myself I am setting myself up for mistreatment, and I will die of something else. True, you may, but an active involvement makes it possible. http://www.stltoday.com/lifestyles/h...2080f8fd6.html",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Lumore51 Hi there: Good point...but I guess it all depends on which study you are looking at and the percentage of patients experiencing any given side effect and how it compares to the percentages of patients experiencing that same side effects from another therapy (e.g. surgery). As an example, in this study from 2015: \"Erectile function was preserved in 72% of the patients who had Grade 0-1 erectile dysfunction before brachytherapy.\" and that 80% with ED will respond to pharmacologic agents. So that also comes into play-the treatable of any inivitable side effects https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4570880/ I don't have the numbers for surgical patients-however, I do recall them seeming to be higher-both in theory and based on the anecdotal evidence of men on the various boards when I was researching. In any case, I am happy to report that thus far for, this has not been an issue! I was referencing the article posted in this thread. In general, radiation accounts for a 65% ED number within 5 years. HDR Brachytherapy is improving that number if it is dropping it to 40%. A note about anecdotal evidence and human nature. Surgery is currently the most common treatment. Someone choosing radiation mostly likely has too or is choosing to go against popular wisdom/advice. Both are likely to not complain about the side effects and to accept them. Someone choosing surgery and following conventional wisdom is more likely to struggle with accepting the side effects expecting a successful experience. The last one they blame will be the cancer itself.",

      "Content": "Follow your doctor's advice! If this is her first mention of referring you to a urologist for a very concerning PSA history - fire her. If you have been ignoring this very concerning PSA history - which you have - you're fired! Bicycle riding is not the cause of your PSA numbers. Repeat, bycycle riding is not the source of your PSA numbers. Again, bycycle riding is not the source of your PSA numbers. Cancer has two demons: denial and delay. They are your demons. You own them. Cancer is just cancer. Denial and delay are on you. Prostate cancer can not be managed with wishful thinking. Regardless of your biking, you have a persistent and steadily rising PSA. Biking will not generate your PSA numbers. The warning flag for you is you now know the extremes you will go to in your mind to deny and delay. This is a cancer managed with statistics. A PSA at 10 or more puts you in a 60% probability of cancer. Make sure the urologist referral is to a competent and experienced prostate cancer specialist and surgeon. I recommend a major cancer center that specializes in PC. At this point, you want to stop wasting time. Early detection and treatment is the path to successful treatment and managment of what can be a very treatable and managable cancer. You've wasted too much time already! I want this post to be a smack to your forehead. Get out of your head and start taking care of your health! It's taken you 14 years, in the face of rising PSA numbers, to learn biking may have a modest effect on PSA test results? You are in a tough spot. Biking won't fix this, and you have a way of thinking that may kill you. Early action is the key to beating this disease. You are well into squandering that advantage. Finding your way here is a bright spot. Now, can you get out of your head and into the game? Thoughts that matter. Your next step after finding a competent highly skilled prostate cancer urologist is a biopsy. Make sure you get one in the next three weeks.",

Viagra (sildenafil) has a 4 hour half life. Cialis is more popular because of this. My understanding is it increases blood flow for healing. I have no reason to doubt it, and my experience was that it did. I noticed it aided the recovery of my continence. Whenever I stopped/forgot there was a slight increase in drbbles, and when I restarted it improved slightly. I no longer take/need it. I did experience lower back pain/discomfort.

I have no reason to doubt it, and my experience was that it did. I noticed it aided the recovery of my continence. Whenever I stopped/forgot there was a slight increase in drbbles, and when I restarted it improved slightly. I no longer take/need it. I did experience lower back pain/discomfort.

I do caution about the use of supplements that affect your PSA when you are using your PSA to monitor for cancer, especially recurrence post treatment. If your cancer is localized, early detection of recurrence and early radiation treatment is an effective combination if going for a cure for intermediate risk cancer. I have not yet been convinced that a particular use of food will cure cancer.",

Once you are clear in the language of this desease you will be clear in your actions. The use of testosterone, regardless of purpose, can manifest in smaller more agressive cancer that is difficult to find and can present early in younger men. Glad you have stopped it. I have two friends my age who are using it. Once I mentioned my situation and cautioned them about it's use they went silent on it. Most men are irrational when it comes to this disease. Sadly, I believe I am unwanted reminder of their lack of care. It has affected our relationship in they don't ask and don't tell. The burden for me is to quietly watch it unfold. My advice is to continue to monitor and diagnois while you upgrade your healthcare support and lose weight in anticipation. You may now be motivated. Also, be cautious of the rock stars in the industry. Search for those with experience with obese men. Don't count calories, count \"added\" sugars. Natural sugars bound to their original fiber is okay. It is the added (refined) sugars added to low fat and diet foods to compensate for reduced calories that is the culprit. Most labels now list added sugar. You can eat all the calories of fruit, nuts and vegetables you want. Just don't put \"reduced fat\" salad dressings or toppings on it. The reduced calories have been replaced with sugar. Consider a fiber supplement to support the reduction in food. One without added sugar. Next add in a low salt diet. Added salt, as a flavor enhancer, is also an indicator of poor quality food which contributes to fat gain. This is more difficult than the sugar. Government standards for salt consumption is twice what it should be. This will almost eliminate all processed carbohydrates, such as bread and processed grain anad snacks products. You will intially loath this diet, but the outcome will make you a believer and may save your life. Keep us posted. Watch \"That Sugar Film.\" It is on Prime, Netflick, and youTube.",

I do caution about the use of supplements that affect your PSA when you are using your PSA to monitor for cancer, especially recurrence post treatment. If your cancer is localized, early detection of recurrence and early radiation treatment is an effective combination if going for a cure for intermediate risk cancer. I have not yet been convinced that a particular use of food will cure cancer.",

Managing this on your own is valid and taking time to assess your situation is valid, but it is not AS. Your clarity in this disease will come with clarity in your language. Your thoughts, actions and outcomes will follow a shift to your clear use of language around this disease. Most are not clear that our language drives our knowledge and actions and not our thoughts. Once you are clear in the language of this desease you will be clear in your actions. The use of testosterone, regardless of purpose, can manifest in smaller more agressive cancer that is difficult to find and can present early in younger men. Glad you have stopped it. I have two friends my age who are using it. Once I mentioned my situation and cautioned them about it's use they went silent on it. Most men are irrational when it comes to this disease. Sadly, I believe I am unwanted reminder of their lack of care. It has affected our relationship in they don't ask and don't tell. The burden for me is to quietly watch it unfold. My advice is to continue to monitor and diagnois while you upgrade your healthcare support and lose weight in anticipation. You may now be motivated. Also, be cautious of the rock stars in the industry. Search for those with experience with obese men. Don't count calories, count \"added\" sugars. Natural sugars bound to their original fiber is okay. It is the added (refined) sugars added to low fat and diet foods to compensate for reduced calories that is the culprit. Most labels now list added sugar. You can eat all the calories of fruit, nuts and vegetables you want. Just don't put \"reduced fat\" salad dressings or toppings on it. The reduced calories have been replaced with sugar. Consider a fiber supplement to support the reduction in food. One without added sugar. Next add in a low salt diet. Added salt, as a flavor enhancer, is also an indicator of poor quality food which contributes to fat gain. This is more difficult than the sugar. Government standards for salt consumption is twice what it should be. This will almost eliminate all processed carbohydrates, such as bread and processed grain anad snacks products. You will intially loath this diet, but the outcome will make you a believer and may save your life. Keep us posted. Watch \"That Sugar Film.\" It is on Prime, Netflick, and youTube.",

      "Content": "State of the art biopsy is a 3T MRI guided biopsy. There are versions of it; fusion guided or live. TRUS biopsy was the standard and is quickly fading. Many urologists still offer it because it is an in office one step procedure, but it is very limited in range of sample area it can reach (less than half the prostate), is a blind sampling and has a 50% false negative record. The 3T MRI highlights significant cancers so the needle biopsy can be direct to the actual potential cancer. May have to assert yourself to get it, but do not be dissuaded. Google it to learn more. Still not readily available everywhere with trained providers, but it is accessible and well worth the effort. This is something to take seriously and move forward on. Not difficult, but the operative words with this cancer is early detection. Once you know what you have or don't have things can often slow down, but now is not the time for that. Again, early detection.",

The doctor, to his credit, was looking for a bigger picture to map his work, location, extent outside the prostate, etc. The positive biopsy warranted the MRI cost. A negative biopsy with elevated PSA warranting an MRI is also now being accepted. From what I have been reading the use of MRI to replace TRUS biopsy as the second level of diagnosis after PSA, DRE, and urinary symptoms is a ways off.

I finally acted to treat through an aggressive intervention by my GP. I'm glad I did. In hindsight, the choice to act brings with it the view I would have acted sooner once I accepted action to treat as my choice. I was upgraded and the volume was significant. My urologist considered volume an indicator of recurrence. Was I practising some form of AS? Probably. Did it work for me? So far, so good. Would I do it again knowing treatment was still the outcome? No. Early detection and treatment works, but no carte blanc. There is an optimal time to act. Assuming you have a competent surgeon, side effects are the outcome of the aggressiveness of the cancer, i.e. how much has to be cut. SE outside of that parameter may be related to older age, surgery mishaps, and aggravation of already developing SE's from the deterioration of the prostate and plumbing. I was developing incontinence and erection issues before my surgery.",

I finally acted to treat through an aggressive intervention by my GP. I'm glad I did. In hindsight, the choice to act brings with it the view I would have acted sooner once I accepted action to treat as my choice. I was upgraded and the volume was significant. My urologist considered volume an indicator of recurrence. Was I practising some form of AS? Probably. Did it work for me? So far, so good. Would I do it again knowing treatment was still the outcome? No. Early detection and treatment works, but no carte blanc. There is an optimal time to act. Assuming you have a competent surgeon, side effects are the outcome of the aggressiveness of the cancer, i.e. how much has to be cut. SE outside of that parameter may be related to older age, surgery mishaps, and aggravation of already developing SE's from the deterioration of the prostate and plumbing. I was developing incontinence and erection issues before my surgery.",

      "Content": "Surgery is the number one choice and for good reason. Radiation is improving as they work to control it's toxic nature and deliver it to the cancer. It's no surprise surgery leads the way. It is older technology than radiation. I hoped to be a candidate for surgery. Was pleased when I was. The upfront risk of side effects was clear and limited. Fortunately, I survived them. Three factors contributed to that, imo; the skill and experience of my surgical team, the nature and extent of my cancer, and my age and general health. There is a broad field of radiation choices that appeared designed to address common fears around surgery and those who are not candidates for surgery. There is a clear and developing path to safer treatment with radiation. HDR brachytherapy is one, imo. For me, it was still too new to rely on, and again, I was a clear candidate for a successful surgery experience. I expect to live into my 90s. Unknown side effects 20 years out are a consideration for me. Early HDR brachytherapy treatment protocals used too high a radiation dosage. That's a big oops for those men. I acknowledge and appreciate those brave men being on the leading edge of developing technologies. Whatever your choice, early diagnosis and early treatment is still a gold standard.",

Taking it intermittently causes blood to flush in and out. It is similar to ice and heat for an injury which causes blood to flood the area and then retreat. This aids in healing. Erections will come later, so to speak. On average a year, or even more. Nerve tissue has been traumatized by being touched, pushed, pulled, bruised, and exposed to heat trapped in the surgical cavity caused by the cauterizing element on the end of the scope used to cauterize blood vessels. Nerve tissue heals at a much slower rate than other tissues. Also, I masturbate at least 3 times a week in addition to fun with the partner. Fun with the partner is for the relationship. Masturbation allows me to work it more intently and to massage blood into the penis making sure I fully engorge the penis, as best I can, and achieve an orgasm. I can witness the improvement over time, but not session to session. These sessions are much longer and designed to be therapeutic. Use it or loose it. The garden variety urologist is a surgeon and looses interest fast after the surgery and focuses primarily on cure and healing result statistics for their own records.

If you are not planning to act until a specific number why bother watching it climb or not below that number? On the other hand, why not know? If your plan is to react at .1 there may be peace in accepting it as soon as possible even when you know you will not act until it reaches your target. Is there value in velocity at this level? Will your treatment plan change to sooner if the number is rising quickly? What about a rise that levels off before your target? I know so little about how this diagnostic works post RP that all I have is questions. Does the when and how fast matter? Or, are there only a few scenarios that are possible, i.e. no rise with no treatment, rise and level off with no treatment, or rise and treatment, or rise and no treatment and how soon it rises and velocity doesn't matter at all. I chose a 2 decimal test. For my profile, it seems early enough.",

      "Content": "All tests will lead to a biopsy for you based solely on your PSA history. Even a clean MRI or one that suggests low risk cancer can not explain, nor will it be reassurring, in the face of a rising 9.6 PSA. I'll wager a fine meal every conversation you have with urologists will end with a recommendation of a biopsy. Your choice will be fusion guided or not. Hard to see way too many choices in that scenario. The treatment choices, should you have to consider them, will render themselves just as simple fi that time comes. Here's the twist. Simple isn't easy. You can take a multitude of tests and if even one is outside safe parameters you are incomplete. A steady rising PSA offers only one path, a search for cancer until you find it. A biopsy is the bottom rung on that ladder and until you find it you can forget about the confusion of treatment options. Take all the test you want, but the steady rising 9.6 is all you need to move on to biopsy.",

      "Content": "Exercise and improve diet, but what's the problem with pills? Depression is the common cold of mental health. Everyone gets it, it is contagious, & you along with many of us have good reason to experience it. Seek treatment if exercise doesn't improve it. It can begin to effect your partner. You can regain your balance naturally, but pharmacutical aids are valid. Just like decongestants and antihistamines can help you through the worse symptoms of a cold antidepressants can do the same for depression. Vitamin D3 works. Especially during the winter months if your short on sunlight depending on where you live and your outdoor activity. Takes a few weeks.",

      "Content": "I find his intent to use multible tests to build a \"better\" picture for his doctor questionable. A complete PSA history and symptoms does it. What he has shared with us is short of that. His bias is obscuring the good information he already has with more information. If he has started his post with, I will biopsy if my PSA doesn't drop dramatically in the next test, I'd have remained quiet. There is conveniently no evidence in his post his PSA spikes or is steady. Money is then on it being steady with gymnastic mental work trying to make it symptomatic of something else. My comments are not directed to the technical stuff, but the emotional state that may not serve him well.",

      "Content": "I get it. However, 3 years ago he moved into biopsy territory with his 2 -3 numbers. He's let it cook now for three years. He's already expressed a bias to his urologist who is now compelled to work with it. Sure, get another PSA test, but note the doctor's order for it in 2 -3 weeks. That is essentially immediately. Curing cancer and AS begins with a biopsy. I do not dispute the risk of biopsy or cancer. A bias which designs a course to avoid a biopsy is flawed, imo. Attempting AS or watchful waiting without a plan to biopsy at some designed point is a game of pin the tail on the donkey. As you note, my focus is simple.",

What he has shared with us is short of that. His bias is obscuring the good information he already has with more information. If he has started his post with, I will biopsy if my PSA doesn't drop dramatically in the next test, I'd have remained quiet. There is conveniently no evidence in his post his PSA spikes or is steady. Money is then on it being steady with gymnastic mental work trying to make it symptomatic of something else.

He's already expressed a bias to his urologist who is now compelled to work with it. Sure, get another PSA test, but note the doctor's order for it in 2 -3 weeks. That is essentially immediately. Curing cancer and AS begins with a biopsy. I do not dispute the risk of biopsy or cancer. A bias which designs a course to avoid a biopsy is flawed, imo. Attempting AS or watchful waiting without a plan to biopsy at some designed point is a game of pin the tail on the donkey. As you note, my focus is simple.",

      "Content": "Supplements with anti inflammatory qualities are beneficial for just about everything, but will not cure cancer or stop it from presenting. They are also present in a healthy diet in appropriate amounts. If not, its not a healthy diet. In other words, the nature of a \"supplement\" is to compensate for an unhealthy diet and lifestyle. If it helps you achieve a healthy weight it may work, but if your BMI is not between 19 to 24 the odds are you are overweight and your diet and lifestyle is counter to your health regardless of the supplements you take. Abdominal fat is a higher risk factor for PC than supplements will benefit you, imo. The biggest risk to your health is thinking you are not overweight when you are. Taking supplements may tempt you to think you are doing something. If you continue to be overweight, supplements are only a finger in the dike. If they are an attempt to compensate for a poor diet and lifestyle while you make adjustments, good for you. You have found what is missing in your diet and you can go to work on it. Indulging in supplements may be a warning flag you are missing identifing major components, good and bad, in your diet. Mega dosing on these benefitials may not only be deluding your acceptance of what a healthy lifestyle is but may be counter productive to it if its all you plan to do. No amount of pomegranite juice may be able to compensate for 10 pounds (yes, that little) overweight and a sedentary lifestyle. Consider your cancer is already set in your DNA regardless of your current diet and lifestyle. Interestingly, the switch that is designed to turn off a prostate cell may have been turned off much earliar in your life by an unhealthy diet, lifestyle choice, or stress experienced by you as an infant or embryo or your mother while pregnant with you. That so many are experiencing it implies it may be a culturally prevalent imbalance or stress. Taking something today to undo what was set in the bone a generation before may be folly. Focusing on your current diet and lifestyle as it may impact you as an example and the provider of the same for your children and grandchildren may be a healthier strategy.",

      "Content": "I was experiencing a decreased flow, smaller bladder capacity (frequent urination), and slight incontinence. All improved with the stream being the most dramatic. I have the stream of a teenager. These improvements alone were enough to consider the procedure a success. Increased bladder capacity has taken more time and is less dramatic. The restriction of your urethra from BHP and/or the cancer causes you to use your bladder muscles more to forceably expell urine. This thickens them reducing bladder volume. This condition is less prone to reverse. I was also beginning to experience some ED. While erections have returned post surgery the nerve damage caused by an enlarged prostate is more likely to be permanent. Cialis helps this. I speculate some men's frustration with ED post surgery is in part related to an already developing ED. My surgeon was clear in letting me know erections will recover from the surgery, if successful, but no better than before.",

      "Content": "Moving your care to a cancer center specializing in prostate cancer for a team approach makes sense. Prostate cancer is treatable. Not all prostate cancer is the same. You have a very serious case of an aggressive form with a head start that may require multidisciplines over an extended period of time. Once that decision is made let the new team perform their own tests and scans. Their expertise extends to both performing and interpreting the scans and tests. Surgeons, radiologists and medical oncologists will confer together for your husband's treatment. He will most likely be considered for all three. His fitness, age, general health, and extent of cancer and aggressiveness will determine if he is a candidate for starting with surgery. If it has progressed beyond surgery, or he is not fit for surgery, then radiation and hormone deprivation therapies (ADT) are used, and many options and combinations are available. Sorting them out and choosing the best for a specific case is an advantage to the team approach. Completing his signature will allow those here with similar experiences to comment. They are here and will support you.",

      "Content": "A 9.1 PSA warrants a biopsy, imo. Your young age only makes it more so. Be careful going forward with anyone who is advocating you avoid basic healthcare. Someone is causing mischief. Studies are reassuring that it is not the case. Their view that biopsy spreads cancer applies to biopsing all cancers, and biopsy is the only way we have to diagnose any and all cancer with certainty. Are they suggesting nobody have biopsies to diagnose cancer? If there is cancer don't you want to know about it? Not having a biopsy will certainly spread it if it's there, because nothing happens to treat cancer until you have a successful biopsy diagnosing it. Prostate cancer is treatable, but not unless you can find it with a biopsy. Sounds like someone in your family is in denial about cancer and healthcare. They may need your leadership in this more than you need theirs. Be your own advocate. Once you're in the crosshairs everything shifts and you get real serious real quick. Don't get drawn into the weeds.",

      "Content": "I had two hernia repairs this past year. One was at the site of an old laproscopic surgery incision 25 years ago in my belly button. Just below the RP incision. It had slowly been widening over time. I could actual feel it. About the size of a quarter. Ballooned out the size of a grape when I strained. The other was a more common inguinal hernia. Doc said it was wear and tear from age. It can also present as a side effect of the RP and colonoscopy inflations. They certainly don't help. All told, had my belly inflated 2 times and my colon 3 times. Had both hernias repaired at the same time. Straight forward procedures. They used mesh on both. The belly button was a little tougher to close up I was told. I suspect from all the scar tissue in the area from the laproscopic tools rooting around from both surgeries.",

His heart is strong. His incontinence persists. Older age also implies older cancer and more extensive cutting.

Surgery is possible after radiation, but not ideal, only a limited number of surgeons take it on due to the condition of radiated tissue, but it's not the point.

It had slowly been widening over time. I could actual feel it. About the size of a quarter. Ballooned out the size of a grape when I strained. The other was a more common inguinal hernia. Doc said it was wear and tear from age. It can also present as a side effect of the RP and colonoscopy inflations. They certainly don't help. All told, had my belly inflated 2 times and my colon 3 times. Had both hernias repaired at the same time. Straight forward procedures. They used mesh on both. The belly button was a little tougher to close up I was told. I suspect from all the scar tissue in the area from the laproscopic tools rooting around from both surgeries.",

      "Content": "Here is a good article that concludes that if you are on the drug you should be getting biopsies if your PSA rises regardless of the multipling factor. Your PSA should not be rising on the drug. It may suppress low grade cancer as a form of weak hormone therapy, but it will not stop or slow more aggressive cancers. The risk is men on the drug will postpone biopsies missing the opportunity for early treatment in the presence of aggressive cancers. I suspect the impact of the drug lasts longer than 6 months in terms of restoring your PSA to a reliable indicator. It has been shrinking and supressing cell growth and low grade cancer with low hormone therapy for 5 years. If in addition, you have more aggressive cancer it has had no impact on it. I find it's use troubling and poorly understood concerning cancer. If you have BHP and low grade cancer it can work, but who is ever certain of that? Not many. http://www.drcatalona.com/quest/quest_fall08_1.htm What were your brothers PSA numbers? Some cancers present with low PSA numbers. He's your best model.",

      "Content": "You're right on track. Your young age is a factor not usually encountered in these forums and the general rules sometimes do not apply. My own reading concurs with you that the cancer can behave differently and more aggressively in younger men with the early onset being the first indicator. It is a very important consideration. Keep seeking out expert advice in your health care system that has experience with this particular nuance. Be wary of any AS recommendations. Look for more advanced diagnostic approaches. Ask about 3T MRI to get a better picture of any hidden stuff trying to sneak out early. Even that may have its limits with the smaller lesions even if they are aggressive. Ask about a saturation biopsy. These suggestions are if you want more information to plan your treatment. A safe call is surgery with a doctor skilled in your situation able to assess extent and make the call during surgery to take more or less. Most surgeons do not do pathology screenings during surgery. This may be another option for you. Whatever path you choose ask the doctor specifically how many patients they have treated in your age group and what were the stats going in and what were the outcomes. There is no substitute for successful experience. Keep taking ground. Nobody is going to carry this ball like you will.",

      "Content": "I understand. I took aspirin and drank red wine, had a outdated \"healthy\" diet, and exercised. I still got cancer. My experience with aspirin was it caused internal bleeding evidenced by dark stool and a couple of ulcer episodes. This may not be a risk for everyone, but for me long term irritation and bleeding of the digestive system didn't work. Especially without the intended result of preventing cancer. I do suspect it artificially lowered my PSA at the time I was denying my cancer. Much like it treats a fever, it may help symptoms. I do subscribe to an anti-inflammatory diet, and am slowly becoming a vegetarian. I find it much more challenging than taking aspirin. This is not a dig, but evidence of the temptations to take short cuts. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/daily-aspirin-therapy/art-20046797 This article discusses the risk. Fish oil supplements increases the risk as well as alcohol. Not everyone is susceptible to the bleeding risk. I am. Typically bleeding shows up as dark stool.

      "Content": "Here is a good article that concludes that if you are on the drug you should be getting biopsies if your PSA rises regardless of the multipling factor. Your PSA should not be rising on the drug. It may suppress low grade cancer as a form of weak hormone therapy, but it will not stop or slow more aggressive cancers. The risk is men on the drug will postpone biopsies missing the opportunity for early treatment in the presence of aggressive cancers. I suspect the impact of the drug lasts longer than 6 months in terms of restoring your PSA to a reliable indicator. It has been shrinking and supressing cell growth and low grade cancer with low hormone therapy for 5 years. If in addition, you have more aggressive cancer it has had no impact on it. I find it's use troubling and poorly understood concerning cancer. If you have BHP and low grade cancer it can work, but who is ever certain of that? Not many. http://www.drcatalona.com/quest/quest_fall08_1.htm What were your brothers PSA numbers? Some cancers present with low PSA numbers. He's your best model.",

It is a condition as much as anything. It makes radiation attractive becasue it radiates all the cells with the goal of irradicating cancer cells. Cancer cells have weaken DNA and often can not survive the radiation. Healthy cells do, but they are stressed in the process. Surgery offers a similar therapy by attempting to radical removal the entire gland. Spot treatment seems to put to fine a point of it, imo. I know longer trust the gland.",

It is a condition as much as anything. It makes radiation attractive becasue it radiates all the cells with the goal of irradicating cancer cells. Cancer cells have weaken DNA and often can not survive the radiation. Healthy cells do, but they are stressed in the process. Surgery offers a similar therapy by attempting to radical removal the entire gland. Spot treatment seems to put to fine a point of it, imo. I know longer trust the gland.",

The < sign means it is measuring somewhere, or not at all, below 0.1 and can be moving around below that limit and you will not know. If the < sign is not there it means you actually measured 0.1 twice in a row and that is considered detectable by most/many. If those are the first measurements after your surgery many/most may conclude the surgery was a failure for a cure. The repeat number is somewhat unexpected.

      "Content": "A side bar to the above encouragement. The way your brain works matters with this disease. You can't out think this. Those who try squander their opportunity. The brain is wired to avoid (shows up as denial) or delay. Early detection, early treatment is the key to staying ahead of this disease at every stage. The treatment protocols work if they are used. Shifting the brain from avoidance to treatment makes a difference with cancer. Some doctors, mostly men, share this same disfunction. Pairing up with a doctor who doesn't take this disease seriously may be more of the same for many men. To support this fact of professional denial, only 17% of internists and GPs screen for prostate cancer. Unexplainable and bad medicine, but still, it is a fact. The cancer doesn't have a brain. It is a mechanism. ADT disrupts the mechanism. You want a new drug. There isn't one. It's all we got. That and an overwhelming will to live. Use your will to shift your head in this matter.",

      "Content": "You do not share enough of your history to make a useful comment on your specific case while searching for evidence to dismiss a doctor's recommendation. So, there's that. If the 3T scan is lighting up cancer then you want to know what it is, where it is, and how much it is. PIRADS 2 (which you are implying without sharing the score) is worth investigating. Rarely does this forum advise not following a doctor's recomendation unless it is obviously heading into the weeds. This is not that. Here's a tale. \"My PSA climbed from (less than yours, so there's that again) and my GP referred me to a urologist for the first time. My urologist retested/confirmed the PSA. I decided at that point to do a prostate MRI, even though it wasn't covered by insurance. It came back with a PI-RADS 2. I made the decision to wait. Just today ( year later) I had a MRI, post-diagnosis. It came back PI-RADS 5. What was a surprise was that my radiology oncologist reviewing the radiologist's findings on today's MRI took a good look at the old MRI and told me that there were indications on that MRI that bore further investigation even though PIRADS2. Like a complete idiot, I didn't bother to get the first full MRI report, I just took their word for it, and thought PI-RADS 2, 30% chance of something and 70% chance of benign/nothing. Lesson #1 - get the full MRI report and get it in the hands of someone you trust for a 2nd opinion. It really matters who is reading your MRI. Kind of pissed that I could have had a year's jump on killing this. Today's MRI indicated (2) PI-RADS4 lesions and (1) PI-RADS 5 lesion which \"closely abuts the base of the seminal vesicles, which have a mildly low T2 signal, raising concern for bilateral seminal vesicle involvement\". This is also now being confirmed/2nd opinion'd with yet another radiologist.....\" Your comment, \"didn't find anything at all\" is not true and is classic denial in the face of obvious evidence and professional opinion. Get the biopsy.",

      "Content": "A side bar to the above encouragement. The way your brain works matters with this disease. You can't out think this. Those who try squander their opportunity. The brain is wired to avoid (shows up as denial) or delay. Early detection, early treatment is the key to staying ahead of this disease at every stage. The treatment protocols work if they are used. Shifting the brain from avoidance to treatment makes a difference with cancer. Some doctors, mostly men, share this same disfunction. Pairing up with a doctor who doesn't take this disease seriously may be more of the same for many men. To support this fact of professional denial, only 17% of internists and GPs screen for prostate cancer. Unexplainable and bad medicine, but still, it is a fact. The cancer doesn't have a brain. It is a mechanism. ADT disrupts the mechanism. You want a new drug. There isn't one. It's all we got. That and an overwhelming will to live. Use your will to shift your head in this matter.",

      "Content": "Welcome and sorry for the news. As you will see we like to see your history and biopsy report information in your signature. It is an indicator that you have it, read it, and understand it. By referring to a \"few (3?) other spots\" my assumption is 5 samples came back with cancer. (That typically rules out AS.) It indicates a casual dismissive approach that you may want to sharpen into more serious focus. Everyone has a unique response to the news, but almost universally there is an immediate bias of denial and preferred treatment methodology which shows up in how we present (or not) the facts of our diagnosis and disease. For example, why did you wait 2 years watching your PSA climb past the warning flag of 4? It doesn't matter now except as an indicator of how you are inclined to approach what comes next. Also, your doctor's slow response to an alarming PSA and your urologist prescribing a BHP medication with such a high PSA raises a concern about both. Typically a PSA over 10 puts you in a higher risk group and is seldom an indicator of a benign problem. Regardless, cancer has to be ruled out. It is not likely your prostate doubled it's size in 2 years from BHP or that BHP is responsible for such a fast and steady rise in your PSA. Your elevated PSA is an indicator there may be more to know about your cancer than revealed by the biopsy. TRUS biopsy is an inexpensive in office valuable diagnostic tool, but it is fallible with a 30% or more false negative and it goes has high as 50% in older men with larger prostates. You are fortunate that it detected your cancer the first time. First thing to realize, it is no guarantee of the whole picture. For clarity, your comment 12.9% involvement of the prostate is not correct. Percent involvement by cancer of the prostate is usually known by surgical removal of the prostate and a pathology report. A pathology report of the biopsy will indicate a percent involvement of cancer of each sample only. A biopsy sample is a minute part of the entire prostate and you probably had only 12 samples taken. Imagine a piece of tissue thinner than a wet kite string less than 3/4\" long. Most likely 12 of those were taken. Much of your prostate was unsampled especially if it has doubled in size. I think your on the right track seriously considering radiation. I'd advise against ruling out surgery without more information. Surgery is a younger man's game both in fitness to recover continence and erectile function and less concern for the longer term side effects of radiation. If I were you I would want to see more diagnostic information and suggest you ask for a 3T MRI, and preferably one that can be fused for a guided biopsy. Everyone, surgeon or radiologist, is going to want to know more about where and what your cancer is before proceeding with treatment. My surgeon wanted an MRI before surgery to map the area even though I had already agreed to surgery. I expect a radiologist will want the same. The advantage for you is you can withhold treatment choice until you have the information as well. If you go to a major cancer that has an experienced prostate cancer team they will be able to share this information easily. This is a very treatable disease and not one to be taken lightly if you want success treating it. If you were electing surgery with the information in hand not much more need be done and once the gland was removed you would have a clearer picture of what it is, where it is, and if it has gone beyond the prostate. Choosing radiation requires more information, imo. As often said on this forum, if you choose radiation you only have one shot it at. You want to know where and what it is before you take that shot. http://news.cancerconnect.com/prosta...ostate-cancer/",

Within a few days I was good with the big pads and one or two nights with diapers and a sit pad in bed. Only ended up using a few diapers. Did you do kegels in preparation? Start them now. It will take a few days for the numbness to clear up and catheter use itself leaves some incontinence because everything stops being used. I don't see a signature so have no info on your age. Typically, the older you are the longer it takes. Surgeon should be able to tell you if he had to take a lot and will have a good idea on how quickly it will come back. 3 months is good. 6 months is average. Getting to a point where pads work happens quickly. I was back to work with the catheter. I have an office job.",

In language, it is the distinction between deciding and choosing. When we decide we kill off what we decide against. When we choose we leave what we do not choose alive and valid for ourselves and others for another day. Not to stirr a hornet's nest, but the best example of this today is belief in religion that relies on righteousness when wanting to be right overides what works, choice, and being with others.",

      "Content": "Unless you have other issues it will improve quickly. I remember looking down as it just ran out. Within a few days I was good with the big pads and one or two nights with diapers and a sit pad in bed. Only ended up using a few diapers. Did you do kegels in preparation? Start them now. It will take a few days for the numbness to clear up and catheter use itself leaves some incontinence because everything stops being used. I don't see a signature so have no info on your age. Typically, the older you are the longer it takes. Surgeon should be able to tell you if he had to take a lot and will have a good idea on how quickly it will come back. 3 months is good. 6 months is average. Getting to a point where pads work happens quickly. I was back to work with the catheter. I have an office job.",

Taking that into account (or perhaps using that as an excuse not to risk the biopsy infection possibility) I waited 6 months for another PSA and when it came back even higher I called my doc to schedule the biopsy.

When I asked the doctor he said it was a sign of healing. I assumed attempt by the bladder to reject the catheter. Mine was in for longer than normal. They continued mildly after removal of the catheter whenever I urinated and ended within a few days. It is a muscle cramp. If you had an enlarged prostate and reduced stream your bladder (a muscle) has gotten muscled up forcing urine through the restricted urethra. When it cramps you will feel it.

      "Content": "There have been some studies that indicate salvage radiation is most effective when administered as early as possible. Some say as early as .03. You will need to have at least 2 rising numbers to confirm this. The intent of an ultraPSA test is to get those 2 rising numbers earliar than later. Most health systems still use numbers as high as .3 and .2 as the threshold for follow up radiation. It is accepted that these are arbitrary numbers established for some time. The thinking behind early detection early treatment is to treat the recurrence, if detected, while it is still as small as ppossible and as localized as possible. Salvage radiation is somewhat of a shotgun approach to the bed of the former prostate. It can be directed to specific areas where your pathology reported margins or higher grades of cancer. The sooner, the smaller the area, the more effective it is at hitting and treating localized cancer cells left behind. The counter argument is it may be remnants of health tissue, or a low grade cancer that will never catch up to it's former self to do any harm, or postpone possible side effects from treatment as long as possible (especially if your still healing from surgery) without reducing the chances of successful treatment. However, it is also said G3 can not exist outside the prostate. So depending on what you believe, it's not G6 indicating it's a higher grade (what was your pathology?) or healthy tissue. My position for my case is to consider it cancer. Either way, the uPSA supports the standard of early detection early treatment is the most effecive method of dealing with this disease. The longer it takes to BCR the better your prognosis. I am suspect of the old bedside manner that manages what I know and keeps information from me for my peace of mind. It is an old and worn reason and the best they have to what amounts to an arbritary threshold at this point. I am at a 30% risk of BCR. My surgeon said we will monitor your PSA on an annual cycle. I said thanks, but I prefer every 6 months. He said okay. I take an intermediate test that's low threshold is <0.02. The margin is a little tight for getting my notice prior to .03, but possible if it happens slowly. I am consdiering changing to the uPSA. I like that your docotor is open to it. Retesting was your first step. Next step is to talk with the radiation team and see where they are on their protocol, and set them up to be taking over your care from the surgeon. His work is done. Everyone will be fine with pushing this off to higher numbers if that is your approach. On the other hand, staying in front of this all the time seems the most effective approach to me. In the end, the radiation team you select is the one to make the call now.",

      "Content": "Your PSA will hopefully drop because you killed the cancer cells producing PSA with radiation or stunned them into remission. Healthy cells are still doing there thing and producing PSA, so you will have some PSA and hopefully it is low and stable. To your question, does radiation cure/stop BPH or prostatitist or will your numbers continue to bounce around never giving you the chance to be certain of recurrence? I don't know, but will consider it is the same as before; bouncing around equals BHP or prostatitis; steady rise equals cancer; both bouncing around and steady rise equals both BHP or prostatitist and cancer. Most men have BPH. It is a natural process of aging in the prostate. So cancer usually comes with BPH. Those with less BPH and a more steady PSA are fortunate. Regardless, if it continues to bounce higher, on average, you probably have cancer. In other words, if you graphed enough data's points, when you look close at the line it is bouncing, but when you step back and look at the whole line it is graphing up and not returning to a true stable number. Looking at your signature, I'd say you are at risk of having cancer. I have not heard much on the presence of BPH or prostatitis impacting a treatment choice. Or own moderator had a prostate so large from BPH it was creating it's own side effects and influenced a choice to proceed with surgery. Does radiation offer the same treatment outcome, i.e no more concern for an enlarging or inflamed prostate. Great question.",

Peeling the onion deeper, it reflects your own personal insecurities that you are a poor example for others. Are either of you going against professional advice at the expense of your own health and responsibility? You may consider you are not giving him credit for making choices for himself. We see in others what we do not see in ourselves. You may consider some counseling to resolve your feelings about your choice for yourself. As a friend, do not share your concern with him about your lack of faith in his ability to do what is best for himself. While you may have this concern for yourself it is best not to share your personal doubts about your choice as a concern for him. Or, in other words, give him the same power and freedom you have given yourself. I will challenge your assumption that being anonymous makes a difference in any of this. You presence sharing here is no less powerful and responsible than with your friend. Being anonymous does not shift responsibility for yourself or others. It is only a pretense that it does. As humans we do one thing very well, we share. If we choose life, we share life. If we choose joy and love, we share joy and love. If we choose pain and suffering, we share pain and suffering. If we choose doubt, we share doubt. Look to what you share to see what you have chosen for yourself. You are doubting your friend. Sharing openly, your own personal experience, is essential for prostate cancer awareness. Just don't make it about others. You may be friends because you share the same ways of being in life. People have a way of finding each other. Your caring for your friend may be a canary in the coal mine for you. Take your blessing where you can get them. Take care of yourself if you can, and in doing so, you will be a good friend. This is getting long, but important. If you have flown you know the oxygen mask drill.

      "Content": "Most everyone uses health insurance of some sort or medicare. I am unaware of any treatment that money will buy that is better than what is provided with most health insurance or medicare. Statistically, having a higher education means you will; make more money, live longer, live healthier, and recent studies indicate you will be happier. Having more money doesn't mean you will be more responsible for your health. Awareness, a clear head, and health insurance are the biggest advantages if they provide access to early detection and treatment. In my experience of these, a clear head is the biggest advantage. Depression runs in my family and appears to be the biggest predicter of health care responsibility. The more depressed you are the more likely you are to not seek timely care and to be tempted into denial and delay in all matters including one's education, fitness, and general health. Depression promotes a general decline as we follow our thoughts and scarifice our will. For most with a higher education a resistance to mental health care is the weak link in their healthcare system, not money, access or availability, imo. To answer your question it is education and mental health, not money, making the difference. Having the means is an outcome of one's education and mental health. It is not the source. Peeling the onion one more layer, peace is accessed through acceptance and happiness through gratitude. Being is our access to power. Money is just money. Poverty, on the other hand, is the outcome of oppression. Accumulating excessive wealth is a sign of a lack of balance and mental health and a temptation to well being. Finally, blame doesn't work and the best thing you can do for your children is leave nothing behind including remorse. Sacrifice, as a way of being, is a temptation to turn away from our own power and avoid responsibility for the gift we have been given.",

Detection will increase as the population ages, as awareness increases, and as the cancer expands in the population. It's cancer. Blaming detection for overtreatment doesn't work. They are separate and distinct. I never understood the overtreatment mantra. I think it is linked to the other myth you will die of something else before you die of PC. As life expectancy increases and the cancer expands to more and younger men and more aggressive forms public perception will change. I think social stigma also plays a role. Men are reluctant to accept the responsibility for the disease, will not discuss it, and practise denial and delay which feeds complaint and bitterness over the natural outcome of delayed detection and treatment. The denial and delay syndrome is driven by men themselves not stepping up and taking responsibility for their health.",

      "Content": "I went a different route and wished I hadn't. GP recommended a urologist when PSA hit 5's at 60yrs. At the time, there was much hoopla about over diagnosis & treating. I claimed other reasons and said lets retest. I made some diet changes, retested, and it dropped slightly. Again at the time, those who thought they new better suggested 2-3 years on PSA testing. Fast forward 3 years and the next test was 7. If cancer is present attempts to lower your PSA on your own may have a slight effect, but rise will continue again relentlessly. GP insisted on referral to urologist. Biopsy showed lots of G 3+3 upgraded to 3+4 after RP. Point, there are other possible reasons for a spike. There is one that can threaten your life. I recommend you procede with the diagnosis path of your choice, but proceed. I was lucky. Today you have more than luck at your disposal. Currently, at least one TRUS biopsy is in most men's future before an insurance company will provide a MRI guided biopsy. TRUS biopsy is 50% false negative so it may not be definitive. Other additional blood tests are available with the PSA. Take advantage of them. Still holding my breath on recurrence. My prognosis is good, and could have been better with a more aggressive and persistent diagnostic phase. This disease will most likely catch up to most men. Stay ahead of it as long as you can. Good sign that you found your way here.",

Something was left behind with a Grade 4 or more. It does point to the dangers of G4. The problem now is where do you direct the radiation?

I am unaware of any treatment that money will buy that is better than what is provided with most health insurance or medicare. Statistically, having a higher education means you will; make more money, live longer, live healthier, and recent studies indicate you will be happier. Having more money doesn't mean you will be more responsible for your health. Awareness, a clear head, and health insurance are the biggest advantages if they provide access to early detection and treatment. In my experience of these, a clear head is the biggest advantage. Depression runs in my family and appears to be the biggest predicter of health care responsibility. The more depressed you are the more likely you are to not seek timely care and to be tempted into denial and delay in all matters including one's education, fitness, and general health. Depression promotes a general decline as we follow our thoughts and scarifice our will. For most with a higher education a resistance to mental health care is the weak link in their healthcare system, not money, access or availability, imo. To answer your question it is education and mental health, not money, making the difference. Having the means is an outcome of one's education and mental health. It is not the source. Peeling the onion one more layer, peace is accessed through acceptance and happiness through gratitude. Being is our access to power. Money is just money. Poverty, on the other hand, is the outcome of oppression. Accumulating excessive wealth is a sign of a lack of balance and mental health and a temptation to well being. Finally, blame doesn't work and the best thing you can do for your children is leave nothing behind including remorse. Sacrifice, as a way of being, is a temptation to turn away from our own power and avoid responsibility for the gift we have been given.",

A separate healthcare system for our veterans is a temptation to abuse and the hiding of it, and proven to be unworkable. If you can't afford the medicare premium you can not afford healthcare. My medicare insurance premiums are the most affordable health insurance available and has no deductible. Your friend's view he can not afford it is misguided and is not clear thinking.

A one size fits all treatment for men who want different outcomes based on different profiles and expectations seems to be a bias for one right answer. Here is one consideration not often mentioned. A gay man may want a treatment that leaves his prostate in place to maintain a more active sex life. The prostate is a more important erogenous zone for him than a heterosexual. He may be willing to take a different set of risks. The most compelling bias we have is to be right in our own mind, and we \"prove\" this to ourselves by recruiting others to agree with our view. At the moment, there is no one cure for all profiles with no side effects. You would need an algorithm that computes all profiles against all side effects including a preference matrix for the side effects.",

      "Content": "Most everyone uses health insurance of some sort or medicare. I am unaware of any treatment that money will buy that is better than what is provided with most health insurance or medicare. Statistically, having a higher education means you will; make more money, live longer, live healthier, and recent studies indicate you will be happier. Having more money doesn't mean you will be more responsible for your health. Awareness, a clear head, and health insurance are the biggest advantages if they provide access to early detection and treatment. In my experience of these, a clear head is the biggest advantage. Depression runs in my family and appears to be the biggest predicter of health care responsibility. The more depressed you are the more likely you are to not seek timely care and to be tempted into denial and delay in all matters including one's education, fitness, and general health. Depression promotes a general decline as we follow our thoughts and scarifice our will. For most with a higher education a resistance to mental health care is the weak link in their healthcare system, not money, access or availability, imo. To answer your question it is education and mental health, not money, making the difference. Having the means is an outcome of one's education and mental health. It is not the source. Peeling the onion one more layer, peace is accessed through acceptance and happiness through gratitude. Being is our access to power. Money is just money. Poverty, on the other hand, is the outcome of oppression. Accumulating excessive wealth is a sign of a lack of balance and mental health and a temptation to well being. Finally, blame doesn't work and the best thing you can do for your children is leave nothing behind including remorse. Sacrifice, as a way of being, is a temptation to turn away from our own power and avoid responsibility for the gift we have been given.",

      "Content": "I would avoid the VA for healthcare. It is underfunded, disfunctional, and care is outdated. In general and as a concept, it is broken and not fixable. Veteran healthcare deserves to be what is available to all of us. Veteran healthcare will work better if it is an insurance supplement to the public healthcare system as the provider. A separate healthcare system for our veterans is a temptation to abuse and the hiding of it, and proven to be unworkable. If you can't afford the medicare premium you can not afford healthcare. My medicare insurance premiums are the most affordable health insurance available and has no deductible. Your friend's view he can not afford it is misguided and is not clear thinking. VA healthcare is substandard from what I have witnessed here alone. Turning 65 and becoming eligible for Medicare was a huge cost saver for me and my health. If he has missed the initial enrollment period he has made another mistake. https://www.mymedicarematters.org/2018/05/use-veterans-benefits-medicare/",

      "Content": "Don't make stuff up in your head. Unless you ask or he tells you he is following your example unwisely you really don't know. Peeling the onion deeper, it reflects your own personal insecurities that you are a poor example for others. Are either of you going against professional advice at the expense of your own health and responsibility? You may consider you are not giving him credit for making choices for himself. We see in others what we do not see in ourselves. You may consider some counseling to resolve your feelings about your choice for yourself. As a friend, do not share your concern with him about your lack of faith in his ability to do what is best for himself. While you may have this concern for yourself it is best not to share your personal doubts about your choice as a concern for him. Or, in other words, give him the same power and freedom you have given yourself. I will challenge your assumption that being anonymous makes a difference in any of this. You presence sharing here is no less powerful and responsible than with your friend. Being anonymous does not shift responsibility for yourself or others. It is only a pretense that it does. As humans we do one thing very well, we share. If we choose life, we share life. If we choose joy and love, we share joy and love. If we choose pain and suffering, we share pain and suffering. If we choose doubt, we share doubt. Look to what you share to see what you have chosen for yourself. You are doubting your friend. Sharing openly, your own personal experience, is essential for prostate cancer awareness. Just don't make it about others. You may be friends because you share the same ways of being in life. People have a way of finding each other. Your caring for your friend may be a canary in the coal mine for you. Take your blessing where you can get them. Take care of yourself if you can, and in doing so, you will be a good friend. This is getting long, but important. If you have flown you know the oxygen mask drill. Put your mask on first before you try to help others with theirs. It is a basic tenet of being.",

If I had concerns I'd push for 3 decimal test. You're good. Ready, set, relax. I'd recommend you stay on a 6 mos schedule and enjoy every day.

Your age, family history, physical condition, fitness, life expectancy, and PSA history all contribute to your treatment choice. We do not have this information in your signature. My experience so far has been a succesfull one with surgery. Continence and erection have all returned. These side effects are influenced most by the extent of the cancer discovered to be removed (difficult to know before hand and unavoidable) and the skill of the surgeon (just as hard to determine). I'd assume a large successfull cancer center will have less risk of a less than acceptable surgeon. They can also walk you through all the treatment options in one stop.",

      "Content": "I have noticed incontinence begins to show up when I stop my kegel exercises. Continuing with these exercises, a few sets a day, seem to be critical maintenance. Two years out and alcohol, caffeine, and carbonated beverages still irritate the bladder and cause dribbles when I consume more than 1 drink of any of them. Very manageable. I have switched from coffee to green tea and it makes a difference. I no longer drink alcohol every day. Both practises seem appropriate for my age and diet. Beer is a double effect with both carbonation and alcohol. I have also noticed consuming bladder irritants can have an accumulating effect. If I drink them daily, within a week, I notice incontinence creeping back in. To keep from being discouraged consider the cancer, if untreated, will have caused more extreme incontinence than you are dealing with now. It is a multiprong approach; kegels, weight, and diet. Another risk is we are tempted to manage incontinence by drinking less. This leaves us dehydrated which weakens us. Try a diary for a few days to track your liquid through the day. You may be drinking less during the day and more in the evening than you think. Reality and perception often need accountability tools to bring them into alignment. What may be hiding is your incontinence progress is less than you think it is, but at 4 months it sounds pretty good. Our brains have a mind of their own and can not be trusted. What truly runs us is our word and integrity to it. It usually is a combination of things.",

      "Content": "Radiation or surgery is the big question, and in the end it is not as complicated as it appears to you now. Be patient, read and participate, stay out of the weeds, and it will come to the surface for you. There are definite pros and cons that mostly stack up depending on your profile. There is no one size fits all answer. They are not interchangable. One is not universally better than another. One is often more suited than another based on your profile which includes your physical condition, general health, age, and type, volume, stage, and location of your cancer. This is really a good thing. It provides options. Professionals may disagree, but when they do they know why. You will too. This is a good palce to get your education. One caution. Be aware (not beware) of bias. We all have it. We are inclined to think our choice is the best and we look for agreement to support it. Another common mishap is to quickly make a choice thinking there is comfort in having made the right/best choice and then it's all bias from there. Don't get stuck there. You have time. It reminds me of the story of the man crossing a field and he come to a wall that is too tall to climb and too long to see either end. He stares for a while, and then tosses his hat over the wall. You will make your way over the wall and get your hat. We all do. What really helps is to complete your signature. It is a distillation of the facts as you know them written simply, like your chart. Seeing it in front of you on a regular basis without all the distractions of possibilites and unknowns that will swirl in your head helps to ground you with what you know. It also helps us help you keep grounded in the facts of what you know. You have already come a long way with detection and acknowledging you are a candidate for treatment. If you have any doubts, you are a candidate for treatment. The Gleason 4 + 3 is something you want to deal with. The next question is it's location. Your biopsy report will indicate the sample location. There can be more. PC is multifocal. Gleason 3 is a turtle, slow and passive. Eventually it can pose a risk to functions just from it's volume, but the general view is it can not survive outside the prostate. Gleason 4 is a rabbit, quick to multiply and move about. Gleason 5 is a bird. It flies. Gleason 3+3 or 6 is all turtles all the way down. Gleason 3+4 or 7 can act like 6 if the 4 is a small percentage, less than 3 - 5%. Gleason 4+3 is a 7 you want to treat. You can see how the combinations and increased risk grows with Gleason 8, 9, and 10. Gleason 8, 9, and 10 can often be assumed to have already left the barn in treatment considerations. If you see my signature, my biopsy was all graded G 6, but a large volume. Based on that, my age (young), and my PSA velocity I chose treament. Post pathology revealed it was really G 3+4 and a good amount. I'm glad I chose to treat it. It was up to no good. I am currently two years post surgery. My continence (back in 3 mos) and erectile function (back in slightly over 1 year) are 100%. My PSA is undetectable using an ultrasensitive test with a lower limit of <.02. I test every 6 months, see my surgeon once a year, and my plan is to see a RO for salvage radiation if it hits .03.",

      "Content": "That helps. It's a lot of cancer, and you are not a candidate for AS. Convention protocol is surgery for that volume and being young. Such volume at such an early age indicates an aggressive cancer despite the G6 score. It has begun its mischief early. This is a time game. You will be managing your treatment options across time to give you the best option to die of something else. Currently, when the journey begins, 50, 60, 70s, shifts your treatment options. You may consider a second opinion on the samples. A higher G score may impact your treatment options. This is common. It's a G6 that will ultimately cause problems, if not already, based just on volume and its early start. It can restrict your urethra, cause incontinence, compress erectile function nerve paths causing ED, push into the bladder and bowel disrupting their function, etc. I'd advise against picking treatment options at this time. It does reveal your bias against surgery and that is useful for you to know. Your bias is a negative aspect at this time. You will have to set it aside to be objective. Meet with the doctors for each option and develop your choice with information and professional input. In other words, keep an open mind. No treatment protoccol is without it's risks, and none has yet risen to the status of best protocol for every diagnosis. It's a sophisticated decision matrix based more on you and your cancer than personal preference. Major cancer centers make this process convenient with most protocals provided in house. Radiation side effects occur later. Your young age now puts dealing with these side effects into play if you choose radiation. Consider your family history and general health to objectively estimate your normal life expectancy. For example 65% of men with experience ED 5 years after radiation. Both radiation technology and surgery has improved, for different reasons, over the years. Current study outcomes lag behind this curve because of the time they take. My bias is confirmation bias. I am on a surgery first with radiation as follow up if necessary path. So far so good. One year post surgery and no recurrence. Fingers crossed. I take my next 6 month (18 total) PSA test in a month. Below is a basic outline of radiation options. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prosta...n-therapy.html",

      "Content": "Sorry you are here. You are getting \"some\" good advice from your doctors. Due to your young age and high PSA numbers for an extended period of time there is a possibility you have more aggressive cancer still undetected. The two cores that did hit cancer are significant percentages for only two samples of the 12 to hit cancer. I do not consider a range of 5.4 to 7.4 at your age \"stable.\" I question your urologist's letting it go so long without a more aggressive diagnosis effort. The key to beating this disease is early detection and your numbers call for an aggressive diagnosis protocol, imo. The standard 12 sample TRUS biopsy is a hit and miss (30% to as high as 50% false negative). When it finds cancer it is an efficient first line in office diagnosis tool, but it is not 100%. The larger your prostate the bigger the chance it may miss significant cancer. Younger men generally have smaller prostates so there is a better chance it will detect the cancer if it is present. However, you have had an elevated PSA for sometime indicating maybe a larger prostate. How big is your prostate? Also, in younger men, smaller more aggressive cancer can be harder to hit (reach) with the blind biopsy method. Although, I assume if the biopsy was not MRI guided it at least indicated areas for the doctor to try to sample manually. His skill then comes into play. If you are going to get an MRI a 3T MRI gives a much better report, and then it can be used to guide the biopsy sampling in real time. I question your urologist's rather casual attitude to your elevated numbers at your young age. There can always be another reason such as BHP, but you now have confirmed cancer making that possibility a low percentage play which I believe it always was. I like what I am hearing from the MO and RO. I am not so confident in your urologist and suggest you follow his advice for a second opinion from a urologist highly skilled in RP (radical prostatectomy) as your next step. I did not take this route, but from what I have learned you are well served by taking yourself to a cancer center with experience in prostate cancer. Your young age indicates this has a possibility of being something you want to deal with aggressively, especially during diagnosis and treatment planning. It places a burden on an inexperienced patient to manage a professional team of independent contractors. The cancer center takes an in-house team approach.",

      "Content": "That helps. It's a lot of cancer, and you are not a candidate for AS. Convention protocol is surgery for that volume and being young. Such volume at such an early age indicates an aggressive cancer despite the G6 score. It has begun its mischief early. This is a time game. You will be managing your treatment options across time to give you the best option to die of something else. Currently, when the journey begins, 50, 60, 70s, shifts your treatment options. You may consider a second opinion on the samples. A higher G score may impact your treatment options. This is common. It's a G6 that will ultimately cause problems, if not already, based just on volume and its early start. It can restrict your urethra, cause incontinence, compress erectile function nerve paths causing ED, push into the bladder and bowel disrupting their function, etc. I'd advise against picking treatment options at this time. It does reveal your bias against surgery and that is useful for you to know. Your bias is a negative aspect at this time. You will have to set it aside to be objective. Meet with the doctors for each option and develop your choice with information and professional input. In other words, keep an open mind. No treatment protoccol is without it's risks, and none has yet risen to the status of best protocol for every diagnosis. It's a sophisticated decision matrix based more on you and your cancer than personal preference. Major cancer centers make this process convenient with most protocals provided in house. Radiation side effects occur later. Your young age now puts dealing with these side effects into play if you choose radiation. Consider your family history and general health to objectively estimate your normal life expectancy. For example 65% of men with experience ED 5 years after radiation. Both radiation technology and surgery has improved, for different reasons, over the years. Current study outcomes lag behind this curve because of the time they take. My bias is confirmation bias. I am on a surgery first with radiation as follow up if necessary path. So far so good. One year post surgery and no recurrence. Fingers crossed. I take my next 6 month (18 total) PSA test in a month. Below is a basic outline of radiation options. https://www.cancer.org/cancer/prosta...n-therapy.html",

Your age, family history, physical condition, fitness, life expectancy, and PSA history all contribute to your treatment choice. We do not have this information in your signature. My experience so far has been a succesfull one with surgery. Continence and erection have all returned. These side effects are influenced most by the extent of the cancer discovered to be removed (difficult to know before hand and unavoidable) and the skill of the surgeon (just as hard to determine). I'd assume a large successfull cancer center will have less risk of a less than acceptable surgeon. They can also walk you through all the treatment options in one stop.",

Not so thrilled with your doctor's putting recurrence on the patient as an outcome of managing anxiety thereby inflammation thereby cancer. A little too new age for me. There is an emerging school of thought in genetics that DNA is more responsible for this than we know, and that DNA is more flexible and changing than fixed and slow to mutate. The trigger is stress and environment and occurs in the womb and during infant care. There are much higher rates of genetically responsible health issues in children suffering the stress of poverty. Long story short, worrying about your anxiety now (see what I did there) is closing the barn door after the horse is gone. He's right about the inflammation, imo, but the truth may be the die is cast much earliar, as is our tendency to be anxious.",

      "Content": "I have noticed incontinence begins to show up when I stop my kegel exercises. Continuing with these exercises, a few sets a day, seem to be critical maintenance. Two years out and alcohol, caffeine, and carbonated beverages still irritate the bladder and cause dribbles when I consume more than 1 drink of any of them. Very manageable. I have switched from coffee to green tea and it makes a difference. I no longer drink alcohol every day. Both practises seem appropriate for my age and diet. Beer is a double effect with both carbonation and alcohol. I have also noticed consuming bladder irritants can have an accumulating effect. If I drink them daily, within a week, I notice incontinence creeping back in. To keep from being discouraged consider the cancer, if untreated, will have caused more extreme incontinence than you are dealing with now. It is a multiprong approach; kegels, weight, and diet. Another risk is we are tempted to manage incontinence by drinking less. This leaves us dehydrated which weakens us. Try a diary for a few days to track your liquid through the day. You may be drinking less during the day and more in the evening than you think. Reality and perception often need accountability tools to bring them into alignment. What may be hiding is your incontinence progress is less than you think it is, but at 4 months it sounds pretty good. Our brains have a mind of their own and can not be trusted. What truly runs us is our word and integrity to it. It usually is a combination of things.",

I suspect genetic switches are turned on by heredity and environmental conditions prenatal to adulthood. For me, the first clue is BHP and prostate enlargement is the outcome of prostate cells living longer and not dieing at the same rate as they regenerate. Those are potentially genetic functions. Environment, such as diet, are certainly thought to be related to increase rates of PC, but it may be coincidental to good health habits in general.",

I do not consider a range of 5.4 to 7.4 at your age \"stable.\" I question your urologist's letting it go so long without a more aggressive diagnosis effort. The key to beating this disease is early detection and your numbers call for an aggressive diagnosis protocol, imo. The standard 12 sample TRUS biopsy is a hit and miss (30% to as high as 50% false negative). When it finds cancer it is an efficient first line in office diagnosis tool, but it is not 100%. The larger your prostate the bigger the chance it may miss significant cancer. Younger men generally have smaller prostates so there is a better chance it will detect the cancer if it is present. However, you have had an elevated PSA for sometime indicating maybe a larger prostate. How big is your prostate? Also, in younger men, smaller more aggressive cancer can be harder to hit (reach) with the blind biopsy method. Although, I assume if the biopsy was not MRI guided it at least indicated areas for the doctor to try to sample manually. His skill then comes into play. If you are going to get an MRI a 3T MRI gives a much better report, and then it can be used to guide the biopsy sampling in real time. I question your urologist's rather casual attitude to your elevated numbers at your young age. There can always be another reason such as BHP, but you now have confirmed cancer making that possibility a low percentage play which I believe it always was. I like what I am hearing from the MO and RO. I am not so confident in your urologist and suggest you follow his advice for a second opinion from a urologist highly skilled in RP (radical prostatectomy) as your next step. I did not take this route, but from what I have learned you are well served by taking yourself to a cancer center with experience in prostate cancer. Your young age indicates this has a possibility of being something you want to deal with aggressively, especially during diagnosis and treatment planning. It places a burden on an inexperienced patient to manage a professional team of independent contractors. The cancer center takes an in-house team approach.",

Your brother in law may not have heard what was said correctly. I expect a different set of words came out of the doctor's mouth than got reported back home. An annual physical is critical for the aging if just for the essentials; blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, preventable and treatable cancer screening such as skin, colon and prostate, then there is diabetes, liver and kidney function, glaucoma, eyesight, dental, etc. What you have learned about your brother in law is he has an unworkable relationship with his healthcare. I doubt any provider at Mayo ever told him what he said, and if they did, those who care about him including himself know better than to believe such a statement. Someone should accompany your brother in law on all future healthcare visits and exams. Your brother in law's current preventable life crisis is proof of the folly of his story. This is not personal, but shining the light on how the mind fails us, if we let it, when we most need it. Or we blame others, some person at Mayo, for our own choices. Even if he was told such a thing, it is surprisingly bad advice to take. I go on about this because the first thing for him and those around him to getting back on track caring for himself is to accept responsibility for his situation and not blame Mayo or his own good health for failing to care for it. Here is the really astounding thing. We all do it, and when we step over the obvious we know we are doing it. Still, we do it. Just as importantly, don't let him blame himself. Blame doesn't work. What has been learned is he can not be trusted with his own healthcare. He needs those close to him to help keep his head clear. Are there signs of dementia or depression to explain his lack of self care?",

No, any advantage of faster healing is out-weighed by more years of living with life-altering side effects. http://www.europeanurology.com/artic...693-0/fulltext The study says something different. It studied only satisfaction with erectile recovery. A similar study for incontinence will be interesting and for BCR. The study supports AS, but not broadly as your statement implies, only as it applies to erectile recovery and as it applies to perception in younger men. I support AS as a rigouros program that chooses treatment at the most effective time for the best outcome. Early detection and treatment produces the best outcome for life threatening forms of this disease, imo. I waited too long in ignorance and denial. I am disappointed with my erectile recovery, but find it servicable after one year. I put the responsibility for that on the disease, not the state of medicine or my choice when to act. In hindsight and knowledge I would have acted two years earliar to improve my overall outcomes and anxiety over BCR as a quality of life issue now from waiting too long then. More studies are in order, I'm sure they are coming, that support not treating non life threatening cancers. What drives the choice for me still ranks it; life, bladder control, erections.",

Your most serious considerations in choice of treatment is the G4 at the base and your age. This puts you in a higher risk group. G4 can move out quickly and the presence at the base adjacent to the seminal vesicle, a higher risk pathway, is an unfavorable finding. To your age, it has an early start indicating a more aggressive disease. Your PSA velocity and your volume are also important indicators. Surgery is an effective way to excise the cancer in a critical location and provide the pathology to determine it's extent and grading at the base and the best chance at determining if the treatment got it all There is always the risk of recurrence with G4 or higher. Surgery keeps radiation as a follow up option. You have done well to catch it and the TRUS biopsy worked. However, you report a clean bill of health with a 3T MRI in Feb. It missed it which is troubling and seems common enough with this new technology. The cancer you detected with the biopsy was there at the time of the first MRI. It was also of a large enough volume and risk to make that miss a concern for others. Again, PSA was the reliable test. I am begininng to come to the realization that currently a 3T MRI is not yet the diagnostic tool that will replace the PSA test. You are very fortunate to have detected it and have a good shot at a \"cure.\" Cure is used loosely with prostate cancer and always has a time limit to it, 5 years, ten years, etc. Whatever treatment path you choose will include ongoing PSA testing for possible recurrence. Your final pathology will be a better predictor of the odds. In general it's around 30%. Your team's challenge is to stop the G4 from moving north. The prostate terminology is reverse of what we'd think. The prostate base is towards our head and the apex is towards our feet.",

      "Content": "Yes. There is a courtesy to the doctor delay and a portal data update delay. Someone in the docs office should be able to request the data update not be delayed. Still may take a few days. After my latest go around with the doctor's office and Quest the retest updated immediately. They have the capability. I suspect someone at the Lab has to make the effort to change preferences at the request of the doctor. My doctor likes to make that early morning call with the results. As a standard of practise it's understandable at critically milestones, but for ongoing monitoring of an informed patient it makes no sense. If this is your first true post RP PSA I understand his desire to deliver the news personally. They may be some coaching he wants to add to the news. I have been impressed with his management of you.

      "Content": "You are a candidate for treatment. Beware of treatment bias. Your age and cancer location and grade make you a better candidate for surgery, imo. You are not a candidate for AS. Your most serious considerations in choice of treatment is the G4 at the base and your age. This puts you in a higher risk group. G4 can move out quickly and the presence at the base adjacent to the seminal vesicle, a higher risk pathway, is an unfavorable finding. To your age, it has an early start indicating a more aggressive disease. Your PSA velocity and your volume are also important indicators. Surgery is an effective way to excise the cancer in a critical location and provide the pathology to determine it's extent and grading at the base and the best chance at determining if the treatment got it all There is always the risk of recurrence with G4 or higher. Surgery keeps radiation as a follow up option. You have done well to catch it and the TRUS biopsy worked. However, you report a clean bill of health with a 3T MRI in Feb. It missed it which is troubling and seems common enough with this new technology. The cancer you detected with the biopsy was there at the time of the first MRI. It was also of a large enough volume and risk to make that miss a concern for others. Again, PSA was the reliable test. I am begininng to come to the realization that currently a 3T MRI is not yet the diagnostic tool that will replace the PSA test. You are very fortunate to have detected it and have a good shot at a \"cure.\" Cure is used loosely with prostate cancer and always has a time limit to it, 5 years, ten years, etc. Whatever treatment path you choose will include ongoing PSA testing for possible recurrence. Your final pathology will be a better predictor of the odds. In general it's around 30%. Your team's challenge is to stop the G4 from moving north. The prostate terminology is reverse of what we'd think. The prostate base is towards our head and the apex is towards our feet.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Konna Thank you so much for your replies. It helps a great deal just knowing you're not alone. My father's prostate gland is showed to be just lightly enlarged, just over 40cc. I do not know yet the exact percentage of the cores or if there are any \"4\" in there, because our urologist talked to me via phone and just told me that the cancer's gleason score is a 6.we have an appointment on Thursday to discuss it thoroughly. When I know something more I will inform you. What worries me the most right now is that extremely rapid rise of the psa in just two weeks! From 27 to 43!! Our urologist said that he has never seen it before and I think that also doesn't stick to that gleason score of 6. Excuse any grammatical etc mistakes, I am from Greece. Thank you again for sharing your stories with me and for your advises and optimism which is so important for me right now. Sorry, my mistake on the question about the percentage of G4. From my own experience, just the way it seems to be acting makes me suspicious of the G6 grading. If you're in Greece the second opinion from Hopkins is probably out. Can you find a highly regarded labaoratory with lots of PC experience to give a second opinion on the Gleason grading?",

      "Content": "Just to reinforce, all other indications must indicate the need for a biopsy or the doctor would not be ordering a MRI (age, family history, urinary symptoms, DRE, and PSA). The MRI only adds to the information already exsiting to support a biopsy, or it doesn't. If the MRI does show something then the doctor will add extra biopsy samples in the area shown as possible by the MRI. A standard 12 core array is usually done in addition to additional samples in the areas suggested by the MRI. MRIs are NOT conclusive, only helpful. It is an emerging technology for this use. They can be helpful if there is possibly a serious cancer that may be hard to reach with a biopsy. Even if the MRI shows nothing a biopsy is most likely in order or the MRI would not have been ordered. In most cases, an MRI is not ordered unless a first biopsy was negative and all other more reliable indicators call for a biopsy. Only a biopsy can detect cancer. Even biopsies can have a surprising significant false negative. An MRI, at this time, can only suggest a possiblity of cancer in any specific place wihtin the prostate. Prostate cancer is multifocal and can be hard to sample. It's not like it's a single mass easily hit with a needle.",

      "Content": "Hahaha! She's having too much fun at work. I'll bet she's got that move down. Not so thrilled with your doctor's putting recurrence on the patient as an outcome of managing anxiety thereby inflammation thereby cancer. A little too new age for me. There is an emerging school of thought in genetics that DNA is more responsible for this than we know, and that DNA is more flexible and changing than fixed and slow to mutate. The trigger is stress and environment and occurs in the womb and during infant care. There are much higher rates of genetically responsible health issues in children suffering the stress of poverty. Long story short, worrying about your anxiety now (see what I did there) is closing the barn door after the horse is gone. He's right about the inflammation, imo, but the truth may be the die is cast much earliar, as is our tendency to be anxious.",

      "Content": "First things first. I can not imagine any competent health system suggesting a man in his 60s does not need annual PSA screening, or worse, no annual physical. Your brother in law may not have heard what was said correctly. I expect a different set of words came out of the doctor's mouth than got reported back home. An annual physical is critical for the aging if just for the essentials; blood pressure, cholesterol, weight, preventable and treatable cancer screening such as skin, colon and prostate, then there is diabetes, liver and kidney function, glaucoma, eyesight, dental, etc. What you have learned about your brother in law is he has an unworkable relationship with his healthcare. I doubt any provider at Mayo ever told him what he said, and if they did, those who care about him including himself know better than to believe such a statement. Someone should accompany your brother in law on all future healthcare visits and exams. Your brother in law's current preventable life crisis is proof of the folly of his story. This is not personal, but shining the light on how the mind fails us, if we let it, when we most need it. Or we blame others, some person at Mayo, for our own choices. Even if he was told such a thing, it is surprisingly bad advice to take. I go on about this because the first thing for him and those around him to getting back on track caring for himself is to accept responsibility for his situation and not blame Mayo or his own good health for failing to care for it. Here is the really astounding thing. We all do it, and when we step over the obvious we know we are doing it. Still, we do it. Just as importantly, don't let him blame himself. Blame doesn't work. What has been learned is he can not be trusted with his own healthcare. He needs those close to him to help keep his head clear. Are there signs of dementia or depression to explain his lack of self care?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Konna Thank you so much for your replies. It helps a great deal just knowing you're not alone. My father's prostate gland is showed to be just lightly enlarged, just over 40cc. I do not know yet the exact percentage of the cores or if there are any \"4\" in there, because our urologist talked to me via phone and just told me that the cancer's gleason score is a 6.we have an appointment on Thursday to discuss it thoroughly. When I know something more I will inform you. What worries me the most right now is that extremely rapid rise of the psa in just two weeks! From 27 to 43!! Our urologist said that he has never seen it before and I think that also doesn't stick to that gleason score of 6. Excuse any grammatical etc mistakes, I am from Greece. Thank you again for sharing your stories with me and for your advises and optimism which is so important for me right now. Sorry, my mistake on the question about the percentage of G4. From my own experience, just the way it seems to be acting makes me suspicious of the G6 grading. If you're in Greece the second opinion from Hopkins is probably out. Can you find a highly regarded labaoratory with lots of PC experience to give a second opinion on the Gleason grading?",

      "Content": "I had this experience and erection recovery still took a full year. I consider it a good sign, but not proof of potential recovery. The nerves that control the valves that hold the blood in the erect penis are the ones traumatized by treatment. Blood still flows easily into the penis and even physical straining or pushing downward, as in a bowel movement, can begin to engorge the penis. It's not proof you can keep it there. The nerves that are responsible for orgasm are not effected by the surgery. Sexual excitement and orgasm are still functioning. You can achieve orgasm without an erection. I suggest you learn how to manipulate an orgasm without an erection as part of your recovery therapy, and do it often. I found standing during masturbation helped to keep blood in the penis. Massaging blood into the penis during masturbation is possible. Everything helps during recovery. My doctor prescribed Cialis, 5mg (small dosage) 2-3x a week to encourage blood flow during recovery. And intentionally not more often or larger doses unless attempting sex. Much like ice and heat on a sprain, the idea is to pulse the blood through the region for best healing therapy. Nerve tissue can be traumatized simply by the heat generated and trapped by the cauterization tool used in the surgical cavity. Nerve tissue takes much longer to heal/recover than other tissue. Nerves do have the capacity to regenerate. Do not be discouraged. Be patient. Love is patient.",

This is done often and in your father's case may make a difference. I suggest you complete a signature here for your father and keep it and us updated.

Still may take a few days. After my latest go around with the doctor's office and Quest the retest updated immediately. They have the capability. I suspect someone at the Lab has to make the effort to change preferences at the request of the doctor. My doctor likes to make that early morning call with the results. As a standard of practise it's understandable at critically milestones, but for ongoing monitoring of an informed patient it makes no sense. If this is your first true post RP PSA I understand his desire to deliver the news personally. They may be some coaching he wants to add to the news. I have been impressed with his management of you.

Your litmus test is your own emotions. If you find yourself becoming annoyed or frustrated with his behavior take a break. This is his end game and most of us live it as we have lived our lives. Expecting him to transform his view of life from one of blame (source of his anger and justification for his depression) to one of acceptance and the access to peace it provides will only be a source of upset for you. Give him his space, more for you than him. Medically, options for him are limited and do not require much from you other than helpful support/companionship. Support groups may be helpful if he's open to working on his head. It is what can make a difference in his quality of life. Don't expect it. Hold it always as a possibility for him. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. On the medical side, antidepressants work, but once again he has to accept it as a condition he wants to deal with. Denial and delay are common ways of being as evidenced by his current physical and emotional health. Inside depression it is a self fulfilling swirl downward. Depression is also contagious. Think of it as the common cold of mental health. We all experience it periodically and it is shortlived. For chronic cases, such as his, look out for yourself first. This is the part of prostate cancer that doesn't get much play. The news is there are standard protocol treatments for this phase.",

      "Content": "It takes decades sometimes a lifetime to develop cancer. As already stated above, when I asked if it was environment or genetics the doctor said yes. Recent studies indicate DNA contributing to disease is more prevalent than first thought. And environment in the womb and early childhood contributes more to disease causing shifts in our DNA than first thought. DNA switches/shifts/triggers happen much quicker and more often than we first thought. It may well be your mother's DNA and life habits during your fertilization, gestation and infancy that turns on the future cancer switch. That can not be reversed. It is set in your DNA. Degrading cellular DNA is the source of BHP. Prostate cells no longer die at the same rate as we age. They live longer causing the prostate to enlarge. Something similar may be at the root of PC. Degrading DNA is the root of all aging and its maladies.",

      "Content": "Damn - that sucks! I have no experience with AUS. I do have experience with being disconnected from my wife and thinking she's not quite there, and certainly not in the game. It's a lonely place. Sounds like you've been carrying the ball. Best advice I can give for that situation is keep oil on the water. Doesn't sound like something you can fix. In fact, there's peace in accepting it doesn't need fixing. It's just the way it is. The support group sounds like a very good idea. Maybe it doesn't have to be cancer related. I have a group of buddies, anywhere from 2 to 4, and we meet once a week every Thursday, same time, different place mostly but we have some regular haunts, for drinks and dinner. The only thing we have in common is we know each other and we have all been divorced. We call it the HMWHC. It's not that we hate women. It's a reverse mantra to remind us we do love them, just hard to live with sometimes. Maybe most of the time for the less fortunate. It began with supporting a guy who just loss his wife and getting him out of the house. It's a different cast of characters now, but what I did learn was how valuable it is to me to have a steady and regular time with some bros. No agenda, just get together once a week for a few hours and be with each other. When the first group began to disband, and it happens, I worked to put another one together, and it's still going. Funny thing, I was single at the time, and women thought it was pretty hot. They get it and hang together a lot. Men not so much. My current partner encourages it. She sees what it does for me, and it makes me easier to be around and attractive! Seems to be a universal woman magnet to have some independence. I read most of what is on these sites, and participate when I have experience. Sometimes it seems like we're tapping on bars communicating between cells in solitary confinement because we never meet each other, but it works. I'd say what you are doing with this post is what I call clearing. You may be angry and venting, but anger doesn't work. Almost all the time it works just to be able to say what's so to someone. Not to fix it, but just to clear it out. You can always do that here. I'll listen.",

      "Content": "Remove the prostate and hope you're not to late. It is the source of anxiety, much medical risk, and nothing but bad news. I'm surprised it hasn't been recommended sooner. I suspect it has. Like an appendix and tonsils it serves no useful purpose at his age. Sadly, poorly performed prostatectomies have created an over reaction that borders on hysteria against removal of the gland that is the source of nothing but trouble in older men. Cancer is not the only valid reason to consider its removal. The younger you are the better your recovery in all categories. Maybe we can help ease concerns if you have been resisting this. Removal of the prostate is only complicated by the presence of cancer. Without the risk of cancer you have only to deal with the risk of incontinence and ED. Cancer may be the inevitable outcome of his BHP. Remove the prostate and you remove the risk. The other possibility is a small but aggressive cancer has metastized. If that's the case you deal with it as it develops, and it may be very manageable. In the mean time you have helped yourself prepare for that scenario by removing a disabling urinary disorder while your are still healthy and able. One last possibility that may complicate a removal. Is there cancer in the bladder?",

      "Content": "Damn - that sucks! I have no experience with AUS. I do have experience with being disconnected from my wife and thinking she's not quite there, and certainly not in the game. It's a lonely place. Sounds like you've been carrying the ball. Best advice I can give for that situation is keep oil on the water. Doesn't sound like something you can fix. In fact, there's peace in accepting it doesn't need fixing. It's just the way it is. The support group sounds like a very good idea. Maybe it doesn't have to be cancer related. I have a group of buddies, anywhere from 2 to 4, and we meet once a week every Thursday, same time, different place mostly but we have some regular haunts, for drinks and dinner. The only thing we have in common is we know each other and we have all been divorced. We call it the HMWHC. It's not that we hate women. It's a reverse mantra to remind us we do love them, just hard to live with sometimes. Maybe most of the time for the less fortunate. It began with supporting a guy who just loss his wife and getting him out of the house. It's a different cast of characters now, but what I did learn was how valuable it is to me to have a steady and regular time with some bros. No agenda, just get together once a week for a few hours and be with each other. When the first group began to disband, and it happens, I worked to put another one together, and it's still going. Funny thing, I was single at the time, and women thought it was pretty hot. They get it and hang together a lot. Men not so much. My current partner encourages it. She sees what it does for me, and it makes me easier to be around and attractive! Seems to be a universal woman magnet to have some independence. I read most of what is on these sites, and participate when I have experience. Sometimes it seems like we're tapping on bars communicating between cells in solitary confinement because we never meet each other, but it works. I'd say what you are doing with this post is what I call clearing. You may be angry and venting, but anger doesn't work. Almost all the time it works just to be able to say what's so to someone. Not to fix it, but just to clear it out. You can always do that here. I'll listen.",

      "Content": "You're wise to acknowledge his primary personality. If you accept it without judgment it will allow you to be with him without being hooked by his depression and anger. Your litmus test is your own emotions. If you find yourself becoming annoyed or frustrated with his behavior take a break. This is his end game and most of us live it as we have lived our lives. Expecting him to transform his view of life from one of blame (source of his anger and justification for his depression) to one of acceptance and the access to peace it provides will only be a source of upset for you. Give him his space, more for you than him. Medically, options for him are limited and do not require much from you other than helpful support/companionship. Support groups may be helpful if he's open to working on his head. It is what can make a difference in his quality of life. Don't expect it. Hold it always as a possibility for him. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. On the medical side, antidepressants work, but once again he has to accept it as a condition he wants to deal with. Denial and delay are common ways of being as evidenced by his current physical and emotional health. Inside depression it is a self fulfilling swirl downward. Depression is also contagious. Think of it as the common cold of mental health. We all experience it periodically and it is shortlived. For chronic cases, such as his, look out for yourself first. This is the part of prostate cancer that doesn't get much play. The news is there are standard protocol treatments for this phase.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Terry's Cellar It's my understanding that the post radiation tissue left behind is no longer like the original prostate tissue before radiation and that it is very unlikely to promote new Pcs. I know mine currently does not produce normal ejaculate. What I produce now may come from the Cowpers gland. Every study I looked at showed the recurrence rate for RT was equal to RP. A lot of the studies actually gave the success edge to high dose radiation treatments like SBRT and HDBT. There is little question in my mind from follobywing a couple of different forums that I see far more posts from the side effects of RP than RT. My surgeon said he could remove my prostate and the cancer. He said I could regain most of my urinary function in a year at so. He said most guys respond pretty well to medications that help with erections. He did not say I should expect penile shortening or mention I might ejaculate some urine during climax if I could achieve an erection. I took my chances with radiation and have no regrets. The studies I investigated including Dr. Kings 10 year results suggest that any future ED is only equal to that of untreated men. For me I found little value in a post surgical pathology of my prostate when weighed against the quality of life issues surgery presented. Just my two cents. No argument here. We're both satisfied. The next conversation is in 5 years.",

If you had any adverse conditions in your surgery pathology which includes never being undetectable after surgery, best outcomes for follow up radiation indicate the sooner the better.

      "Content": "That works for me. With my prostate gone any improvements in radiation will also benefit me in salvage treatments. The one aspect of radiation that still concerns me is \"healthy\" prostate cancer cells are left behind. These are the same \"healthy\" cells that produced the cancers that started the whole thing. I see radiation as kicking the can down the road and it seems for most men it kicks it far enough. For me, I'm satisfied my prostate is gone, but that could just be my justification bias and having survived the potential side effects. Just a note, 65% of men using radiation treatments will have ED in 5 years. Side effects are real regardless of treatment choice. Breast cancer which is a similar disease, common, well researched, and many forms of treatment still relies on surgery to remove the source of the cancer, breast cells. Still, it recurrs. Albeit a much larger gland. I agree that finding more convenient and less obtrusive forms of treatment is the future. I think the doctor, if the quotes are accurate, is being optomistic.",

      "Content": "That works for me. With my prostate gone any improvements in radiation will also benefit me in salvage treatments. The one aspect of radiation that still concerns me is \"healthy\" prostate cancer cells are left behind. These are the same \"healthy\" cells that produced the cancers that started the whole thing. I see radiation as kicking the can down the road and it seems for most men it kicks it far enough. For me, I'm satisfied my prostate is gone, but that could just be my justification bias and having survived the potential side effects. Just a note, 65% of men using radiation treatments will have ED in 5 years. Side effects are real regardless of treatment choice. Breast cancer which is a similar disease, common, well researched, and many forms of treatment still relies on surgery to remove the source of the cancer, breast cells. Still, it recurrs. Albeit a much larger gland. I agree that finding more convenient and less obtrusive forms of treatment is the future. I think the doctor, if the quotes are accurate, is being optomistic.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Terry's Cellar It's my understanding that the post radiation tissue left behind is no longer like the original prostate tissue before radiation and that it is very unlikely to promote new Pcs. I know mine currently does not produce normal ejaculate. What I produce now may come from the Cowpers gland. Every study I looked at showed the recurrence rate for RT was equal to RP. A lot of the studies actually gave the success edge to high dose radiation treatments like SBRT and HDBT. There is little question in my mind from follobywing a couple of different forums that I see far more posts from the side effects of RP than RT. My surgeon said he could remove my prostate and the cancer. He said I could regain most of my urinary function in a year at so. He said most guys respond pretty well to medications that help with erections. He did not say I should expect penile shortening or mention I might ejaculate some urine during climax if I could achieve an erection. I took my chances with radiation and have no regrets. The studies I investigated including Dr. Kings 10 year results suggest that any future ED is only equal to that of untreated men. For me I found little value in a post surgical pathology of my prostate when weighed against the quality of life issues surgery presented. Just my two cents. No argument here. We're both satisfied. The next conversation is in 5 years.",

      "Content": "Remove the prostate and hope you're not to late. It is the source of anxiety, much medical risk, and nothing but bad news. I'm surprised it hasn't been recommended sooner. I suspect it has. Like an appendix and tonsils it serves no useful purpose at his age. Sadly, poorly performed prostatectomies have created an over reaction that borders on hysteria against removal of the gland that is the source of nothing but trouble in older men. Cancer is not the only valid reason to consider its removal. The younger you are the better your recovery in all categories. Maybe we can help ease concerns if you have been resisting this. Removal of the prostate is only complicated by the presence of cancer. Without the risk of cancer you have only to deal with the risk of incontinence and ED. Cancer may be the inevitable outcome of his BHP. Remove the prostate and you remove the risk. The other possibility is a small but aggressive cancer has metastized. If that's the case you deal with it as it develops, and it may be very manageable. In the mean time you have helped yourself prepare for that scenario by removing a disabling urinary disorder while your are still healthy and able. One last possibility that may complicate a removal. Is there cancer in the bladder?",

It is important to not take it daily so it surges. Similar to ice and heat therapy on a muscle injury. The alternating heat and cold expands and contracts the blood flow pumping blood through the site.",

If you have reason to want to measure your PSA with a more sensitive test you will have to ask.

      "Content": "It takes decades sometimes a lifetime to develop cancer. As already stated above, when I asked if it was environment or genetics the doctor said yes. Recent studies indicate DNA contributing to disease is more prevalent than first thought. And environment in the womb and early childhood contributes more to disease causing shifts in our DNA than first thought. DNA switches/shifts/triggers happen much quicker and more often than we first thought. It may well be your mother's DNA and life habits during your fertilization, gestation and infancy that turns on the future cancer switch. That can not be reversed. It is set in your DNA. Degrading cellular DNA is the source of BHP. Prostate cells no longer die at the same rate as we age. They live longer causing the prostate to enlarge. Something similar may be at the root of PC. Degrading DNA is the root of all aging and its maladies.",

      "Content": "I will add to your question. Are these clear 4s and clear 3s, or do they exist on a scale? Some 3s are closer to 4s and some 4s are closer to 3s. I suspect there are gradients. There are high and low grades within the classifications resulting in different multiplication rates across the spectrum. As mentioned, I suspect the grades are tied to measured outcomes to accomodate statistical forecasting. In the end a 3+4 is more risk than a 3+3 with a larger jump to 4+3. Think of it as multiplying rates being exponential functions. A small shift results in a much larger reproduction number on an exponential curve. And your prostate is probably producing them at a fixed rate, i.e. 10 - 3s to 1 - 4 etc, etc, etc, while a prostate that is producing more primary 4s is producing them at a faster rate than primary 3s and secondary 4s being produced in another prostate. And the 4s are reproducing faster than the 3s. 5s are birds, 4s are rabbits, 3s are sloths.",

It appears to be making note of the drug's effects on suppressing testosterone and subsequent potential effect on prostate cells being worthy of study. This has been known for some time and as only a slight effect. Modern hormone therapy is much more effective in suppressing testosterone. I am not hopeful of the use of cannabis being proven useful anytime soon for PC. I recommend researching clinical trials you may qualify for if you have exhausted conventional therapies.

If you had any adverse conditions in your surgery pathology which includes never being undetectable after surgery, best outcomes for follow up radiation indicate the sooner the better.

Cured, as a term, in prostate cancer is always based on time, 5 yrs, 10 yrs, imo. If I were you, I'd test every 6 months and use an ultasensitive format. I hear that's typically not Hopkins way, but you can insist. I want to be cured. I've done what I can to be cured. Only time will tell, imo.",

      "Content": "I will add to your question. Are these clear 4s and clear 3s, or do they exist on a scale? Some 3s are closer to 4s and some 4s are closer to 3s. I suspect there are gradients. There are high and low grades within the classifications resulting in different multiplication rates across the spectrum. As mentioned, I suspect the grades are tied to measured outcomes to accomodate statistical forecasting. In the end a 3+4 is more risk than a 3+3 with a larger jump to 4+3. Think of it as multiplying rates being exponential functions. A small shift results in a much larger reproduction number on an exponential curve. And your prostate is probably producing them at a fixed rate, i.e. 10 - 3s to 1 - 4 etc, etc, etc, while a prostate that is producing more primary 4s is producing them at a faster rate than primary 3s and secondary 4s being produced in another prostate. And the 4s are reproducing faster than the 3s. 5s are birds, 4s are rabbits, 3s are sloths.",

      "Content": "\"Healthy\" prostate cells are producing prostate cancer cells. Healthy prostate cells grow and die on a DNA schedule to maintain a healthy prostate. As we get older, some of us have prostate cells that begin to live longer causing our prostates to enlarge and create problems. This is thought to be separate from cancer, but it is a shift in DNA performance. There is a shift in cell DNA that causes a normal cell to produce a cancer cell. Old age is another shift in DNA performance. Our DNA eventually starts to wear out or degrade. If we can sort this out we may have a means for immortality. Cancer is a chicken and the egg question. Which comes first? There is an answer. The egg comes first. Any mutation or change in the DNA is created first in the egg. So, a new breed of chicken or change in any way is first manifested in the egg or the birth of a new cell. A new chicken comes first through the egg. Cancer is essentially an act of cell generation. Back to prostate cancer. Usually cancer cells are produced by an individual prostate within a close grouping; 3s and 4s, 4s and 3s, 4s and 5s, etc. Rarely, you see a third; 3s and 4s with some 5s. Once generated a prostate cancer cell will continue to replicate itself as a cancer cell and at a faster rate than it dies (if it does die). This is what causes cancer to \"grow\". A good question is will the remaining \"healthy\" cells continue to add fuel to the fire by continuing to manufacture new cancer cells as the older cancer cells continue to multiply. Cancer growth is exponential, and most are predatory. They go off the reservation consuming other resources. Finally, will radiation kill both prostate cancer cells and the \"healthy\" cells that are producing them? This brings me back to the question for your doctor. If radiation kills the cancer cells and leaves the \"healthy\" cells, what keeps those reamaining healthy cells from starting all over again and continue to produce cancer cells as they first did. I believe they do, however, prostate cancer is slow growing and resetting the clock with treatment buys you the time you need to die of something else. The dilemma in surgery is some cells, healthy or cancerous, may be left behind to reset the clock. So, it then becomes which process suits you best. Each has pros and cons based on the individual statistics of the cancer and you. The more aggressive the cancer the less time time you have after resetting the clock. The older you are the less it matters.",

He did an open surgery due to RP although he gave me the choice of open or laparoscopic. He said there can be a lot of scar tissue in the area after RP. He also repaired a navel hernia that developed after a varacosele laparoscopic surgery decades ago that used the navel for a port. I'm good to go for another couple of decades.",

They diagnosed it officially with an ultrasound. Doc said I could wait till after a vacation I planned, or longer if I wanted. I opted to take care of it immediately. Went on vacation one week after surgery. My girlfriend carried (rolled) my bags for me. Less to worry about. I travel some for pleasure and don't like the idea of it maybe acting up when I'm on the road or later when I'm older and not so surgery capable. Recovery was easy with some lifting restrictions for two weeks. Four weeks back to normal. One day off off from my desk job. One of the most common surgeries. I have mesh and it seems very stable.

In other words, if your urologist is not capable/knowledgable of monitoring your PSA post CK treatment, who is? Are you left to yourself with this task and making follow up contact? Since this is a relatively new treatment method you'd think they'd be all over it for their data. I am very curious, your cancer seems to be aggressive for the treatment you have chosen. What were the statistics for success quoted to you for your profile? I may be wrong, but you may be our forum's first CK patient. At least, that I can recall",

      "Content": "Inflammation and infection are not the same. Both affect PSA. Certain activities can increase PSA short term, exertion, sexual activity, stimulation of the prostate itself including biking, or a DRE prior to testing. Drugs, diet, and supplements can also lower your PSA including some BHP drugs. A 7 is still high. Investgate until you are certain of the cause. A reliable PSA number is invaluable if diagnosing for cancer. Avoid attempts to manipulate it thinking your reducing your risk of cancer until you are certain of the cause. Regardless of anomalies a steady rise over time is a possible indicator of cancer. Therfore establish a reliable baseline and monitor it over time. A reliable PSA history is a useful tool for men not unlike BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, blood sugar, liver and kidney functions tests. There are additional blood tests that add to the PSA such as free PSA that increase the value of the test.",

      "Content": "\"Healthy\" prostate cells are producing prostate cancer cells. Healthy prostate cells grow and die on a DNA schedule to maintain a healthy prostate. As we get older, some of us have prostate cells that begin to live longer causing our prostates to enlarge and create problems. This is thought to be separate from cancer, but it is a shift in DNA performance. There is a shift in cell DNA that causes a normal cell to produce a cancer cell. Old age is another shift in DNA performance. Our DNA eventually starts to wear out or degrade. If we can sort this out we may have a means for immortality. Cancer is a chicken and the egg question. Which comes first? There is an answer. The egg comes first. Any mutation or change in the DNA is created first in the egg. So, a new breed of chicken or change in any way is first manifested in the egg or the birth of a new cell. A new chicken comes first through the egg. Cancer is essentially an act of cell generation. Back to prostate cancer. Usually cancer cells are produced by an individual prostate within a close grouping; 3s and 4s, 4s and 3s, 4s and 5s, etc. Rarely, you see a third; 3s and 4s with some 5s. Once generated a prostate cancer cell will continue to replicate itself as a cancer cell and at a faster rate than it dies (if it does die). This is what causes cancer to \"grow\". A good question is will the remaining \"healthy\" cells continue to add fuel to the fire by continuing to manufacture new cancer cells as the older cancer cells continue to multiply. Cancer growth is exponential, and most are predatory. They go off the reservation consuming other resources. Finally, will radiation kill both prostate cancer cells and the \"healthy\" cells that are producing them? This brings me back to the question for your doctor. If radiation kills the cancer cells and leaves the \"healthy\" cells, what keeps those reamaining healthy cells from starting all over again and continue to produce cancer cells as they first did. I believe they do, however, prostate cancer is slow growing and resetting the clock with treatment buys you the time you need to die of something else. The dilemma in surgery is some cells, healthy or cancerous, may be left behind to reset the clock. So, it then becomes which process suits you best. Each has pros and cons based on the individual statistics of the cancer and you. The more aggressive the cancer the less time time you have after resetting the clock. The older you are the less it matters.",

A percentage of men will remain on AS because their cancer is indolent and not life threatening. For most, it is acceptance of constant vigilance until death from another way appears on the horizon or treatment becomes the path. It is this acceptance that brings peace.

      "Content": "I will add to your question. Are these clear 4s and clear 3s, or do they exist on a scale? Some 3s are closer to 4s and some 4s are closer to 3s. I suspect there are gradients. There are high and low grades within the classifications resulting in different multiplication rates across the spectrum. As mentioned, I suspect the grades are tied to measured outcomes to accomodate statistical forecasting. In the end a 3+4 is more risk than a 3+3 with a larger jump to 4+3. Think of it as multiplying rates being exponential functions. A small shift results in a much larger reproduction number on an exponential curve. And your prostate is probably producing them at a fixed rate, i.e. 10 - 3s to 1 - 4 etc, etc, etc, while a prostate that is producing more primary 4s is producing them at a faster rate than primary 3s and secondary 4s being produced in another prostate. And the 4s are reproducing faster than the 3s. 5s are birds, 4s are rabbits, 3s are sloths.",

      "Content": "\"Healthy\" prostate cells are producing prostate cancer cells. Healthy prostate cells grow and die on a DNA schedule to maintain a healthy prostate. As we get older, some of us have prostate cells that begin to live longer causing our prostates to enlarge and create problems. This is thought to be separate from cancer, but it is a shift in DNA performance. There is a shift in cell DNA that causes a normal cell to produce a cancer cell. Old age is another shift in DNA performance. Our DNA eventually starts to wear out or degrade. If we can sort this out we may have a means for immortality. Cancer is a chicken and the egg question. Which comes first? There is an answer. The egg comes first. Any mutation or change in the DNA is created first in the egg. So, a new breed of chicken or change in any way is first manifested in the egg or the birth of a new cell. A new chicken comes first through the egg. Cancer is essentially an act of cell generation. Back to prostate cancer. Usually cancer cells are produced by an individual prostate within a close grouping; 3s and 4s, 4s and 3s, 4s and 5s, etc. Rarely, you see a third; 3s and 4s with some 5s. Once generated a prostate cancer cell will continue to replicate itself as a cancer cell and at a faster rate than it dies (if it does die). This is what causes cancer to \"grow\". A good question is will the remaining \"healthy\" cells continue to add fuel to the fire by continuing to manufacture new cancer cells as the older cancer cells continue to multiply. Cancer growth is exponential, and most are predatory. They go off the reservation consuming other resources. Finally, will radiation kill both prostate cancer cells and the \"healthy\" cells that are producing them? This brings me back to the question for your doctor. If radiation kills the cancer cells and leaves the \"healthy\" cells, what keeps those reamaining healthy cells from starting all over again and continue to produce cancer cells as they first did. I believe they do, however, prostate cancer is slow growing and resetting the clock with treatment buys you the time you need to die of something else. The dilemma in surgery is some cells, healthy or cancerous, may be left behind to reset the clock. So, it then becomes which process suits you best. Each has pros and cons based on the individual statistics of the cancer and you. The more aggressive the cancer the less time time you have after resetting the clock. The older you are the less it matters.",

      "Content": "It may be the beginning of bladder spasms. I hope it goes no further. The bladder is a muscle that contracts to expel urine. A spasm is like a charlie horse. At full strength I compare it to child birth contractions. For me, they were unstopable, random, and increased frequency with time. Not much they can do for them if they get worse. Keeping still tends to minimize them. Afterwards, my doctor referred to them as a sign of healing. May be the bladder trying to expel the catheter. What worked for me was to not resist/fight it by trying to relax it. It only makes it last longer. When it got bad for me I went with it. (Read it on the internet.) I pushed as if I was peeing hard, and pushed through the whole spasm. It was slightly less painful, but more importantly, shortened them. Isolate the pushing to pretending to urinate . Don't strain the whole area for obvious reasons. That's the best I got. Up till then I was working, and going out when necessary. Once they began and became frequent I spent the last two days on the couch. I would get up for them, bend over and grab something, and use breathing techniques. I hope this doesn't happen for you, and don't want to scare you. I just wished I had known about it first. It would have relieved anxiety about it. I did call the doctor's office and they confirmed it, said much doesn't help. I found pain medication didn't help very much and may irritate the bladder. Dealing with it also left me tired. It becomes a pain management experience. Having said all this, it could be something else so stay on top of it, and don't hesitate to call your doctor to confirm this for yourself, if you become concerned, if it becomes a continuos irritation, fever develops, or to ask for it to come out sooner. I see no reason for unnecessary pain just to manage an office schedule. It's a 5 minute procedure. This is the internet and not your doctor. Wishing you well. PS: they immediately became lighter after the catheter was removed and stopped within a day or two.",

In other words, if your urologist is not capable/knowledgable of monitoring your PSA post CK treatment, who is? Are you left to yourself with this task and making follow up contact? Since this is a relatively new treatment method you'd think they'd be all over it for their data. I am very curious, your cancer seems to be aggressive for the treatment you have chosen. What were the statistics for success quoted to you for your profile? I may be wrong, but you may be our forum's first CK patient. At least, that I can recall",

      "Content": "I will add if you are new to this and see men here discussing treatment options such as radiation when their PSA reaches 0.1, 0.2, or numbers close to that they are discussing cancer recurrence after surgical removal or other whole gland treatment for cancer of their prostate and their PSA should now theoretically be 0.0. You will also read signatures that list very low PSA numbers from hormone therapy (HT) treatment used to suppress testosterone that drives the PSA numbers very low. As HighlanderCFH says, normal for your age is anywhere between 0.0 and 2.5. (Copied from the site link below.) The guidelines below are adapted from the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines In Oncology (NCCN Guidelines®) for Prostate Cancer Early Detection. Please use these guidelines to have a discussion with your physician about your personal risk and make a plan for screening. Age 40: Talk to your physician about screening and your personal risk Age 45-49: Have a baseline PSA and DRE. If PSA above 1 ng/mL, repeat at 1-2 year intervals until age 50. If PSA below 1 ng/mL repeat PSA at age 50. Age 50-70: If PSA is below 3ng/mL, repeat screening at 1-2 year intervals Age 70 and over: Talk with physician and assess general health to decide together if routine PSA screening should continue. https://zerocancer.org/learn/about-p...osis/psa-test/ Personally, at 50 and above I would have a PSA test (see ASAdvocate post above for a well advised more thorough test also discussed on the link) done every year as part of my annual physical exam.

      "Content": "It may be the beginning of bladder spasms. I hope it goes no further. The bladder is a muscle that contracts to expel urine. A spasm is like a charlie horse. At full strength I compare it to child birth contractions. For me, they were unstopable, random, and increased frequency with time. Not much they can do for them if they get worse. Keeping still tends to minimize them. Afterwards, my doctor referred to them as a sign of healing. May be the bladder trying to expel the catheter. What worked for me was to not resist/fight it by trying to relax it. It only makes it last longer. When it got bad for me I went with it. (Read it on the internet.) I pushed as if I was peeing hard, and pushed through the whole spasm. It was slightly less painful, but more importantly, shortened them. Isolate the pushing to pretending to urinate . Don't strain the whole area for obvious reasons. That's the best I got. Up till then I was working, and going out when necessary. Once they began and became frequent I spent the last two days on the couch. I would get up for them, bend over and grab something, and use breathing techniques. I hope this doesn't happen for you, and don't want to scare you. I just wished I had known about it first. It would have relieved anxiety about it. I did call the doctor's office and they confirmed it, said much doesn't help. I found pain medication didn't help very much and may irritate the bladder. Dealing with it also left me tired. It becomes a pain management experience. Having said all this, it could be something else so stay on top of it, and don't hesitate to call your doctor to confirm this for yourself, if you become concerned, if it becomes a continuos irritation, fever develops, or to ask for it to come out sooner. I see no reason for unnecessary pain just to manage an office schedule. It's a 5 minute procedure. This is the internet and not your doctor. Wishing you well. PS: they immediately became lighter after the catheter was removed and stopped within a day or two.",

      "Content": "Here's an answer to one question you ask. My incontinence improved with surgery. I was experiencing urgency incontinence before surgery as a result of a 65 gr prostate. Now I have no urgency incontinence, and I very rarely experience stress incontinence, maybe once a week if I drink alcohol or lots of caffeine. Meaning I can avoid it with diet choices. I do not wear pads. However, surgery will not improve ED if you already have it. To answer your overall question, you may be collapsing definitions. Combine the top two catagories of your study and the numbers work. No incontinence ( good) and occassional leakage ( that does not effect QOL) and the numbers align. The catagory we are concerned with is poor. The catagory that impacts QOL. It really doesn't matter for you. You want to be studying treatment results not side effect results. Pick the most effect form of treatment for your profile, a highly skilled practitioner for that treatment and the side effects will be what they are. One side effect of delaying treatment is fewer choices in treatment options. You may be on the cusp between surgery and radiation. The confidence your cancer is still confined to the prostate is low for me. Since you have no symptoms that will be improved by surgery (your prostate has remained small - I really question this result and suggest you confirm your prostate size) radiation may be a better fit. It's a question for each of the doctors. You want to be talking with surgeons and ROs. Age, fitness, extent and type of cancer , and the skill of the operator determine the most effective treatment for the cancer - not side effect studies. There is no one best treatment type. They all have a different sweet spot and the selection that will work best depends on your personal patient profile, imo. Fear of side effects can drive you to second quess what works best to cure your cancer. Only after you have narrowed your treatment choice will a consideration of side effects come into play, and then just to prepare yourself. People seldom change quickly. Focusing on side effects studies and not treatment efficacy studies is more of the old you. Like focusing on benign causes for rising PSA and not the risk of cancer. Work out your best treatment choice to play for a cure. Side effects will be what they are. You are way past avoiding side effects or biopsies. That thinking is what got you here. Go to work on your treatment choice.",

I ultimately gave it up for good, but it took a while. I have it now only on very special occassions. It is an easy habit to return too. I found as I aged it was too much for me. Not just the caffeine, but the acid as well. My daily drink is now green tea with honey, lemon, and ginseng. It gives me a little boost, but without the longing for another cup and the addiction. Sadly, alcohol is following the same pattern. Your continence will eventually return from what you describe. It will be different, and more fragile and suceptible to diet/fluid influences. If you are proceeding to radiation you want to regain it before you start that process. Giving up coffee will jump start it for you. You do not have to give up sex. You are without an erection at the moment. You can still be a good partner for your mate. Do it for her. Takes a different commitment, such as, wanting to please her.",

I've started needle injections at 6 mos with Trimix. Erections are at about 50% without the Trimix. I expect recovery to take a year or more. I am experiencing some natural responses. Nerves are traumatized by the surgery and take longer to recover than other tissue. The surgery cuts and carterizes blood vessels. It takes time for blood to find other routes and the carterizing generates heat inside the surgery area traumatizing nerves. Masturbate with whatever you have. Orgasms should be 100% even without erection. Use it any way you can or lose it.",

      "Content": "You are getting good care. Your diagnostic treatment is exemplary. Detection of cancer in the anterior zone is difficult. It is undersampled in the standard TRUS biopsy. Surgery is a reasonable option for you. PC is treatable and \"curable\". Early detection early treatment is the mantra for this disease. You got the first part covered. It's not recommended you think you know all there is to know about the cancer or it's extent. Sometimes there is more to know. Surgery has certain advantages; a pathology report of the gland, lymp nodes, seminal vesicsles, etc; your young age has much better outcomes recovering from side effects; radiation remains possible if necessary for follow up, as does hormone therapy. With a possible extension you want to know where and what it is for future radiation if necessary. Manifesting at a young age, G4, and possible extension are negatives, but everything else is good news. I know it's difficult to accept, but you will learn a clear treatable path forward is the best news. You have that. On the emotional side, while your experiences are unique to you they are normal. My suggestion is to accept them, give some time to acknowledge them, and move past them. Don't fight them. You got this! Again, very impressed with your care. Your detection was state of the art in my opinion. It can be the most challenging aspect of this disease. Regarding sharing the news, secrets with those close to you are energy sucking ventures . Being honest and transparent never fails. Faith in your power to handle this is more valuable than having a plan. As for a plan, you couldn't have done better than what you have done so far.",

I've started needle injections at 6 mos with Trimix. Erections are at about 50% without the Trimix. I expect recovery to take a year or more. I am experiencing some natural responses. Nerves are traumatized by the surgery and take longer to recover than other tissue. The surgery cuts and carterizes blood vessels. It takes time for blood to find other routes and the carterizing generates heat inside the surgery area traumatizing nerves. Masturbate with whatever you have. Orgasms should be 100% even without erection. Use it any way you can or lose it.",

It will bounce back up if cancer is present. The MRI is a good move. His prostate is near normal size indicating no BHP giving more value to rising PSA is a result of cancer growth. If in the states, I'd recommend a second opinion on reading the biopsy samples. His Gleason score may be higher. They can be misread. Cancer with low PSA can be higher risk. Even if the biopsy is being read correctly treatment is recommended because of the volume. There may be higher Gleason that is undetected as indicated by the PIRADS 4. The 3 samples in the area of the PIRADS 4 were not enough if it missed it. With this disease success is achieved with early detection and early treatment.

      "Content": "Exercise, like walking, immediately after surgery reduces the risk of blood clots in the legs of older patients which can be fatal. Belly fat and obesity increases the risk of certain cancers which include prostate cancer. Some types of fat, specifically abdominal fat, store toxic components some of which are considered to be cancer causing. Most overweight people do not think they are overweight and are surprised when shown their BMI measure. Cultural diet choices are considered a possible contributor to prostate cancer in the general population, such as eating red meat. Most overweight men eat red meat, high fat, high calorie, high carbohydrate, and high sugar diets. Anti-inflammatory diets are thought to impact prostate cancer and general health in a positive way. General fitness is a factor in suitability for DaVinci surgery. Some men in poor health can not risk surgery eliminating an early and powerful option. Being in poor health complicates and conspires to thwart all medical treatment. Abdominal fat makes most PC treatment choices more difficult to perform. DaVinci surgery inflates your belly to create work space. Stressed abdominal muscles require rehabilitation to restore their effectiveness. They are critical to posture and future lower back health. Exercise and diet combat general depression. Depression is a common and natural response to aging and the realization of cancer. Depression suppresses motivation and self caring, critical factors in early detection, treatment, and following through on commitments (integrity) necessary in dealing with PC. I have three brothers all of which deal with varying degrees of depression. The two of us who exercise have dealt with it early and effectively. The two who do not have procrastinated in dealing with it. One resulted in critical adverse conditions. The other has yet to deal with it and the result will not be pretty. Exercise and weight are general indicators of being responsible for your health. They are primary guages on the dashboard. It is never too late to go back to them. A sedentary life style, obesity, and poor diet will shorten your life and degrade its quality. Such a view is at odds with a desire to survive prostate cancer. It is not sustainable. For an obese person, cardiovascular disease and diabetes may do you in before prostate cancer. In all things where we think we may be stuck without direction or a path forward the simple act of taking action, any positive physical action, can transform our view (head) of what's possible for ourselves. If you are over weight and eating poorly you are being driven by thoughts that are not in your own self interest. Shift your physical actions to healthy ones and the thoughts will follow. A fit body and a clear head is invaluable in navigating the pitfalls of prostate cancer which never end. Irresponsible self care can demoralize the healthcare providers you are asking to help you. Healthcare is a team sport. Doing your part will inspire those whose help you seek. Wax on. Wax off.",

      "Content": "Here's an answer to one question you ask. My incontinence improved with surgery. I was experiencing urgency incontinence before surgery as a result of a 65 gr prostate. Now I have no urgency incontinence, and I very rarely experience stress incontinence, maybe once a week if I drink alcohol or lots of caffeine. Meaning I can avoid it with diet choices. I do not wear pads. However, surgery will not improve ED if you already have it. To answer your overall question, you may be collapsing definitions. Combine the top two catagories of your study and the numbers work. No incontinence ( good) and occassional leakage ( that does not effect QOL) and the numbers align. The catagory we are concerned with is poor. The catagory that impacts QOL. It really doesn't matter for you. You want to be studying treatment results not side effect results. Pick the most effect form of treatment for your profile, a highly skilled practitioner for that treatment and the side effects will be what they are. One side effect of delaying treatment is fewer choices in treatment options. You may be on the cusp between surgery and radiation. The confidence your cancer is still confined to the prostate is low for me. Since you have no symptoms that will be improved by surgery (your prostate has remained small - I really question this result and suggest you confirm your prostate size) radiation may be a better fit. It's a question for each of the doctors. You want to be talking with surgeons and ROs. Age, fitness, extent and type of cancer , and the skill of the operator determine the most effective treatment for the cancer - not side effect studies. There is no one best treatment type. They all have a different sweet spot and the selection that will work best depends on your personal patient profile, imo. Fear of side effects can drive you to second quess what works best to cure your cancer. Only after you have narrowed your treatment choice will a consideration of side effects come into play, and then just to prepare yourself. People seldom change quickly. Focusing on side effects studies and not treatment efficacy studies is more of the old you. Like focusing on benign causes for rising PSA and not the risk of cancer. Work out your best treatment choice to play for a cure. Side effects will be what they are. You are way past avoiding side effects or biopsies. That thinking is what got you here. Go to work on your treatment choice.",

Cells travel their way out depending on their aggressiveness. A 3 will sit there and grow. A 4 runs. A 5 flies. The size and time are less important than the aggressiveness. The aggressiveness is its speed to mobilize. Don't mess around with 4 and 5s. They may remain small, hard to find, and have low PSA values, but their aggressiveness to leave and metastisize is the risk. Your fortunate to have discovered it. Early detection and early treatment is the path to success with this disease. Two demons work against us; denial and delay.",

The variables are your age, general health, and family history of life expectancy and health conditions. In other words, how long do you expect to live and what other life threatening/shortening issues are you confronted with such as weight, blood pressure, diabetes, alcohol, smoking, etc? Much like planning your financial retirement. The game is to finish with a zero balance spending what you earn with good health practices on life experiences. Now is the time when your diet, BMI, exercise, genetics, and mental health factor into the statistical outcome of your diagnosis and treatment options. It's different for everyone. There was a time when other things would kill you first, but earlier diagnosis and always improving treatment options for everything now puts prostate cancer in the decision matrix. It may not sound like it, but that's a good thing.",

      "Content": "As an example of a limited view of statistics in this consideration. We know, \"The most common causes of cancer death continue to be lung, prostate, and colorectal cancers in men and lung, breast, and colorectal cancers in women. These 4 cancers account for 45% of all cancer deaths, with 1 in 4 cancer deaths from lung cancer.\" Now they are introducing the statistic of not just death, but years lost to determine how \"destructive\" a type of cancer is. While prostate cancer deaths may be more than breast cancer deaths, the years lost in men is much less than women. Men who die of PC may statistically only lose a year off their life while women may lose many more years making breast cancer statistically more destructive. Yet, what is the loss of quality years of life for men who's lives are extended by terminal cancer treatment who show up statistically only losing a year of life from PC? A long course of multiple prostate cancer treatments of a preventable terminal case of prostate cancer may extended a man's life to nearly his expected lifetime, but are those many years of extended cancer treatment before death worth a statistically average life span? Death from cancer as a meaningful statistical measure is just the crude and cruel beginning of this story. Statistically, we are very good at treating cancer. We are not so good at detecting and curing cancer. For me, AS is the current answer to the early screening and detection debate. Large cancer centers seem to be the epicenter for it. As a question of public health policy, do we advocate for early screening in general practise and push screened patients to large cancer center AS programs? Or, do we push AS programs to general practises as a part of screening? For now, I propose a PSA screening of 3-4 by your GP forwards you to a cancer center AS program. It's simple, and places the seriouness of your potential risk in the appropriate context. It is asking too much for your local GP or urologist to run an AS program, imo.",

The risk in manipulating your PSA is you no longer have a reliable indicator of your cancer activity. You are treating a symptom of cancer not the cancer. An example, we often know we are sick because we have a fever. Taking some Tylenol to reduce the fever doesn't cure the illness. In the example, the illness will most often cure itself so treating symptoms has an advantage of providing comfort. In your case the cancer will not cure itself and hemp oil will not do it either and now you lost the baseline of the best method you had of measuring its progress.

      "Content": "Everything is normal except you! (humour) You will be continent within 3 months, imo. You are still in the rest and recuperate period for at least a month. The zen approach is to first accept it. Resisting it will only prolong it. It is a natural aspect of the healing process. Imagine everything in the region is behaving like a leg or foot gone to sleep. It will return. There are things you can do to help. My doctor gave me a script for a half dose of Cialis 2-3 times a week. Not for ED, but to enhance blood flow to the area for healing. Cialis lingers for up to 3 days, but the idea is to pulse increased blood flow, not elevate and sustain it. Relax on the kegels. You can be overdoing them. No more than 3 sets a day for now just to let them know you're paying attention. After 9 days everything is swollen and numb. Give it time to heal. Kegels are for muscle tone, but more importantly for redeveloping nerve/muscle control. Nerve tissue takes longer to recover than other soft tissues. It just takes longer to refresh those connections. Blood flow has also been disrupted with the cauterization and blood has to find new pathways. As you recover, you will be best in the morning and regress as the day goes on and the muscles tire. Don't overwork them. For almost a year I could not disntiguish the need to fart, from a bowel movement, from urinating. A full bowel now causes a slight increase in stress dribbles. Keep your bowels moving. Stress continence will require specific effort, but now is too soon to go to work on them, imo. These are mucle memory connections best practised after healing when muscle control has returned and you are retraining automatic responses. My example of the last thing to work on was getting in an out of a car. Once I realized it, I created a mantra, \"stay together, stay together\" from an old Cheech and Cong movie. Everytime I get into and out of a car I'd repeat the mantra to remind myself to prepare. It was close to 5 months when I took on that last issue. It is now automatic and is no longer necessary. Hard sneezes are still a problem. If I can , I just grab myself and clamp it. It works (in private) , but do not do this until you are fully healed, several months. Coffee, carbonated beverages, and alcohol, among other things, irritate the bladder. The bladder has just undegone a major trauma. Over indulgence of any of those will result in dribbles for me. More than two manhattans in a row and I will dribble at the slightest stress. If I want to drink more I pull out a light pad. I kept one in my back pocket for a year after I stopped wearing them regularly. Happy hour or a night out always created opportunities for putting one back in, and I didn't sweat it. You have a system thatvwill work use it and enjoy. I find myself drinking less alcohol on a daily basis. I now regularly put a glass of water between all my alcohol drinks. I gave up all 3 during my recovery. I switched to green tea for my morning caffeine. It was enough to make a difference. I find coffee to be too intense for me in general as I age. I miss it the most. Use 100% synthetic stretch underwear. I use short boxers. It holds the pads in place better and dries faster than cotton. Darker colors also hide the stains. They do provide more support for the region. It took a while for the swelling to resolve 100% in the scrotum. They are sexier. Ditch the stretched out cotton tighty whities. The key to kegels is not to clamp your anus. That's not the muscle group. The kegels lift your pelvic floor. It's a head pat stomach circle exercise. Some benefit from PT to learn this distinction. One exercise is to control the kegel contraction like an elevator going up and down. Go half way up and stop. Hold it and then take it all the way up. Take it down the same way, stopping half way. The biggest challenge is not obsessing and over reacting. Ready, set, ....relax. And keep hydrated.",

      "Content": "I had a Peyronie's experience. After the first injection I noticed a slight depression in the area of the injection site. I should have stopped then. I gave myself 4 more shots over the course of 2 months. Each more painful than the last. I stopped, but have significant bottlenecking at the base at the site of the injections. I am now deformed, but still functional. In hindsight, I would have been more patient. I eventually recoverd my erections in full in a year and a half. For you, after six years I'd give it a try. It can work. I had Peyronie's, but didn't know it. The shape was normal. Imagine the chances of that. The injections exposed it. My doctor was unaware of injections causing Peyronie's. My doctor said erections or incontinence will not be improved with a successful surgery. They may return to pre surgery levels, but not better than. One suggestion is to work with a doctor who specializes in ED. My urologist was good at surgery, but not ED. My first injection and erection was in his office and under his supervision. When I pointed out the slight divot at the injection site he said may be Peyronie's yet he let me walk out with the script. I believe a more experienced doctor would have stopped it right there. As I understand it, the nerves damaged by the procedure are the nerves that shut the valves when the penis is engorged and hold the blood in the erect penis under pressure. You should be able to fill your penis with blood (standing helps). The problem is keeping it there for the time you need. The injections do work and while off putting you do get used to it.",

I think those in the know and current with the state of the art will have more aggressive attitudes and treatment recommendations. If you're in this patient group, I'd be wary of those professionals who still perpetuate the myth you have time and it's a slow moving disease. Especially, when they have no way of knowing what you have. A question to ask the professionals along the way is if they have any personal experience with prostate cancer, whether themselves or someone close. I often hear a disconnect in some of the shared experiences here between the patient's concern and the professional's lack of it. Thanks for the work you do here!",

I worry about professionals characterizing G3 as not worthy of treatment and the risk that a G6 pathology report is a get out of prostate cancer free card. When the day comes they can say with certainty this is what you have and all you have then his comment makes sense. Until then G6 is prostate cancer, imo, and any choice of treatment or not treatment for a G6 diagnosis includes a risk of \"real\" cancer. Until they can determine a prostate will produce only G6 my view is a prostate that is producing G6 is capable of G7 and you may never know it even after a pathology report.",

I think those in the know and current with the state of the art will have more aggressive attitudes and treatment recommendations. If you're in this patient group, I'd be wary of those professionals who still perpetuate the myth you have time and it's a slow moving disease. Especially, when they have no way of knowing what you have. A question to ask the professionals along the way is if they have any personal experience with prostate cancer, whether themselves or someone close. I often hear a disconnect in some of the shared experiences here between the patient's concern and the professional's lack of it. Thanks for the work you do here!",

When the day comes they can say with certainty this is what you have and all you have then his comment makes sense. Until then G6 is prostate cancer, imo, and any choice of treatment or not treatment for a G6 diagnosis includes a risk of \"real\" cancer. Until they can determine a prostate will produce only G6 my view is a prostate that is producing G6 is capable of G7 and you may never know it even after a pathology report.",

Older men with larger prostates developing cancer later have a higher probability of less aggressive cancer, maybe.

Were you in the meeting? Someone, in addition to your father, who is clear and objective should also attend all meetings going forward. Your father has a high level of cancer and the odds are very high he will have reoccurrence immediately. That much G4 is a serious matter. Early detection, early treatment is the key to successful treatment all the way down the line with this disease at each phase. Your father did not benefit from early detection and treatment. Do not make the same mistake again. Regardless, it is time to prepare for the next phase and move on to an RO and MO to guide you forward. Your urological surgeon's work is done. Follow up treatment will depend on your father's health and general life expectancy. It will most likely include hormone deprivation therapy and radiation. Scans will be done to determine if the cancer has metastized to other parts of the body. These scans are not highly sensitive and a negative scan does not mean it has not spread. It means it is had not spread or is not detectable yet. It is time for the oncologists to take over your father's care. I'd recommend a major cancer center with experience in prostate cancer. I apologize in advance if this is too blunt. My intent is to make a brief, clear and honest assessment of your father's situation.",

      "Content": "Find a urologist you are comfortable with who specializes in prostate cancer and get a biopsy. DREs are done quickly by experienced docs. They are simple procedures. Judge your experience by his lack of patience and time with you. Be wary of the \"normal ranges\" of PSA as safe. Pay attention to a steady rise over time. It may bounce a bit, but prostate cancer is slow growing (unless an aggressive variety) and your PSA will rise accordingly. There are exceptions: some have lower PSA values in the presence of cancer. Some have BPH in addition to cancer which can confuse the PSA line, but even then the overall trend is always a steady up. Your young age is your warning flag here. In general, I'm am reluctant to offer the view it is more often BPH than cancer even when it may be. Too many men are too eager to believe in anything but cancer as the risk they are facing. Both are troublesome, both require monitoring, both may require treatment at some time, so get yourself into the care of an experienced prostate cancer urologist and be prepared. You will be managing the care of your prostate now for the rest of your life, BPH or cancer or both. 80% of all men will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. When the little organ starts to act up is important to what you have ahead of you. Don't ignore it. Be prepared and address issues as they present. You don't have to like your urologist, but he has to be: highly experienced, qualified, patient, informative, clear, brief, and recommended by peer professionals. There are only a few male friends I consider objective enough about their prostate health whom I will accept as knowledgable to make a urologist recommendation. So be wary of bias in friends and family. Denial and delay are the two demons of all cancer. It is especially poignant with prostate cancer because many men fail miserably in being responsible around this one issue for obvious reasons, and it is most often curable if detected early, and manageable for a long time if not.",

      "Content": "Indicator of cancer is generally a steady rise. BHP can be eratic. You can have both. In that case, the bottom number continues to rise. In otherwords, eratic but a steady increase in the baseline. Activities that stimulate the prostate can vary the PSA, but generally not that much. Some prostate medications can reduce PSA, but not Flomax. Diet and supplements can too, but again not that much. Different labs can have varying results that are minor so use the same lab, but again not that much. The 3.5 is somewhat up for your age. The others are pretty high. The 3.5 can also be a mistake. It happens. We have a member with eratic PSA. In the end, only a physical biopsy can detect cancer. Just to keep you clear. Difficulty peeing is a cancer symptom. So if you're taking Flomax you're dealing with possible cancer symptoms. Set up your signature with PSA and date history, family history, DRE, is it enlarged, etc. A profile is how you diagnosis this disease. You build the evidence that paints the picture. BHP can complicate the hunt for cancer. It does not necesssrily lead to cancer, but they are also common together. PSA over 10 and a rise of more than .5 in a year are indicators of a higher risk of cancer. Next PSA test include a freePSA test. It will provide additional risk info.",

      "Content": "Find a urologist you are comfortable with who specializes in prostate cancer and get a biopsy. DREs are done quickly by experienced docs. They are simple procedures. Judge your experience by his lack of patience and time with you. Be wary of the \"normal ranges\" of PSA as safe. Pay attention to a steady rise over time. It may bounce a bit, but prostate cancer is slow growing (unless an aggressive variety) and your PSA will rise accordingly. There are exceptions: some have lower PSA values in the presence of cancer. Some have BPH in addition to cancer which can confuse the PSA line, but even then the overall trend is always a steady up. Your young age is your warning flag here. In general, I'm am reluctant to offer the view it is more often BPH than cancer even when it may be. Too many men are too eager to believe in anything but cancer as the risk they are facing. Both are troublesome, both require monitoring, both may require treatment at some time, so get yourself into the care of an experienced prostate cancer urologist and be prepared. You will be managing the care of your prostate now for the rest of your life, BPH or cancer or both. 80% of all men will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. When the little organ starts to act up is important to what you have ahead of you. Don't ignore it. Be prepared and address issues as they present. You don't have to like your urologist, but he has to be: highly experienced, qualified, patient, informative, clear, brief, and recommended by peer professionals. There are only a few male friends I consider objective enough about their prostate health whom I will accept as knowledgable to make a urologist recommendation. So be wary of bias in friends and family. Denial and delay are the two demons of all cancer. It is especially poignant with prostate cancer because many men fail miserably in being responsible around this one issue for obvious reasons, and it is most often curable if detected early, and manageable for a long time if not.",

Cancer tissue tends to clump together while healthy tissue peels away easily. That is a useful remark for many to understand how cancer can get left behind. The cancerous cell is \"sticky\". It sticks to the knife and the remaining tissue. Once described here like peeling a hard boiled egg. Some tissue separates cleanly, some pulls and tears. The cancerous tissue tends to cling and tear making a clean close removal a challenge near the edges. Or something like that.",

You think you know it, but seeing it written before you causes invaluable insights. Denial and delay are the two demons of cancer. Hard to hide from the facts when they are written before you and others. If left to swirl in your head they will be shaped by emotions. G4 is serious stuff. It can move quickly and unpredictably and not likely to grow quietly in place. G3 is the stuff that causes people to dismiss PC. G4 is not G3. It is the difference between most likely indolent and aggressive cancer. Do not think you can manage the details of this journey in your head. Your head will play tricks on you and can not be trusted alone. Have someone accompany you to doctor visits. They take notes, you listen. Keep a list of questions. You will think of something to ask and then forget. Keep it simple and complete.",

The doctor operates a joy stick at a computer screen in the corner of the room. Assistants attend to the patient in the room inverted (head down) on a table. The surgeon enters the abdomen from above. You can watch a Youtube of the procedure. Some people (surgeons) may never have the aptitude for operating via robot technology and maintain relative presence of left right and up down. While the anatomy is the same the skill set is entirely different between scapel and robot. Even if the surgeon has the aptitude it's a long and steep learning curve.",

      "Content": "From never sick a day in my life, to cancer, is a big shift. It takes time. Cancered out is a great phrase. Who wouldn't be. Some examples. Healthcare may be new for you, embrace it. It's the new normal at our age. Its a new experience for you. As you get better at it you will begin to appreciate the outcomes. Since my prostatectomy (2 yrs back) I've had knee surgery (second on same knee), irregular heart beat scare and testing, and a double hernia (iguinal and belly button) surgery. All while working, traveling, being with my 97 year old mom in her end game, bounce back, end game again, bounce back, and now hospice end game, and being in the best relationship of my life. Go figure, as the going gets harder the living gets better. Anything you want to do in retirement start doing now. I amped up my trout fishing. Going again in two weeks and am using it to renew my relationship with my brother who just moved back in town to retire. One of my favories, I meet once a week for dinner and drinks with a small group of guy friends. Same day and time and different places, but some favorites. There is always something we help each other with during the conversations, usually without knowing it. This also makes you much more attractive to women. We have a name, \"The He-Man Women Haters Club.\" (You can use it, but be warned, it takes some kahunas because it is easily missunderstood.) It is definitely a hook for some (all the better) but it does have a reference in American culture that suits our age. We explain it as a reverse mantra. Its to remind us we love our women and we are men. It's serious fun, and I miss it when we can't make it happen which is often enough because we are all busy. Once a week is a good working time period. It was started to help a guy get out who had just lost his wife. It worked and he moved on, and I suspect we will see him again some day because it does work, and everyone needs something that works when they need it. Don't fight it. Allow yourself the time to be with it. Fighting it holds it in place. Accepting it allows you to be with it, and eventually you will tire of it. Fighting it keeps it in place and it can become chronic because it has some hidden payoff for you. Cancer is inconvenient. One more thing. Most of us, by age, are in our end game, the last period/quarter/inning, pick you sport. There's more wrapping up of old injuries, stretching and warming up, sitting on the bench, mentoring the young players, and making a difference whether you're in the game or not. I'm now one of the veteran players in the club house. Every championship team needs one or two to win. I earned it and I still enjoy the game.",

      "Content": "RobLee, the new standard for biopsy is moving from a PSA of 4 to a PSA of 3. It also varies based on ethnicity. FishSpear, good work. You got this. You are a candidate for AS, as you know, just want to reinforce it. My bias is surgery if a cure is possible and if you need one. Any decision matrix must also include a life expectancy. Difficult to confront, but your assessment of your fitness and family history helps in projecting a number. A large consideration in life expectancy is your BMI. The health consequences of gaining weight as we age is the largest contributor to reduced life expectancy; high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease, diabetes, and less activity. Get a second opinion on the Gleason scoring of all your samples. Everything changes if G4 is present. The premier lab for this is Epstein at John Hopkins. Did the biopsy include a random array in addition to the targeted samples? Looks like it with the 13. Just want to confirm. And where was the one G6 in the prostate? Most of the diagnostic tools we have are marginal, at best, including MRIs. However, if your PSA is steady (not bouncing around) it can be the most reliable indicator, imo. Yours is rising recently, steadily and with the possiblity of some velocity indicating more may be going on than just one G6. You found an excellent forum here.",

Healthcare may be new for you, embrace it. It's the new normal at our age. Its a new experience for you. As you get better at it you will begin to appreciate the outcomes. Since my prostatectomy (2 yrs back) I've had knee surgery (second on same knee), irregular heart beat scare and testing, and a double hernia (iguinal and belly button) surgery. All while working, traveling, being with my 97 year old mom in her end game, bounce back, end game again, bounce back, and now hospice end game, and being in the best relationship of my life. Go figure, as the going gets harder the living gets better. Anything you want to do in retirement start doing now. I amped up my trout fishing. Going again in two weeks and am using it to renew my relationship with my brother who just moved back in town to retire. One of my favories, I meet once a week for dinner and drinks with a small group of guy friends. Same day and time and different places, but some favorites. There is always something we help each other with during the conversations, usually without knowing it. This also makes you much more attractive to women. We have a name, \"The He-Man Women Haters Club.\" (You can use it, but be warned, it takes some kahunas because it is easily missunderstood.) It is definitely a hook for some (all the better) but it does have a reference in American culture that suits our age. We explain it as a reverse mantra. Its to remind us we love our women and we are men. It's serious fun, and I miss it when we can't make it happen which is often enough because we are all busy. Once a week is a good working time period. It was started to help a guy get out who had just lost his wife. It worked and he moved on, and I suspect we will see him again some day because it does work, and everyone needs something that works when they need it. Don't fight it. Allow yourself the time to be with it. Fighting it holds it in place. Accepting it allows you to be with it, and eventually you will tire of it. Fighting it keeps it in place and it can become chronic because it has some hidden payoff for you. Cancer is inconvenient. One more thing. Most of us, by age, are in our end game, the last period/quarter/inning, pick you sport. There's more wrapping up of old injuries, stretching and warming up, sitting on the bench, mentoring the young players, and making a difference whether you're in the game or not.

      "Content": "I would not play chicken with it. If you want to consider AS get a second opinion on the scoring. I chose treatment of G6 based solely on volume. There was too much of it. Turned out to be G7. If it's not acting benign it probably isn't. Your PSA and prostate size are both suspiciously low for your age, volume and grading of cancer. Rather than being a positive consideration it is now a concern. I do not see a path for you to AS. You do not fit a specific profile you can trust, imo. Then there's the doctor's recommendation. It begs the question why the MRI and biopsy with such a low PSA. Which beings us back to something being uncertain. What is your life expectancy currently? It is a valid question now if you are considering non-treatment and have other morbidities. There is enough information to recommend treatment. There is not enough to recommend AS. I end up back at a second opinion on the scoring if you are not inclined to treat. Something is different here for you and that is never a good sign with cancer.",

      "Content": "RobLee, the new standard for biopsy is moving from a PSA of 4 to a PSA of 3. It also varies based on ethnicity. FishSpear, good work. You got this. You are a candidate for AS, as you know, just want to reinforce it. My bias is surgery if a cure is possible and if you need one. Any decision matrix must also include a life expectancy. Difficult to confront, but your assessment of your fitness and family history helps in projecting a number. A large consideration in life expectancy is your BMI. The health consequences of gaining weight as we age is the largest contributor to reduced life expectancy; high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease, diabetes, and less activity. Get a second opinion on the Gleason scoring of all your samples. Everything changes if G4 is present. The premier lab for this is Epstein at John Hopkins. Did the biopsy include a random array in addition to the targeted samples? Looks like it with the 13. Just want to confirm. And where was the one G6 in the prostate? Most of the diagnostic tools we have are marginal, at best, including MRIs. However, if your PSA is steady (not bouncing around) it can be the most reliable indicator, imo. Yours is rising recently, steadily and with the possiblity of some velocity indicating more may be going on than just one G6. You found an excellent forum here.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD Thanks for the tip about leaning forward and raising the feet on the toes. It helps. So it this a temporary thing or is this the way it is going to be from now on? It has always been a helpful technique for everyone, but more so for us. It has taken me a year to find the right combination of fiber and diet to have healthy bowel movements. I have other issues. However, once you have regularity mastered the urge to have a movement unaided does eventually return. It took me about a year. If you have watched a youtube video of the procedure you will notice they use an electrical cauterizer on the end of the scopes to cauterize blood vessels as they make their way through the procedure. I think it may disrupt blood flow and nerves leaving the colon muscle sluggish for a while. It is speculated that the heat trapped in the surgery cavity generated by the cauterizing tool may traumatize the nearby nerves. Tissue damage of this nature takes longer to heal as blood finds other routes, and nerve tissue takes longer to heal and regenerate than other tissue. The colon is a muscle, has a memory, is more voluntary than involuntary, is trained, and likes regularity and robust use. The use of aids to move your bowels or low fiber diets can make the colon sluggish and weak. There is light at the end of the tunnel if you develop a regime that exercises your colon daily. One another note, as we work to regain our continence we are tempted to drink less water. The consequences of this contribute to dryer stool and overall fatigue. Water is the vehicle for energy in everything. And one more thing, the antibiotic regimes particulary for the biopsy, can destroy your intestinal flora especially in the colon. This can contribute to dryer less digested stool and less mucus. I found a high quality probiotic designed to release lower in the colon helped. It took a while. Sometimes more fiber just generates larger more constipating stool until balance is restored. Oatmeal, which was a stable of mine, proved to be constipating because of its absorbency. Go figure. Commercial dairy probiotics were useless to me. Saurkraut and cabbage worked for me. Inexpensive dry high fiber breakfast cereals actually worked for me. I mean the really tastless low sugar high fiber unappealing ones. Ugh! But, a good bowel movement is one of life's simple pleasures. Fighting cancer is an active participation sport demanding you pay attention to the conversation your body is having with you. Medical procedures and treatments are only a part of game, at worse, a passive approach to this disease is fatal, at best, a poor and depressing quality of life. I view this as a wake up call to reconnect with my body. In the end its a simple formula made up of three things- diet and exercise, diet and exercise, and diet and exercise. Stay engaged. Your body is a wonderful vessel designed to make this voyage. Care for it like it is your own and use it. A passive and sedentary lifestyle is tiring and depressive. Our bodies are built for being spent.",

You are a candidate for AS, as you know, just want to reinforce it. My bias is surgery if a cure is possible and if you need one. Any decision matrix must also include a life expectancy. Difficult to confront, but your assessment of your fitness and family history helps in projecting a number. A large consideration in life expectancy is your BMI. The health consequences of gaining weight as we age is the largest contributor to reduced life expectancy; high blood pressure, high cholesterol and heart disease, diabetes, and less activity. Get a second opinion on the Gleason scoring of all your samples. Everything changes if G4 is present. The premier lab for this is Epstein at John Hopkins. Did the biopsy include a random array in addition to the targeted samples? Looks like it with the 13. Just want to confirm. And where was the one G6 in the prostate? Most of the diagnostic tools we have are marginal, at best, including MRIs. However, if your PSA is steady (not bouncing around) it can be the most reliable indicator, imo. Yours is rising recently, steadily and with the possiblity of some velocity indicating more may be going on than just one G6. You found an excellent forum here.",

      "Content": "From what I am learning from my short experience with this disease is there is no \"all is well.\" Once begun this vigil is never over. My health system is using the <0.02 and I have no illusions that my PSA may be moving below this limit, or not. I know this only from what I have learned on my own initiative and this wondetful site. If a health system is going to use the ultrasensitive test then the anxiety created by knowing sooner than later is managed by knowing what treatment options are available sooner than later. The anxiety produced by a doctor wanting to know while putting off discussion of what happens next with the patient, or not being clear that no action will be taken until it reaches a much higher level when options exist to treat earlier with higher success rates is why we find ourselves left to discover these things here rather than our doctor's office. I am not pursuing this conversation here to say one way is right, but to demonstrate the argument for the poster to empower them to pursue a more aggressive path of treatment made possible with ultratesting if they want it in the face of a doctor who may not be preparing them for it. The temptation on the doctor side is to operate on a need to know basis assuming they need to know more than the patient. The result is needless anxiety. The impact here is not that the patient knows too much about their PSA, but they don't know enough about what their options are with that information. Imo based on what the poster is sharing, the doctor's actions are not aligned with the test he is using. In a perfect world, the last test would have generated an in office conversation about what happens if the next test shows a third rise. If the health system's protocol is to not take action until .1 or higher the <0.02 test is sufficient. A simple 2 minute conversation in the beginning about recurrence, the testing for it, and their treatment protocol around it relieves any anxiety caused by knowing some but not all of what the doctor knows. I understand a doctor's motivation to deal only with what happens next. They don't experience anxiety because they know what happens next. Patient's have it because they don't know what happens next. A doctor may not see anxiety as a medically relevant symptom. I do, for many reasons which is another conversation. If a health system is going to choose to use the ultrasensitive test then education of the patient should align with that choice. If patients don't push back with that need the doctor will not address it. Personally, I found my doctor's conversation about PSA testing and recurrence after the surgery to be inadequate. I'm sure his answer would be we will deal with that when and if it happens. I will let him know my thoughts when we meet again. That's my responsibility.",

The result posted was <0.06. It took thee phone calls starting with my GP who said he would check into it, but it's still undetectable. I said I understand, but now I'can't compare results and I have lost 0.04 in detection. Waited a week, and when he didn't get back to me I called the surgeon's office. Said it was still undectable. I said I know, but I lost 0.04 points in detection. They said call the lab. I did. Similar conversation, and they confirmed they changed their test, but still undetectable. I said I understood, but not good enough. The lab called my doctor, then called me back and said we will change your test. When you come in ask for Quest and ultra sensitive and we will note your file as well. Retest results came back in, and it was interesting to note the test was sent to California. Took 2 days and was posted to my portal. Technology is amazing! Now, <0.02 is not ultra sensitive as I understand it, but good enough for me at this point. Despite everyone's good intentions and hard work you still have to be an advocate for yourself. Now, I will call everyone back, let them know I'm happy and how it was resolved, and thank them for their work to get me back on track. Hopefully, it was a learning experience for everyone. I have to think that even if it occurrs to them as an annoyance in their day they will appreciate my advocacy as an intregal part of their own commitment to provide excellence in service and healthcare, person by person.",

      "Content": "A note about the antibiotic drill for elevated PSA. Imo, it is bad medicine. The over use of antibiotics for elevated PSA, particularly short term, is a serious issue that can later result in complications during the biopsy and surgery. Studies have shown that some who experience sepsis after biopsy also had antibiotic treatment for elevated PSA. Your age, PSA, symptoms, and negative urine culture are evidence enough to test for cancer and not treat for a bacterial infection. Studies also show there will be a chance of a slight decrease in your PSA as a result of the antibiotics in the presence of cancer that some will use as a reason to postpone a biopsy. There is a belief, which I consider now to be outdated and verging on harmful myth, that prostate cancer is slow growing and you will not die from it and it leads some to take a casual approach to it's symptoms and diagnoses. I did. There is some truth in it, but many will tell you that during the diagnoses is not the time to take the possibility lightly. That truth only applies when there is some evidence that supports it, such as a biopsy grading it as non aggressive. Living with prostate cancer is no cake walk even if it doesn't kill you! Your symptoms presenting at a young age increase the possibility of it being a more aggressive form of the cancer. Regarding your question about late stages, probably not, but it is not a relevant question (not a bad question). Prostate cancer has high probability of a \"cure\" when detected early. There are some grades that are relatively indolent and hang around growing slowly. Other's are more aggressive and head out into the body quickly. All of them benefit from early diagnosis, and will be something you treat and manage the rest of your life.",

      "Content": "I have a question. Radiation is suppose to kill the cancer cells, because they are by nature weaker cells, and spare the healthy cells. What stops the radiate prostate from continuing to produce cancer cells? For me, I lost confidence in my prostate to play nice and wanted it removed to halt any further mischief such as future BHP or the remaining cells producing more cancer cells. It is my understanding radiation does not \"kill\" the prostate. It only \"kills\" the cancerous prostate cells at the time of the treatment. The prostate is left alive and \"well\" to continue to do what it has already proven itself to do which is continue to produce both healthy and cancerous prostate cells in the future. In the poster's case, it has proven itself to produce a more aggressive type of cancer cell at an early age. The radiation has no way of determining which healthy cells will eventually be triggered to start producing cancerous cells. Radiation leaves behind a difficult if not impossible mess of damaged tissue to try to clean up 25 years from now. Future radiation is not a useful option making matters worse for all the surrounding tissue/organs, and surgeons do not like operating in or around radiation damaged sites because the radiated tissue is no longer normal healthy tissue. Most prostate cancer is slow growing and begins later in life and most men outlive it. Not so in a younger man with more aggressive cancer. The term \"cure\" in prostate cancer does not mean what we first think it means, i.e. permanent. The word is used in the context of time, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and does not apply well to the younger man or aggressive cancer. For me, its a kick the can down the road game and at the moment there are only 3 kicks I have at it; surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy. Time is the variable to determine how many kicks I'll need. A younger man with aggressive cancer may need all three and more. An old man may need none. Everyone else falls somewhere between.",

Your young age, G4, and volume are the critical factors. Because cancer wasn't hit on one side doesn't mean it's not there. Your young age is the most critical factor. G4 presenting so early implies an aggressive form of cancer, imo. At 54 it has a head start, and it will not go away or slow down. Silver lining, you caught it early making it very treatable. Early detection, early treatment is the mantra for aggressive forms of this disease. You have time to consider and educate yourself. Stay main stream and out of the weeds. Welcome to the club. G4, age, and volume do not make you a good candidate for AS, imo.",

Interestingly, their observation of the margins is over 90% accurate. Or, one doctor's 6 is another's 3+4. That being said I am not yet convinced than Gleason 6 can not survive alone. It may not be fatal but that is a whole other calculus. It may be internet creep, i.e. Gleason 6 rarely metastasizes talk turns in to it can't survive outside the prostate. It may survive and grow slowly, but still not metastasize. It seems there is a lot we still don't know.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear this news. You've found a good source that is served by many experienced men with this disease. I am relatively new to this. This is what I can share. You are very fortunate to have discovered this. Your age, the amount of cancer and it's locations are serious indicators of something you may want to consider treating aggressively. Your age indicates this may be more aggressive than the Gleason scores you have available suggest. You can get a second opinion on the grading. There is also a chance they can be upgraded when examined after surgery. That happened in my case. I believe your doctor's are giving you very good advice. I am very impressed with an oncologist recommending surgery. It points to the seriousness of your situation, that it is still possible to play for a cure keeping the possibility of radiation as your second line of defense. Open vs Robotics debate is unclear to me. My understanding is outcomes at this point rely entirely on the skill of the surgeon. Robotics has a greater learning curve and cost, but ultimately may win out due to the ability of the surgeon to see under magnification what he is doing. Cyberknife is for low and intermediate risk cancers. While it is tempting to look at your Gleason scores and make a case for it I am more concerned with your age and that you have a prostate that has begun producing cancer that with time may not be so friendly. MRI is quickly becoming a more reliable diagnostic tool than TRUS and PI-RADS 4 indicates the possibility of a high risk of significant cancer. Again, more valuable information than the Gleason score at this point. (I assume these samples were from a random biopsy.) You want to play this game for a cure or long life. Erections are third on the list after your life and continence and not worth risking your life, imo. I am curious how you discovered this so early without symptoms or family history. It is unusual to be testing PSA so early. You are very lucky! Do not squander what you have been given by trying to finesse this disease. It's an underestimation of it's seriousness that I see happen too much, imo. It's a beast that can be beat if diagnosed early. You've got that part covered.",

      "Content": "It is true studies are underway, and there is not enough clinical evidence for most to change current treatment protocals. It is the nature of salvage radiation to be most effective against low risk/stage disease. Recurrence in low risk disease has a higher likelyhood of being confined to the prostate bed. SR is effective treating such a limited area. If 3 can't survive outside the gland, then it's 4 or greater creating the BCR. Low detection levels may catch it before it has metastized. Time and waiting on G4 & 5 give it a chance to run or fly which 4 and 5 do. I suspect the thinking was to wait and make the recurrence risk certain and worthy of the side effects. Detection and radiation technology have improved dramaticaly, and what if you're playing for a cure? Why wait? Once you know, waiting is to it's favor not yours if you plan on using SR, imo. For me despite current (outdated?) protocals, if you are going to use the limited value of SR, the sooner the better. AS, imo, is for a high probability treatment will never be necessary. If treatment is a high probability then sooner is better. When playing for a cure sooner is the optimum time for treating prostate cancer, imo. The other option for low to intermediate risk is surgery and done. As always it considers age and other morbidities. The back up is HT and chemo.

SR is effective treating such a limited area. If 3 can't survive outside the gland, then it's 4 or greater creating the BCR. Low detection levels may catch it before it has metastized. Time and waiting on G4 & 5 give it a chance to run or fly which 4 and 5 do. I suspect the thinking was to wait and make the recurrence risk certain and worthy of the side effects. Detection and radiation technology have improved dramaticaly, and what if you're playing for a cure? Why wait? Once you know, waiting is to it's favor not yours if you plan on using SR, imo. For me despite current (outdated?) protocals, if you are going to use the limited value of SR, the sooner the better. AS, imo, is for a high probability treatment will never be necessary. If treatment is a high probability then sooner is better. When playing for a cure sooner is the optimum time for treating prostate cancer, imo. The other option for low to intermediate risk is surgery and done. As always it considers age and other morbidities. The back up is HT and chemo. This is a useful discussion. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2848745/",

      "Content": "The nerves that control the blood held in erections run down alongside the prostate. One on each side. They are not within the prostate. Removing the prostate without damaging them is difficult. Heat from the cauterizing tool in the surgical cavity, disruption of blood flow from the cutting and cauterizing of blood vessels, pushing and pulling off tissue around the nerves all can contribute to damage. Most can heal, but nerve tissue heals much slower than other tissue. If the surgeon sees cancer they will remove it even if it has invaded the space around the nerve. If the nerve is cut it will most likely not be restored with healing. They are difficult to see. A small electrical wire is used to stimulate and reveal them to the surgeon who can visually see them inside the surgical cavity. An advantage of DaVinci. Sometimes the prostate gets large enough that the pressure of the enlarged prostate pressing on the nerve next to it will damage it permanently. Obesity can have a similar effect. Orgasms are controlled by another nerve not at risk with RP. This is the nerve just beneath the head of the penis on the underside. You will still have the ability to have orgasms even if you lose the ability to have an erection. It is recommended you begin exercising both functions after the surgery and continue to have orgasms without erections.

      "Content": "Patience. This takes time to heal. Nerves have been traumatized and blood vessels cartarized. Nerves ( feeling in the area) need to heal and nerve tissue takes longer to heal than other tissue. Blood needs to find other pathways to healing tissue and muscle. Also, it is a temptation to manage the return to continence by drinking less. You may not realize you are doing it. Make note of how much you drink a day to stay hydrated. Wait until your bladder is full then attempt to stop your urine stream mid stream. Eventually you will see this slow or even stop your stream. This will be a good sign. This exercise is only to reassure you it will return. It is not a good exercise for recovery. Do your kegels, but not to an extreme. Muscles will tire and fail before the day is through. One aspect of kegels is to tone the pelvic floor muscles. More importantly, it is to learn to identify them apart from the anus muscles and learn to control them to the point it becomes automatic. Lifting your pelvic floor muscles without tightening your anus is a pat your head rub your tummy exercise. Practise lifting them slowly and stopping and holding on the way up and on the way down. Like an elevator. Alcohol (also hinders healing)and caffeine irritate the bladder and cause a natural loss of control. Consider giving them up until you have your continence back and then reintroduce them and note the effect. You will have to manage their use from here on. Remember - ready, set, relax. Patience and time are now your friends. Your body knows what to do.",

Having been diagnosed with 3+3 via biopsy, upgraded to 3+4 via pathology, and having a tumor size at 35% of a 65gr prostate creating continence issue I have a lot of respect for G6 as a cancer - \"the disease caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in a part of the body.\" The disgruntled who rant about G6 being indolent cancer, over treatment, and money hungry doctors do not add to the conversation to defeat this disease, imo. Many of us want to believe the better part of the message - G6 does not kill. Maybe it doesn't, but in many it is cancer and can cause quality of life issues (incontinence or urinary track obstruction) and indicates a higher risk of more aggressive cancers being present and some of these considerations may be worthy of treatment. I stopped participating in another forum because the shrillness of their message around this issue is a distraction to science, medicine, caring, and may be misleading. Thanks for letting me rant some myself.",

      "Content": "Supplements are a common addiction and part of the denial process. An ongoing healthy diet with regular exercise is work. It promotes general health and strength. Supplements are easy. You buy them and consume them with little effort. Get your BMI between 19 and 25. Reducing body fat takes work and discipline to transform your life habits. Taking supplements does little to nothing to transform your habits or improve health. One example, drinking a high sugar processed fruit juice such as pomegranite juice substitues processed sugar and damaged/empty micro-nutrients for real food. Mega dosing on herbs and vitamins can only stress your liver and kidneys and irtitate your bladder and urethra. It's never too late to begin a healthy diet and exercise regime. It will develop strength. It will not directly cure cancer. Your heightened state of renewed commitment to your health is a good thing. Looking for quick fixes is a warning flag of old behaviors. You know what a healthy life style is. You've known it all your life. Yet here you are. Relax and go about the business of transforming your diet and sedentary life style. Reduce your weight. Stop alcohol. Reduce caffeine. Drink water and tea. Exercise. Reduce red meats. Increase fresh vegetables. Increase olive oil. Eliminate processed foods, fats, dressings. You know the drill. Spend time buying fresh foods, preparing them, and eating them. Learn to eat what's in season. Do not, I repeat, do not focus on reducing your PSA. Your PSA is your friend. Reduce your BMI. I just got back from Italy, you know what? They are thin!",

      "Content": "That is a number so far from current studies I suspect his stats are influenced by his typical patient profile being unique or a quirk in the lab he uses. Making such a public declaration of an anomaly like that makes me wonder what's going on. This debate seems stuck in time. Radiation appears to win the short term \"cure\" side effects. This is great for old men with prostate cancer. But increasingly, younger and younger men are being diagnosed with prostate cancer due both to early screening and a disease that is expanding into a younger demographic. We still do not know the mechanism behind it. I'd like a new drug. A simple injection that shrinks and disapears the tumors with no side effects. Immune therapy seems to be coming on strong. Bottom line, I'm not happy with either radiation or surgery. They both seem to have a very small sweet spot (ideal patient profile).",

      "Content": "I did begin to measure pad weights with a small food scale when it seemed the leaking was dimishing yet I couldn't tell a difference. I'd add them for a day. Then compare a week later. Weigh an empty pad first. I did it mostly to reinforce small changes. Like weighing yourself everyday when you are losing weight. Once you're down to one lite pad the tendency is to slack off on improvements, i.e. stop working your kegels, stop using them when you start a stress move, etc. It did take an extra effort near the end to close the leaks associated with everyday stess moves; i.e. getting in and out of the car, standing up, etc. Mostly just being mindful of the moment and using your kegels with intention. You can always grap yourself and clamp down, if your alone, during a stress move (sneeze, cough, etc.). Regarding the weighing, it was not a straight line. There were small setbacks and variations. Probably due to tiredness, drinking, irritants, and just being human. Coffee, alcohol, caffeine, and other foods/drinks will irritate the blader and contribute to leaking. Some of these never stop having an effect. For example, if I have more than a few drinks I will start to leak if tired. Another example, end of day activities when your kegels are simply tired. When sleeping or lying gravity is not working against you. First improvements are always noticed with sleeping because you are taking gravity out of the equation. Sitting helps as well becauce pressure is pushing upward from the sitting position. The concern never quite goes away, but it does become automatic with time. I always carry a lite pad and very very rarely use it. Usually late at night when drinking. A caution. Subconsciously you may be tempted to drink less to control performance in this matter. Don't. Don't dehyrate yourself. Regarding alcohol, it will inhibit healing. I'd give it up for at least 3 months.",

      "Content": "I have a question. Radiation is suppose to kill the cancer cells, because they are by nature weaker cells, and spare the healthy cells. What stops the radiate prostate from continuing to produce cancer cells? For me, I lost confidence in my prostate to play nice and wanted it removed to halt any further mischief such as future BHP or the remaining cells producing more cancer cells. It is my understanding radiation does not \"kill\" the prostate. It only \"kills\" the cancerous prostate cells at the time of the treatment. The prostate is left alive and \"well\" to continue to do what it has already proven itself to do which is continue to produce both healthy and cancerous prostate cells in the future. In the poster's case, it has proven itself to produce a more aggressive type of cancer cell at an early age. The radiation has no way of determining which healthy cells will eventually be triggered to start producing cancerous cells. Radiation leaves behind a difficult if not impossible mess of damaged tissue to try to clean up 25 years from now. Future radiation is not a useful option making matters worse for all the surrounding tissue/organs, and surgeons do not like operating in or around radiation damaged sites because the radiated tissue is no longer normal healthy tissue. Most prostate cancer is slow growing and begins later in life and most men outlive it. Not so in a younger man with more aggressive cancer. The term \"cure\" in prostate cancer does not mean what we first think it means, i.e. permanent. The word is used in the context of time, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and does not apply well to the younger man or aggressive cancer. For me, its a kick the can down the road game and at the moment there are only 3 kicks I have at it; surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy. Time is the variable to determine how many kicks I'll need. A younger man with aggressive cancer may need all three and more. An old man may need none. Everyone else falls somewhere between.",

      "Content": "Pathology reports are not 100%. They may choose to use time and cost saving methods and take a sampling of slices based on their observation of the gland and judgment. Interestingly, their observation of the margins is over 90% accurate. Or, one doctor's 6 is another's 3+4. That being said I am not yet convinced than Gleason 6 can not survive alone. It may not be fatal but that is a whole other calculus. It may be internet creep, i.e. Gleason 6 rarely metastasizes talk turns in to it can't survive outside the prostate. It may survive and grow slowly, but still not metastasize. It seems there is a lot we still don't know.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Duck2 Feed a cold, starve a fever, so what is happening in this suggestion is starve both good and bad cells. I know nothing about this method, but.... Starving prostate cells of testosterone can cause unhealthy cancer cells to be stunned into remission for long periods of time or forever, or even kill them. Healthy cells can survive this. Also, treating cells with (toxic) radiation is similar. Prostate cancer cells have less DNA redundancy and most can not survive radiation while most healthy cells can. While healthy and unhealthy cancer cells both get treated with radiation the cancer cells have less ability to survive it than the healthy ones. You can compound this weakening effect with testosterone starvation causing the cancer prostate cells to be even more vulnerable to the radiation. Management of toxic treatments can be a useful tool treating cancer. Chemo is another. Ideal? No, but it works enough in part to extend life or survive cancer. Does it work with nutrition? I don't know, but the concept is sound with other harsh treatments. There is some truth in the line, \"What doesn't kill you can make you stronger.\" On the other side you may not be as healthy as before, but the cancer may be less so. I have a good friend that eventually succumbed to chemo therapy as a last effort. It worked for a while, but probably added to her demise. She survived breast cancer for 10 years. She was grateful and so was I. It was the ten years I knew her. Personally, I think a healthy diet is more beneficial than an unhealthy one, but I can see the possiblity only test studies can reveal.",

How I see it is they are different treatments. It's like asking what's a better way to travel; planes, trains, or automobiles? If it's very close you can walk. To far to walk you can drive. To far to drive you can fly. Each mode is more effective than another for a specific travel profile. Some are afraid to fly so they drive or take a bus. They all get you somewhere. They all work for what they are designed to do, and they are not universally interchangeable. They are different. Surgery and radiation each have a specific patient profile that makes them more effective for that profile than the other. I will not go so far as to say they are interchangable. One can be done in lieu of the other in lots of profiles. It doesn't mean it is better. There are clear patient profiles where the majority of professionals will agree on the mode of treatment. Then a clear profile where either will work with pros and cons. Then there are those profiles that exclude one treatment as not medically possible or recommended. There are multible biases; provider bias, patient bias, and confirmation bias. Provider bias: surgeons prefer surgery and radiologist prefer radiotherapy. Yet competent professionals will acknowledge when the patient's profile trumps their skill set and is better served by the other. Patient bias: each of us has a bias for surgery or radiation independent of what we know and our own profile. For example, going in I'd hope my profile matches up with surgery. That bias comes from thinking if it's small, unentangled, and can be cleanly removed - remove it. My bias is against radiation as toxic and crude and used when the line between healthy and diseased tissue can not be made with a scaple. Sounds very reasonable, but it is still a bias that tempts me to hear only those things about my profile supporting surgety. (Someone with a radiation bias can speak for that.) Confirmation bias: a patient chooses and then begins to listen for any and only evidence that supports his choice as the best choice. This is automatic and we all do it. The upside is we have a multitude of effective, tried, and proven treatment choices. The best advice is to stay out of the weeds and go main stream, imo. This is a little off topic, but it applies to how we misuse language. If you use the words right and wrong, better or worse, good or bad you are making a moral judgment. Those words are exclusive to moral language yet we collapse them into other judgment choices. The consideration is what will work and how effective will it be.

Interestingly, their observation of the margins is over 90% accurate. Or, one doctor's 6 is another's 3+4. That being said I am not yet convinced than Gleason 6 can not survive alone. It may not be fatal but that is a whole other calculus. It may be internet creep, i.e. Gleason 6 rarely metastasizes talk turns in to it can't survive outside the prostate. It may survive and grow slowly, but still not metastasize. It seems there is a lot we still don't know.",

      "Content": "Patience. This takes time to heal. Nerves have been traumatized and blood vessels cartarized. Nerves ( feeling in the area) need to heal and nerve tissue takes longer to heal than other tissue. Blood needs to find other pathways to healing tissue and muscle. Also, it is a temptation to manage the return to continence by drinking less. You may not realize you are doing it. Make note of how much you drink a day to stay hydrated. Wait until your bladder is full then attempt to stop your urine stream mid stream. Eventually you will see this slow or even stop your stream. This will be a good sign. This exercise is only to reassure you it will return. It is not a good exercise for recovery. Do your kegels, but not to an extreme. Muscles will tire and fail before the day is through. One aspect of kegels is to tone the pelvic floor muscles. More importantly, it is to learn to identify them apart from the anus muscles and learn to control them to the point it becomes automatic. Lifting your pelvic floor muscles without tightening your anus is a pat your head rub your tummy exercise. Practise lifting them slowly and stopping and holding on the way up and on the way down. Like an elevator. Alcohol (also hinders healing)and caffeine irritate the bladder and cause a natural loss of control. Consider giving them up until you have your continence back and then reintroduce them and note the effect. You will have to manage their use from here on. Remember - ready, set, relax. Patience and time are now your friends. Your body knows what to do.",

When you let an outcome hang out there unexplained and undefended you allow the space for the impact on those who's bias is to immediately deny the cause you present. It is a very powerful way to make a point. Those who advocated for the reduction in screening are left to their own thoughts. It took a lot of discipline for the designers of this study to limit their study to just the results, but highly effective. Glad to see it. My girlfriend emailed this to me yesterday, and her conclusion was as obvious as it is to most except those who were responsible for the reduction in screening. It will take longer for them to adjust their thinking to the facts. It works to give them the space to be alone with the facts and their responsibility in it.",

Typically SVI is viewed as very serious adverse pathology and is justification for immediate adjuvant radiation. SVI may be an indicator it's too late for localized treatment success in that direction. The location of the extension can be an indicator of risk recurrence and treatment success. Cancer at the base is higher risk in general. It may be more difficult to reach effectively without unacceptable side effects. SVs extend up and behind the bladder. Early detection and treatment may still be a gold standard.",

How I see it is they are different treatments. It's like asking what's a better way to travel; planes, trains, or automobiles? If it's very close you can walk. To far to walk you can drive. To far to drive you can fly. Each mode is more effective than another for a specific travel profile. Some are afraid to fly so they drive or take a bus. They all get you somewhere. They all work for what they are designed to do, and they are not universally interchangeable. They are different. Surgery and radiation each have a specific patient profile that makes them more effective for that profile than the other. I will not go so far as to say they are interchangable. One can be done in lieu of the other in lots of profiles. It doesn't mean it is better. There are clear patient profiles where the majority of professionals will agree on the mode of treatment. Then a clear profile where either will work with pros and cons. Then there are those profiles that exclude one treatment as not medically possible or recommended. There are multible biases; provider bias, patient bias, and confirmation bias. Provider bias: surgeons prefer surgery and radiologist prefer radiotherapy. Yet competent professionals will acknowledge when the patient's profile trumps their skill set and is better served by the other. Patient bias: each of us has a bias for surgery or radiation independent of what we know and our own profile. For example, going in I'd hope my profile matches up with surgery. That bias comes from thinking if it's small, unentangled, and can be cleanly removed - remove it. My bias is against radiation as toxic and crude and used when the line between healthy and diseased tissue can not be made with a scaple. Sounds very reasonable, but it is still a bias that tempts me to hear only those things about my profile supporting surgety. (Someone with a radiation bias can speak for that.) Confirmation bias: a patient chooses and then begins to listen for any and only evidence that supports his choice as the best choice. This is automatic and we all do it. The upside is we have a multitude of effective, tried, and proven treatment choices. The best advice is to stay out of the weeds and go main stream, imo. This is a little off topic, but it applies to how we misuse language. If you use the words right and wrong, better or worse, good or bad you are making a moral judgment. Those words are exclusive to moral language yet we collapse them into other judgment choices. The consideration is what will work and how effective will it be.

Are you in a higher risk ethnic group? MRIs can miss detecting both small low grade and small aggressive cancers. Biopsy can miss also and there is a risk of other more aggressive cancer being present and undetected. Your young age is a wild card. Your survival challenge is greater because your exposure is longer. A cancer that begins growing so soon will have a longer time to generate mischief regardless of it's aggressiveness. Volume alone can eventually impact quality of life causing all the symptoms of more aggressive cancers. In general, early detection and early treatment yields better results with this disease. You are a candidate for AS, but more diagnostic efforts are part of that protocol to monitor your cancer. \"A\" means active. Your PSA is high for your age and cancer type.

My advice is to choose the treatment and schedule that places your health and well being first. As a son and father it is what I would do and want my children to do and hope my children would want me to do. I'd also share this information with my immediate family once I made my choice. Without a long discourse, witholding information is manipulative. We can handle it and one thing doesn't overshadow another. Life is messy and it finds a way to bring joy to those who live it full out with nothing hidden. Placing any responsibility for nothing but the best outcome for you on your view of what is best for someone else doesn't work. This is an inconvenience for you. You can handle this without drama and worry. Not that there won't be some, but you get to say how this goes and your family will follow your lead.",

      "Content": "Also, if your PSA is an effective indicator and the supplement reduces or manupulates it in anyway you will lose your very valuable baseline. Manipulation of PSA does not impact the cancer and it will continue to grow only now your PSA can not be trusted to track it for you. Also, short term relief of symptoms is a booby prize that gives the cancer a head start. If you are having difficult urinating remember your body is trying to tell you something. Self diagnose at your own peril. Just because some food, diet, or supplement regime reduces your PSA or makes it easier to pee for a while does not mean it is reducing the cancer. At the moment, there is no magic pill. If your goal is to detect and treat cancer stay within conventional protocols. They work. Do not wander into the weeds.",

      "Content": "My choice was surgery to remove as much of the source of the cancer as possible and to determine as complete a pathology of the cancer as possible. Then radiation to follow. Since both surgery and radiation are effective in different ways I wanted the most effective benefits of both. Fortunately my age, physical and mental fitness, diagnosis, and resources were suited for this approach. I am playing the game with one goal, to die of something else. Knowing that achieving a goal is most successful when separated into smaller incremental goals I do not expect this to happen in one event, but a series of smaller consecutive events until the day I pass of something else. In support of Jim's very important note regarding test limitations, it is not certain your cancer is confined to your prostate, and your scans are clear of detectable levels of cancer. The scans are not certain either. You have Gleason 4 cancer and your PSA is over 10. Those facts are more certain. As a technical writer you can understand the temptations that exist in the use of language, and how we step over the details to hear what we want. This also applies to the temptation to over think an issue to avoid the obvious and unpleasant realities. It explains your lengthy post and conclusion to pursue a treatment that is very much less used than others raising the very obvious question why? And in your signature, May 2017 with radiation oncologist decided to use IMRT to eliminate the malignancy. Not certain how that can be guaranteed. In the same reference to use of language, referring to Gleason grading as a flip of the coin is dangerous thinking. It is a professional assessment made by experienced doctors of pathology using a scoring system many decades in the making. They may differ slightly, but rarely are mistakes made and it is not a random selection. You may seek a second opinion of your Gleason score. Also, your rise in PSA did not come out of the blue. A 3.9 was a serious warning flag yet you allowed 2 years to pass before checking it again, and may even have ignored a recommendation to consider a biopsy then. All of this is not to beat you up or point out what you did wrong. It is to warn you how we use language to mislead ourselves and justify who, what, and where we are in our lives. My advice, get clear in your language and get out of your head. For most of us, this disease becomes an opportunity to clear our heads and learn again how to focus on what is real and important. It shows up first in our language.",

      "Content": "Why are you being screened for prostate cancer at your very young age? Why was the MRI done before your biopsy? Why is the doctor recommending surgery? Are you in a higher risk ethnic group? MRIs can miss detecting both small low grade and small aggressive cancers. Biopsy can miss also and there is a risk of other more aggressive cancer being present and undetected. Your young age is a wild card. Your survival challenge is greater because your exposure is longer. A cancer that begins growing so soon will have a longer time to generate mischief regardless of it's aggressiveness. Volume alone can eventually impact quality of life causing all the symptoms of more aggressive cancers. In general, early detection and early treatment yields better results with this disease. You are a candidate for AS, but more diagnostic efforts are part of that protocol to monitor your cancer. \"A\" means active. Your PSA is high for your age and cancer type. A second opinion on the Gleason scoring is recommended, imo, as well as genetic testing. You are fortunate to have discovered this.",

      "Content": "My choice was surgery to remove as much of the source of the cancer as possible and to determine as complete a pathology of the cancer as possible. Then radiation to follow. Since both surgery and radiation are effective in different ways I wanted the most effective benefits of both. Fortunately my age, physical and mental fitness, diagnosis, and resources were suited for this approach. I am playing the game with one goal, to die of something else. Knowing that achieving a goal is most successful when separated into smaller incremental goals I do not expect this to happen in one event, but a series of smaller consecutive events until the day I pass of something else. In support of Jim's very important note regarding test limitations, it is not certain your cancer is confined to your prostate, and your scans are clear of detectable levels of cancer. The scans are not certain either. You have Gleason 4 cancer and your PSA is over 10. Those facts are more certain. As a technical writer you can understand the temptations that exist in the use of language, and how we step over the details to hear what we want. This also applies to the temptation to over think an issue to avoid the obvious and unpleasant realities. It explains your lengthy post and conclusion to pursue a treatment that is very much less used than others raising the very obvious question why? And in your signature, May 2017 with radiation oncologist decided to use IMRT to eliminate the malignancy. Not certain how that can be guaranteed. In the same reference to use of language, referring to Gleason grading as a flip of the coin is dangerous thinking. It is a professional assessment made by experienced doctors of pathology using a scoring system many decades in the making. They may differ slightly, but rarely are mistakes made and it is not a random selection. You may seek a second opinion of your Gleason score. Also, your rise in PSA did not come out of the blue. A 3.9 was a serious warning flag yet you allowed 2 years to pass before checking it again, and may even have ignored a recommendation to consider a biopsy then. All of this is not to beat you up or point out what you did wrong. It is to warn you how we use language to mislead ourselves and justify who, what, and where we are in our lives. My advice, get clear in your language and get out of your head. For most of us, this disease becomes an opportunity to clear our heads and learn again how to focus on what is real and important. It shows up first in our language.",

      "Content": "Many want to make the choice between radiation and surgery a choice between the best treatment choice, i.e. one is a better choice than another. How I see it is they are different treatments. It's like asking what's a better way to travel; planes, trains, or automobiles? If it's very close you can walk. To far to walk you can drive. To far to drive you can fly. Each mode is more effective than another for a specific travel profile. Some are afraid to fly so they drive or take a bus. They all get you somewhere. They all work for what they are designed to do, and they are not universally interchangeable. They are different. Surgery and radiation each have a specific patient profile that makes them more effective for that profile than the other. I will not go so far as to say they are interchangable. One can be done in lieu of the other in lots of profiles. It doesn't mean it is better. There are clear patient profiles where the majority of professionals will agree on the mode of treatment. Then a clear profile where either will work with pros and cons. Then there are those profiles that exclude one treatment as not medically possible or recommended. There are multible biases; provider bias, patient bias, and confirmation bias. Provider bias: surgeons prefer surgery and radiologist prefer radiotherapy. Yet competent professionals will acknowledge when the patient's profile trumps their skill set and is better served by the other. Patient bias: each of us has a bias for surgery or radiation independent of what we know and our own profile. For example, going in I'd hope my profile matches up with surgery. That bias comes from thinking if it's small, unentangled, and can be cleanly removed - remove it. My bias is against radiation as toxic and crude and used when the line between healthy and diseased tissue can not be made with a scaple. Sounds very reasonable, but it is still a bias that tempts me to hear only those things about my profile supporting surgety. (Someone with a radiation bias can speak for that.) Confirmation bias: a patient chooses and then begins to listen for any and only evidence that supports his choice as the best choice. This is automatic and we all do it. The upside is we have a multitude of effective, tried, and proven treatment choices. The best advice is to stay out of the weeds and go main stream, imo. This is a little off topic, but it applies to how we misuse language. If you use the words right and wrong, better or worse, good or bad you are making a moral judgment. Those words are exclusive to moral language yet we collapse them into other judgment choices. The consideration is what will work and how effective will it be. We want to be right more than anything often times at the expense of what works.",

      "Content": "A note about the antibiotic drill for elevated PSA. Imo, it is bad medicine. The over use of antibiotics for elevated PSA, particularly short term, is a serious issue that can later result in complications during the biopsy and surgery. Studies have shown that some who experience sepsis after biopsy also had antibiotic treatment for elevated PSA. Your age, PSA, symptoms, and negative urine culture are evidence enough to test for cancer and not treat for a bacterial infection. Studies also show there will be a chance of a slight decrease in your PSA as a result of the antibiotics in the presence of cancer that some will use as a reason to postpone a biopsy. There is a belief, which I consider now to be outdated and verging on harmful myth, that prostate cancer is slow growing and you will not die from it and it leads some to take a casual approach to it's symptoms and diagnoses. I did. There is some truth in it, but many will tell you that during the diagnoses is not the time to take the possibility lightly. That truth only applies when there is some evidence that supports it, such as a biopsy grading it as non aggressive. Living with prostate cancer is no cake walk even if it doesn't kill you! Your symptoms presenting at a young age increase the possibility of it being a more aggressive form of the cancer. Regarding your question about late stages, probably not, but it is not a relevant question (not a bad question). Prostate cancer has high probability of a \"cure\" when detected early. There are some grades that are relatively indolent and hang around growing slowly. Other's are more aggressive and head out into the body quickly. All of them benefit from early diagnosis, and will be something you treat and manage the rest of your life.",

      "Content": "The 4+3 is not slow growing and you have a significant amount of it. Be careful to not collapse your facts, i.e. PC is slow growing, into all the facts. The majority of prostate cancer is slow growing. The majority of PC is 3+3 and 3+4. You have 4+3. It is not slow growing and it is not like 3+4. Because of your young age surgery now and radiation later is the most common path. Best case scenario is surgery does the trick, but with 4 +3 recurrence is more of a concern. Let's say your recurrence happens in 10 years. You then treat with radiation at 64. If it comes back in another 10 years you have hormones at 74 and that gets you what it gets you. Short story, surgery first buys you a longer treatment game. As a youg person, my view is to treat this as a chronic disease you manage such as diabetes. PC \"cures\" mostly are windows of time. Radiation leaves the prostate in place. Generally not a problem for an older person who will die of something else before the prostate regenerates the cancer that was irradicated by the radiation, if it was a slow growing type, i.e. 3s or 3+4s. If a higher grade it can regenerate sooner. With a successful surgery only minute amounts of prostate remain to continue to harbor or generate cancer. Again if you are producing 3s and 3+4s not a big problem, but if you are producing 4s and up it moves quicker. This scenario is more managable with follow up radiation and/or hormone therapy. Worst case scenario is that of a good friend of mine with 4+3 and 57. Surgery missed a significant portion. The suspicion is they were to go wide on the right and went wide on the left instead. Follow up radiation was not very effective, and he is now looking at hormone therapy from this point forward. All side effects are present. Not a happy camper. So, best advice imo, don't dally with primary G4, start with surgery, and most important find a competent team.",

I am (well was!) very active, and had in the past year or so started - rather irregularly - taking a glucosamine/chondroitin supplement - into the garbage as I speak! Responsible for the change seen in the last year? Hmmmm (fortunately, I do most of the other dietary things Another suggested) I have found maintaining my D3 level with the appropriate support of calcium and a few other vitamins and minerals that work in conjunction with D3 for bone health over time has improved my joint issues. It took about a year. I now ask they include a D3 blood test with my annual physical metabolic panel. Vitamin D3 is very individual in absorption and conversion. It is generally accepted older Americans, for whatever reason and there are suspicions why, are showing up deficient in D3. A few years ago my internist recommended a 2,000 unit daily supplement as standard. I consider it main stream for the moment. We will see.",

      "Content": "Not that I am aware. You can have a diet including supplements and exercise that improves your overall health and is designed specifically for older men. Some of the things that I do and watch are; Maintain BMI 19-24 (Very hard to do if you don't change your diet/life style) Exercise 80mg of chewable aspirin every other day General multivitamin D3 and monitor your levels (recommend min 2000 units daily, I take 4000, it is very individual therefore the D3 testing) Calcium, K2, and magnesium to support D3 Olive oil as #1 oil in diet. Use liberally Avoid or moderate use of vegetable oils, again use olive oil Make your own salad dressing oil, vinegar, and spices/herbs in the bowl with the salad. Avoid manufactured dressings. No palm oil and hydrogenated oil/spread products Less red meat (once a week) More Omega 3 fatty acids in diet (not supplements), i.e. salmon, sardines, etc. Less refined sugar and carbohydrate products and sugary drinks/juices including fruit juice Use honey as a sweetner No artificial sweeteners A colorful vegetables diet beans onions Fruit Green tea (I have 1 cup a day and take mine w/ginger, lemon, & honey) Moderate nuts and seeds Moderate alcohol Less all things dairy Some of the spices/herbs are considered beneficial and anti-inflammatory, i.e. garlic, ginger, turmeric (Curcumin), black & cayenne pepper, oregano. A Mediterranean or Asian diet Fermented foods for colon health including kimchi, kefir, all cultured after/if pasteurized Make your own hummus. Stupid easy. Eat it with fresh vegetables not chips/pita. Chew your food and eat slowly, drink water moderately with your food as you eat. (not cold water) Never eat from the container. Take a portion and step away to eat it. No smoking/vaping Actual fresh food as the source of the above is better than supplements. Sometimes fresh frozen maintains more nutrients to market than \"fresh\" vegetables/fruit picked green and time spent getting to market. Home made smoothies are a good way to maintain calories while upping fresh nutrient value. What I have noticed as I age is my body is more efficient with my calories, or I am less active, and as we age our digestive systems become less effective processing some nutrients. Regardless, I eat less and can not waste precious calories on foods that don't contribute to my nutrient needs. This is where supplements come in. For me, they become a necessary component in maintaining nutrient content levels in low calorie/volume diets. The sugar feeds cancer is a myth. What sugar does is shortcut the body into consuming it for energy in lieu of consuming/processing more complex foods thereby missing their nutrients. Sugars, corn syrups, and other naturally sourced processed sweeteners have been stripped of their nutrient content while maintaining high caloric content. Be careful embracing supplement regimens for cancer. They are generally untested with unknown side effects. My example is I used chondroitin for joint health only to discover it was found in the removed prostates of men with cancer and is highly recommended to be avoided. http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supp...y/hrb-20058926 \"Chondroitin may promote spread or recurrence of prostate cancer.\" Source supplements carefully. Many studies exist that reveal supplements do not match their label often with additional unknown compounds. They are an unregulated industry, financially lucrative, highly promoted, and market driven by wishful thinking looking for better health without the work and discipline to make life style changes. It would not surprise me to discover supplement manufacturers/online retailers use trolls on sites like these to promote the latest supplement regimen for something.",

      "Content": "I assume prostate cells regenerate the gland by dividing. Enlarging prostate is caused by older cells not dying in a normal cell life time period. Something shifts and they live longer, and the gland begins to enlarge. To me, that alone is a precursor of a shifting dna similar to cancer if not cancer, i.e. precancerous activity. I assume a \"healthy\" cell produces a cancerous one i.e. G3, 4, 5, etc. Does a cell produce just 3s, or 3s and sometimes 4s. Or, does the way a cell shifts to producing cancer cells remain static? A specific \"healthy\" cell will only produce 3s. It seems most common they will produce relatively close to a specific aggressiveness, i.e. 3s & 4s, or 4s & 5s, 8s & 9s, etc. In this scenario I can see how one specific gland may have a set pattern of aggressiveness. Now, are they points on a line, i.e. some 3s are more aggressive than other 3s? I suspect so leading to some 3s become volume problems while others do not. 2s are never a problem. 3s may be or not depending on their aggressiveness within the range of 3. 4s and up are always a problem regardless of amount. \"Healthy\" cells if producing 4s will continue to produce 4s. Do they produce them at a consistent rate across the gland? Will 4s always represent 5% of a specific glands tumor production? Even if this is the case, 4s now have a life of their own and they prefer to live it elsewhere in the body. Time is a factor so now the reference to doubling time. At some point, depending on your age and the nature of that 4, it will overwelhm the 3s and the effective outcome of metastasis will be 4s galore. Is time the only distinction between 3+4 and 4+3?",

If you do not have the information that is being asked for here then get an actual copy of the biopsy report. Many health systems have online patient portals where reports are listed. If not, call the doctor's office and get it. Start a digital and paper file of all lab tests and pathology reports inclduing your PSA. The signature information is important mostly for you.

      "Content": "Those are all good signs. It took a year for me and is still improving two years later. Nerve tissue is much slower to heal than other tissue. Even when spared the nerves are traumatized by the procedure. The specific nerves affected are the ones that operate the valves that hold/trap the blood in the penis during erection. Standing helps gravity keep the blood in the penis as you \"exercise.\" Sustaining the erection will come last, so to speak. In the meantime, learning to orgasm with a less than fully erect penis takes some practise. We are conditioned that one precedes the other. This is more of a mental exercise. The nerves that facilitate the orgasm itself are unaffected by the procedure. Patience is the word. Experiment with the ED drugs. Cialis was more effective than Viagra for me. Still, they only increase blood flow. They do not stimulate the nerves that hold the erection in place. Blood flow does aid the healing of those nerves. What once was automatic fun now seems like work. Toss in uncertainty and anxiety shows up to ruin the party. This is an inconvenience for the two of you. For now, make lemonade. Together you will experience a different view of intimacy. For him, it now becomes about you.",

      "Content": "Not that I am aware. You can have a diet including supplements and exercise that improves your overall health and is designed specifically for older men. Some of the things that I do and watch are; Maintain BMI 19-24 (Very hard to do if you don't change your diet/life style) Exercise 80mg of chewable aspirin every other day General multivitamin D3 and monitor your levels (recommend min 2000 units daily, I take 4000, it is very individual therefore the D3 testing) Calcium, K2, and magnesium to support D3 Olive oil as #1 oil in diet. Use liberally Avoid or moderate use of vegetable oils, again use olive oil Make your own salad dressing oil, vinegar, and spices/herbs in the bowl with the salad. Avoid manufactured dressings. No palm oil and hydrogenated oil/spread products Less red meat (once a week) More Omega 3 fatty acids in diet (not supplements), i.e. salmon, sardines, etc. Less refined sugar and carbohydrate products and sugary drinks/juices including fruit juice Use honey as a sweetner No artificial sweeteners A colorful vegetables diet beans onions Fruit Green tea (I have 1 cup a day and take mine w/ginger, lemon, & honey) Moderate nuts and seeds Moderate alcohol Less all things dairy Some of the spices/herbs are considered beneficial and anti-inflammatory, i.e. garlic, ginger, turmeric (Curcumin), black & cayenne pepper, oregano. A Mediterranean or Asian diet Fermented foods for colon health including kimchi, kefir, all cultured after/if pasteurized Make your own hummus. Stupid easy. Eat it with fresh vegetables not chips/pita. Chew your food and eat slowly, drink water moderately with your food as you eat. (not cold water) Never eat from the container. Take a portion and step away to eat it. No smoking/vaping Actual fresh food as the source of the above is better than supplements. Sometimes fresh frozen maintains more nutrients to market than \"fresh\" vegetables/fruit picked green and time spent getting to market. Home made smoothies are a good way to maintain calories while upping fresh nutrient value. What I have noticed as I age is my body is more efficient with my calories, or I am less active, and as we age our digestive systems become less effective processing some nutrients. Regardless, I eat less and can not waste precious calories on foods that don't contribute to my nutrient needs. This is where supplements come in. For me, they become a necessary component in maintaining nutrient content levels in low calorie/volume diets. The sugar feeds cancer is a myth. What sugar does is shortcut the body into consuming it for energy in lieu of consuming/processing more complex foods thereby missing their nutrients. Sugars, corn syrups, and other naturally sourced processed sweeteners have been stripped of their nutrient content while maintaining high caloric content. Be careful embracing supplement regimens for cancer. They are generally untested with unknown side effects. My example is I used chondroitin for joint health only to discover it was found in the removed prostates of men with cancer and is highly recommended to be avoided. http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supp...y/hrb-20058926 \"Chondroitin may promote spread or recurrence of prostate cancer.\" Source supplements carefully. Many studies exist that reveal supplements do not match their label often with additional unknown compounds. They are an unregulated industry, financially lucrative, highly promoted, and market driven by wishful thinking looking for better health without the work and discipline to make life style changes. It would not surprise me to discover supplement manufacturers/online retailers use trolls on sites like these to promote the latest supplement regimen for something.",

Scans are an indicator of the seriouness. They will show if detectable levels of cancer have metastized. There are limits to the sensitivity of these tests. Clear scans are a good thing, but not certainty the cancer has not begun to spread below the levels of the test. You can not assume clear scans mean confined to the prostate. Regardless, it is a good thing to have discovered it, and many options are available for treatment, and a long life is possible. Stay on top of it, be positive, and be prepared to accept it. He will be living with it as a concern from now on. PNI is what this cancer does. It has not proven to be an indicator of much, except it is cancer, so don't dwell on it. Prostate cancer will follow the nerve pathways out of the gland. That is PNI. It is present most of the time when cancer is present.",

Your prostate is twice normal size. This is not moderate, imo, and causes a concern about the experience of who is reading it. Pheripheral zone cancer is difficult to biopsy. A fusion guided biopsy is next. Using MRIs for PC is new business and skill/interpretation/experience can vary. Stay on top of this and do not hang your hat on just one fact such as this MRI reading.

      "Content": "Your age and the volume of cancer you have indicates eventual treatment. The question then is what type treatment and when. You're still a candidate for surgery, but that window narrows as cancer volume expands and age increases. Surgery sooner than later is best for surgery outcomes. If you choose radiation you may want to meet with a radiation team to assess your options for eventual treatment. Then you will have completed the AS game plan which includes a plan for future treatment. AS doesn't put everything on hold. Regarding your language, you may think you are a good candidate for AS, but the medical community does not agree. So be clear in that. Your plan is more watchful waiting or let's wait 6 months and see what happens. Not that there is anything wrong with this. I make this distinction becasue AS is a very succesful program that many will be tempted to coop as cover for non treatment, indecision, or simply waiting. This calculation also includes a best guess at your normal life expectancy usually based on family history. In the end, a biopsy is a crude and incomplete diagnostic tool. Part of your calculation includes acceptance you only have a piece of the picture. Bottom line, most medical professionals will disagree with your choice. The peculiar state of the prostate conversation today means most will not push back hard on whatever you decide. They state their view and move on. What did your doctor recommend?",

      "Content": "Pathology reports are not 100%. They may choose to use time and cost saving methods and take a sampling of slices based on their observation of the gland and judgment. Interestingly, their observation of the margins is over 90% accurate. Or, one doctor's 6 is another's 3+4. That being said I am not yet convinced than Gleason 6 can not survive alone. It may not be fatal but that is a whole other calculus. It may be internet creep, i.e. Gleason 6 rarely metastasizes talk turns in to it can't survive outside the prostate. It may survive and grow slowly, but still not metastasize. It seems there is a lot we still don't know.",

      "Content": "What is your life expectancy? I put mine at between 85 and 90 on thelie side. Of course, you can die anytime, but some things are obvious; family history, fitness habits, and your personal commitment to your health. There are life expectancy calculators on line. Most insurance companies provide them. They seem remarkably accurate. They are the masters of actuarials. They put mine at 86. It seems accurate, if conservative. You can play with the differences of weight, exercise, drinking and smoking. They do not go into family history or mental health. I've had several parents and grandparent live into their 90s so there is that. Assess your mental health. Depression, even if not chronic, can be a factor in your thinking and can impact your view of your healthcare. Your PSA history indicates a reluctance to deal with healthcare issues effectively. Early detection early treatment is the mantra for prostate cancer, or any cancer. PC seems to have gotten a dangerous reputation as being non life threatening. You now know differently, or do you? If you do nothing, it is unlikely you will die of something else as most men are eager to quote (if not believe). Research death from prostate cancer. It can happen as quickly as 3 to 5 years. Research PC lymphatic invasion as the adverse condition you are confronting. PC can be successfully managed for a long time in many cases. You don't know if you don't try. We have plenty of history and diagnostic tools to help, but it is clear we can't predict how it is going to go for any one person. In fairness to you it's also a question for your doctors; what will happen if I do nothing? And, it is a very good question we all ask ourselves. If more men asked it and got it answered for themselves in a timely manner (sooner) we'd have less of them here. There may come a time for all of us when we are confronted with a treatment option worse than death. Imo, this isn't it for you unless you are dying of something else in the next 5 years you haven't shared with us. I may be wrong, but it seems you hesitated once before with this disease and here you are. Do it again and you may not have this second chance a third time.",

      "Content": "I have a question. Radiation is suppose to kill the cancer cells, because they are by nature weaker cells, and spare the healthy cells. What stops the radiate prostate from continuing to produce cancer cells? For me, I lost confidence in my prostate to play nice and wanted it removed to halt any further mischief such as future BHP or the remaining cells producing more cancer cells. It is my understanding radiation does not \"kill\" the prostate. It only \"kills\" the cancerous prostate cells at the time of the treatment. The prostate is left alive and \"well\" to continue to do what it has already proven itself to do which is continue to produce both healthy and cancerous prostate cells in the future. In the poster's case, it has proven itself to produce a more aggressive type of cancer cell at an early age. The radiation has no way of determining which healthy cells will eventually be triggered to start producing cancerous cells. Radiation leaves behind a difficult if not impossible mess of damaged tissue to try to clean up 25 years from now. Future radiation is not a useful option making matters worse for all the surrounding tissue/organs, and surgeons do not like operating in or around radiation damaged sites because the radiated tissue is no longer normal healthy tissue. Most prostate cancer is slow growing and begins later in life and most men outlive it. Not so in a younger man with more aggressive cancer. The term \"cure\" in prostate cancer does not mean what we first think it means, i.e. permanent. The word is used in the context of time, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and does not apply well to the younger man or aggressive cancer. For me, its a kick the can down the road game and at the moment there are only 3 kicks I have at it; surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy. Time is the variable to determine how many kicks I'll need. A younger man with aggressive cancer may need all three and more. An old man may need none. Everyone else falls somewhere between.",

Without a long discourse, witholding information is manipulative. We can handle it and one thing doesn't overshadow another. Life is messy and it finds a way to bring joy to those who live it full out with nothing hidden. Placing any responsibility for nothing but the best outcome for you on your view of what is best for someone else doesn't work. This is an inconvenience for you.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by fishinguy I had a surgeon with well over 3500 surgery's, he did two per day, occasionally more. When talking to the people prepping me they saw my previous appendix scars and commented about scar tissue. I asked if that would be an issue, they said they didn't think so but that the surgeon was extremely particular how equipment was placed into me, and the angle of every piece. That told me two things, 1) he had a team he's worked with very often and they knew what he expected and 2) muscle memory must be very important to him and how he moves those instruments. I've had wonderful results from my surgery. Agreed. My surgeon valued his team above everything else. I had my choice of hospital locations. I asked his preference and he chose a location I would have avoided. His reason, the team was far superior. When I met them I concurred : ) The team head nurse had done more than twice the procedures than my surgeon.",

      "Content": "A note about the antibiotic drill for elevated PSA. Imo, it is bad medicine. The over use of antibiotics for elevated PSA, particularly short term, is a serious issue that can later result in complications during the biopsy and surgery. Studies have shown that some who experience sepsis after biopsy also had antibiotic treatment for elevated PSA. Your age, PSA, symptoms, and negative urine culture are evidence enough to test for cancer and not treat for a bacterial infection. Studies also show there will be a chance of a slight decrease in your PSA as a result of the antibiotics in the presence of cancer that some will use as a reason to postpone a biopsy. There is a belief, which I consider now to be outdated and verging on harmful myth, that prostate cancer is slow growing and you will not die from it and it leads some to take a casual approach to it's symptoms and diagnoses. I did. There is some truth in it, but many will tell you that during the diagnoses is not the time to take the possibility lightly. That truth only applies when there is some evidence that supports it, such as a biopsy grading it as non aggressive. Living with prostate cancer is no cake walk even if it doesn't kill you! Your symptoms presenting at a young age increase the possibility of it being a more aggressive form of the cancer. Regarding your question about late stages, probably not, but it is not a relevant question (not a bad question). Prostate cancer has high probability of a \"cure\" when detected early. There are some grades that are relatively indolent and hang around growing slowly. Other's are more aggressive and head out into the body quickly. All of them benefit from early diagnosis, and will be something you treat and manage the rest of your life.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear this news. You've found a good source that is served by many experienced men with this disease. I am relatively new to this. This is what I can share. You are very fortunate to have discovered this. Your age, the amount of cancer and it's locations are serious indicators of something you may want to consider treating aggressively. Your age indicates this may be more aggressive than the Gleason scores you have available suggest. You can get a second opinion on the grading. There is also a chance they can be upgraded when examined after surgery. That happened in my case. I believe your doctor's are giving you very good advice. I am very impressed with an oncologist recommending surgery. It points to the seriousness of your situation, that it is still possible to play for a cure keeping the possibility of radiation as your second line of defense. Open vs Robotics debate is unclear to me. My understanding is outcomes at this point rely entirely on the skill of the surgeon. Robotics has a greater learning curve and cost, but ultimately may win out due to the ability of the surgeon to see under magnification what he is doing. Cyberknife is for low and intermediate risk cancers. While it is tempting to look at your Gleason scores and make a case for it I am more concerned with your age and that you have a prostate that has begun producing cancer that with time may not be so friendly. MRI is quickly becoming a more reliable diagnostic tool than TRUS and PI-RADS 4 indicates the possibility of a high risk of significant cancer. Again, more valuable information than the Gleason score at this point. (I assume these samples were from a random biopsy.) You want to play this game for a cure or long life. Erections are third on the list after your life and continence and not worth risking your life, imo. I am curious how you discovered this so early without symptoms or family history. It is unusual to be testing PSA so early. You are very lucky! Do not squander what you have been given by trying to finesse this disease. It's an underestimation of it's seriousness that I see happen too much, imo. It's a beast that can be beat if diagnosed early. You've got that part covered.",

      "Content": "During surgery the prostate has to be separated from all the surrounding tissue. It doesn't just hang in space. After surgery, the removed prostate is examined. If cancer cells are found within a specific measurement of millimeters (don't recall the exact number) from the edge of the specimen it can statistically be assumed there is a chance there is cancer on the otherside of the cut and therefore left behind. A supporting fact is cancer cells tend to be stickier than healthy cells. They can cling to healthier tissue making it difficult to cleanly separate them. I have heard it described here by someone quoting a doctor, it is like peeling a hard boiled egg. Sometimes it peels off easily and sometimes it clings and tears. Back to the original question. You can't know for sure if cancer is left behind, but if cancer is found measured within a small specific distance to the specimen/knife cut edge there is a statistical significant chance some was left behind.",

Placing any responsibility for nothing but the best outcome for you on your view of what is best for someone else doesn't work. This is an inconvenience for you.

Seems to me, all currently available treatments are from the caveman era. It's pretty disappointing. And then it seems you have to do a coin flip to choose the doctor that you want to mutilate or burn you. How sick is that. Sorry to be so frank in my opinion. I'm ready to deal with the after effects so I'll be flipping the coin soon. Time to move on to the rest of my life. I'm realizing that I have to develop a sense of humor to trudge through this mess to get to the GOOD SIDE. I guess comedy and tragedy really are two heads of the same coin.

      "Content": "A note about the antibiotic drill for elevated PSA. Imo, it is bad medicine. The over use of antibiotics for elevated PSA, particularly short term, is a serious issue that can later result in complications during the biopsy and surgery. Studies have shown that some who experience sepsis after biopsy also had antibiotic treatment for elevated PSA. Your age, PSA, symptoms, and negative urine culture are evidence enough to test for cancer and not treat for a bacterial infection. Studies also show there will be a chance of a slight decrease in your PSA as a result of the antibiotics in the presence of cancer that some will use as a reason to postpone a biopsy. There is a belief, which I consider now to be outdated and verging on harmful myth, that prostate cancer is slow growing and you will not die from it and it leads some to take a casual approach to it's symptoms and diagnoses. I did. There is some truth in it, but many will tell you that during the diagnoses is not the time to take the possibility lightly. That truth only applies when there is some evidence that supports it, such as a biopsy grading it as non aggressive. Living with prostate cancer is no cake walk even if it doesn't kill you! Your symptoms presenting at a young age increase the possibility of it being a more aggressive form of the cancer. Regarding your question about late stages, probably not, but it is not a relevant question (not a bad question). Prostate cancer has high probability of a \"cure\" when detected early. There are some grades that are relatively indolent and hang around growing slowly. Other's are more aggressive and head out into the body quickly. All of them benefit from early diagnosis, and will be something you treat and manage the rest of your life.",

Recovery is easier, side effects recover quicker, and it gives you a longer treatment game plan with radiation, and hormone therapy should you need them later down the road. If you start with radiation surgery is off the table. Cures are measured with time, 5 years, 10 years, etc. As a young man, you are more interested in a longer game plan. You may be a candidate for AS. It requires diligent ongoing testing and monitoring. The key is active. Sometimes you can avoid treatment or kick it down the road a bit. Because of your young age you will be dealing with this for a longer time. Recurrence is the concern, and what to do if and when. Also, because it is presenting at such a young age there may be more aggressive cancer in there not hit by the biopsy, or it may develop with time.",

Turned out to be G7. If it's not acting benign it probably isn't. Your PSA and prostate size are both suspiciously low for your age, volume and grading of cancer. Rather than being a positive consideration it is now a concern. I do not see a path for you to AS. You do not fit a specific profile you can trust, imo. Then there's the doctor's recommendation. It begs the question why the MRI and biopsy with such a low PSA. Which beings us back to something being uncertain. What is your life expectancy currently? It is a valid question now if you are considering non-treatment and have other morbidities. There is enough information to recommend treatment. There is not enough to recommend AS. I end up back at a second opinion on the scoring if you are not inclined to treat. Something is different here for you and that is never a good sign with cancer.",

      "Content": "Supplements are a common addiction and part of the denial process. An ongoing healthy diet with regular exercise is work. It promotes general health and strength. Supplements are easy. You buy them and consume them with little effort. Get your BMI between 19 and 25. Reducing body fat takes work and discipline to transform your life habits. Taking supplements does little to nothing to transform your habits or improve health. One example, drinking a high sugar processed fruit juice such as pomegranite juice substitues processed sugar and damaged/empty micro-nutrients for real food. Mega dosing on herbs and vitamins can only stress your liver and kidneys and irtitate your bladder and urethra. It's never too late to begin a healthy diet and exercise regime. It will develop strength. It will not directly cure cancer. Your heightened state of renewed commitment to your health is a good thing. Looking for quick fixes is a warning flag of old behaviors. You know what a healthy life style is. You've known it all your life. Yet here you are. Relax and go about the business of transforming your diet and sedentary life style. Reduce your weight. Stop alcohol. Reduce caffeine. Drink water and tea. Exercise. Reduce red meats. Increase fresh vegetables. Increase olive oil. Eliminate processed foods, fats, dressings. You know the drill. Spend time buying fresh foods, preparing them, and eating them. Learn to eat what's in season. Do not, I repeat, do not focus on reducing your PSA. Your PSA is your friend. Reduce your BMI. I just got back from Italy, you know what? They are thin!",

When talking to the people prepping me they saw my previous appendix scars and commented about scar tissue. I asked if that would be an issue, they said they didn't think so but that the surgeon was extremely particular how equipment was placed into me, and the angle of every piece. That told me two things, 1) he had a team he's worked with very often and they knew what he expected and 2) muscle memory must be very important to him and how he moves those instruments. I've had wonderful results from my surgery. Agreed. My surgeon valued his team above everything else. I had my choice of hospital locations. I asked his preference and he chose a location I would have avoided. His reason, the team was far superior. When I met them I concurred : ) The team head nurse had done more than twice the procedures than my surgeon.",

      "Content": "The operative word is salvage followed with extreme caution. I suspect this is a procedure for those who chose radiation for an organ confined cancer and it was incomplete, and this surgery was developed to address a very difficult and limited condition and is not meant as a preferred order of treatment. Patient selection for this procedure is critical. Kudos to them for developing a technically challenging procedure most find to daunting to attempt and do not recommend. I do not see it as standard protocal equivalent to the current standard of SRT after RP, but some consider it a rapidly growing occurrence. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25765848 https://www.karger.com/Article/FullText/371893 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10910157 (Department of Urology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York) https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/t...lvage-surgery/ Pretty high side effect numbers including rectal injury. \"The greatest risk is that it may have to be converted to a radical cystoprostatectomy (removal of the prostate and the bladder). This procedure is necessary in as many as 20 percent of patients who decide on salvage surgery, and, in addition to the additional trauma, it is associated with less good long-term outcomes. \"",

      "Content": "The 4+3 is not slow growing and you have a significant amount of it. Be careful to not collapse your facts, i.e. PC is slow growing, into all the facts. The majority of prostate cancer is slow growing. The majority of PC is 3+3 and 3+4. You have 4+3. It is not slow growing and it is not like 3+4. Because of your young age surgery now and radiation later is the most common path. Best case scenario is surgery does the trick, but with 4 +3 recurrence is more of a concern. Let's say your recurrence happens in 10 years. You then treat with radiation at 64. If it comes back in another 10 years you have hormones at 74 and that gets you what it gets you. Short story, surgery first buys you a longer treatment game. As a youg person, my view is to treat this as a chronic disease you manage such as diabetes. PC \"cures\" mostly are windows of time. Radiation leaves the prostate in place. Generally not a problem for an older person who will die of something else before the prostate regenerates the cancer that was irradicated by the radiation, if it was a slow growing type, i.e. 3s or 3+4s. If a higher grade it can regenerate sooner. With a successful surgery only minute amounts of prostate remain to continue to harbor or generate cancer. Again if you are producing 3s and 3+4s not a big problem, but if you are producing 4s and up it moves quicker. This scenario is more managable with follow up radiation and/or hormone therapy. Worst case scenario is that of a good friend of mine with 4+3 and 57. Surgery missed a significant portion. The suspicion is they were to go wide on the right and went wide on the left instead. Follow up radiation was not very effective, and he is now looking at hormone therapy from this point forward. All side effects are present. Not a happy camper. So, best advice imo, don't dally with primary G4, start with surgery, and most important find a competent team.",

I am (well was!) very active, and had in the past year or so started - rather irregularly - taking a glucosamine/chondroitin supplement - into the garbage as I speak! Responsible for the change seen in the last year? Hmmmm (fortunately, I do most of the other dietary things Another suggested) I have found maintaining my D3 level with the appropriate support of calcium and a few other vitamins and minerals that work in conjunction with D3 for bone health over time has improved my joint issues. It took about a year. I now ask they include a D3 blood test with my annual physical metabolic panel. Vitamin D3 is very individual in absorption and conversion. It is generally accepted older Americans, for whatever reason and there are suspicions why, are showing up deficient in D3. A few years ago my internist recommended a 2,000 unit daily supplement as standard. I consider it main stream for the moment. We will see.",

      "Content": "Your age and the volume of cancer you have indicates eventual treatment. The question then is what type treatment and when. You're still a candidate for surgery, but that window narrows as cancer volume expands and age increases. Surgery sooner than later is best for surgery outcomes. If you choose radiation you may want to meet with a radiation team to assess your options for eventual treatment. Then you will have completed the AS game plan which includes a plan for future treatment. AS doesn't put everything on hold. Regarding your language, you may think you are a good candidate for AS, but the medical community does not agree. So be clear in that. Your plan is more watchful waiting or let's wait 6 months and see what happens. Not that there is anything wrong with this. I make this distinction becasue AS is a very succesful program that many will be tempted to coop as cover for non treatment, indecision, or simply waiting. This calculation also includes a best guess at your normal life expectancy usually based on family history. In the end, a biopsy is a crude and incomplete diagnostic tool. Part of your calculation includes acceptance you only have a piece of the picture. Bottom line, most medical professionals will disagree with your choice. The peculiar state of the prostate conversation today means most will not push back hard on whatever you decide. They state their view and move on. What did your doctor recommend?",

A fusion guided biopsy is next. Using MRIs for PC is new business and skill/interpretation/experience can vary. Stay on top of this and do not hang your hat on just one fact such as this MRI reading.

When you let an outcome hang out there unexplained and undefended you allow the space for the impact on those who's bias is to immediately deny the cause you present. It is a very powerful way to make a point. Those who advocated for the reduction in screening are left to their own thoughts. It took a lot of discipline for the designers of this study to limit their study to just the results, but highly effective. Glad to see it. My girlfriend emailed this to me yesterday, and her conclusion was as obvious as it is to most except those who were responsible for the reduction in screening. It will take longer for them to adjust their thinking to the facts. It works to give them the space to be alone with the facts and their responsibility in it.",

      "Content": "I agree Highlander. Yet here is what the poster said, \"At this point we have been told that it is all contained in the prostate.\" This may or may not be what the doctor said. If I knew this statement was certain, more so than a doctor's opinion, I would choose surgery assuming I was active and in excellent physical condition and expected to live well into my 80s or more. If there was a risk of long term incontinence as an outcome of a more aggressive surgery due to cancer beyond the capsule I would be investigating my radiation options. The highky aggressive nature makes this a more likely option. The all contained comment confuses it. What a good doctor can say is the scans do not detect cancer. Yet, they have detectable limits and highly aggressive cancers are difficult to predict. There are no guarantees. What I have found is some doctors begin to shorten their conversations over time leaving out details they consider nonessential to a treatment path they have already chosen for the patient. Imo, declaring a highly aggressive cancer in a man in his late 60s is confined to the prostate is a hopeful statement. Not that there is anything wrong with that as long as it is spoken in that way, ie the tests indicate a good posdibility the cancer is still local. I suspect the oncologist will not be so ready to declare the extent of the cancer while a surgeon can always correct himself with a post surgery/pathology report after the fact. Then the patient discovers the true nature of the disease and their options. I suspect most surgeons in most intermediate cases believe in the surgery radiation combo. Family history in this situation is also important and I am not just referring to prostate cancer history, but to longevity which is often genetic. How long do the males in the family naturally live? This has an important impact on the treatment choice. With such limited information (no history) indicating it was discovered recently, I believe hormone and radiation is a reasonable choice for an aggressive cancer. The comment \"it is confined\" indicates there is value in another opinion because I question a doctor who makes such a declaration.",

      "Content": "Do not wait. A negative biopsy is not evidence it is nothing. For those who are vigilant a first time false negative is common. At your age, a steady rising PSA is very indicative of something going on and with no other symptoms it may not be BHP. BHP is an annoying condition you will most likely be aware of. PC is often silent until it's later in the game. Serious cancer's can present with low PSAs, and PC has many levels from indolent to highly aggressive and many act differently. You are now in the hunt for cancer until you find it or fortunate enough to never find it. This is not something you can walk away from with a negative biopsy. This is a vigilance that will last the rest of your life until your are too old to care. Kind of like breast cancer for women. Welcome to the club. Early detection is the key to beating this disease. It is a very treatable disease if you are vigilant and do not dismiss it or forget about it. The back pain is most likely something else, but keep it on your list. There are a lot of buts. Denial and delay are the two demons of cancer in any form. 2.5 to 3.0 PSA is the trigger point for young men to start taking it seriously, imo. You will find that on general med info sites, not just here. This is not, \"Am I the 1 in 7 who gets prostate cancer?\" and you can get past the screening phase if lucky. No, this is a different animal and in this regard is unlike breast cancer. 80% of all men will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. For practical purposes, it is statiscally inevitable. When it starts matters. It is also growing in the population and starting at earliar ages. No one knows the source ,but there are clues. It seems to be both genetic and evironmental. Here's the take away. Starting at your young age is a good indicator this is something you will have to deal with. Stay on top of it. Take time to accept it and don't let it off your radar screen. While it doesn't seem like it, you are fortunate to even be screening for it. I've been told only 17% of general practises screen for PSA. I'm not saying you have cancer. I'm saying you now have cancer awareness. Do you have a family history? There are also other risk factors such as weight and race. This is the best forum out there, imo. Take care of your health and you will live a full and happy life.",

      "Content": "Do not wait. A negative biopsy is not evidence it is nothing. For those who are vigilant a first time false negative is common. At your age, a steady rising PSA is very indicative of something going on and with no other symptoms it may not be BHP. BHP is an annoying condition you will most likely be aware of. PC is often silent until it's later in the game. Serious cancer's can present with low PSAs, and PC has many levels from indolent to highly aggressive and many act differently. You are now in the hunt for cancer until you find it or fortunate enough to never find it. This is not something you can walk away from with a negative biopsy. This is a vigilance that will last the rest of your life until your are too old to care. Kind of like breast cancer for women. Welcome to the club. Early detection is the key to beating this disease. It is a very treatable disease if you are vigilant and do not dismiss it or forget about it. The back pain is most likely something else, but keep it on your list. There are a lot of buts. Denial and delay are the two demons of cancer in any form. 2.5 to 3.0 PSA is the trigger point for young men to start taking it seriously, imo. You will find that on general med info sites, not just here. This is not, \"Am I the 1 in 7 who gets prostate cancer?\" and you can get past the screening phase if lucky. No, this is a different animal and in this regard is unlike breast cancer. 80% of all men will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. For practical purposes, it is statiscally inevitable. When it starts matters. It is also growing in the population and starting at earliar ages. No one knows the source ,but there are clues. It seems to be both genetic and evironmental. Here's the take away. Starting at your young age is a good indicator this is something you will have to deal with. Stay on top of it. Take time to accept it and don't let it off your radar screen. While it doesn't seem like it, you are fortunate to even be screening for it. I've been told only 17% of general practises screen for PSA. I'm not saying you have cancer. I'm saying you now have cancer awareness. Do you have a family history? There are also other risk factors such as weight and race. This is the best forum out there, imo. Take care of your health and you will live a full and happy life.",

There is another viewing scope procedure I can't recall. Pet and CT scans for the whole body. And time, tracking these that change with time and how. We have a plethora of puzzle pieces to use to build the picture of the disease. The ones that prove cancer are the ones that collect tissue samples. You can add a pathological inspection of a removed prostate. This is the most definitive of the type of cancer and it's location. All the others are statistically based in their value.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis I am facing the same choice. I don't have the travel restriction. My Uro at Yale has done a hundred and that is not enough even though he is wonderful in all other aspects. What seems critical is this is a skill issue. I suspect most Uros are smart and well trained but operating the Davinci and performing a multi-hour surgery in a very tight space is critical. So I am in the mode of finding someone who is dedicated to PC and performs surgery very often. I wish you well. Denis I agree. My surgeon lives to perform the DaVinci. He is personally committed to beating prostate cancer and he has dedicated himself to the procedure. It makes a difference.",

      "Content": "I was told 10 days by the doctor. It was scheduled by the office nurse at 12 days. I saw no problem with the 12, but wondered about it at the time. HOWEVER, I was one of those who developed bladder spasms near the end. VERY painful and uncomfortable. Those extra two day were not fun. As stated, there may be a medical reason discovered during the surgery for the extra time, but that should have been explained by the doctor post surgery. I've seen many posts sharing 7 days which seemed pretty quick to me considering the importance of a good heal on such a vital connection. I am not a doctor, but having had the experience I can see an increased risk of taking it longer than necessary. It impacts the bladder, healing, and recovery, and increases the risk of infection/irritation/accidents. I was always afraid I'd hook it on something. Even things we don't think of such as being in an automobile accident can cause complications. It's pretty important plumbing we are dealing with. Call the office, and get a reasonable explanation or other arrangements. When things happen different from what you are told by the doctor you have a responsibility to speak up. There can always be miscommunication or mistakes on their side. As an aside, I only strapped it on the leg when going out or to work. Most of the time I used the larger bag and carried it around and pretty much avoided going out except for work and my daughter's graduation. Don't strap it too tight. Loosen it when your just sitting around. My brother may have given himself a clot in his leg as a complication of keeping it too tight. Either way he developed a clot in that leg and had to go on blood thinners.",

      "Content": "Why are you being screened for prostate cancer at your very young age? Why was the MRI done before your biopsy? Why is the doctor recommending surgery? Are you in a higher risk ethnic group? MRIs can miss detecting both small low grade and small aggressive cancers. Biopsy can miss also and there is a risk of other more aggressive cancer being present and undetected. Your young age is a wild card. Your survival challenge is greater because your exposure is longer. A cancer that begins growing so soon will have a longer time to generate mischief regardless of it's aggressiveness. Volume alone can eventually impact quality of life causing all the symptoms of more aggressive cancers. In general, early detection and early treatment yields better results with this disease. You are a candidate for AS, but more diagnostic efforts are part of that protocol to monitor your cancer. \"A\" means active. Your PSA is high for your age and cancer type. A second opinion on the Gleason scoring is recommended, imo, as well as genetic testing. You are fortunate to have discovered this.",

      "Content": "I agree Highlander. Yet here is what the poster said, \"At this point we have been told that it is all contained in the prostate.\" This may or may not be what the doctor said. If I knew this statement was certain, more so than a doctor's opinion, I would choose surgery assuming I was active and in excellent physical condition and expected to live well into my 80s or more. If there was a risk of long term incontinence as an outcome of a more aggressive surgery due to cancer beyond the capsule I would be investigating my radiation options. The highky aggressive nature makes this a more likely option. The all contained comment confuses it. What a good doctor can say is the scans do not detect cancer. Yet, they have detectable limits and highly aggressive cancers are difficult to predict. There are no guarantees. What I have found is some doctors begin to shorten their conversations over time leaving out details they consider nonessential to a treatment path they have already chosen for the patient. Imo, declaring a highly aggressive cancer in a man in his late 60s is confined to the prostate is a hopeful statement. Not that there is anything wrong with that as long as it is spoken in that way, ie the tests indicate a good posdibility the cancer is still local. I suspect the oncologist will not be so ready to declare the extent of the cancer while a surgeon can always correct himself with a post surgery/pathology report after the fact. Then the patient discovers the true nature of the disease and their options. I suspect most surgeons in most intermediate cases believe in the surgery radiation combo. Family history in this situation is also important and I am not just referring to prostate cancer history, but to longevity which is often genetic. How long do the males in the family naturally live? This has an important impact on the treatment choice. With such limited information (no history) indicating it was discovered recently, I believe hormone and radiation is a reasonable choice for an aggressive cancer. The comment \"it is confined\" indicates there is value in another opinion because I question a doctor who makes such a declaration.",

      "Content": "My choice was surgery to remove as much of the source of the cancer as possible and to determine as complete a pathology of the cancer as possible. Then radiation to follow. Since both surgery and radiation are effective in different ways I wanted the most effective benefits of both. Fortunately my age, physical and mental fitness, diagnosis, and resources were suited for this approach. I am playing the game with one goal, to die of something else. Knowing that achieving a goal is most successful when separated into smaller incremental goals I do not expect this to happen in one event, but a series of smaller consecutive events until the day I pass of something else. In support of Jim's very important note regarding test limitations, it is not certain your cancer is confined to your prostate, and your scans are clear of detectable levels of cancer. The scans are not certain either. You have Gleason 4 cancer and your PSA is over 10. Those facts are more certain. As a technical writer you can understand the temptations that exist in the use of language, and how we step over the details to hear what we want. This also applies to the temptation to over think an issue to avoid the obvious and unpleasant realities. It explains your lengthy post and conclusion to pursue a treatment that is very much less used than others raising the very obvious question why? And in your signature, May 2017 with radiation oncologist decided to use IMRT to eliminate the malignancy. Not certain how that can be guaranteed. In the same reference to use of language, referring to Gleason grading as a flip of the coin is dangerous thinking. It is a professional assessment made by experienced doctors of pathology using a scoring system many decades in the making. They may differ slightly, but rarely are mistakes made and it is not a random selection. You may seek a second opinion of your Gleason score. Also, your rise in PSA did not come out of the blue. A 3.9 was a serious warning flag yet you allowed 2 years to pass before checking it again, and may even have ignored a recommendation to consider a biopsy then. All of this is not to beat you up or point out what you did wrong. It is to warn you how we use language to mislead ourselves and justify who, what, and where we are in our lives. My advice, get clear in your language and get out of your head. For most of us, this disease becomes an opportunity to clear our heads and learn again how to focus on what is real and important. It shows up first in our language.",

      "Content": "Many want to make the choice between radiation and surgery a choice between the best treatment choice, i.e. one is a better choice than another. How I see it is they are different treatments. It's like asking what's a better way to travel; planes, trains, or automobiles? If it's very close you can walk. To far to walk you can drive. To far to drive you can fly. Each mode is more effective than another for a specific travel profile. Some are afraid to fly so they drive or take a bus. They all get you somewhere. They all work for what they are designed to do, and they are not universally interchangeable. They are different. Surgery and radiation each have a specific patient profile that makes them more effective for that profile than the other. I will not go so far as to say they are interchangable. One can be done in lieu of the other in lots of profiles. It doesn't mean it is better. There are clear patient profiles where the majority of professionals will agree on the mode of treatment. Then a clear profile where either will work with pros and cons. Then there are those profiles that exclude one treatment as not medically possible or recommended. There are multible biases; provider bias, patient bias, and confirmation bias. Provider bias: surgeons prefer surgery and radiologist prefer radiotherapy. Yet competent professionals will acknowledge when the patient's profile trumps their skill set and is better served by the other. Patient bias: each of us has a bias for surgery or radiation independent of what we know and our own profile. For example, going in I'd hope my profile matches up with surgery. That bias comes from thinking if it's small, unentangled, and can be cleanly removed - remove it. My bias is against radiation as toxic and crude and used when the line between healthy and diseased tissue can not be made with a scaple. Sounds very reasonable, but it is still a bias that tempts me to hear only those things about my profile supporting surgety. (Someone with a radiation bias can speak for that.) Confirmation bias: a patient chooses and then begins to listen for any and only evidence that supports his choice as the best choice. This is automatic and we all do it. The upside is we have a multitude of effective, tried, and proven treatment choices. The best advice is to stay out of the weeds and go main stream, imo. This is a little off topic, but it applies to how we misuse language. If you use the words right and wrong, better or worse, good or bad you are making a moral judgment. Those words are exclusive to moral language yet we collapse them into other judgment choices. The consideration is what will work and how effective will it be. We want to be right more than anything often times at the expense of what works.",

      "Content": "Do not wait. A negative biopsy is not evidence it is nothing. For those who are vigilant a first time false negative is common. At your age, a steady rising PSA is very indicative of something going on and with no other symptoms it may not be BHP. BHP is an annoying condition you will most likely be aware of. PC is often silent until it's later in the game. Serious cancer's can present with low PSAs, and PC has many levels from indolent to highly aggressive and many act differently. You are now in the hunt for cancer until you find it or fortunate enough to never find it. This is not something you can walk away from with a negative biopsy. This is a vigilance that will last the rest of your life until your are too old to care. Kind of like breast cancer for women. Welcome to the club. Early detection is the key to beating this disease. It is a very treatable disease if you are vigilant and do not dismiss it or forget about it. The back pain is most likely something else, but keep it on your list. There are a lot of buts. Denial and delay are the two demons of cancer in any form. 2.5 to 3.0 PSA is the trigger point for young men to start taking it seriously, imo. You will find that on general med info sites, not just here. This is not, \"Am I the 1 in 7 who gets prostate cancer?\" and you can get past the screening phase if lucky. No, this is a different animal and in this regard is unlike breast cancer. 80% of all men will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. For practical purposes, it is statiscally inevitable. When it starts matters. It is also growing in the population and starting at earliar ages. No one knows the source ,but there are clues. It seems to be both genetic and evironmental. Here's the take away. Starting at your young age is a good indicator this is something you will have to deal with. Stay on top of it. Take time to accept it and don't let it off your radar screen. While it doesn't seem like it, you are fortunate to even be screening for it. I've been told only 17% of general practises screen for PSA. I'm not saying you have cancer. I'm saying you now have cancer awareness. Do you have a family history? There are also other risk factors such as weight and race. This is the best forum out there, imo. Take care of your health and you will live a full and happy life.",

In support of Jim's very important note regarding test limitations, it is not certain your cancer is confined to your prostate, and your scans are clear of detectable levels of cancer. The scans are not certain either. You have Gleason 4 cancer and your PSA is over 10. Those facts are more certain. As a technical writer you can understand the temptations that exist in the use of language, and how we step over the details to hear what we want. This also applies to the temptation to over think an issue to avoid the obvious and unpleasant realities. It explains your lengthy post and conclusion to pursue a treatment that is very much less used than others raising the very obvious question why? And in your signature, May 2017 with radiation oncologist decided to use IMRT to eliminate the malignancy. Not certain how that can be guaranteed. In the same reference to use of language, referring to Gleason grading as a flip of the coin is dangerous thinking. It is a professional assessment made by experienced doctors of pathology using a scoring system many decades in the making. They may differ slightly, but rarely are mistakes made and it is not a random selection. You may seek a second opinion of your Gleason score. Also, your rise in PSA did not come out of the blue. A 3.9 was a serious warning flag yet you allowed 2 years to pass before checking it again, and may even have ignored a recommendation to consider a biopsy then. All of this is not to beat you up or point out what you did wrong. It is to warn you how we use language to mislead ourselves and justify who, what, and where we are in our lives. My advice, get clear in your language and get out of your head. For most of us, this disease becomes an opportunity to clear our heads and learn again how to focus on what is real and important. It shows up first in our language.",

      "Content": "Do not wait. A negative biopsy is not evidence it is nothing. For those who are vigilant a first time false negative is common. At your age, a steady rising PSA is very indicative of something going on and with no other symptoms it may not be BHP. BHP is an annoying condition you will most likely be aware of. PC is often silent until it's later in the game. Serious cancer's can present with low PSAs, and PC has many levels from indolent to highly aggressive and many act differently. You are now in the hunt for cancer until you find it or fortunate enough to never find it. This is not something you can walk away from with a negative biopsy. This is a vigilance that will last the rest of your life until your are too old to care. Kind of like breast cancer for women. Welcome to the club. Early detection is the key to beating this disease. It is a very treatable disease if you are vigilant and do not dismiss it or forget about it. The back pain is most likely something else, but keep it on your list. There are a lot of buts. Denial and delay are the two demons of cancer in any form. 2.5 to 3.0 PSA is the trigger point for young men to start taking it seriously, imo. You will find that on general med info sites, not just here. This is not, \"Am I the 1 in 7 who gets prostate cancer?\" and you can get past the screening phase if lucky. No, this is a different animal and in this regard is unlike breast cancer. 80% of all men will have prostate cancer by the time they are 80. For practical purposes, it is statiscally inevitable. When it starts matters. It is also growing in the population and starting at earliar ages. No one knows the source ,but there are clues. It seems to be both genetic and evironmental. Here's the take away. Starting at your young age is a good indicator this is something you will have to deal with. Stay on top of it. Take time to accept it and don't let it off your radar screen. While it doesn't seem like it, you are fortunate to even be screening for it. I've been told only 17% of general practises screen for PSA. I'm not saying you have cancer. I'm saying you now have cancer awareness. Do you have a family history? There are also other risk factors such as weight and race. This is the best forum out there, imo. Take care of your health and you will live a full and happy life.",

      "Content": "I assume prostate cells regenerate the gland by dividing. Enlarging prostate is caused by older cells not dying in a normal cell life time period. Something shifts and they live longer, and the gland begins to enlarge. To me, that alone is a precursor of a shifting dna similar to cancer if not cancer, i.e. precancerous activity. I assume a \"healthy\" cell produces a cancerous one i.e. G3, 4, 5, etc. Does a cell produce just 3s, or 3s and sometimes 4s. Or, does the way a cell shifts to producing cancer cells remain static? A specific \"healthy\" cell will only produce 3s. It seems most common they will produce relatively close to a specific aggressiveness, i.e. 3s & 4s, or 4s & 5s, 8s & 9s, etc. In this scenario I can see how one specific gland may have a set pattern of aggressiveness. Now, are they points on a line, i.e. some 3s are more aggressive than other 3s? I suspect so leading to some 3s become volume problems while others do not. 2s are never a problem. 3s may be or not depending on their aggressiveness within the range of 3. 4s and up are always a problem regardless of amount. \"Healthy\" cells if producing 4s will continue to produce 4s. Do they produce them at a consistent rate across the gland? Will 4s always represent 5% of a specific glands tumor production? Even if this is the case, 4s now have a life of their own and they prefer to live it elsewhere in the body. Time is a factor so now the reference to doubling time. At some point, depending on your age and the nature of that 4, it will overwelhm the 3s and the effective outcome of metastasis will be 4s galore. Is time the only distinction between 3+4 and 4+3?",

      "Content": "Why are you being screened for prostate cancer at your very young age? Why was the MRI done before your biopsy? Why is the doctor recommending surgery? Are you in a higher risk ethnic group? MRIs can miss detecting both small low grade and small aggressive cancers. Biopsy can miss also and there is a risk of other more aggressive cancer being present and undetected. Your young age is a wild card. Your survival challenge is greater because your exposure is longer. A cancer that begins growing so soon will have a longer time to generate mischief regardless of it's aggressiveness. Volume alone can eventually impact quality of life causing all the symptoms of more aggressive cancers. In general, early detection and early treatment yields better results with this disease. You are a candidate for AS, but more diagnostic efforts are part of that protocol to monitor your cancer. \"A\" means active. Your PSA is high for your age and cancer type.

      "Content": "I was told 10 days by the doctor. It was scheduled by the office nurse at 12 days. I saw no problem with the 12, but wondered about it at the time. HOWEVER, I was one of those who developed bladder spasms near the end. VERY painful and uncomfortable. Those extra two day were not fun. As stated, there may be a medical reason discovered during the surgery for the extra time, but that should have been explained by the doctor post surgery. I've seen many posts sharing 7 days which seemed pretty quick to me considering the importance of a good heal on such a vital connection. I am not a doctor, but having had the experience I can see an increased risk of taking it longer than necessary. It impacts the bladder, healing, and recovery, and increases the risk of infection/irritation/accidents. I was always afraid I'd hook it on something. Even things we don't think of such as being in an automobile accident can cause complications. It's pretty important plumbing we are dealing with. Call the office, and get a reasonable explanation or other arrangements. When things happen different from what you are told by the doctor you have a responsibility to speak up. There can always be miscommunication or mistakes on their side. As an aside, I only strapped it on the leg when going out or to work. Most of the time I used the larger bag and carried it around and pretty much avoided going out except for work and my daughter's graduation. Don't strap it too tight. Loosen it when your just sitting around. My brother may have given himself a clot in his leg as a complication of keeping it too tight. Either way he developed a clot in that leg and had to go on blood thinners.",

For example, it is statistical proven measurement a PSA over 10% indicates more than a 60% probability of prostate cancer.

      "Content": "I was told 10 days by the doctor. It was scheduled by the office nurse at 12 days. I saw no problem with the 12, but wondered about it at the time. HOWEVER, I was one of those who developed bladder spasms near the end. VERY painful and uncomfortable. Those extra two day were not fun. As stated, there may be a medical reason discovered during the surgery for the extra time, but that should have been explained by the doctor post surgery. I've seen many posts sharing 7 days which seemed pretty quick to me considering the importance of a good heal on such a vital connection. I am not a doctor, but having had the experience I can see an increased risk of taking it longer than necessary. It impacts the bladder, healing, and recovery, and increases the risk of infection/irritation/accidents. I was always afraid I'd hook it on something. Even things we don't think of such as being in an automobile accident can cause complications. It's pretty important plumbing we are dealing with. Call the office, and get a reasonable explanation or other arrangements. When things happen different from what you are told by the doctor you have a responsibility to speak up. There can always be miscommunication or mistakes on their side. As an aside, I only strapped it on the leg when going out or to work. Most of the time I used the larger bag and carried it around and pretty much avoided going out except for work and my daughter's graduation. Don't strap it too tight. Loosen it when your just sitting around. My brother may have given himself a clot in his leg as a complication of keeping it too tight. Either way he developed a clot in that leg and had to go on blood thinners.",

      "Content": "Many want to make the choice between radiation and surgery a choice between the best treatment choice, i.e. one is a better choice than another. How I see it is they are different treatments. It's like asking what's a better way to travel; planes, trains, or automobiles? If it's very close you can walk. To far to walk you can drive. To far to drive you can fly. Each mode is more effective than another for a specific travel profile. Some are afraid to fly so they drive or take a bus. They all get you somewhere. They all work for what they are designed to do, and they are not universally interchangeable. They are different. Surgery and radiation each have a specific patient profile that makes them more effective for that profile than the other. I will not go so far as to say they are interchangable. One can be done in lieu of the other in lots of profiles. It doesn't mean it is better. There are clear patient profiles where the majority of professionals will agree on the mode of treatment. Then a clear profile where either will work with pros and cons. Then there are those profiles that exclude one treatment as not medically possible or recommended. There are multible biases; provider bias, patient bias, and confirmation bias. Provider bias: surgeons prefer surgery and radiologist prefer radiotherapy. Yet competent professionals will acknowledge when the patient's profile trumps their skill set and is better served by the other. Patient bias: each of us has a bias for surgery or radiation independent of what we know and our own profile. For example, going in I'd hope my profile matches up with surgery. That bias comes from thinking if it's small, unentangled, and can be cleanly removed - remove it. My bias is against radiation as toxic and crude and used when the line between healthy and diseased tissue can not be made with a scaple. Sounds very reasonable, but it is still a bias that tempts me to hear only those things about my profile supporting surgety. (Someone with a radiation bias can speak for that.) Confirmation bias: a patient chooses and then begins to listen for any and only evidence that supports his choice as the best choice. This is automatic and we all do it. The upside is we have a multitude of effective, tried, and proven treatment choices. The best advice is to stay out of the weeds and go main stream, imo. This is a little off topic, but it applies to how we misuse language. If you use the words right and wrong, better or worse, good or bad you are making a moral judgment. Those words are exclusive to moral language yet we collapse them into other judgment choices. The consideration is what will work and how effective will it be. We want to be right more than anything often times at the expense of what works.",

      "Content": "Why are you being screened for prostate cancer at your very young age? Why was the MRI done before your biopsy? Why is the doctor recommending surgery? Are you in a higher risk ethnic group? MRIs can miss detecting both small low grade and small aggressive cancers. Biopsy can miss also and there is a risk of other more aggressive cancer being present and undetected. Your young age is a wild card. Your survival challenge is greater because your exposure is longer. A cancer that begins growing so soon will have a longer time to generate mischief regardless of it's aggressiveness. Volume alone can eventually impact quality of life causing all the symptoms of more aggressive cancers. In general, early detection and early treatment yields better results with this disease. You are a candidate for AS, but more diagnostic efforts are part of that protocol to monitor your cancer. \"A\" means active. Your PSA is high for your age and cancer type. A second opinion on the Gleason scoring is recommended, imo, as well as genetic testing. You are fortunate to have discovered this.",

While movement helps dispel the residual gas and the pains it causes and aids in healing, the real threat is lower extremity blood clots. The older we are the greater the risk as a surgery complication. My brother had this. It's an unecessary complication with a regimen of blood thinning meds not to mention the risk to your life. If you absolutely can't move around do calf exercises while laying or sitting to keep blood moving in your legs. Google them. As you recover and choose to use the leg bag to get out of the house, do not strap it too tight or wear it for long periods of time. This can also contribute to blood clots by suppressing circulation.",

      "Content": "I was told 10 days by the doctor. It was scheduled by the office nurse at 12 days. I saw no problem with the 12, but wondered about it at the time. HOWEVER, I was one of those who developed bladder spasms near the end. VERY painful and uncomfortable. Those extra two day were not fun. As stated, there may be a medical reason discovered during the surgery for the extra time, but that should have been explained by the doctor post surgery. I've seen many posts sharing 7 days which seemed pretty quick to me considering the importance of a good heal on such a vital connection. I am not a doctor, but having had the experience I can see an increased risk of taking it longer than necessary. It impacts the bladder, healing, and recovery, and increases the risk of infection/irritation/accidents. I was always afraid I'd hook it on something. Even things we don't think of such as being in an automobile accident can cause complications. It's pretty important plumbing we are dealing with. Call the office, and get a reasonable explanation or other arrangements. When things happen different from what you are told by the doctor you have a responsibility to speak up. There can always be miscommunication or mistakes on their side. As an aside, I only strapped it on the leg when going out or to work. Most of the time I used the larger bag and carried it around and pretty much avoided going out except for work and my daughter's graduation. Don't strap it too tight. Loosen it when your just sitting around. My brother may have given himself a clot in his leg as a complication of keeping it too tight. Either way he developed a clot in that leg and had to go on blood thinners.",

      "Content": "Interesting question so I googled it. https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkr...-energy-drink/ Another distinction about caffiene is we consider it an \"energy\" booster, but it may be more accurate to say \"focus\" booster. Energy may be more fuel related, i.e. carbs and proteins. You may want to look into making your own smoothies and designing something tailored to your specific needs. Exercise is also an energy booster, but the hurdle is generating the energy to start exercise when you need it for energy. I am a yoga fan. It doesn't take a lot of energy to start a yoga session, but it will generate it before your finished. Walking and biking are both easy starters. Exerting energy is the key to generating energy, but we often want a quick dose of something to jump start the hard part, getting active. Hard to generate activity when you don't feel active. No easy fix I suspect. If you live in America it's more difficult to break out of the sedentary life styles. I sit at work all day and go home and want to sit some more because I'm tired from sitting all day.",

      "Content": "My choice was surgery to remove as much of the source of the cancer as possible and to determine as complete a pathology of the cancer as possible. Then radiation to follow. Since both surgery and radiation are effective in different ways I wanted the most effective benefits of both. Fortunately my age, physical and mental fitness, diagnosis, and resources were suited for this approach. I am playing the game with one goal, to die of something else. Knowing that achieving a goal is most successful when separated into smaller incremental goals I do not expect this to happen in one event, but a series of smaller consecutive events until the day I pass of something else. In support of Jim's very important note regarding test limitations, it is not certain your cancer is confined to your prostate, and your scans are clear of detectable levels of cancer. The scans are not certain either. You have Gleason 4 cancer and your PSA is over 10. Those facts are more certain. As a technical writer you can understand the temptations that exist in the use of language, and how we step over the details to hear what we want. This also applies to the temptation to over think an issue to avoid the obvious and unpleasant realities. It explains your lengthy post and conclusion to pursue a treatment that is very much less used than others raising the very obvious question why? And in your signature, May 2017 with radiation oncologist decided to use IMRT to eliminate the malignancy. Not certain how that can be guaranteed. In the same reference to use of language, referring to Gleason grading as a flip of the coin is dangerous thinking. It is a professional assessment made by experienced doctors of pathology using a scoring system many decades in the making. They may differ slightly, but rarely are mistakes made and it is not a random selection. You may seek a second opinion of your Gleason score. Also, your rise in PSA did not come out of the blue. A 3.9 was a serious warning flag yet you allowed 2 years to pass before checking it again, and may even have ignored a recommendation to consider a biopsy then. All of this is not to beat you up or point out what you did wrong. It is to warn you how we use language to mislead ourselves and justify who, what, and where we are in our lives. My advice, get clear in your language and get out of your head. For most of us, this disease becomes an opportunity to clear our heads and learn again how to focus on what is real and important. It shows up first in our language.",

It's a better sign than nothing, but did not indicate an early recovery for me. Nor can I say it predicts a recovery, but I considered it a good sign. I'd also experience blood swelling my penis while pressing during a bowel movement. I think valves are wide open allowing a free flow in and out. Your orgasm nerves are unaffected and you can/may have an orgasm without erection. An orgasmic dream is still as possible as before. You may have pressed blood into the penis by contraction during your erotic/orgasmic dream. The valves that hold the blood in the erect penis are the ones controlled by the nerves effected by the surgery.",

      "Content": "What is your life expectancy? I put mine at between 85 and 90 on thelie side. Of course, you can die anytime, but some things are obvious; family history, fitness habits, and your personal commitment to your health. There are life expectancy calculators on line. Most insurance companies provide them. They seem remarkably accurate. They are the masters of actuarials. They put mine at 86. It seems accurate, if conservative. You can play with the differences of weight, exercise, drinking and smoking. They do not go into family history or mental health. I've had several parents and grandparent live into their 90s so there is that. Assess your mental health. Depression, even if not chronic, can be a factor in your thinking and can impact your view of your healthcare. Your PSA history indicates a reluctance to deal with healthcare issues effectively. Early detection early treatment is the mantra for prostate cancer, or any cancer. PC seems to have gotten a dangerous reputation as being non life threatening. You now know differently, or do you? If you do nothing, it is unlikely you will die of something else as most men are eager to quote (if not believe). Research death from prostate cancer. It can happen as quickly as 3 to 5 years. Research PC lymphatic invasion as the adverse condition you are confronting. PC can be successfully managed for a long time in many cases. You don't know if you don't try. We have plenty of history and diagnostic tools to help, but it is clear we can't predict how it is going to go for any one person. In fairness to you it's also a question for your doctors; what will happen if I do nothing? And, it is a very good question we all ask ourselves. If more men asked it and got it answered for themselves in a timely manner (sooner) we'd have less of them here. There may come a time for all of us when we are confronted with a treatment option worse than death. Imo, this isn't it for you unless you are dying of something else in the next 5 years you haven't shared with us. I may be wrong, but it seems you hesitated once before with this disease and here you are. Do it again and you may not have this second chance a third time.",

      "Content": "Yes, you can manipulate your PSA with drugs, supplements, and diet. I did in ignorance and denial. I lost a couple of years and the possibility of earliar detection. If you do this you are undermining the value of PSA testing as your best indicator of cancer. Manipulating your PSA has no effect on the cancer. It continues to do what it does. What you may be manipulating is that potion of the PSA generated by BHP or other prostate issues. Often both conditions exist in varying degrees. You can test for your free PSA (fPSA). As you search for your 3T MRI I suggest you proceed with the TRUS biopsy anyway. You've been sitting on this for a while. While your PSA bounces may indicate other prostate issues your consistently elevated values indicates cancer is possible. The biopsy is a valuable tool and works most of the time. Don't let concerns and a search for state of the art stuff stop you from basic health care.",

      "Content": "I had surgery and recovered my continence in 3 months and erections within a year. I was already experiencing urgency incontinence as a symptom before the surgery. My continence and urination improved with surgery. If you are experiencing ED before surgery it will be no better after surgery. So far, surgery has worked for me. I am now 2 years post and watching closely for any recurrence. If there is I will follow up with radiation. If you are a candidate, surgery first gives you the option of salvage radiation as a follow up. Radiation first eliminates surgery as a second option. It creates too much scar tissue for surgery to be a good risk. Surgery also gives you a prostate, lymph node, and seminal vesicle pathology report of the extent and grade of the cancer. This is useful moving forward. This disease has many good treatment options for a potential cure and a long life if not curable. Early detection and early treatment is the gold standard for curing or managing this disease. You are off to a good start. Stay on top of it. As our understanding of the disease increases, low risk and indolent varieties of the disease can be managed with Active Surveillance. Your experience with your friend is a valuable early lesson. We all have treatment bias. Some more than others. Some with successful experiences and accurate information, and some not so much. Stay out the weeds. There are recognizable pitfalls along the way. This disease is treatable and manageable with decades of research and development of treatment options. This forum is a good resource, well monitored, experienced participants in many aspects of the disease and treatments, and committed to mainstream proven pathways of which there are many. Exercise and a healthy diet are good practices, but will not cure cancer. Maintaining your weight to a BMI of 19 to 25 is also good practise and will improve your health, treatment options, recovery and treatment outcomes. Avoid supplements, megadoses of vitamins, and prostate health products. They may manipulate your PSA levels, but will not cure cancer. I did it. Check my signature. An unadulterated PSA level and history is now your best friend. Some are not as lucky as you. Your PSA appears to be a reliable indicator of your cancer. You want to keep it that way as you deal with this inconvenience. There is no slightly worse Gleason score than yours. The next worse score is a 4+3 and it's a significant upgrade in risk. 3+3 is good news if you have to have this cancer. 3+4 is concerning depending on the percentage of 4. 4+3 is serious. Volume is a different statistic and the number of positive biopsy samples is an indicator of volume. In my signature you will see a high volume of 3+3 at biopsy. It was upgraded to a high volume of 3+4 after the surgery. Upgrading and down grading are possible risks due to the limits of our tools artany time in this process. Location of your positive samples is also useful to know. Some locations are a higger risk than others. Also, some areas of the prostate are difficult to reach and are often missed. You are a potential candidate for AS, but the operative word is Active. If you are considering AS you will continue testing to confirm your status is accurate and stable. In the US I advise a second opinion on biopsy G scores with Epstein's lab at John Hopkins. It is a grading that requires experience and when critical to a treatment choice benefits from a second opinion. Personally, I would not consider AS with 2 - 3+4s. Life expectancy is an important consideration. For young men with a long life expectancy and locally confined cancer surgery gives you more treatment options for a longer game plan if you need it. Dr. Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", most recent book edition is recommended reading. Denial and delay are the two demons of all cancer.",

It is contagious from life events and from other depressed people. Use the tools available to deal with it if it effects your ability to live the life you want for yourself. It is a critical aspect of your healthcare. It will effect your general health, activity, and longevity if left unaddressed. It can also become chronic, even if low grade, if left unaddressed. Your brain will rewire itself to acceptance and a depressed way of life becomes a new normal. I know people who are addicted to it. It can be an effective mechanism for making your life smaller and dealing with aniexty or stress. Sadly, there is a stigma associated with it that is harmful and it takes courage and strength to push past it and take care of yourself. All the issues of aging can contribute to it. Best to develop the skills to manage it now because as we age we become more at risk to it. It has many and varied symptoms; anxiety, anger, irritability, substance abuse, obesity and eating disorders, inactivity, isolation, poor general health, poverty, poor healthcare, homelessness and unemployment, fatigue...... If your head is not clear, nothing else is. Put a plan in place; diet and exercise, medical support and therapy in place as you head into this adventure. Be proactive. Be prepared. If its something you know about yourself do not step over it. Take it on before it takes on you. It's real and you can make a difference in it. Just like cancer, denial and delay are the demons of depression. Cancer and depression go hand in hand, imo. You are not normal if it doesn't depress you. What is not normal is living with it as the new normal.",

Of course, you can die anytime, but some things are obvious; family history, fitness habits, and your personal commitment to your health. There are life expectancy calculators on line. Most insurance companies provide them. They seem remarkably accurate. They are the masters of actuarials. They put mine at 86. It seems accurate, if conservative. You can play with the differences of weight, exercise, drinking and smoking. They do not go into family history or mental health. I've had several parents and grandparent live into their 90s so there is that. Assess your mental health. Depression, even if not chronic, can be a factor in your thinking and can impact your view of your healthcare. Your PSA history indicates a reluctance to deal with healthcare issues effectively. Early detection early treatment is the mantra for prostate cancer, or any cancer. PC seems to have gotten a dangerous reputation as being non life threatening. You now know differently, or do you? If you do nothing, it is unlikely you will die of something else as most men are eager to quote (if not believe). Research death from prostate cancer. It can happen as quickly as 3 to 5 years. Research PC lymphatic invasion as the adverse condition you are confronting. PC can be successfully managed for a long time in many cases. You don't know if you don't try. We have plenty of history and diagnostic tools to help, but it is clear we can't predict how it is going to go for any one person. In fairness to you it's also a question for your doctors; what will happen if I do nothing? And, it is a very good question we all ask ourselves. If more men asked it and got it answered for themselves in a timely manner (sooner) we'd have less of them here. There may come a time for all of us when we are confronted with a treatment option worse than death. Imo, this isn't it for you unless you are dying of something else in the next 5 years you haven't shared with us. I may be wrong, but it seems you hesitated once before with this disease and here you are. Do it again and you may not have this second chance a third time.",

My continence and urination improved with surgery. If you are experiencing ED before surgery it will be no better after surgery. So far, surgery has worked for me. I am now 2 years post and watching closely for any recurrence. If there is I will follow up with radiation. If you are a candidate, surgery first gives you the option of salvage radiation as a follow up. Radiation first eliminates surgery as a second option. It creates too much scar tissue for surgery to be a good risk. Surgery also gives you a prostate, lymph node, and seminal vesicle pathology report of the extent and grade of the cancer.

We all have treatment bias. Some more than others. Some with successful experiences and accurate information, and some not so much. Stay out the weeds. There are recognizable pitfalls along the way. This disease is treatable and manageable with decades of research and development of treatment options. This forum is a good resource, well monitored, experienced participants in many aspects of the disease and treatments, and committed to mainstream proven pathways of which there are many. Exercise and a healthy diet are good practices, but will not cure cancer. Maintaining your weight to a BMI of 19 to 25 is also good practise and will improve your health, treatment options, recovery and treatment outcomes. Avoid supplements, megadoses of vitamins, and prostate health products. They may manipulate your PSA levels, but will not cure cancer. I did it. Check my signature. An unadulterated PSA level and history is now your best friend. Some are not as lucky as you. Your PSA appears to be a reliable indicator of your cancer. You want to keep it that way as you deal with this inconvenience. There is no slightly worse Gleason score than yours. The next worse score is a 4+3 and it's a significant upgrade in risk. 3+3 is good news if you have to have this cancer. 3+4 is concerning depending on the percentage of 4. 4+3 is serious. Volume is a different statistic and the number of positive biopsy samples is an indicator of volume. In my signature you will see a high volume of 3+3 at biopsy. It was upgraded to a high volume of 3+4 after the surgery. Upgrading and down grading are possible risks due to the limits of our tools artany time in this process. Location of your positive samples is also useful to know. Some locations are a higger risk than others. Also, some areas of the prostate are difficult to reach and are often missed. You are a potential candidate for AS, but the operative word is Active. If you are considering AS you will continue testing to confirm your status is accurate and stable. In the US I advise a second opinion on biopsy G scores with Epstein's lab at John Hopkins. It is a grading that requires experience and when critical to a treatment choice benefits from a second opinion. Personally, I would not consider AS with 2 - 3+4s. Life expectancy is an important consideration. For young men with a long life expectancy and locally confined cancer surgery gives you more treatment options for a longer game plan if you need it.

      "Content": "Make sure the lab report is a copy of the original and not an internal doctor's office summary. Questions and follow up question. Prostate size? What's normal? DRE (digital rectal exam) results, and explain. Cancer or no cancer? No cancer, then what are percentages of biopsy false negative for your profile? How do we monitor you going forward, testing, frequency? If cancer - low risk, intermediate or high? Do you need a second opinion of Gleason scoring if Gleason scoring is ambiguous or becomes critical to your treatment choice. Regardless of Gleason scoring is cancer volume high based on biopsy? How many samples hit cancer? Some reports have a graphic of the prostate showing where and what was found within the prostate. If not, have them draw you a picture. Where is it hard to reach with the biopsy needle and did we reach it with yours? Are you a candidate for treatment? If so, why, and what do they recommend, and why? Again, have them draw you a picture of the treatment recommendations. What is done during surgery? What is done during radiation treatments? What is done for active surveillance? (No picture needed for AS.) After the meeting, and after you have a chance to review the actual report and consider what they told you, how do you address your follow up questions? How do you get a second opinion on treatment options? Your doctor may be a surgeon and can speak to surgery, but who do you they refer you to for radiation treatment options or AS? The surgeon is not the one to address those options. Time frame going forward whatever the outcome of the biopsy? Check your local library for a copy of Walsh's book. You have time between now and your appointment to get it, skim it, and get really confused. But, relax, you will get really confused before you get clear. We all do. The booked is organized to work as a reference guide or a front to back read. You have the time. Nothing is rushed with prostate cancer. (I don't mean years, but weeks and months.) The book has all the basics you need to know so don't sweat the computer thing. However, this is a very good forum for input from experienced and dedicated fellow travelers. Compete your signature on this site. If you need help doing this seek the help of a computer literate friend. Trust but verify. Too many doctors still believe you will die of something else. If you live a long life it may not be true. So, what is your best guess of your life expectancy? Not kidding here. Your family history, education, commitment to health care, and personal fitness determine this answer and may impact your choices going forward. Take a friend to take notes. You listen and ask questions. Give yourself time to stop and consider during the meeting. Do not be concerned if you generate some lengthy empty pauses while you do this. Ask your friend if they have questions before you finish.",

      "Content": "I had surgery and recovered my continence in 3 months and erections within a year. I was already experiencing urgency incontinence as a symptom before the surgery. My continence and urination improved with surgery. If you are experiencing ED before surgery it will be no better after surgery. So far, surgery has worked for me. I am now 2 years post and watching closely for any recurrence. If there is I will follow up with radiation. If you are a candidate, surgery first gives you the option of salvage radiation as a follow up. Radiation first eliminates surgery as a second option. It creates too much scar tissue for surgery to be a good risk. Surgery also gives you a prostate, lymph node, and seminal vesicle pathology report of the extent and grade of the cancer. This is useful moving forward. This disease has many good treatment options for a potential cure and a long life if not curable. Early detection and early treatment is the gold standard for curing or managing this disease. You are off to a good start. Stay on top of it. As our understanding of the disease increases, low risk and indolent varieties of the disease can be managed with Active Surveillance. Your experience with your friend is a valuable early lesson. We all have treatment bias. Some more than others. Some with successful experiences and accurate information, and some not so much. Stay out the weeds. There are recognizable pitfalls along the way. This disease is treatable and manageable with decades of research and development of treatment options. This forum is a good resource, well monitored, experienced participants in many aspects of the disease and treatments, and committed to mainstream proven pathways of which there are many. Exercise and a healthy diet are good practices, but will not cure cancer. Maintaining your weight to a BMI of 19 to 25 is also good practise and will improve your health, treatment options, recovery and treatment outcomes. Avoid supplements, megadoses of vitamins, and prostate health products. They may manipulate your PSA levels, but will not cure cancer. I did it. Check my signature. An unadulterated PSA level and history is now your best friend. Some are not as lucky as you. Your PSA appears to be a reliable indicator of your cancer. You want to keep it that way as you deal with this inconvenience. There is no slightly worse Gleason score than yours. The next worse score is a 4+3 and it's a significant upgrade in risk. 3+3 is good news if you have to have this cancer. 3+4 is concerning depending on the percentage of 4. 4+3 is serious. Volume is a different statistic and the number of positive biopsy samples is an indicator of volume. In my signature you will see a high volume of 3+3 at biopsy. It was upgraded to a high volume of 3+4 after the surgery. Upgrading and down grading are possible risks due to the limits of our tools artany time in this process. Location of your positive samples is also useful to know. Some locations are a higger risk than others. Also, some areas of the prostate are difficult to reach and are often missed. You are a potential candidate for AS, but the operative word is Active. If you are considering AS you will continue testing to confirm your status is accurate and stable. In the US I advise a second opinion on biopsy G scores with Epstein's lab at John Hopkins. It is a grading that requires experience and when critical to a treatment choice benefits from a second opinion. Personally, I would not consider AS with 2 - 3+4s. Life expectancy is an important consideration. For young men with a long life expectancy and locally confined cancer surgery gives you more treatment options for a longer game plan if you need it. Dr. Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", most recent book edition is recommended reading. Denial and delay are the two demons of all cancer.",

The apex is actually the bottom toward our rectum and scrotum. Cancer at the base (or top) is a higher risk. It is closes to the seminal vesicles (which sit above) and the cancer has a pattern of following them up and out. I know I can come off as a doom and gloomer. What is important to me is you have the information that makes a difference to you in as simple, short, and straight forward manner as possible.

If you have made your treatment choice then schedule it now for January. Waiting to schedule after the first of January puts you further back in the que. How will the scans impact your treatment choice? You have not shared all your information so hard to tell. If your PSA is not through the roof the scans may be protocal and hold little risk of a surprise. Even if the cancer has metastized will you still have an RP? Regardless of your finacial timimg you want to play out the possible scenarios to answer your question. For example, what do we do if the scans fail to detect anything? What do we do if they do. G4 and 5 are nothing to mess around with. Two weeks or 6 months, is it worth a couple thousand dollars. A doctor's remark from a biopsy that you have 6 months of safety with G8 is not professional, imo. The mantra is early detection early treatment. Mess with that at your own risk. Not saying you can't be prudent with money and health, but you want to lay out your critical path before moving forward.",

      "Content": "The G7 and 8 is concerning and I'll assume the G7 is 4+3. The location is critical also. If at the base it is a higher risk. If you have made your treatment choice then schedule it now for January. Waiting to schedule after the first of January puts you further back in the que. How will the scans impact your treatment choice? You have not shared all your information so hard to tell. If your PSA is not through the roof the scans may be protocal and hold little risk of a surprise. Even if the cancer has metastized will you still have an RP? Regardless of your finacial timimg you want to play out the possible scenarios to answer your question. For example, what do we do if the scans fail to detect anything? What do we do if they do. G4 and 5 are nothing to mess around with. Two weeks or 6 months, is it worth a couple thousand dollars. A doctor's remark from a biopsy that you have 6 months of safety with G8 is not professional, imo. The mantra is early detection early treatment. Mess with that at your own risk. Not saying you can't be prudent with money and health, but you want to lay out your critical path before moving forward.",

      "Content": "Make sure the lab report is a copy of the original and not an internal doctor's office summary. Questions and follow up question. Prostate size? What's normal? DRE (digital rectal exam) results, and explain. Cancer or no cancer? No cancer, then what are percentages of biopsy false negative for your profile? How do we monitor you going forward, testing, frequency? If cancer - low risk, intermediate or high? Do you need a second opinion of Gleason scoring if Gleason scoring is ambiguous or becomes critical to your treatment choice. Regardless of Gleason scoring is cancer volume high based on biopsy? How many samples hit cancer? Some reports have a graphic of the prostate showing where and what was found within the prostate. If not, have them draw you a picture. Where is it hard to reach with the biopsy needle and did we reach it with yours? Are you a candidate for treatment? If so, why, and what do they recommend, and why? Again, have them draw you a picture of the treatment recommendations. What is done during surgery? What is done during radiation treatments? What is done for active surveillance? (No picture needed for AS.) After the meeting, and after you have a chance to review the actual report and consider what they told you, how do you address your follow up questions? How do you get a second opinion on treatment options? Your doctor may be a surgeon and can speak to surgery, but who do you they refer you to for radiation treatment options or AS? The surgeon is not the one to address those options. Time frame going forward whatever the outcome of the biopsy? Check your local library for a copy of Walsh's book. You have time between now and your appointment to get it, skim it, and get really confused. But, relax, you will get really confused before you get clear. We all do. The booked is organized to work as a reference guide or a front to back read. You have the time. Nothing is rushed with prostate cancer. (I don't mean years, but weeks and months.) The book has all the basics you need to know so don't sweat the computer thing. However, this is a very good forum for input from experienced and dedicated fellow travelers. Compete your signature on this site. If you need help doing this seek the help of a computer literate friend. Trust but verify. Too many doctors still believe you will die of something else. If you live a long life it may not be true. So, what is your best guess of your life expectancy? Not kidding here. Your family history, education, commitment to health care, and personal fitness determine this answer and may impact your choices going forward. Take a friend to take notes. You listen and ask questions. Give yourself time to stop and consider during the meeting. Do not be concerned if you generate some lengthy empty pauses while you do this. Ask your friend if they have questions before you finish.",

      "Content": "Make sure the lab report is a copy of the original and not an internal doctor's office summary. Questions and follow up question. Prostate size? What's normal? DRE (digital rectal exam) results, and explain. Cancer or no cancer? No cancer, then what are percentages of biopsy false negative for your profile? How do we monitor you going forward, testing, frequency? If cancer - low risk, intermediate or high? Do you need a second opinion of Gleason scoring if Gleason scoring is ambiguous or becomes critical to your treatment choice. Regardless of Gleason scoring is cancer volume high based on biopsy? How many samples hit cancer? Some reports have a graphic of the prostate showing where and what was found within the prostate. If not, have them draw you a picture. Where is it hard to reach with the biopsy needle and did we reach it with yours? Are you a candidate for treatment? If so, why, and what do they recommend, and why? Again, have them draw you a picture of the treatment recommendations. What is done during surgery? What is done during radiation treatments? What is done for active surveillance? (No picture needed for AS.) After the meeting, and after you have a chance to review the actual report and consider what they told you, how do you address your follow up questions? How do you get a second opinion on treatment options? Your doctor may be a surgeon and can speak to surgery, but who do you they refer you to for radiation treatment options or AS? The surgeon is not the one to address those options. Time frame going forward whatever the outcome of the biopsy? Check your local library for a copy of Walsh's book. You have time between now and your appointment to get it, skim it, and get really confused. But, relax, you will get really confused before you get clear. We all do. The booked is organized to work as a reference guide or a front to back read. You have the time. Nothing is rushed with prostate cancer. (I don't mean years, but weeks and months.) The book has all the basics you need to know so don't sweat the computer thing. However, this is a very good forum for input from experienced and dedicated fellow travelers. Compete your signature on this site. If you need help doing this seek the help of a computer literate friend. Trust but verify. Too many doctors still believe you will die of something else. If you live a long life it may not be true. So, what is your best guess of your life expectancy? Not kidding here. Your family history, education, commitment to health care, and personal fitness determine this answer and may impact your choices going forward. Take a friend to take notes. You listen and ask questions. Give yourself time to stop and consider during the meeting. Do not be concerned if you generate some lengthy empty pauses while you do this. Ask your friend if they have questions before you finish.",

I will let you know when these results come in. Yes, the next thing is to complete his signature. Please correct me, but my understanding is these scans can not make sure it has not spread as stated. They can only determine if it is possible the cancer has spread beyond surgery as a treatment choice while still leaving a grey area between. Do doctors speak this way or is it what we hear? Or do doctors speak in partial truths thinking we can't handle the whole truth? Or, are we being sent on our happy way by doctors too busy to share the whole truth? Very disconcerting to hear words used so carelessly in matters of life and death by those sworn to do no harm. Nothing is certain with this disease unless the tissue itself is sitting in a lab, and even then we need second opinions on some matters.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD My doctor told me this used to be the thinking but that has changed. It is now believed cancer does not get more aggressive but its aggressiveness is set at the time it starts. Here is an excerpt from an article that supports this. Cancer lethality set early The study looked for changes in cancer aggressiveness in men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2004. All of the men had their prostates removed after diagnosis, and biopsy samples were taken from the glands. The Harvard team reexamined the samples and graded them using a tool called the Gleason score, which assigns a number from 2 to 10 based on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope. High-scoring or \u201chigh-grade cancers\u201d tend to be the most lethal. Over the study period, fewer and fewer men were diagnosed with advanced, late-stage prostate cancers that had spread beyond the prostate gland. This reflected the growing use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to diagnose prostate cancers earlier and earlier. In contrast, the proportion of high-grade cancers, as measured by the Gleason score, remained relatively stable rather than gradually becoming more aggressive. Previous studies have seen a similar pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting study that confirms what previous studies have found,\u201d says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, a prostate cancer specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who was not involved in the study. \u201cThere may be rare exceptions, but in the vast majority the cancer is born with a particular Gleason score.\u201d Please post the link to the study. I accept a 3 remains a 3, and whatever causes a cell to produce a 3 may be fixed. But, many men have cells that produce 3 and 4s. Are these the same cells producing 3s and 4s? Will the proportion of cells produce 3s and 4s consistently, for example 4s will always be limited to 5% of new cancer cells? If the aggressiveness relationship is fixed then maybe we go to decimals, i.e. 3.5 or 3.8",

Continue to monitor your PSA for recurrence with an ultrasensitive type test with the goal of early detection and follow up treatment and you will live to die of something else. The amount of G4 and it's location is evidence of your good fortune in choosing treatment and for vigilance going forward. You've got this. The nurse was out of line, unprofessional, and perpetuating outdated myths about prostate cancer. Sadly, some doctors still believe in these myths as well. Each case is unique and the use of adages is not responsible healthcare.",

My G6 was high volume with increasing velocity and upgraded to G3+4 after removal. One thing I've been learning is the risk of hanging everything on one good factor, such as your G6. Your PSA is bouncing around a lot. Are you messing with it? Just askin'. I'd say your age is a factor as well and you are heading for treatment. The risk increases the longer you wait, imo. If treatment is inevitable why wait? You're doing a good job staying on top of this.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DavefromMD My doctor told me this used to be the thinking but that has changed. It is now believed cancer does not get more aggressive but its aggressiveness is set at the time it starts. Here is an excerpt from an article that supports this. Cancer lethality set early The study looked for changes in cancer aggressiveness in men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2004. All of the men had their prostates removed after diagnosis, and biopsy samples were taken from the glands. The Harvard team reexamined the samples and graded them using a tool called the Gleason score, which assigns a number from 2 to 10 based on how abnormal the cells look under a microscope. High-scoring or \u201chigh-grade cancers\u201d tend to be the most lethal. Over the study period, fewer and fewer men were diagnosed with advanced, late-stage prostate cancers that had spread beyond the prostate gland. This reflected the growing use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to diagnose prostate cancers earlier and earlier. In contrast, the proportion of high-grade cancers, as measured by the Gleason score, remained relatively stable rather than gradually becoming more aggressive. Previous studies have seen a similar pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting study that confirms what previous studies have found,\u201d says Dr. Marc B. Garnick, a prostate cancer specialist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center who was not involved in the study. \u201cThere may be rare exceptions, but in the vast majority the cancer is born with a particular Gleason score.\u201d Please post the link to the study. I accept a 3 remains a 3, and whatever causes a cell to produce a 3 may be fixed. But, many men have cells that produce 3 and 4s. Are these the same cells producing 3s and 4s? Will the proportion of cells produce 3s and 4s consistently, for example 4s will always be limited to 5% of new cancer cells? If the aggressiveness relationship is fixed then maybe we go to decimals, i.e. 3.5 or 3.8",

I will let you know when these results come in. Yes, the next thing is to complete his signature. Please correct me, but my understanding is these scans can not make sure it has not spread as stated. They can only determine if it is possible the cancer has spread beyond surgery as a treatment choice while still leaving a grey area between. Do doctors speak this way or is it what we hear? Or do doctors speak in partial truths thinking we can't handle the whole truth? Or, are we being sent on our happy way by doctors too busy to share the whole truth? Very disconcerting to hear words used so carelessly in matters of life and death by those sworn to do no harm. Nothing is certain with this disease unless the tissue itself is sitting in a lab, and even then we need second opinions on some matters.",

It is a highly common finding, but statisticslly not useful in itself of predicting future recurrence. In other words, it is part of the natural progression of the disease, but not a key indicator of future risk. Your other findings are the critical ones, and they are all good. PNI is a precursor to more critical pathology and yours are all negative. That said, and not to spoil the day but to be clear, there are no guarantees with cancer. Your report is the best outcome of the facts. Enjoy it! Imo, it highlights your choice to treat your disease was a good one and timely. Sooner is most often better with this disease, but soon enough works as well. Enjoy the moment and commit to monitoring your status for possible recurrence. Worry has no useful role. If anything, life may be a little sweeter for you.",

I'll post my post-op psa values tomorrow but I recall every one up until today were <.03. So today, I just lost the less-than sign. I'll post exact data tomorrow. Also, my surgeon has been checking my psa every 3 months and I have my last one ordered (before I see him for a followup) 3 months from now. Do you think 3 months is too long to wait and should I email him and ask him to order a test every month ? I had my last test only 2 months ago and it was <.03. Tim That is a question for an RO.",

      "Content": "Be careful. You are both young to be presenting with PC. If you were both on testosterone supplements it may be viewed suspiciously as the source of your PC presenting early. I have heard it's influence can be for early, small, and aggressive cancers. Nobody knows what is normal for testosterone. Everyone wants what testosterone provides; energy, vitality, libido, limber, erections, muscle mass, etc. Who wouldn't, but at what price? Professional advice from Mayo is to not use testosterone supplements to counter normal aging. There have been studies that confuse this issue. What we do know. One proven treatment for advanced prostate cancer is to effectively use drug therapy to reduce testosterone to very low levels and force/stun prostate cancer into remission. The implication in this proven treatment is PC responds to testosterone. It can respond and adjust to manipualtion of testosterone and become resistant to it or continue to thrive at varying levels. It's a wild card. It's use now may affect use later when you may really need it. My advice, unless you have a life threatening issue addressed by testosterone supplementation it is safer to avoid it unless neccesary to combat PC. I am no expert in this, but when I hear talk of experimenting with it in the presence of PC the hair on my neck goes up. Especially, when it's use may have been the source of it presenting as it has. Nobody can claim you are clear of cancer, now or after RP. The commercialized pressure through advertising to influence patients to ask doctors for certain drug therapies seems to cause some doctors to throw up their hands and let you have your way. Sort of an eyes wide open, except you really don't know. You just want to be young again. The symptoms of testosterone use are many.",

      "Content": "Here's a good article on 4+3 and an article on grading in general. G7 has two values, G3+4 and G4+3. A significant difference exists between them. In short, G4+3 is a higher risk. Another consideration is the volume, or number of cores. You have a significant volume on the one side. All the cores on that side hit cancer. That indicates a possibility of a very high volume on that side. 6/12 across the whole prostate is considered a significant volume. While you may have time I'd not characterize this report as indicating a very slow growing cancer. A third consideration, your father is young. For a better picture of that side, you may ask for a 3T MRI. The article I linked offers the possibility it may be downgraded. You will only know this two ways. A second expert opinion on the biopsy slides. I'd recommend this. It may effect your treatment options. Or a pathology report after surgery. One of the values of surgery is you get a more complete pathology report of the cancer. This often matters in higher risk treatment options to determine the extent of localized cancer for follow up radiation treatments. A biopsy can not sample seminal vessicals or lymph nodes or be good indicators of extension or margins of the prostate. My recommendation is you continue to move forward in informing yourself, diagnosing and considering treatment options. The fact your doctor is pursuing additional scans is evidence of a well founded concern with the biopsy report. http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr...scovery_96.php https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/tests/understanding-your-pathology-report/prostate-pathology/prostate-cancer-pathology.html",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic With regard to MRI's, for what it's worth, my own uro doesn't think nearly as highly of them as many studies do. We should make use of what hi PIRAD lesions they do find. As I've said in another thread, I think it's a mistake to do a targeted biopsy with only a few cores that investigate only the imaged lesions and forgoes the standard 12 cores in all zones. And where there is suspicion of PCa, the default should be that the biopsy is still done after a negative mpMRI in a biopsy-naive man. I've been thinking about a quip I saw in someone's signature in another (planted aquarium) forum (referring, I think, to nutrient testing): \"A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches isn't sure.\" I don't think that applies to PCa testing/diagnosis -- Isn't it better to favor the test(s) that indicate there is disease, and then investigate? Yesterday I added a paper to Topic (C) in the Subforum that found that 2.8% of high-grade metastatic PCa has a PSA of 4 or less at diagnosis. ________ OK, I had to Google that watch quip. Turn's out it's Segal's Law, which you can Wiki. \"The pitfalls of too much conflicting information when making a decision.\" Or too much incomplete or partial information. Imagine everything we know is accurate, but only in part.",

This may well be of other causes, but your in the age range and want to begin monitoring for prostate cancer regardless. It may be nothing and your number goes back down. It may be something and needs watching. It may be something that needs treatment soon or someday. So, find a good urologist who specializes in prostate cancer and establish a working relationship. Good advice above. One step at a time: skilled specialist urologist, PHI testing, and see what's next. Now that you have your eyes on it you want to keep this risk on your radar screen and go about living your life. Be grateful. You got an early wake up call. All men are not so lucky as you almost experienced. I've been told only 17% of general practices screen for PSA. Who knows how many don't pay attention when they do. I want to acknowledge you for following it up. Well done. Early detection is the mantra. Welcome!",

      "Content": "Be careful. You are both young to be presenting with PC. If you were both on testosterone supplements it may be viewed suspiciously as the source of your PC presenting early. I have heard it's influence can be for early, small, and aggressive cancers. Nobody knows what is normal for testosterone. Everyone wants what testosterone provides; energy, vitality, libido, limber, erections, muscle mass, etc. Who wouldn't, but at what price? Professional advice from Mayo is to not use testosterone supplements to counter normal aging. There have been studies that confuse this issue. What we do know. One proven treatment for advanced prostate cancer is to effectively use drug therapy to reduce testosterone to very low levels and force/stun prostate cancer into remission. The implication in this proven treatment is PC responds to testosterone. It can respond and adjust to manipualtion of testosterone and become resistant to it or continue to thrive at varying levels. It's a wild card. It's use now may affect use later when you may really need it. My advice, unless you have a life threatening issue addressed by testosterone supplementation it is safer to avoid it unless neccesary to combat PC. I am no expert in this, but when I hear talk of experimenting with it in the presence of PC the hair on my neck goes up. Especially, when it's use may have been the source of it presenting as it has. Nobody can claim you are clear of cancer, now or after RP. The commercialized pressure through advertising to influence patients to ask doctors for certain drug therapies seems to cause some doctors to throw up their hands and let you have your way. Sort of an eyes wide open, except you really don't know. You just want to be young again. The symptoms of testosterone use are many.",

      "Content": "I'd have a concern that a mistake was made. Less likely on Epstein's part, but did he get the right sample or did you get the right reports? Second opinions are for confirmation. This isn't that. This resolves nothing. These findings are too far apart to be useful or believable. The temptation is obvious. Cherry pick the one you want. You've tossed us a softball. Why? I'm confused. How many samples we're taken and how many were sent to Epstein? Please complete your signature. What is your PSA, family, DRE, and symptom histories? Why are you testing at 43? Is this your first biopsy? How did you manage a 3T MRI fusion biopsy as your first? The short answer is either resolve the disparity or act on the higher risk option, imo. What does your doctor say? Too much is missing in this conversation. With what you have chosen to share, your profile is still unclear and you have no path forward other than to resolve the disparity. You can't hang your hat on either one without more information you may have and we do not. So, you tell us. Bottom line seems to be you asking for help while you are withholding. It usually implies an agenda or bias. For you, which one comes closes to matching the rest of your profile? My own experience, my cancer was worse than what the biopsy revealed. I knew it when I was honest with myself about everything else. I had surgery and the results confirmed what I knew, not what I wanted.",

Also, my surgeon has been checking my psa every 3 months and I have my last one ordered (before I see him for a followup) 3 months from now. Do you think 3 months is too long to wait and should I email him and ask him to order a test every month ? I had my last test only 2 months ago and it was <.03. Tim That is a question for an RO.",

      "Content": "This isn't rocket science. It's prostate cancer. A biopsy will be your next step. You want the most experienced group. This is the group who has the most patients. Over thinking this will lead you to make mistakes. Avoiding a biopsy or hiring a doctor who will accomodate you avoiding a biopsy will have a predictable outcome. You will not get a biopsy sooner, but later. With cancer later is bad, sooner is good. Delaying a biopsy delays detection of cancer. Cancer left undetected can grow more and be more difficult to treat. All the tests you mention do not detect cancer. They only suggest you may have cancer. You already know you may have cancer. There is no going back. You will now be monitoring or treating prostate cancer the rest of your life. Welcome to our club. Only a biopsy detects cancer. Avoid a biopsy and you avoid detecting your cancer. Not a good place to be. That outcome is the only sure thing in this scenario. Cancer does two things very well. It grows and it screws with your head. The best path with this disease is the conventional path. The majic bullet here is everyone who has gone before you. Do not squander the work and sacrifice they have made to offer you a cure. Early detection, early treatment. Get out of your head and into a urologist office that specializes in curing prostate cancer. The bigger and more experienced the better. Cancer is a numbers and statistics game, not a who's smarter game. Discipline and ruthless persistence wins this game, not avoidance. The focus of your post is how to avoid a biopsy. You want to clear that out. Whatever is driving that is working against you. Do what you have to to get yourself to a place you are demanding a biopsy and as many as it takes. Then you may have a chance to move forward. Avoiding healthcare is not a good place to be. If you do one thing, let it be a biopsy. Get a biopsy. Get two if that's what it takes. Or three or four. If you want to cure your cancer, it begins with a biopsy.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic This is a good question, and here is my understanding. The impetus to try a plant-derived (or other natural compound) often can come from(1) anecdotal evidence that something helps another condition or disease, and (2) its chemical structure or family is similar to another compound that has demonstrated a desired effect. Studies are then done in vitro, where the compound is put in contact with tissue cultures of a PCa line. Researchers are looking for apoptosis, or the ability of the substance to cause the malignant cells to undergo the normal programmed death of healthy prostate cells (cancer cells are zombies they live on and on, grow, replace healthy tissue and don't function properly); healthy cells of most organs die at a certain point in their lives and are replaced). I see studies about new natural substances inducing apoptosis in PCa cells every month--which only means that they warrant being studied. If the substance is extracted and integrated in a diet as a supplement, it's reasonable to think that a lowering of PSA is from a direct effect on the tumor cells. The British Pomi-T study was formulated specifically for a study (capsules of green tea, broccoli, tumeric, and pomegranate); see Subforum (S) #9. The study was double-blind, randomized and placebo controlled. There was a lowering of PSA and another commentary I've put there states that this lowering was accompanied by a reduction of lesion size on imaging. That's the best kind of evidence, which, unfortunately, we don't usually have. I believe further studies are underway on Pomi-T, which was commercialized. I've been taking it. I think if you read the research studies you'll find discussion about various proposed mechanisms of action that substances have on PCa cells. But getting back to your point, there is current thinking that inflammation itself plays a role in the carcinogenesis of PCa, so the picture is complex! Good answer if you don't have cancer. Meaning, once you have cancer the cancer rules the context. The horse is out of the barn and avoiding cancer or delaying treatment is not the issue. If it is untreatable, then by all means.",

If I am ultimately going to need a second round of treatment I'd rather know sooner than later and treat it sooner than later. the only thing that alters that view is if the study reports the supplement cures cancer, not just slow it. A \"slower\" growing G4 still has a risk the longer it is alive and in my body. As long as these reports only report a drop or slowing of PSA and no actual regression of G4 and 5, I'm a skeptic.",

I'll post my post-op psa values tomorrow but I recall every one up until today were <.03. So today, I just lost the less-than sign. I'll post exact data tomorrow. Also, my surgeon has been checking my psa every 3 months and I have my last one ordered (before I see him for a followup) 3 months from now. Do you think 3 months is too long to wait and should I email him and ask him to order a test every month ? I had my last test only 2 months ago and it was <.03. Tim That is a question for an RO.",

A false negative on the biopsy can be a fifty fifty possibility based on your personal body specifics. Personally, I would not be taking testosterone with your PSA history. One negative biopsy with your PSA history is not proof you do not have cancer or it is safe for you to experiment with testostetone. Your doctor did the only thing he could by recommending a biopsy. It's not proof you do not have cancer. It is not advisable to use hormones to compensate for the effects of normal aging. We do not know enough about them. Are you overweight?

Over thinking this will lead you to make mistakes. Avoiding a biopsy or hiring a doctor who will accomodate you avoiding a biopsy will have a predictable outcome. You will not get a biopsy sooner, but later. With cancer later is bad, sooner is good. Delaying a biopsy delays detection of cancer. Cancer left undetected can grow more and be more difficult to treat. All the tests you mention do not detect cancer. They only suggest you may have cancer. You already know you may have cancer. There is no going back. You will now be monitoring or treating prostate cancer the rest of your life. Welcome to our club. Only a biopsy detects cancer. Avoid a biopsy and you avoid detecting your cancer. Not a good place to be. That outcome is the only sure thing in this scenario. Cancer does two things very well. It grows and it screws with your head. The best path with this disease is the conventional path. The majic bullet here is everyone who has gone before you. Do not squander the work and sacrifice they have made to offer you a cure. Early detection, early treatment. Get out of your head and into a urologist office that specializes in curing prostate cancer. The bigger and more experienced the better. Cancer is a numbers and statistics game, not a who's smarter game. Discipline and ruthless persistence wins this game, not avoidance. The focus of your post is how to avoid a biopsy. You want to clear that out. Whatever is driving that is working against you. Do what you have to to get yourself to a place you are demanding a biopsy and as many as it takes. Then you may have a chance to move forward. Avoiding healthcare is not a good place to be. If you do one thing, let it be a biopsy. Get a biopsy. Get two if that's what it takes. Or three or four.

If I am ultimately going to need a second round of treatment I'd rather know sooner than later and treat it sooner than later. the only thing that alters that view is if the study reports the supplement cures cancer, not just slow it. A \"slower\" growing G4 still has a risk the longer it is alive and in my body. As long as these reports only report a drop or slowing of PSA and no actual regression of G4 and 5, I'm a skeptic.",

      "Content": "Family history is critical. It is your best indicator of your future. All 3 of my brothers have it. All of us waited too long. Two have adverse conditions. I consider my volume an adverse condition making it three. The fourth is yet to be determined. All our profiles are similar and the PSA levels appear to match the risk amongst the four of us. Where it began in the prostate seems to be the only wild card. The second oldest is just getting started and he is older than me. I expect the worse results for him. One is planning salvage radiation with HT after a failed surgery. He is the youngest. Not much volume, but 3 positive margins. His cancer showed up on the surface at the apex. Just had his first consult with his RO after testing .03 after surgery. He is now coordinating timing of his RP healing with hip replacement surgery and it's healing. Ultrasensitive testing has given him time and space to coordinate all his healthcare issues. RT and HT are likely 6 to 8 months out for him. He is the only one taking effective advantage of my experience. The oldest is the most at risk and is being less than proactive. He chose to act after my experience, but still not soon enough. He had SVI and is testing with .1 oblivious to what his risks and possible futures may be. Ugh. The two oldest are head in the sand types and suffer depression. I also have depression, but awareness of my condition allows me to adjust for its impact on my thinking. I was the first to detect and treat thanks to my GP's strong intervention. I shared the whole way, but it made little difference in their awareness. Only the youngest has been aggressive in his self education. The two oldest have done no reading and have no idea what is in store for them or available. The medical industry is woefully lacking in proactive care for prostate cancer and this is clearly the responsibility of men. Women have proven themselves much more effective in education and awareness with breast cancer. Early detection early treatment. You are in a good place and I wish you well. PS: my reference to our PSA being reliable indicators amongst us is just that. It is relative to our familial condition. Another person's PSA value to risk may be different. Waiting to 7 for us was too long. It may be different for others. PSA is produced by healthy and cancer cells and BHP may effect total levels differently among men with cancer. Testing for free PSA helps overcome this.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic This is a good question, and here is my understanding. The impetus to try a plant-derived (or other natural compound) often can come from(1) anecdotal evidence that something helps another condition or disease, and (2) its chemical structure or family is similar to another compound that has demonstrated a desired effect. Studies are then done in vitro, where the compound is put in contact with tissue cultures of a PCa line. Researchers are looking for apoptosis, or the ability of the substance to cause the malignant cells to undergo the normal programmed death of healthy prostate cells (cancer cells are zombies they live on and on, grow, replace healthy tissue and don't function properly); healthy cells of most organs die at a certain point in their lives and are replaced). I see studies about new natural substances inducing apoptosis in PCa cells every month--which only means that they warrant being studied. If the substance is extracted and integrated in a diet as a supplement, it's reasonable to think that a lowering of PSA is from a direct effect on the tumor cells. The British Pomi-T study was formulated specifically for a study (capsules of green tea, broccoli, tumeric, and pomegranate); see Subforum (S) #9. The study was double-blind, randomized and placebo controlled. There was a lowering of PSA and another commentary I've put there states that this lowering was accompanied by a reduction of lesion size on imaging. That's the best kind of evidence, which, unfortunately, we don't usually have. I believe further studies are underway on Pomi-T, which was commercialized. I've been taking it. I think if you read the research studies you'll find discussion about various proposed mechanisms of action that substances have on PCa cells. But getting back to your point, there is current thinking that inflammation itself plays a role in the carcinogenesis of PCa, so the picture is complex! Good answer if you don't have cancer. Meaning, once you have cancer the cancer rules the context. The horse is out of the barn and avoiding cancer or delaying treatment is not the issue. If it is untreatable, then by all means.",

      "Content": "I am not a doctor. Your body produces less urine at night. A natural hormone helps do this so you can sleep. You are used to getting up maybe once or less during the night. During the day you are drinking more and urinating more often. With BHP the increased frequency during the day is not as noticeable or disrupting as at night. Early in BHP it is not a problem during the day to urinate more often. Also, the frequent urges to urinate during the day can be consciously suppressed allowing the bladder to fill more before urinating during the day. At night you notice it more because it bothers your sleep. The urge to urinate wakes you and suppressing it keeps you awake so you go to urinate so you can go back to sleep, but it is not as much as during the day so the pressure of the full bladder is less, so less is eliminated out. As the prostate grows it constricts the urethra. The bladder muscle grows stronger to force the urine through. As the bladder muscle grows stronger it thickens. The thickening shrinks the bladder volume, and you hold less.",

      "Content": "OOM, I did not read a preference in the two responses. I read the question, how did you arrive at your choice of radiation vs surgery? It is a choice many have to make. Dismissing surgery based soley on side effects data is misguided in my opinion as is choosing based soley on side effects as you are discovering with the ADT. The acceptance of side effects is an integral part of all the treatment consideration for this disease. Please complete your signature and hang around with updates so we can follow your results. I'm interested in your PSA history, family history, how long your cancer was developing before treatment, and biopsy results including volume and location. Did you use any prostate treatment drugs or other drugs with hormones, testosterone, etc? I chose surgery for one of the reasons you mentioned, a pathogy report. More importantly, I chose it playing for a long term cure knowing the side effect risks. In my profile, I was not as concerned for the side effects which since have both recovered. Surgery side effects are impacted by the skill of the surgeon, fitness of the patient, and the extent of the cancer, imo, all are variables to consider when choosing surgery. I am now waiting to see if follow up radiation is necessary. I can see a high probability of living well into my 90's. I wanted as long a treatment strategy as possible. This makes me pro-surgery and pro-radiation. Regardless of the test results, I'm not sure I agree that a G9 is low risk in any consideration. My understanding of your profile is, if radiation appears inevitable because of the extent and type of the cancer, going straight to radiation may save the time and stress (including side effects) of a more extensive surgery (wider cut) with a diminshing effectiveness in the face of more advanced aggressive cancer. The doctor recommending surgery may have reason to believe it was highly probable it was still confined. I'm not so sure based on your age and Gleason score. Radiation may have been a better choice for you. Even so, an individual may still want to be more aggressive with a competent surgery option knowing they can follow up with much improved radiation and ADT options. Both RALP surgery experience and radiation treatment technology are improving making past data on side effects somewhat difficult to navigate. Surgery is more of an early detection option for low to intermediate cancers and possible cures in younger men with radiation and ADT as a follow up. Radiation is a less intrusive option for low, intermediate and high risk cancers with more radiation and ADT as a follow up. Radiation has a broader reach. Surgery has an optimal window. My understanding is combining ADT with radiation gives a significant boost to more positive outcomes. While nobody seems to like it, I have heard few cases here where it was considered intolerable and discontinued against the doctor's advice. The extra 5-20% increase in positive long term outcomes gained with ADT in the face of more aggressive and persistent disease is significant, imo. My view is there are many treatment options for this disease. There is no universally accepted one best treatment. Each is dependent on the individual patient profile. Your experience of the ADT being intolerable is a good example. Self prescribing and consistently going against the recommendation of your doctors is not a good sign. You may be not doing your homework on your doctor choices and/or second guessing yourself. Not a good place to be. Discovering you can not tolerate hormone therapy will have a huge impact on managing your disease going forward should it prove to be persistent. I'm not sure what your options will be. One of the lines of conversation in this forum is trying to fine tune the decision matrix with current technology in testing and treatment. Both the poster and you fall into this conversation. Choosing radiation, surgery, ADT, chemo, or eventually some or all is a matrix choice of how to treat this disease that cross several times depending on who, what, and when. With respect for the poster, I think you should have your own thread.",

Radiation is a less intrusive option for low, intermediate and high risk cancers with more radiation and ADT as a follow up. Radiation has a broader reach. Surgery has an optimal window. My understanding is combining ADT with radiation gives a significant boost to more positive outcomes. While nobody seems to like it, I have heard few cases here where it was considered intolerable and discontinued against the doctor's advice. The extra 5-20% increase in positive long term outcomes gained with ADT in the face of more aggressive and persistent disease is significant, imo. My view is there are many treatment options for this disease. There is no universally accepted one best treatment. Each is dependent on the individual patient profile. Your experience of the ADT being intolerable is a good example. Self prescribing and consistently going against the recommendation of your doctors is not a good sign. You may be not doing your homework on your doctor choices and/or second guessing yourself. Not a good place to be. Discovering you can not tolerate hormone therapy will have a huge impact on managing your disease going forward should it prove to be persistent. I'm not sure what your options will be. One of the lines of conversation in this forum is trying to fine tune the decision matrix with current technology in testing and treatment. Both the poster and you fall into this conversation. Choosing radiation, surgery, ADT, chemo, or eventually some or all is a matrix choice of how to treat this disease that cross several times depending on who, what, and when. With respect for the poster, I think you should have your own thread.",

      "Content": "\"because of the clear superiority of RT over RP in preservation of erectile function with equivalent longterm recurrence free survival. RT is also superior to RT in the significantly lower probability of either urinary incontinence or urethral stricture.\" The poster then goes on to say he acted against the recommendations of both his doctors. The above is bias. The patient's needs determine which option is superior, imo. \"Did the uro give any reason for apparently not offering surgery as a treatment option?\" This above is not bias. Everyone is free to ask \"why not\". Ruling out treatment options is another way of determining the need of the treatment. Why radiation, why not surgery, or why surgery and why not radiation or valid questions, imo. Especially for those confronted with this choice. \"Forum Brothers will be interested in how you arrived at your decision for RT+ADT. Did you also consult with a R.O? This above is not bias. Most people want to hear the story and why you did what you did. Be prepared. If there is a bias on this site it's towards due diligence and full disclosure. You can not participate here collecting justification for your own view and expect it to be unchallenged. Surgery is an early detection treatment option, imo. Determining when that window closes is valuable. Radiation offers treatment options across the full range of the disease. My experience of this site is pro-surgery, pro-radiation, and pro-AS. If there is a bias it is for early detection and treatment of treatable disease (early or not). I, personally, am here to prepare for possible radiation therapy after my surgery, as planned. So far my plan is working for me. What drives the need for it to be considered superior to other treatment plans? Anyone who claims one treatment model is universally superior is not clear about the risks of the disease and those who are dealing with it. It's classic bias and justification of a personal choice. Claiming to be a doctor only doubles down on that in a very questionable way, imo. What was missing, and I'm guilty of this a lot, was \"why are you here sharing?\" Do you want to tell your story, looking for advice, camaraderie, or giving back. If your not clear in this people will use what you share to serve their own needs, bias or not. Often people show up to share the exuberance of having made a choice only to have it immediately challenged or asked to share what went on behind the curtain. Difficult to say the least. Made more difficult by the need to justify to themselves it is the \"right\" choice. When, imo, the only question is will/did it work? The fear of a right/wrong choice drives most people, before and after and more so after. Try instead, will/did it work or not for me.",

Waiting until a .2 PSA to consider action indicates your choice to not be aggressive with early detection and treatment options. Standard of care in this situation is usually full body scans to see if it's spread to detectable limits outside the prostate bed. Then treatment with radiation to the prostate bed supplemented with hormone deprivation therapy to boost its effect. Treatment outside the prostate bed depends on if, when, and where they find it.

You want them to align. I/my health system use(s) the intermediate level test to 2 decimal points, <0.02 is the lowest sensitivity. I'd prefer the uPSA, but this works for me. My final G was 3+4, but due to volume my doc put my risk for recurrence at 20%. After 1 year, the doc recommended annual checks. I requested to stay on a 6 month schedule. He's confident, I'm diligent. He understood. Earliar is better on salvage radiation, imo.",

      "Content": "Family history is critical. It is your best indicator of your future. All 3 of my brothers have it. All of us waited too long. Two have adverse conditions. I consider my volume an adverse condition making it three. The fourth is yet to be determined. All our profiles are similar and the PSA levels appear to match the risk amongst the four of us. Where it began in the prostate seems to be the only wild card. The second oldest is just getting started and he is older than me. I expect the worse results for him. One is planning salvage radiation with HT after a failed surgery. He is the youngest. Not much volume, but 3 positive margins. His cancer showed up on the surface at the apex. Just had his first consult with his RO after testing .03 after surgery. He is now coordinating timing of his RP healing with hip replacement surgery and it's healing. Ultrasensitive testing has given him time and space to coordinate all his healthcare issues. RT and HT are likely 6 to 8 months out for him. He is the only one taking effective advantage of my experience. The oldest is the most at risk and is being less than proactive. He chose to act after my experience, but still not soon enough. He had SVI and is testing with .1 oblivious to what his risks and possible futures may be. Ugh. The two oldest are head in the sand types and suffer depression. I also have depression, but awareness of my condition allows me to adjust for its impact on my thinking. I was the first to detect and treat thanks to my GP's strong intervention. I shared the whole way, but it made little difference in their awareness. Only the youngest has been aggressive in his self education. The two oldest have done no reading and have no idea what is in store for them or available. The medical industry is woefully lacking in proactive care for prostate cancer and this is clearly the responsibility of men. Women have proven themselves much more effective in education and awareness with breast cancer. Early detection early treatment. You are in a good place and I wish you well. PS: my reference to our PSA being reliable indicators amongst us is just that. It is relative to our familial condition. Another person's PSA value to risk may be different. Waiting to 7 for us was too long. It may be different for others. PSA is produced by healthy and cancer cells and BHP may effect total levels differently among men with cancer. Testing for free PSA helps overcome this.",

The report is not referring to the base or apex of the gland, but the apex of the transition zone which is mostly in the inner center and mostly to the front. It wraps around the urethra. So, left, center, towards your feet of the transition zone, and the transition zone is center and slightly to the front of the gland. Nothing to worry about. It is difficult to reach with a needle from the rectum since it's on the side away from the rectum or front. One of the problems with TRUS biopsy is difficulty reaching some areas.

      "Content": "Those are probably measurement variations and not evidence your prostate is shrinking even though it may have from the turmeric. Add up extremely young age, artificially suppressed PSA and rising PSA in the face of anti-inflammatory (turmeric) supplements and you are at risk for smaller more aggressive cancer. Testosterone is a wild card. If you were under the care of a endocrinologist and testing your blood levels and administering it carefully to well within normal ranges for your age it may be safe. This is usually not the case. It is unadviseable for use for the effects of normal ageing. We know very little about it. Best to avoid it except for medically significant necessary treatment. 3TMRI is a good idea as long as it results in another biopsy, but it will miss the smaller stuff including the aggressive smaller stuff. However you proceed, a follow up biopsy appears to be in your future. Consider a larger sample number this time.",

And yes, doing so is confronting, but also liberating and surprisingly not difficult. We are all in our end game here. Average expected life span in this country is 78. Higher education, fitness, responsible healthcare, genetics, will, and activity can extend it into your 90s. Planning out how you deal with this disease ongoingly can change if your life expectancy is 5, 10, 15, or 20 years out. Based solely on your biopsy results you are having, not unexpectedly, a recurrence. Waiting until a .2 PSA to consider action indicates your choice to not be aggressive with early detection and treatment options. Standard of care in this situation is usually full body scans to see if it's spread to detectable limits outside the prostate bed. Then treatment with radiation to the prostate bed supplemented with hormone deprivation therapy to boost its effect. Treatment outside the prostate bed depends on if, when, and where they find it. The longer you wait the greater the risk it has/will metastasize. So you know, a retest can happen immediately. There is no reason I am aware of to wait 1-2 months.",

      "Content": "OOM, I did not read a preference in the two responses. I read the question, how did you arrive at your choice of radiation vs surgery? It is a choice many have to make. Dismissing surgery based soley on side effects data is misguided in my opinion as is choosing based soley on side effects as you are discovering with the ADT. The acceptance of side effects is an integral part of all the treatment consideration for this disease. Please complete your signature and hang around with updates so we can follow your results. I'm interested in your PSA history, family history, how long your cancer was developing before treatment, and biopsy results including volume and location. Did you use any prostate treatment drugs or other drugs with hormones, testosterone, etc? I chose surgery for one of the reasons you mentioned, a pathogy report. More importantly, I chose it playing for a long term cure knowing the side effect risks. In my profile, I was not as concerned for the side effects which since have both recovered. Surgery side effects are impacted by the skill of the surgeon, fitness of the patient, and the extent of the cancer, imo, all are variables to consider when choosing surgery. I am now waiting to see if follow up radiation is necessary. I can see a high probability of living well into my 90's. I wanted as long a treatment strategy as possible. This makes me pro-surgery and pro-radiation. Regardless of the test results, I'm not sure I agree that a G9 is low risk in any consideration. My understanding of your profile is, if radiation appears inevitable because of the extent and type of the cancer, going straight to radiation may save the time and stress (including side effects) of a more extensive surgery (wider cut) with a diminshing effectiveness in the face of more advanced aggressive cancer. The doctor recommending surgery may have reason to believe it was highly probable it was still confined. I'm not so sure based on your age and Gleason score. Radiation may have been a better choice for you. Even so, an individual may still want to be more aggressive with a competent surgery option knowing they can follow up with much improved radiation and ADT options. Both RALP surgery experience and radiation treatment technology are improving making past data on side effects somewhat difficult to navigate. Surgery is more of an early detection option for low to intermediate cancers and possible cures in younger men with radiation and ADT as a follow up. Radiation is a less intrusive option for low, intermediate and high risk cancers with more radiation and ADT as a follow up. Radiation has a broader reach. Surgery has an optimal window. My understanding is combining ADT with radiation gives a significant boost to more positive outcomes. While nobody seems to like it, I have heard few cases here where it was considered intolerable and discontinued against the doctor's advice. The extra 5-20% increase in positive long term outcomes gained with ADT in the face of more aggressive and persistent disease is significant, imo. My view is there are many treatment options for this disease. There is no universally accepted one best treatment. Each is dependent on the individual patient profile. Your experience of the ADT being intolerable is a good example. Self prescribing and consistently going against the recommendation of your doctors is not a good sign. You may be not doing your homework on your doctor choices and/or second guessing yourself. Not a good place to be. Discovering you can not tolerate hormone therapy will have a huge impact on managing your disease going forward should it prove to be persistent. I'm not sure what your options will be. One of the lines of conversation in this forum is trying to fine tune the decision matrix with current technology in testing and treatment. Both the poster and you fall into this conversation. Choosing radiation, surgery, ADT, chemo, or eventually some or all is a matrix choice of how to treat this disease that cross several times depending on who, what, and when. With respect for the poster, I think you should have your own thread.",

Add up extremely young age, artificially suppressed PSA and rising PSA in the face of anti-inflammatory (turmeric) supplements and you are at risk for smaller more aggressive cancer. Testosterone is a wild card. If you were under the care of a endocrinologist and testing your blood levels and administering it carefully to well within normal ranges for your age it may be safe. This is usually not the case. It is unadviseable for use for the effects of normal ageing. We know very little about it. Best to avoid it except for medically significant necessary treatment. 3TMRI is a good idea as long as it results in another biopsy, but it will miss the smaller stuff including the aggressive smaller stuff. However you proceed, a follow up biopsy appears to be in your future. Consider a larger sample number this time.",

The report is not referring to the base or apex of the gland, but the apex of the transition zone which is mostly in the inner center and mostly to the front. It wraps around the urethra. So, left, center, towards your feet of the transition zone, and the transition zone is center and slightly to the front of the gland. Nothing to worry about. It is difficult to reach with a needle from the rectum since it's on the side away from the rectum or front. One of the problems with TRUS biopsy is difficulty reaching some areas.

I agree with the PSA testing for you, but which 2 digit test? They run from <0.06 to <0.01 from what I have seen. Mine was <0.01 and is now <0.02. They tried to change it to <0.06, but I am interested in early treatment so I asked for better and I got the <0.02 from Quest. It satisfies me, and more so as each 6 months goes by, but still I want to know when it crosses the 0.03 mark. His insistence on 0.2 as the trigger for treatment I suspect is specific to you and may be influenced by your age.

I am not so confident in your urologist and suggest you follow his advice for a second opinion from a urologist highly skilled in RP (radical prostatectomy) as your next step....Since I assume you know this I say it for others, the location of the known extension in fatty tissue is an accelerant. Did the doctor recommend, in your best interest, another surgeon to move the surgery forward?...Since you have no symptoms that will be improved by surgery (your prostate has remained small - I really question this result and suggest you confirm your prostate size) radiation may be a better fit. It's a question for each of the doctors....I am not so confident in your urologist and suggest you follow his advice for a second opinion from a urologist highly skilled in RP (radical prostatectomy) as your next step. I did not take this route, but from what I have learned you are well served by taking yourself to a cancer center with experience in prostate cancer....My urologist ordered an MRI to map out the extent of the cancer before surgery. I recommend it be considered before whatever your next step is....",
