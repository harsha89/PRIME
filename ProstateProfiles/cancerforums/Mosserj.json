From researching about tertiary G5, while nothing is certain, it does add a risk factor for BCR. The D'Amico calculator puts BCR around 50% at 5 years. But hey - its a calculator - happy to wait and see where things are at in 5 years. One step at a time.",

      "Content": "This forum proved to be most helpful after diagnosis, deciding on treatment and awaiting the surgery day for da Vinci and surgeon to do their thing. Being in Bangkok Thailand and although confident with the surgeon, team and hospital experience the whole event is most demanding and daunting on ones physical and mental capacities. Positive support from my partner and one son who visited from Australia gave me great courage and determination to handle this adventure. But as commented on many times on this forum \"the day comes and goes\" and although your dignity, privacy and personal space are thrown to the wind you get through it. My experience was fairly typical as far as I can tell from others who have posted their journeys except that in Thailand you stay in hospital a little longer - that I didn't mind. Surgery day saw hospital arrival in the morning for 430 pm surgery. Room assignment, normal blood tests on the day, speaking with the surgical team and preparations. Headed to surgery area from the room around 415 and was returned around 845. The OR team showed me the robot and after a brief chat was sleeping soundly from my anaesthetic. Surgery was about 1:45 and remember waking in recovery in a groggy state chatting to the staff. No pain to speak of just uncomfortable feeling from event and catheter. First night was uneventful and slept very well and in the morning I was up and walking around the room and bed a number of times a day. Usual hospital care of checks and medicines, bathing and dressing changes and liquid diet. Lots of gas to pass but no pain. Day 2 all the systems were working and gas almost gone- still no pain from surgery or gas at all - just pulling of surgery area when moving about..Walking the corridors of the ward increasing time and distance. Light food introduced. Nurses emptying the surgery drain and bags routinely. Day 3 was similar and ready to get out. Day 4 was discharge day. Apparently in Thailand most people stay in hospital until the catheter comes out as they don't wish to care for it and themselves when nursing staff can do the job...for them. Doctor was happy for me to be discharged to look after myself. Checked into a local apartment complex now for recovery until the next doctor consult on 3 May for cystogram and hopefully the news the catheter can come out. Here's hoping - no pain or problems, just the annoyance of bag management. Lots education on discharge on large and leg bag management, cleaning and medication requirements. Been going to gym in the apartment complex to use the walking machines a few times a day for 30 minutes each - much cooler atmosphere to walk in than the steam streets of BANGKOK. You can see from my updated signature the pathology results were already provided to me. Turns out as often is the case, the pathology results from surgery showed a more aggressive cancer than found on biopsy. It was an organ confined tumour (15% of prostate size 48 grams) pT2c with G 4+3 with Tertiary 5 (5%) which can be classed at G8. Great news is that everything else was negative - margins, lymphs, seminal vesicles, vas deferens -so sounds like they got it all. I was lucky as tumor was 1 mm from escaping - nerves partially spared on left side, but had to take all the right - so lets see what the future holds. Urologist is pleased with result but cautioned about the aggressive nature of the G5 - so he indicated the need to closely follow my future with PSA tests to watch for any re-occurrence. I note from researching the path result that there is always a future possibility of reoccurrence - but that is for later. I am sticking with the recovery journey and positive aspects of the pathology report - organ confined and negative all around. Went on Tuesday 3 May for my cystogram and 8 day post surgery follow up with the surgeon. Unfortunately he wasn't satisfied with the healing of the urethra and bladder connection so advised that I must life with my buddy \"Mr Foley\" for another week. He says it will come out on Monday 9th for sure. So thats the update from my experience - a normal prognosis and initially scared patient, then a more knowledgeable patient from research and after double checking of biopsy and blood works, MRI etc, finally an informed patient that made a treatment choice and went for it - and aside from being nervous to subject myself to the unknown of all this I have come out the other side not that worse for wear. Onward to recovery and normal, health and happy life - and good luck with that!",

      "Content": "With Da Vinci surgery booked for 4:30 pm on Monday 25th of April (a befitting Australian remembrance day) I have gotten myself into what I believe is the right mindset. Once I decided on Da Vinci surgery (latest version) with an experience team in Bangkok, Thailand (over 1000 & doING weekly) I have been reading lots about recovery and the various experiences many have had. I think that accepting the various possibilities and knowing what to expect in the first few hours and days following surgery has made me both nervous but resigned to the journey. My journey so far and what lies ahead continues to be both unexpected and most disturbing but count myself fortunate to fit enough to battle this disease early. To all those who have posted on this site and shared information and experiences I thank you, as the knowledge gained here is invaluable for informed decision making, getting a positive mindset and to understand where one sits in dealing with this most confusing disease and treatment options. The upside for me (at this point) is that one of my son's is coming to Thailand to visit me from Australia for the weekend in Bangkok, to have some quality time and will be around for surgery and post surgery visits for a few days in support of my partner. Here's to a positive, uneventful surgery and quality post recovery experience so I can remain - \"tranquil in Thailand\". I am trying to proceed with all this with a mindset that considers this: \"Don't regret the past, it's gone. Don't worry about the future, it hasn't arrived. Live in the present and make it wonderful.\" Thanks again everyone for your contributions on this site. Well surgery day arrived and completed and into the 2nd day of recovery. When I was wheeled into the OR they showed me the impressive DV robot and shortly after I was asleep - two hours or so later I woke up in recovery - really only feeling groggy. When back in my room I had a fairly comfortable night with no pain at all. The first day was more awkward than anything getting used to moving around with my IV, surgical drain and new friend - catheter. I got the hiccups most of the day that didn't help. Liquids most of the day but back on food now. No real gas pain and lots of passing wind. Looking forward to another day of recovery and getting out of here on Friday - Thailand like to keep patients in hospital longer than western countries. All good at the moment and really just annoying having the catheter... Cheers",

The results for this healthy 66 year old were a Gleason 7 (3+4) on 6 cores and Gleason 6 (3+3) on a further 6 cores of the 15 taken. Some perineurial invasions on 2 cores. Recent PSA of 9.1 and %fPSA of 9 and PHI of 62. Having read many forum posts the first thing I am doing is keeping calm and reading. Life is what it is and the way forward for me has always involved no panicking and informed decision making. Clearly my next step will be to understand from my urologist surgeon the initial biopsy results, any further imaging and suggestive curative treatments. In the mean time I am avidly reading for information. Happy for any member feedback to assist me in my initial phase and considerations, noting choices for the future will be supported by the Doctors recommendations and my gained knowledge.",

I know it's early, has been undetectable and the sensitive test results can provide unnecessary concerns but after only 7 months it seems to me it's not the best to have these increasing results. Any views or advice on common approach to this situation these days? The next result will no doubt provide a better view of trending. Thanks",

      "Content": "Thanks all for your time to reply and offer views on my situation. I appreciate the information and your postings are helpful to understand the next steps. Yes all reports from same lab and doctor is most concerned already so will let you know how things go in January and in the mean time will seek some consultations. Cheers from sunny Thailand Originally Posted by Mosserj April 16 underwent Di Vinci surgery...path was 4+3 with T5; pT2c, negative margins, limp etc. PSA testing June - 0.04; September - 0.06 and November 0.1 - next test in January to see if it's still rising. I know it's early, has been undetectable and the sensitive test results can provide unnecessary concerns but after only 7 months it seems to me it's not the best to have these increasing results. Any views or advice on common approach to this situation these days? The next result will no doubt provide a better view of trending. Thanks",
