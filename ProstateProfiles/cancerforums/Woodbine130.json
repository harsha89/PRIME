      "Content": "Originally Posted by chiguy Did you get your bloodwork done before or after the DRE? It should be done before, because the DRE will cause PSA to spike. Also, you'll want to avoid ejaculating, bike riding or intense physical activity for a few days before bloodwork as those activities will also raise PSA levels. Good luck with your appointment. Hi Chiguy, It was just a blood test. The Dre was done a few weeks earlier. I did have physical activity in the early morning so maybe that had an effect and it feels like I still have something going on with my prostate because of a urinary infection in March of this year.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by chiguy Did you get your bloodwork done before or after the DRE? It should be done before, because the DRE will cause PSA to spike. Also, you'll want to avoid ejaculating, bike riding or intense physical activity for a few days before bloodwork as those activities will also raise PSA levels. Good luck with your appointment. Hi Chiguy, It was just a blood test. The Dre was done a few weeks earlier. I did have physical activity in the early morning so maybe that had an effect and it feels like I still have something going on with my prostate because of a urinary infection in March of this year. Thanks again",
