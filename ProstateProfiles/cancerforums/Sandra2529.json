      "Content": "My dad was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer last year. He\u2019s 69 years old. He\u2019s a very, very stubborn man who has told his doctor numerous times that he\u2019s not going to go through radiation or operation. I haven\u2019t had a deep conversation as to why he refuses to do either. I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s either pride or he\u2019s fear. He instead chose to do take homeopathic medicine to \u201ccure\u201d him because he\u2019s a firm believer of that. He\u2019s gone to Mexico to get this medication because a family friend\u2019s nephew specializes in homeopathic remedies. He swears that this is helping, although his PSA levels say otherwise. I wish I knew his scores and information, but I don\u2019t have that with me. He received a second opinion on Wednesday and was told the same thing that he needs to get the proper treatment and now the doctor worries that the cancer has spread because of its aggressiveness. I know I have to talk to my dad again as well as my other siblings. But would any of you know what the chances are if it already spread out of the prostate? I know his numbers would help and every case is different. I\u2019m just so scared, sad and just losing sleep over this. Thank you all and wish you all the best.",
