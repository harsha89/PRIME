In fact, my treatment went over the Thanksgiving holiday. To compensate for this day off, they had all of us who were going through radiation come in on SUNDAY. I\u2019ve read different ideas on this, but it was very clear to me that my doctor did not want to break my treatment into pieces. You can read about fractionation of treatments, but he wasn\u2019t supportive of that idea.",

      "Content": "I am impressed that there is obvious coordination of care afoot for your dad. Having the urologist and cardiologist talking to each other about both his heart and his prostate is a good sign. And, it sounds as if the priority for care weighs on the side of his heart first and his prostate second. As others have suggested, it would be a very good thing if the urologist (and a urologic oncologist) sat down with the cardiologist and reviewed specifics. As already pointed out, there are clear options besides surgery (Gleason 7 notwithstanding), and having a second opinion and a multidisciplinary team of doctors communicating, I think this is a good plan of attack!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Barry: You've got this fully UC! (Under Control). Congrats! Getting the MRI prior to surgery indicates a highly diligent surgeon. This will allow detection (90%) and assessment of your PC status and identify any looming surprises in advance. We're with you every step of the way. Good luck! MF I've had two appointments with the physical therapy staff. While my personal trainer works on strength training, these two folks put my through some rigorous training and exercise on pelvic floor strengthening. The last appointment including placing leads around my anal area and then measuring my ability to \"flex\" and strengthen my musculature to improve continency. I could see this on the computer screen. Pretty fascinating and an exercise I'd never though of. I have one more session prior to surgery, then follow-up 30 days post prostatectomy. Also saw the results of the Multidetector CT imaging they did a few weeks ago. Findings: Prostate: 50 mm in diameter No gross estracapsular extension Seminal vessels grossly normal Bladder normal No pelvic lymphadenopathy No aggressive osseous lesion in pelvis Next week is the MRI with the endorectal coil as well as preop work. I'm really ready to get this to the next stage. AND, I'm hoping to NOT need the big box of incontinent pads that arrived yesterday. Thanks to all of you who've posted stuff to help me get ready for this. I can't tell you how encouraging its been to see not only the results, but the fantastic attitude of guys who've been through this drill and are getting on with life! Barry",

      "Content": "I am impressed that there is obvious coordination of care afoot for your dad. Having the urologist and cardiologist talking to each other about both his heart and his prostate is a good sign. And, it sounds as if the priority for care weighs on the side of his heart first and his prostate second. As others have suggested, it would be a very good thing if the urologist (and a urologic oncologist) sat down with the cardiologist and reviewed specifics. As already pointed out, there are clear options besides surgery (Gleason 7 notwithstanding), and having a second opinion and a multidisciplinary team of doctors communicating, I think this is a good plan of attack!",

      "Content": "I'll put the stats down in the profile section after this post, but since this is my first, I'll put it in the text. FIRST. Thanks to all of you for what I've learned about PCa from this forum. Age: 72. Have had rising and falling PSA since 2012. Tested twice a year for 5 years. PSA of 9.8 on 12/16. DRE's every time I got PSA results, always negative. After having the \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over my head for all these years, I asked for a biopsy. 12 cores done on 1/4. Four cores were 3 + 3, six cores were 3+ 4, two cores were 4 +3 (right base less than 5% involved, right mid 60% involved. Not happy about this, but not surprised either. Began educating myself about PCa when I started the semi-annual PSA drill, but it's now more than academic. Have followed the Hopkins newsletter as well as MSK data. Didn't find this site until last week, and now have another resource and lots of great insights from veterans and new guys (like me). The urological practice I've been going to has an outstanding reputation and is extremely well-run. My urologist diagnosed interstitial cystitis back in 1988 after the best docs at Walter Reed (I was a career Army guy), couldn't figure out why I had hematuria and bladder pain. I met with the surgeon last week. Discussed pathology. I asked about sending biopsy to Dr. Epstein at Hopkins for review. (He was surprised I knew who he was.) He said, \"of course we can do that, but I should tell you that the pathologist who did your report worked for Epstein at Hopkins and has a terrific reputation.\" Hmmmm. That base sounds covered. So, at 72 the conversation turns to best option. Fortunately, I have zero health concerns -- no heart, lung, kidney, diabetes, etc. And, I am in great physical condition. Not overweight, have worked out 2-3x weekly with a personal trainer for the past two years, etc. So, we discussed radiotherapy or a robotic. (I had done both a CT and bone scan the week prior -- both negative.) Plan to do the Robotic, and surgeon believes I will have minimal issues. As you get \"chronologically gifted\" recovery (especially incontinence) can be tougher, but I\"m an optimist. My check on the surgeon: top grades from other patients/doctors, was early in the DaVinci game, has mentored others in the robotic prostatectomy business, has done more than 1,000. Will do a consult before I make final call as to where to have this done. At this stage I'm optimistic about outcomes -- though I don't have rose colored glasses when it comes to cancer --- my dad died of colon cancer at 61, my brother died of a glioblastoma multiform at 62, my mom of ovarian at 83 -- oh, and I lost my wife to brain cancer (Astrocytoma grade III) when she was 46. BUT, she was diagnosed at age 32 and lived 13 years. Cancer has been a part of my life for a long time. Now I get to deal with it up close and VERY personally. But, I'm ready to take it on!",

      "Content": "I'll put the stats down in the profile section after this post, but since this is my first, I'll put it in the text. FIRST. Thanks to all of you for what I've learned about PCa from this forum. Age: 72. Have had rising and falling PSA since 2012. Tested twice a year for 5 years. PSA of 9.8 on 12/16. DRE's every time I got PSA results, always negative. After having the \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over my head for all these years, I asked for a biopsy. 12 cores done on 1/4. Four cores were 3 + 3, six cores were 3+ 4, two cores were 4 +3 (right base less than 5% involved, right mid 60% involved. Not happy about this, but not surprised either. Began educating myself about PCa when I started the semi-annual PSA drill, but it's now more than academic. Have followed the Hopkins newsletter as well as MSK data. Didn't find this site until last week, and now have another resource and lots of great insights from veterans and new guys (like me). The urological practice I've been going to has an outstanding reputation and is extremely well-run. My urologist diagnosed interstitial cystitis back in 1988 after the best docs at Walter Reed (I was a career Army guy), couldn't figure out why I had hematuria and bladder pain. I met with the surgeon last week. Discussed pathology. I asked about sending biopsy to Dr. Epstein at Hopkins for review. (He was surprised I knew who he was.) He said, \"of course we can do that, but I should tell you that the pathologist who did your report worked for Epstein at Hopkins and has a terrific reputation.\" Hmmmm. That base sounds covered. So, at 72 the conversation turns to best option. Fortunately, I have zero health concerns -- no heart, lung, kidney, diabetes, etc. And, I am in great physical condition. Not overweight, have worked out 2-3x weekly with a personal trainer for the past two years, etc. So, we discussed radiotherapy or a robotic. (I had done both a CT and bone scan the week prior -- both negative.) Plan to do the Robotic, and surgeon believes I will have minimal issues. As you get \"chronologically gifted\" recovery (especially incontinence) can be tougher, but I\"m an optimist. My check on the surgeon: top grades from other patients/doctors, was early in the DaVinci game, has mentored others in the robotic prostatectomy business, has done more than 1,000. Will do a consult before I make final call as to where to have this done. At this stage I'm optimistic about outcomes -- though I don't have rose colored glasses when it comes to cancer --- my dad died of colon cancer at 61, my brother died of a glioblastoma multiform at 62, my mom of ovarian at 83 -- oh, and I lost my wife to brain cancer (Astrocytoma grade III) when she was 46. BUT, she was diagnosed at age 32 and lived 13 years. Cancer has been a part of my life for a long time. Now I get to deal with it up close and VERY personally. But, I'm ready to take it on!",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the positive vibrations, and very cogent and useful suggestions. There is nothing of greater value than having input from others who have (and are) experiencing cancer. I most definitely learned this when dealing with my wife's 13 years of dealing with it. (I became very proficient in dealing with neurologists, hematology-oncologists, CT scans, MRI's. BUT, it is different this time.) My post-military field has been behavioral science and I've spent about 30 years working with people to improve their ability to lead others--mostly by understanding themselves first. I know my strengths and weaknesses and how I process information and make decisions. My decision style is to amass significant amounts of data, examine it, ask, \"so what am I missing?\" and make a call. This has a downside to it if you don't ask that last question. The posts you guys have made confirmed a lot of my thoughts and also helped me uncover areas I hadn't adequately addressed. So, I've done some more work, and have a plan of action. (In the Army, this would be called an Operations Order -- commonly known as an OpOrd!) After a bit more investigation, I have confirmed that the surgeon is seen as outstanding, experienced, and thorough by other patients, and he gets a great review from my regular doc, whom I've been seeing since 1988. As noted by several of you, the 4 + 3 puts me in the intermediate phase, so active surveillance entails more risk than I'd be willing to take. We discussed the radiology option -- which is entirely feasible. Given the totality of what I'm looking at, I think (for me), the prostatectomy is the way to go. He has scheduled me for an MRI so he can get a complete picture of what he can expect -- particular the approach he wants to take. We will go for nerve sparing on both sides, but he will make the call when he's got a better picture. The MRI will help with this. I'm also being scheduled for sessions with their physical therapist to begin strengthening the pelvic floor well before the surgery. Current plan is to get this scheduled in mid-March. Since I had the biopsy in January, things should be well healed. (I had zero issues with infection, bleeding, etc. from the biopsy...I was actually surprised that this was only moderately uncomfortable.) I was even prepared for really gross semen. I was not disappointed, but that's all fine now. I've read the Walsh book (3d edition) and found it really helpful. There were sections that I did a light skim on -- particularly some of the more exotic therapy. Hopefully, I won't get to that point. It means a lot to have you guys as fellow journeymen. I lurked on this site for several months before I had the biopsy. There was no doubt in my mind that I would someday face a challenge like this. It's very helpful to have guys like Chuck, Michael, Brandon -- well all of you as \"unpaid consultants\" to help me beat this. I'd also say that my life has been so filled with family members who fought the cancer battle before me. I have plenty of role models to emulate. Best to all of you! Barry",

      "Content": "To Michael\u2019s question: yes, I will complete radiation therapy and all the other codicils of the clinical trial (ADT, a lot of measurement, testing, etc.). The idea of moving to Keytruda would be if the usual therapies are ineffective. I could, obviously opt out of the trial and go to Keytruda -- and we discussed that option. As long as I continue to do well, it seems to make sense to only to to the Keytruda if deemed medically necessary. To Fairwind's question on cost: I retired from the military and my TriCare will cover the cost of the drug. Thus far, TriCare has covered everything that Medicare hasn't. For anyone reading this who\u2019s in the 1% of our population currently serving their country, there are some long term benefits for giving 20 or more years of your life to your Country. Oh, the approximate annual cost for Keytruda therapy is $160,000. Merck will undoubtedly recover their discovery and NDA costs as more and more physicians find that Keytruda can (and is) doing amazing things in treating Cancer. My doctor at Hopkins is Clinical Director of Research for Prostate Cancer, Dr. Kenneth Pienta. I cannot say enough good things about this gifted scientist. At the end of our first meeting, I stood to shake his hand and he said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t your rather have an anti-cancer hug?\u201d He also said, \u201cwhile I could \u2018treat\u2019 your Cancer, I am much more interested in KILLING it.\u201d Just an amazing guy....and the same adjective applies to Jane and Donnie. If I send an email at weird hours I get responses from them at equally weird hours. I\u2019ve had a lot of experience in major medical centers, but I\u2019ve never felt the warmth and caring that I\u2019ve experienced from every single person at Johns Hopkins.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the positive vibrations, and very cogent and useful suggestions. There is nothing of greater value than having input from others who have (and are) experiencing cancer. I most definitely learned this when dealing with my wife's 13 years of dealing with it. (I became very proficient in dealing with neurologists, hematology-oncologists, CT scans, MRI's. BUT, it is different this time.) My post-military field has been behavioral science and I've spent about 30 years working with people to improve their ability to lead others--mostly by understanding themselves first. I know my strengths and weaknesses and how I process information and make decisions. My decision style is to amass significant amounts of data, examine it, ask, \"so what am I missing?\" and make a call. This has a downside to it if you don't ask that last question. The posts you guys have made confirmed a lot of my thoughts and also helped me uncover areas I hadn't adequately addressed. So, I've done some more work, and have a plan of action. (In the Army, this would be called an Operations Order -- commonly known as an OpOrd!) After a bit more investigation, I have confirmed that the surgeon is seen as outstanding, experienced, and thorough by other patients, and he gets a great review from my regular doc, whom I've been seeing since 1988. As noted by several of you, the 4 + 3 puts me in the intermediate phase, so active surveillance entails more risk than I'd be willing to take. We discussed the radiology option -- which is entirely feasible. Given the totality of what I'm looking at, I think (for me), the prostatectomy is the way to go. He has scheduled me for an MRI so he can get a complete picture of what he can expect -- particular the approach he wants to take. We will go for nerve sparing on both sides, but he will make the call when he's got a better picture. The MRI will help with this. I'm also being scheduled for sessions with their physical therapist to begin strengthening the pelvic floor well before the surgery. Current plan is to get this scheduled in mid-March. Since I had the biopsy in January, things should be well healed. (I had zero issues with infection, bleeding, etc. from the biopsy...I was actually surprised that this was only moderately uncomfortable.) I was even prepared for really gross semen. I was not disappointed, but that's all fine now. I've read the Walsh book (3d edition) and found it really helpful. There were sections that I did a light skim on -- particularly some of the more exotic therapy. Hopefully, I won't get to that point. It means a lot to have you guys as fellow journeymen. I lurked on this site for several months before I had the biopsy. There was no doubt in my mind that I would someday face a challenge like this. It's very helpful to have guys like Chuck, Michael, Brandon -- well all of you as \"unpaid consultants\" to help me beat this. I'd also say that my life has been so filled with family members who fought the cancer battle before me. I have plenty of role models to emulate. Best to all of you! Barry",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Barry: You've got this fully UC! (Under Control). Congrats! Getting the MRI prior to surgery indicates a highly diligent surgeon. This will allow detection (90%) and assessment of your PC status and identify any looming surprises in advance. We're with you every step of the way. Good luck! MF I've had two appointments with the physical therapy staff. While my personal trainer works on strength training, these two folks put my through some rigorous training and exercise on pelvic floor strengthening. The last appointment including placing leads around my anal area and then measuring my ability to \"flex\" and strengthen my musculature to improve continency. I could see this on the computer screen. Pretty fascinating and an exercise I'd never though of. I have one more session prior to surgery, then follow-up 30 days post prostatectomy. Also saw the results of the Multidetector CT imaging they did a few weeks ago. Findings: Prostate: 50 mm in diameter No gross estracapsular extension Seminal vessels grossly normal Bladder normal No pelvic lymphadenopathy No aggressive osseous lesion in pelvis Next week is the MRI with the endorectal coil as well as preop work. I'm really ready to get this to the next stage. AND, I'm hoping to NOT need the big box of incontinent pads that arrived yesterday. Thanks to all of you who've posted stuff to help me get ready for this. I can't tell you how encouraging its been to see not only the results, but the fantastic attitude of guys who've been through this drill and are getting on with life! Barry",

      "Content": "I'll put the stats down in the profile section after this post, but since this is my first, I'll put it in the text. FIRST. Thanks to all of you for what I've learned about PCa from this forum. Age: 72. Have had rising and falling PSA since 2012. Tested twice a year for 5 years. PSA of 9.8 on 12/16. DRE's every time I got PSA results, always negative. After having the \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over my head for all these years, I asked for a biopsy. 12 cores done on 1/4. Four cores were 3 + 3, six cores were 3+ 4, two cores were 4 +3 (right base less than 5% involved, right mid 60% involved. Not happy about this, but not surprised either. Began educating myself about PCa when I started the semi-annual PSA drill, but it's now more than academic. Have followed the Hopkins newsletter as well as MSK data. Didn't find this site until last week, and now have another resource and lots of great insights from veterans and new guys (like me). The urological practice I've been going to has an outstanding reputation and is extremely well-run. My urologist diagnosed interstitial cystitis back in 1988 after the best docs at Walter Reed (I was a career Army guy), couldn't figure out why I had hematuria and bladder pain. I met with the surgeon last week. Discussed pathology. I asked about sending biopsy to Dr. Epstein at Hopkins for review. (He was surprised I knew who he was.) He said, \"of course we can do that, but I should tell you that the pathologist who did your report worked for Epstein at Hopkins and has a terrific reputation.\" Hmmmm. That base sounds covered. So, at 72 the conversation turns to best option. Fortunately, I have zero health concerns -- no heart, lung, kidney, diabetes, etc. And, I am in great physical condition. Not overweight, have worked out 2-3x weekly with a personal trainer for the past two years, etc. So, we discussed radiotherapy or a robotic. (I had done both a CT and bone scan the week prior -- both negative.) Plan to do the Robotic, and surgeon believes I will have minimal issues. As you get \"chronologically gifted\" recovery (especially incontinence) can be tougher, but I\"m an optimist. My check on the surgeon: top grades from other patients/doctors, was early in the DaVinci game, has mentored others in the robotic prostatectomy business, has done more than 1,000. Will do a consult before I make final call as to where to have this done. At this stage I'm optimistic about outcomes -- though I don't have rose colored glasses when it comes to cancer --- my dad died of colon cancer at 61, my brother died of a glioblastoma multiform at 62, my mom of ovarian at 83 -- oh, and I lost my wife to brain cancer (Astrocytoma grade III) when she was 46. BUT, she was diagnosed at age 32 and lived 13 years. Cancer has been a part of my life for a long time. Now I get to deal with it up close and VERY personally. But, I'm ready to take it on!",

      "Content": "Some of the decision making process is due to our psychological wiring. There are those who only make decisions after assembling as much data as possible, then moving on. Others are prone to make a call based on what \u201cfeels\u201d right, or what their intuition tells them. Is there anything more intensely personal than making a tough call on what to do after a cancer diagnosis? There\u2019s a natural tendency to defend a decision already made. What I have valued most about this forum has been the wide range of \u201chow I decided to do what I did.\u201d This proved invaluable to me 14 months ago when I was trying to make a call for myself. My life history just couldn\u2019t push me in the direction of communicating (or on-communicating!) with someone who forbade honest discussion of alternatives. It almost seems a bit like invoking the \u201cthought police\u201d which surely hampers an open and honest conversation.",

      "Content": "I had a colonoscopy just prior to IMRT (my Dad died of colon cancer). I\u2019ve been religious about a 5 year check for about 15 years. I\u2019d had polyps in each of the last three. None in my last check -- good news. My RT consisted of a total of 69 Gy. 46 to the pelvic fossa and 23 boost. I finished in late November \u201917. SO FAR, I haven\u2019t had any serious issues, though I definitely have a different elimination schedule. It seems as if I\u2019ll go a couple of days, then have a massive set of clean outs and repeat the process. I\u2019ve been told that there can be long term complications from the IMRT, and that they can occur (sometimes) years post therapy. Just one more thing to pay attention to, right?",

While I didn\u2019t have as high a PSA, or some of the complications you mention, I did go through the same chemo treatment your husband is taking and I\u2019m also on ADT. If it\u2019s any comfort to you, the chemo and ADT brought my PSA score to .1. While getting a cure would be wonderful, this disease is eminently treatable. I look at a bit like going into a maze. You come to one dead end and turn left. Here\u2019s treatment for that. Then you walk a bit further and there\u2019s another dead end. Turn right. There\u2019s another treatment available. While your husband is younger than most of us, that is probably a positive for him. Let us know what happens. We\u2019re all pulling for you both.",

      "Content": "Many of us on this Forum can truly understand the enormous impact a PCa diagnosis has on not just those of us who have it, but also our family members. The suggestions you\u2019re receiving are based on our own personal experiences, and his (and yours) may differ. BUT, the best weapon for either treatment (or cure -- though that sounds less likely from the info you\u2019ve been given) is KNOWLEDGE. From my experience, putting my trust in an expert created an environment for me that was grounded in top notch medical care. I went from my home in Greensboro, NC to Baltimore, MD to get that expertise at Johns Hopkins. For sure you want to have an appointment for him at the Cleveland Clinic as soon as you can get one. THEN you\u2019ll have a much clearer idea of treatment options. Trust me, he does have treatment options. Finally, and perhaps this is just me -- as I coped with a very scary pathology -- I decided that IF this nasty disease is going to put me down, I wanted to be able to say to my son that I did everything I possibly could to beat the disease. I don\u2019t believe I could have said that if I didn\u2019t seek out the very best treatment options. He lost his Mom to brain cancer when he was 18 (he\u2019s now 42), and I want to be a Dad and Grandad as long as I can. He probably feels much the same, and your seeking out this forum tells me a lot about how you love him. There is treatment for him that will make a difference. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read many of the options here on cancerforums.net. Good luck!",

The regiment started off with 4 sessions of Docetaxel (each session separated by 3 weeks). Also began Lupron on same day as starting chemo. My major side effect from the chemo was tiredness -- which began on day 5 after chemo and lasted about 4 days. My hair thinned but I did NOT lose it. After completing chemo I had 69 Gray of radiation. PSA has been tested each quarter after surgery and has stayed at .01. Have been reading a LOT of research (as most of us do!), and it seems as if administering docetaxel for guys like us has become popular. My doc (Dr. Pienta) feels that administering the chemo early treats some of the systemic cells (I had two lymph nodes that tested positive.) Not enjoying the ADT, but you do what you gotta do!",

      "Content": "Many of us on this Forum can truly understand the enormous impact a PCa diagnosis has on not just those of us who have it, but also our family members. The suggestions you\u2019re receiving are based on our own personal experiences, and his (and yours) may differ. BUT, the best weapon for either treatment (or cure -- though that sounds less likely from the info you\u2019ve been given) is KNOWLEDGE. From my experience, putting my trust in an expert created an environment for me that was grounded in top notch medical care. I went from my home in Greensboro, NC to Baltimore, MD to get that expertise at Johns Hopkins. For sure you want to have an appointment for him at the Cleveland Clinic as soon as you can get one. THEN you\u2019ll have a much clearer idea of treatment options. Trust me, he does have treatment options. Finally, and perhaps this is just me -- as I coped with a very scary pathology -- I decided that IF this nasty disease is going to put me down, I wanted to be able to say to my son that I did everything I possibly could to beat the disease. I don\u2019t believe I could have said that if I didn\u2019t seek out the very best treatment options. He lost his Mom to brain cancer when he was 18 (he\u2019s now 42), and I want to be a Dad and Grandad as long as I can. He probably feels much the same, and your seeking out this forum tells me a lot about how you love him. There is treatment for him that will make a difference. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read many of the options here on cancerforums.net. Good luck!",

While I didn\u2019t have as high a PSA, or some of the complications you mention, I did go through the same chemo treatment your husband is taking and I\u2019m also on ADT. If it\u2019s any comfort to you, the chemo and ADT brought my PSA score to .1. While getting a cure would be wonderful, this disease is eminently treatable. I look at a bit like going into a maze. You come to one dead end and turn left. Here\u2019s treatment for that. Then you walk a bit further and there\u2019s another dead end. Turn right. There\u2019s another treatment available. While your husband is younger than most of us, that is probably a positive for him. Let us know what happens. We\u2019re all pulling for you both.",

      "Content": "Keep good spirits! I started a clinical trial (post RALP) at Johns Hopkins for guys with metastatic PCa. The regiment started off with 4 sessions of Docetaxel (each session separated by 3 weeks). Also began Lupron on same day as starting chemo. My major side effect from the chemo was tiredness -- which began on day 5 after chemo and lasted about 4 days. My hair thinned but I did NOT lose it. After completing chemo I had 69 Gray of radiation. PSA has been tested each quarter after surgery and has stayed at .01. Have been reading a LOT of research (as most of us do!), and it seems as if administering docetaxel for guys like us has become popular. My doc (Dr. Pienta) feels that administering the chemo early treats some of the systemic cells (I had two lymph nodes that tested positive.) Not enjoying the ADT, but you do what you gotta do!",

      "Content": "My partner is 62 and was having what sounded like BPH last June. He scheduled an appointment with our family practice doc. Was seen by the PA. PA did DRE, found a pea size nodule and prescribed a course of CIPRO. Did PSA. PSA came back as 4.54. Referred to Urologist in Aug 18. Uro ordered PSA and did DRE, noted pea size nodule. PSA came back as 2.1. Scheduled for follow up Jan \u201919. At Jan appointment, Uro did DRE, said the lump was the size of a marble and ran PSA. PSA came back as 2.6. Uro ordered MRI, refused by Insurance. Uro wants to run biopsy (\u201cout of abundance of caution\u201d) Insurance refused to pay for biopsy with a 2.6 PSA. My slightly educated impression would say: \u201cslow stream, let\u2019s try a course of antibiotics and do PSA to be on safe side. Return after course of Cipro, PSA drops to 2.1. \u201cAha! we have cleared the infection, (but let\u2019s check again to be safe)\". Recheck in 5 months, PSA is 2.6. Has anyone some insight into doing a prostatic biopsy with a PSA that bumped .5 in 5 months and a nodule that seems to be growing? Is it unusual to order a biopsy with a 2.6 PSA? What\u2019s the likelihood a nodule would influence PSA score? Ideas would really be welcome. (The stats below are MINE. Please just comment on what\u2019s above.)",

      "Content": "Next Monday I get my last Lupron injection. This marks 2 full years on ADT. It HAS been a slog, but even with G9, my PSA has remained undetectable. The side effects you\u0092ve read about? I\u0092ve had almost all of them to one degree or another. But before I sound like a whiner: My Doc carefully explained at my first appointment that his goal was to \u0093kill\u0094 my cancer rather than \u0093treat\u0094 it. The ADT was to sensitize my system so that the chemo therapy would be enhanced. After completing chemo, the continuing ADT would further improve my response to the 69 Gy of radiation. I agree about the importance of exercising. I\u0092ve worked out with a trainer for 6 years. The bi-weekly workouts while on Lupron have been much tougher. More adipose tissue, shortness of breath, hot flashes, all of the SE that I\u0092d read about came to pass. I wouldn\u0092t change a thing. There\u0092s nothing I can\u0092t do that I could have done prior to ADT. BUT, almost every physical activity has been much tougher. The shortness of breath has....by far....been the most crushing side effect. There were times in my workouts when my trainer would make me sit down to catch my breath. Hated that. Lastly, my libido has completely disappeared. While I definitely miss it, the mere fact that I\u0092ve enjoyed the last 2 years anyway...well it could be a whole lot worse.",

      "Content": "Had my quarterly blood letting (CBC, Metabolic Panel, Testosterone, PSA) at Hopkins on Monday. Some of the CBC and Metabolic panel results were weird. Explanation. Completing two full years of ADT has had its impact on everything from red cells to glucose levels. BUT, I had my last Eligard injection. Doctor said that we\u2019d start seeing some testosterone kick in by mid to late summer. Any testosterone would be better than under 20! PSA results arrived today. I continue my membership along with the rest of the \u201cundetectables.\u201d A group to which I am happy to be a part of! Dr. Pienta feels I have a better than even shot at curing this awful G9 prostate cancer. That sounds really good and makes the past two years on ADT worthwhile. ADT plus chemo, then ADT plus radiation has been a slog. (The only thing I haven\u2019t had with ADT has been a gin and tonic.) If the research shows that ADT sensitizes the cancer cells making chemo and radiation more potent -- well, we\u2019ll have quite a few months (hopefully, years), to check the outcome. Thanks to all of you guys for helping me stay positive. I dedicate a past hot-flash to each and every one of you!",

      "Content": "I live in Greensboro, NC. I had biopsy and RALP in Greensboro. Once the post-surgery pathology report kicked in, I transferred follow-up care to the Brady Urological Institute at Johns Hopkins. As you can see in my signature, it turned out to be very serious cancer (G-9), lymph node involvement, etc. I\u2019ve been in a clinical trial at Hopkins since June 2017. In order to be compliant to the trial, I go to Hopkins for 1 day a month. I have had three appointments back-to-back. Blood draw for CBC, Metabolic Panel, Testosterone and PSA. I\u2019ve had an injection (either Lupron , Trelstar, or Eligard) every 90 days for two years. Monday was my last injection of Eligard. (Yes, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s over) Hopkins has been amazing as has been my local cancer center (Wesley Long). I had 70 Gy of radiation in Greensboro, and a couple of times Hopkins let me off the quarterly appointment and allowed me do bloodworm and ADT injection in Greensboro. I WAS very concerned about coordinating care. I failed to realize that this is quite normal. Both sites are on \u201cEpic\u201d so it is not an issue to see what\u2019s going on at Hopkins or in Greensboro. My radiology/oncologist drew up the radiation plan, sent it to Hopkins, then took the time to call my Hopkins doc to make sure he approved the plan. Initially I made quite a few trips to Baltimore, mainly because I had four sessions of Docetaxel, and JH felt I should to the chemo at their place. There is a lot of blood drawn post chemo and pre chemo. I became good friends with the phlebotomist at the local LabCorp facility. Each does of chemo required 3 different blood draws. (That was a total of 12 vials of blood.) Hopkins could not do chemo without very fresh CBC results. If they didn\u2019t have the sample they needed, I\u2019d have missed a chemo treatment. I think sharing the responsibility for treatment is a bit more complicated. Is it worth it? If you see where I started this journey and where I am two years later, you\u2019d agree that this was a smart move. Not to be melodramatic, but I\u2019ve had two years (pretty trouble free), and my Doctor at Hopkins feels I have a real shot at curing my cancer.. When I started the process I decided that I would take complete responsibility for myself. Obviously, I\u2019ve had a lot of support and world class treatment. Everyone is different, everyone has life issues to deal with. I\u2019d like to be dealing with them for many more years. Good luck with whatever you do!",

ANOTHER PSA, but today (drumroll) 0.00 I\u0092m obviously very happy about this turn of events, but I also know there\u0092s more stuff ahead of me.

For whatever, reason, my Doctor at Hopkins is more comfortable without the ultra sensitive version.

I\u2019ve had two PSA\u2019s in the last 10 days. One for an annual physical (0.1), and then a second was done locally and sent to Hopkins to close out the clinical trial. It, too was 0.1. So in the past 4 weeks I\u2019ve had three PSA\u2019s. The were evaluated by three different labs and they were all 0.1",

For whatever, reason, my Doctor at Hopkins is more comfortable without the ultra sensitive version. I asked him about it 18 months ago and he said that we\u2019d get what we needed from the standard version. I\u2019m guessing this may be a \u201curologist\u2019s choice\u201d kind of thing. I\u2019ve had two PSA\u2019s in the last 10 days. One for an annual physical (0.1), and then a second was done locally and sent to Hopkins to close out the clinical trial. It, too was 0.1. So in the past 4 weeks I\u2019ve had three PSA\u2019s. The were evaluated by three different labs and they were all 0.1",

There are a lot of resources at hand, and it\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019ve already figured that out. If you haven\u2019t yet read the stickies at the top of our PCa form, do so. There\u2019s a lot of hard work that went into guys who researched (and continue). As you can see from my stats below, I had a RALP at 74. So much for the age deal. My uro and my surgeon were more concerned with my physical condition than my chronological age. Your reasons 1-4 for the surgery look like you\u2019ve done the rational/logical approach, though with a G6, I can see why you\u2019d look at other than surgery first. I think most guys opt first for a cure rather than treatment, but there are so many things to weigh, that it is not a straightforward decision. Incidentally, my biopsy didn\u2019t look all that awful. Once my prostate had its pathology report, it turned out a LOT more serious than expected. Longevity is a crapshoot as it is, but if something serious is going on, get it early before serious turns to tragedy. BTW, as its was explained to me, most surgeons don\u2019t want to deal with prostate removal post radiation because the RT makes it very difficult to do a clean job afterwards.",

As I began treatment there (and I\u2019m in a Phase II clinical trial), I recall specifically asking him why (post RALP) I was starting on chemo rather than the more standard EBRT/ADT route for metastatic PC. His logic seems very sound (I had a couple of lymph nodes that tested positive) \u201cAll it takes is a few PC cells wandering around somewhere other than where you\u2019ll be irradiated, the chemo is to give us a shot at them.\u201d While the word \u201cimpossible\u201d is pretty harsh, and I\u2019m not an expert in nuclear imaging -- will any scan ever be able to spot a single bad actor cell?",

      "Content": "Hey Dave, another Hopkins guy here! Your experiences pretty much dovetail with mine. I had a total of 69 Gy. This was around two full months worth -- 1 session a day. I\u2019d already gone through RALP and Chemo before I started radiation. I was started on Lupron coincident with my first Chemo treatment. I\u2019ve been on Lupron now for about 20 months and will have my last injection on 11 March. I have never been overweight in my life. Until I started on Lupron, that is. After the first 6 months, I\u2019d gained 5 pounds. I continued the same level of physical activity (I\u2019ve worked out 2x a week with a personal trainer for 6 years), but it seemed like no matter what I did, I gained weight. At the end of 20 months, I\u2019m 18 pounds overweight. I still have the same focus on fitness I\u2019ve always had -- but I also have the unfortunate 18 pounds which gives me shortness of breath, and physical fatigue I have never had before. I actually had a cardiac consult (with stress EKG) because the shortness of breath scared the hell out of me! So, the good news is my G9 cancer is being held in check (PSA of 0.1 since surgery). . The unhappy news is the side effects of Lupron have been tolerable (except for an inner tube around my middle), the misery of hot flashes, and some minor other outcomes. I look at this stuff and sound whiny. The bigger and more important factor has been extremely positive results in my doctor\u2019s \u201cKill Cancer\u201d campaign.",

      "Content": "So, all of us want to get over the \u201cpad\u201d thing as quickly as possible (I know I did). This may sound weird, but I took the digital kitchen scale (to measure ingredients), and put it in the bathroom. I made a monthly chart with space for each day....and in that space, I wrote in what each pad weighed when I changed it. (The obvious idea was to see the weight decreasing as I went from day to day.) So, this was a real incentive for me to pay attention to strengthening what was left of my pelvic floor muscles. My doc REQUIRED physical therapy prior to and after surgery for strengthening. AND, being able to chart my progress worked -- at least for me. Since I had more treatment post surgery (chemo and radiation), getting dry was essential before I could move on to the next therapy.",

      "Content": "My first brush with ADT was last June. I had the 90 day version of Trelstar. Have had two subsequent injections, but they switched to Lupron. I was told there\u2019s a lot of pressure to go with whatever\u2019s the least expensive (I\u2019m on Medicare and TriCare). I didn\u2019t notice any difference. Side effects are just like everyone else\u2019s on here: weight gain (belly fat), hot flashes multiple times daily, some tiredness. I have really worked on the weight issue with both diet and increased physical exercise (trainer 3x a week), plus three hours of additional cardio. I\u2019m trying hard to avoid cardiovascular and bone issues. I\u2019m on it because I need it, not because I want it. There\u2019s no doubt that ADT has had and is having a clear impact on my life.

While we are all different, I truly believe the more prepared he is, the quicker he\u2019ll be back where a 45 year old ought to be. Since you have had cancer yourself, you have gone through the stages that we all go through. He will as well, and you can obviously facilitate his ability to move through them more easily. I lived for 13 years with a spouse who\u2019d been treated for brain cancer. We had a \u201cnew normal\u201d after she had surgery, chemo, and radiation. While I lost her at the end of the 13 years, those years we did have were awesome. She saw our son go from K to graduation from high school. BUT, we did this together. And, that\u2019s what you two will do. You will have a \u201cnew normal.\u201d It will be different from pre- prostate cancer. It may well be even better because this experience can and should draw you even closer together. He really does need to get himself prepared for this. You can (and obviously are!) doing the pick and shovel work. But, he\u2019ll be the one dealing with the catheter, incontinence, dribbling, all the possible ED stuff. Most all of the guys on this forum have successfully navigated this disease, so will he, and so will you! Sending good wishes.",

      "Content": "Really appreciate your chronological narrative, Fairwind. I\u2019m also in the high-risk category and entered a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins last Spring. If it\u2019s any comfort to you, 6 weeks post RALP I started chemo and ADT. I had four infusions of Docetaxel (taxotere) separated by 3 weeks. Lots of CBC\u2019s, metabolic panels, PSA\u2019s. Also had 69 Gy. The comfort I offer is that the chemo treatments were not all that bad. They prepped me with Dexamethasone the day prior, day of, and day after chemo to reduce nausea. It worked pretty well. My main side effect was tiredness 5 days post chemo (I could set my watch for the regularity). My energy level was somewhat diminished and I did not have the usual appetite. My hair thinned, but I did not lose it. The chemo (as far as I am concerned) was preferable to being on ADT. It surely sounds as if you are receiving terrific care and I\u2019ll be following your progress!",

You\u2019re already seeing the urine clear up as you hydrate and pass urine out of your bladder. Remember: your doctor did an anastomosis -- reconnected your urethra to your bladder. They sever the urethra in order to remove your prostate, then sew you back together. (Stark description, but that\u2019s the procedure.) As you can imagine, that stitching causes some clotting and bleeding. It is ABSOLUTELY normal. So is the constipation. It\u2019s an aftereffect of anesthesia and any kind of opiod pain reliever. All this will soon be in your rear view mirror. My major issue was feeling like my insides were coming apart when I coughed!",

I\u2019ve gotten into the Zero Prostate Walk fundraising effort in my community and am planning on being active on the national level this year in lobbying Congress for more money for PCa research. The outreach and meeting others who are also coping with this disease is a great morale lift for me as well. This Forum has had a huge impact on both understanding PCa and dealing with the treatment.

As I began treatment there (and I\u2019m in a Phase II clinical trial), I recall specifically asking him why (post RALP) I was starting on chemo rather than the more standard EBRT/ADT route for metastatic PC.

If it\u2019s any comfort to you, 6 weeks post RALP I started chemo and ADT. I had four infusions of Docetaxel (taxotere) separated by 3 weeks. Lots of CBC\u2019s, metabolic panels, PSA\u2019s. Also had 69 Gy. The comfort I offer is that the chemo treatments were not all that bad. They prepped me with Dexamethasone the day prior, day of, and day after chemo to reduce nausea. It worked pretty well. My main side effect was tiredness 5 days post chemo (I could set my watch for the regularity). My energy level was somewhat diminished and I did not have the usual appetite. My hair thinned, but I did not lose it. The chemo (as far as I am concerned) was preferable to being on ADT. It surely sounds as if you are receiving terrific care and I\u2019ll be following your progress!",

I have made prostate cancer a part of my work. There\u2019s a lot we can do. I\u2019ve gotten into the Zero Prostate Walk fundraising effort in my community and am planning on being active on the national level this year in lobbying Congress for more money for PCa research. The outreach and meeting others who are also coping with this disease is a great morale lift for me as well. This Forum has had a huge impact on both understanding PCa and dealing with the treatment. Hope you\u2019ll find as much help from the guys on here as I have.",

Epstein is (without much argument), the best pathologist in the US, and perhaps the world, when it comes to accuracy of prostate diagnosis. The pathologist who first did my diagnosis was not Epstein. The second was Epstein. Both of the pathology reports were virtually identical. I then found out that the first pathologist had trained under Epstein. My MD at Hopkins and I had a laugh about this.",

      "Content": "HI Trex, As you\u0092ve already experienced, there is a warm welcome when you become \u0093one of us.\u0094 While none of us want to be here, there is a lot of great info provided, completely non-judgmental support, and a willingness to answer any question -- even if it seems small and unimportant. i\u0092m also in the high risk category (higher than you, though I really don\u0092t much want to compete for that \u0091honor.\u0094 The info you\u0092ll be given from your medical team will kind of dribble out (bad metaphor), you may find this tough and anxiety inducing. The guys who post on here can be very helpful by translating stuff into understandable points as you get further on into the process. While nobody is a urologic surgeon, RO, or oncologist, there is a lot of knowledge that will give you deeper understanding of what\u0092s going on. I\u0092ve been on here for just short of two years. Really have appreciated the support, and I know you will as well.",

In order to remain \u0093compliant\u0094 with my clinical trial they run a CBC, Metabolic Panel, Testosterone AND (of course), the PSA every 90 days. I also get the wonderful Lupron Injection. I had blood drawn on the 17th, and all the numbers are now in: all looking good, and the PSA held at 0.1. I\u0092ve avoided thinking about ADT, and just deal with it. I\u0092ve now had 7 injections and one more to go. This makes for a great start to the holiday season! Just back from a month down under. Two weeks in Australia and two weeks in New Zealand. VERY good for my morale. Merry Christmas to all of you.",

      "Content": "I keep up with the postings here pretty regularly, and when I reflect back to the beginning of this journey (unwanted though it may be), I\u2019m struck by how much I\u2019ve learned about the disease in the last 22 months. There surely is value in better understanding the complexity and enormous variability within the PCa framework. Pat Walsh\u2019s book (which I first heard about here), gave me a good foundation and made me a LOT more comfortable when I started this journey two years ago. I\u2019m realizing more and more about the impact this brotherhood has. Twice this year my doc at Hopkins has asked me if I\u2019d be willing to talk to a couple of his new patients about my journey. Of course I said, yes. These two guys were eligible for a clinical trial, but were nervous about it. After sharing my clinical trial experiences I suggested both of them check out this great forum. While I realize different people have different needs for information, my preference is for as much data as I can get. You folks really have helped with timely info. So, thanks!",
