He went back a week ago and the psa was 7.6 and the dre was swollen and one side of prostate hard. Today they did a 12 core biopsy so for now we wait. I have spent the last 3 years in the colon cancer board. My mother passed with it in 2013 and 3 weeks later my sister was diagnosed with it. She has completed her treatments and seems to be doing OK for now. I just don't know how much more I can stand. Any info or advice on the prostate would be appreciated.",

They told us results would be in around 5-7 days but put his appointment for the 20th. I just need to know what questions to ask this doctor on the 20th if he is positive for pc. Just doing some reading on here I have came across some things I don't understand. For instance psa vs fpsa. I'm just at a loss.",

      "Content": "My husband is 62. Over the last year his psa has been slowly rising. He went back in May and his number was 7.4 and the dre showed a very small bump. He went back a week ago and the psa was 7.6 and the dre was swollen and one side of prostate hard. Today they did a 12 core biopsy so for now we wait. I have spent the last 3 years in the colon cancer board. My mother passed with it in 2013 and 3 weeks later my sister was diagnosed with it. She has completed her treatments and seems to be doing OK for now. I just don't know how much more I can stand. Any info or advice on the prostate would be appreciated.",
