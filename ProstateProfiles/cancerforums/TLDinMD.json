We met with the RO this week and the best course of treatment for my Dad is external radiation and hormone injections. He will get his first injection in January, wait one month then have gold markers placed in the prostate, 2 weeks later get CT scan and the little tattoo markers, then 2 weeks later start radiation. Holy hell! So we are talking end of March before he starts radiation. Spring will be arriving! Has this been everyone else\u0092s experience? Just seems like such a long time since being diagnosed. And the fact that he hadn\u0092t been to the Urologist since 2014, I keep thinking this has been festering for some time already. We feel good about his treatment plan and are going to enjoy the holidays and hit this full steam ahead in the new year! Was just curious if it typically takes this long.",

I am trying to remain calm and worry free (hard to do) while we go thru this process and figure out the next steps, as well as learning all I can about the disease. He is 75 years old. We met with his Urologist last week after getting his biopsy results back. We were hoping for a better result but are dealing with this day by day. His Gleason score is 9, his PSA is 6.2 He is going tomorrow to have a CT scan and bone scan done. Once we get those results back that will determine the course of treatment. I know that the Gleason score is on the very high end which isn't good, but I'm confused by the PSA level. With the PSA being on the lower end is there some hope that this could still be localized? Or doesn't that matter with such a high Gleason score? As you know, the waiting is the worst part. I'll be anxious to get the results of the scans back sometime next week. Thank you for any info you can give me.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the warm welcome. He has been followed closely by his Urologist for about 10 years now. However, I recently found out he decided to skip his visit last year so it's been 2 years since he was checked. That was a blow to hear. What's the old saying - you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink. I hope that decision doesn't come back to bite him. The PSA has gone up slightly over the years but nothing significant. When he went in August of this year it had gone up a little more and the Urologist recommended having an MRI done. The results of that showed 2 areas of concern. He had the biopsy done in mid-Nov. I was frustrated that it took 3 months to get in for the biopsy. Seemed like a long time to me but we were told they wanted to use the new MRI guided equipment and that's how long it took to get in. Here is some additional information on his biopsies: 7 cores taken - here is a breakout of the numbers which I'm still trying to understand. He didn't mention anything as far as what % of each was cancer. He just talked in terms of low, med, and high risk. With the one that is a 9 being high risk.

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the warm welcome. He has been followed closely by his Urologist for about 10 years now. However, I recently found out he decided to skip his visit last year so it's been 2 years since he was checked. That was a blow to hear. What's the old saying - you can lead a horse to water but can't make it drink. I hope that decision doesn't come back to bite him. The PSA has gone up slightly over the years but nothing significant. When he went in August of this year it had gone up a little more and the Urologist recommended having an MRI done. The results of that showed 2 areas of concern. He had the biopsy done in mid-Nov. I was frustrated that it took 3 months to get in for the biopsy. Seemed like a long time to me but we were told they wanted to use the new MRI guided equipment and that's how long it took to get in. Here is some additional information on his biopsies: 7 cores taken - here is a breakout of the numbers which I'm still trying to understand.

      "Content": "Hello All, I am so grateful to have found this board. My father was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. I am trying to remain calm and worry free (hard to do) while we go thru this process and figure out the next steps, as well as learning all I can about the disease. He is 75 years old. We met with his Urologist last week after getting his biopsy results back. We were hoping for a better result but are dealing with this day by day. His Gleason score is 9, his PSA is 6.2 He is going tomorrow to have a CT scan and bone scan done. Once we get those results back that will determine the course of treatment. I know that the Gleason score is on the very high end which isn't good, but I'm confused by the PSA level. With the PSA being on the lower end is there some hope that this could still be localized? Or doesn't that matter with such a high Gleason score? As you know, the waiting is the worst part. I'll be anxious to get the results of the scans back sometime next week. Thank you for any info you can give me.",

He is a little older than your Dad, 75. His PSA is 6.2 and he is at a 9 Gleason. Try to remain calm, and positive, and learn as much as you can so you are well informed. I've had a week to absorb this and am starting to feel more like myself again and trying to accept this new normal. As others have said the scans are the next step. My Dad had his CT Scan and bone scan done yesterday. I was grateful he got there because it was snowing like Hell in Baltimore! Like you I find myself scared that it has spread. So now we wait.... I think I will feel better once I know one way or the other what we're dealing with and the treatment plan. Please keep us posted. Sorry you are here but glad that you found this support system. There is a wealth of knowledge here! Stay Strong.",

      "Content": "Hello All, I haven't been on the board in a while but always reading and learning. My father has finished up with his 9 weeks of EBRT. His last treatment was on May 21. He had a follow-up appointment today with his Urologist. I guess I was expecting them to do a PSA test, but he said no. His Urologist said \"no use getting a PSA test because the hormones and the radiation will render that useless as it should read zero now\". I get that, but how are you going to know if it is at Zero unless you do a PSA test??? I'm confused. At what point in time should he be getting a PSA test done now that his treatments are over? The Urologist said nothing to do at this point in time until the end of July when he will get his 2nd hormone shot. They may send him for a bone density scan down the road, the one he had in January was normal. From your experiences does this course of action sound right? Do they wait a little while after treatments before doing another PSA test?",
