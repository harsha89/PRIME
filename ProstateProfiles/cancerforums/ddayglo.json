      "Content": "If it's a single core of G6, with 2.5% involvement, and .15 cm; then yes, Active Surveillance could make sense as long as he is \"wired\" for AS (you on the other hand, like many others, may not be, and are in the \"get it out\" category - no right or wrong answer...) One thing a lot of us would strongly suggest is to have the slides sent out for a second opinion to be sure that's a G6... Also, please read the \"AS\" sticky, it contains a lot of good info. Did your Dad go through a full physical and blood work including vitamin levels? If not, that may be a good next step. Good Luck",

One thing a lot of us would strongly suggest is to have the slides sent out for a second opinion to be sure that's a G6... Also, please read the \"AS\" sticky, it contains a lot of good info. Did your Dad go through a full physical and blood work including vitamin levels? If not, that may be a good next step. Good Luck",

I started drinking some regular coffee after a month (and noticed the difference, in both how I felt and an increase in leakage) and then cut back until I found a good middle ground and then slowly increased it again",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". Since robotic takes more time. It was basically upside down during the surgery and you are \"under\" for a longer time (notthat you know that of course), so it places slightly more strain on the body. It is not recommended if you have a previous heath condition such as a heart condition. At your age the vast majority of us would recommend robotic. It is less invasive and the healing time is quicker. In fact,many of us had to \"hold back\" from exercising and lifting heavy items as the stitches outside were gone rather quickly but there was still a lot of healing to be done inside. I believe there is some research which indicates that robotic has a slightly higher success rate with incontinence since some surgeons report that it is easier to stitch up the muscles down there. But as everyone has stressed, the most important thing is the experience of the surgeon. Good Luck!",

It took them 3 tries to find mine...Your insurance company has some rather strict rules about what they will pay for and what they won't. Your tissue samples will go to a local pathology lab. Unless there is reason to doubt their findings, ordering an expert second opinion could cost you $800 if your insurance company balks.... Not a bad idea to call the insurance company first and \"pave the road\" for a second opinion on the slides, and ask up-front about sending the slides out. It seems some places have never done it before, charge extra, etc (which is an extra cause of stress just when you don't need it)",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". Since robotic takes more time. It was basically upside down during the surgery and you are \"under\" for a longer time (notthat you know that of course), so it places slightly more strain on the body. It is not recommended if you have a previous heath condition such as a heart condition. At your age the vast majority of us would recommend robotic. It is less invasive and the healing time is quicker. In fact,many of us had to \"hold back\" from exercising and lifting heavy items as the stitches outside were gone rather quickly but there was still a lot of healing to be done inside. I believe there is some research which indicates that robotic has a slightly higher success rate with incontinence since some surgeons report that it is easier to stitch up the muscles down there. But as everyone has stressed, the most important thing is the experience of the surgeon. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". It does sound like the doctors want to \"starve\" any cells as soon as possible to ensure it doesn't spread. My totally uneducated opinion is that it sounds like a good idea since at least with surgery you need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy and you want to make sure it doesn't spread while you wait. (Not sure if the waiting is also true for radiation or not). Since you need to be treated as quickly as possible, I suggest you schedule surgery while you research radiation. That way if you decide on surgery your spot is \"reserved\" without any delay. If you decide on radiation, then simply cancel the surgery. Good luck",

(Not sure if the waiting is also true for radiation or not). Since you need to be treated as quickly as possible, I suggest you schedule surgery while you research radiation. That way if you decide on surgery your spot is \"reserved\" without any delay. If you decide on radiation, then simply cancel the surgery. Good luck",

It took them 3 tries to find mine...Your insurance company has some rather strict rules about what they will pay for and what they won't. Your tissue samples will go to a local pathology lab. Unless there is reason to doubt their findings, ordering an expert second opinion could cost you $800 if your insurance company balks.... Not a bad idea to call the insurance company first and \"pave the road\" for a second opinion on the slides, and ask up-front about sending the slides out. It seems some places have never done it before, charge extra, etc (which is an extra cause of stress just when you don't need it)",

I started drinking some regular coffee after a month (and noticed the difference, in both how I felt and an increase in leakage) and then cut back until I found a good middle ground and then slowly increased it again",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". Since robotic takes more time. It was basically upside down during the surgery and you are \"under\" for a longer time (notthat you know that of course), so it places slightly more strain on the body. It is not recommended if you have a previous heath condition such as a heart condition. At your age the vast majority of us would recommend robotic. It is less invasive and the healing time is quicker. In fact,many of us had to \"hold back\" from exercising and lifting heavy items as the stitches outside were gone rather quickly but there was still a lot of healing to be done inside. I believe there is some research which indicates that robotic has a slightly higher success rate with incontinence since some surgeons report that it is easier to stitch up the muscles down there. But as everyone has stressed, the most important thing is the experience of the surgeon. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". Since robotic takes more time. It was basically upside down during the surgery and you are \"under\" for a longer time (notthat you know that of course), so it places slightly more strain on the body. It is not recommended if you have a previous heath condition such as a heart condition. At your age the vast majority of us would recommend robotic. It is less invasive and the healing time is quicker. In fact,many of us had to \"hold back\" from exercising and lifting heavy items as the stitches outside were gone rather quickly but there was still a lot of healing to be done inside. I believe there is some research which indicates that robotic has a slightly higher success rate with incontinence since some surgeons report that it is easier to stitch up the muscles down there. But as everyone has stressed, the most important thing is the experience of the surgeon. Good Luck!",

(Not sure if the waiting is also true for radiation or not). Since you need to be treated as quickly as possible, I suggest you schedule surgery while you research radiation. That way if you decide on surgery your spot is \"reserved\" without any delay. If you decide on radiation, then simply cancel the surgery. Good luck",

Some Drs give you a color chart to match up the colors with your progress. You may have a low-grade fever. Have a towel on top of your pillow when sleeping. Don't be to alarmed but call the Dr if it goes over 101 degrees. If you have a recliner, plan on using it to sleep. I could not even imagine getting in and out of a regular bed sleep in the recliner overnight a few days before the surgery. That way the first time won't be the first time immediately after the surgery. For a few days after the surgery, you will need someone to help you push the recliner in and help to get up onto your feet.",

In no particular order, most of this stuff was probably mentioned or I read a dozen times but somehow it either never penetrated my thick skull or I did not put enough importance to it: Make the nurse go through how to use the catheter several times. DO IT YOURSELF. You make think you get it but you really don't Bacitracin (or whatever ointment your Dr likes) is your friend. ask the Dr beforehand so you have plenty at home Your catheter pee will be red for a while. don't be too alarmed. Some Drs give you a color chart to match up the colors with your progress. You may have a low-grade fever. Have a towel on top of your pillow when sleeping. Don't be to alarmed but call the Dr if it goes over 101 degrees. If you have a recliner, plan on using it to sleep. I could not even imagine getting in and out of a regular bed sleep in the recliner overnight a few days before the surgery. That way the first time won't be the first time immediately after the surgery. For a few days after the surgery, you will need someone to help you push the recliner in and help to get up onto your feet.",

DO IT YOURSELF. You make think you get it but you really don't Bacitracin (or whatever ointment your Dr likes) is your friend. ask the Dr beforehand so you have plenty at home Your catheter pee will be red for a while. don't be too alarmed. Some Drs give you a color chart to match up the colors with your progress. You may have a low-grade fever. Have a towel on top of your pillow when sleeping. Don't be to alarmed but call the Dr if it goes over 101 degrees. If you have a recliner, plan on using it to sleep. I could not even imagine getting in and out of a regular bed sleep in the recliner overnight a few days before the surgery. That way the first time won't be the first time immediately after the surgery. For a few days after the surgery, you will need someone to help you push the recliner in and help to get up onto your feet.",

Which Dr would recommend AS in that case? What would be most interesting would be the outcome for the 24 percent, who also had two or less cores involved. AND exactly what their \"Active Surveillance\" entailed. Was it just testing PSA every 6 months? Or something more \"Active\"?",

DO IT YOURSELF. You make think you get it but you really don't Bacitracin (or whatever ointment your Dr likes) is your friend. ask the Dr beforehand so you have plenty at home Your catheter pee will be red for a while. don't be too alarmed. Some Drs give you a color chart to match up the colors with your progress. You may have a low-grade fever. Have a towel on top of your pillow when sleeping. Don't be to alarmed but call the Dr if it goes over 101 degrees. If you have a recliner, plan on using it to sleep. I could not even imagine getting in and out of a regular bed sleep in the recliner overnight a few days before the surgery. That way the first time won't be the first time immediately after the surgery. For a few days after the surgery, you will need someone to help you push the recliner in and help to get up onto your feet.",

In no particular order, most of this stuff was probably mentioned or I read a dozen times but somehow it either never penetrated my thick skull or I did not put enough importance to it: Make the nurse go through how to use the catheter several times. DO IT YOURSELF. You make think you get it but you really don't Bacitracin (or whatever ointment your Dr likes) is your friend. ask the Dr beforehand so you have plenty at home Your catheter pee will be red for a while. don't be too alarmed. Some Drs give you a color chart to match up the colors with your progress. You may have a low-grade fever. Have a towel on top of your pillow when sleeping. Don't be to alarmed but call the Dr if it goes over 101 degrees. If you have a recliner, plan on using it to sleep. I could not even imagine getting in and out of a regular bed sleep in the recliner overnight a few days before the surgery. That way the first time won't be the first time immediately after the surgery. For a few days after the surgery, you will need someone to help you push the recliner in and help to get up onto your feet.",

I am still hopeful that I have the same issue shortly, pain or no pain! LOL Fran Well, I wouldn't call it \"hard wood\", more like balsa... But it was still there, in the middle of the night, without any help from \"Mr Palm and his five friends\"... Anyway, I went to the Dr, he tool a urine culture (clean), he looked and pulled and poked around and didn't find anything. So maybe it was just some irritation, and said not to worry about it and be very glad that my little friend seem to be awaking from his almost year-long hibernation. He also said that he wants PSA level every six months for now, so he suggested that I schedulie his annual visit for August and my standard physical in January.",

He asked on a scale of 1-10 how active things were \"down there\". I told him a three. He looked me up and said I was a two last time, so he was encouraged. He told me to continue the Viagra/Cialis... A few other points: He personally likes the injection rather than the pump. He said that the \"rocco stitch\" was big a while ago, but most surgeons nowadays reconstruct the external urinary sphincter, which is much easier to do with Robotic Surgery. If I stay a member of the \"Zero Club\", I don't have to come back for six months I'll know the results in a week or so, which me luck...",

      "Content": "10 months almost to the day after my surgery. Woke up with some nice \"wood\" last night and felt a few \"twinges\" during the day... (Made it a point to check out as many pretty girls as possible, for medical reasons of course). Overall, I was quite happy about this.. Until... Now I've had some sharp pain at the tip of my penis a few times today. It lasts for a few seconds each time. Almost like a pinch. Not too intense, but enough for me take notice for sure. It seems to have nothing to do with urinating. I called the service and the Dr said it doesn't sound like anything to worry about, and make a followup with my surgeon. (Which I will...) Has anyone experienced anything like this? Thanks!",

      "Content": "A reluctant welcome to our \"club\". Based on your stats, you do need treatment, it's just a matter of what is best for you. (which you need to decide based on your age, physical health, etc). Not sure of your age and general health, as your heart condition may lead you to one type of treatment over another. (Robotic surgery is harder on the body during the initial surgery, as you are basically lying at a 45 degree angle upside down, and I believe you are under longer and \"deeper\" -- although recovery is a bit faster.). Not sure of your age and health, but if your cardiologist and urologist believe surgery is an option, then I would research surgeons (both open and robotic - the most important thing is EXPERIENCE) and *schedule* the surgery. You'll need about six weeks for your prostate to heal. Also research other treatments such as radiation... You can cancel the surgery if you decide on other treatment, but if you decide to go through with the surgery then your spot is \"reserved\" and you'll never have to second guess yourself about waiting more than the six weeks (athough with G6, your decision does not have to be a rush-job). Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JoeInBucks I found that you can over the Kegels. Not sure If the analogy is perfect but like working out or lifting weights you typically don't work the same body part two days in a row. I think I was over doing it early after my operation. I'm sort of on a one day on one day off routine now. Seems to work better. Stopped using any pads or shields about 2 - 2 1/2 months after the operation. The progress is not linear at all at least for me. I found this as well. Your pee-muscles have been traumatized. And they aren't big like a bicep or chest muscle to begin with. They have to work anyway even without kegels. Don't overdo the kegels, and think about giving the poor muscle a day free from kegels on a regular basis.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Don't put too much emphasis on the PSA today. One month from surgery seems like an awfully quick expectation because, even if you are fully \"cured\", the PSA may not have had enough time to clear completely out of your bloodstream. My recollection is that a PSA at the 90-day mark after surgery should provide a more definitive overview. Good luck. My surgeon likes the first test to be at six weeks, in some ways more of a baseline for the 90-day PSA test than anything else. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Don't put too much emphasis on the PSA today. One month from surgery seems like an awfully quick expectation because, even if you are fully \"cured\", the PSA may not have had enough time to clear completely out of your bloodstream. My recollection is that a PSA at the 90-day mark after surgery should provide a more definitive overview. Good luck. My surgeon likes the first test to be at six weeks, in some ways more of a baseline for the 90-day PSA test than anything else. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Caverject was covered by my insurance, so I suggested to my uro that we try that first. There's also no compounding pharmacy nearby so it would be a bit of a hassle for me to go to one. While I had nerve-sparing DaVinci, I never fully recovered and would basically make it to 60% for short periods of time so our hope was that the Caverject would be enough for me to make it to the next step. The doc was careful not to overdo it the first time (he warned me multiple times about erections over 4 hours long. I told him I would like to experience a full three-hour full erection at least once... I received six vials full of powder and needed to add the distilled(?) water to one of them. No big deal. Anyway, the doc showed me where to inject myself and made me do it. 15 units. I felt a slight twinge. Wouldn't call it painful. Just... Different... I felt a bit of warmth in area around the shot for a few minutes. Anyway after 10 minutes, my little friend started to wake up. I reached about 60% of firmness, but this was different as I wasn't helping myself or thinking about naughty stuff. It was like a spontaneous boner we all use to get for no reason when we were teens. I definitely felt areas of my little (well, maybe not so little) friend stretching out and waking up. Areas which haven't been stretched out like that for over two years The doc came back in and he said it looked good. I asked him if I could have a lap dance with the pretty receptionist. He agreed that she was cute but it probably wouldn't be a good idea for him to ask her LOL. I felt that in the correct setting with 20 units and some help from porn or the wifey) I would have achieved some \"real\" wood. Maybe not raging-boner-hang-wet-towels wood, but good enough. My next step is to do the 20 in a couple of days. I'm keeping the mix in the fridge. After the vials are used up, the doc agreed that if either I'll get a refill or \"graduate\" to trimix.",

      "Content": "I'm not going to say I'm glad to be here... My physical 6 months ago showed PSA 4.9, biopsy clean. Bump on right side of prostate. Asked to do another PSA test 6 months later. PSA went up to 5.9. Another biopsy. One core positive on the left top, one \"suggestive\" on the left bottom. Rest were clean. Gleason 3+4. Tumor is \"T1C\". I remember hearing \"5%\" but not sure if I heard that right. I'm not the kind of person to do active monitoring or \"watchful waiting\". So the choice was seeds or the nerve-sparing robotic surgery. Of course the radiologists said radiation was fine and there is no difference between that and surgery while the surgeons said there is a difference, especially at my age. I'm sure that 15 years from now they will have perfected the seeds-then-surgery but for now it seems to be one or the other. I scheduled the surgery for July 18th and unless I absolutely hear otherwise I'm going to go through with it. The head of surgery at the hospital is going to do the daVincie. He's done about 400 and has published several research articles. One thing I found interesting is that the definition of \"dry\" depends on the study or doctor. His definition of \"dry\" is ZERO pads while some studies define it as one-per-day. The worst part so far is my wife... She doesn't handle stress well. She's ready to have a full-time nurse for me for the next few weeks after the surgery.. Thanks for listening",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by steveinErie Greetings. Newly diagnosed, details below. As I follow in all of your footsteps, doing as much online research as humanly possible to determine which treatments to consider, I'd pose the following question: In Dr. Walsh's book, he advocates for a biopsy second opinion. Has anyone requested and benefited from having their results reviewed by a another pathologist? Thanks in advance for any help. {Congrats on a terrific and useful Forum} In my case, if I were diagnosed with G6, AS would have been an option... I then would have had a second opinion to validate the first diagnosis. If BOTH were G6, then a second opinion would have been a huge benefit. (I decided since I was \"awarded\" a G3+4 on my first biopsy, my \"threshold\" for AS was exceeded and it was time for active treatment.) I know this does not directly answer your question, but at least in my case of deciding whether AS would have been appropriate for me, if my first biopsy was G6, then a second opinion would have been absolutely essential.",

Cancer control? I had seeds done in March and have no urinary or erection problems at all - the only weird sexual side effect I have is an orgasm that is dry or nearly drug. Good luck with your surgery! According to the surgeons, there is a lack of data past 15 years for seeds... They said that if I was 70 they would recommend seeds....",

      "Content": "I'm not going to say I'm glad to be here... My physical 6 months ago showed PSA 4.9, biopsy clean. Bump on right side of prostate. Asked to do another PSA test 6 months later. PSA went up to 5.9. Another biopsy. One core positive on the left top, one \"suggestive\" on the left bottom. Rest were clean. Gleason 3+4. Tumor is \"T1C\". I remember hearing \"5%\" but not sure if I heard that right. I'm not the kind of person to do active monitoring or \"watchful waiting\". So the choice was seeds or the nerve-sparing robotic surgery. Of course the radiologists said radiation was fine and there is no difference between that and surgery while the surgeons said there is a difference, especially at my age. I'm sure that 15 years from now they will have perfected the seeds-then-surgery but for now it seems to be one or the other. I scheduled the surgery for July 18th and unless I absolutely hear otherwise I'm going to go through with it. The head of surgery at the hospital is going to do the daVincie. He's done about 400 and has published several research articles. One thing I found interesting is that the definition of \"dry\" depends on the study or doctor. His definition of \"dry\" is ZERO pads while some studies define it as one-per-day. The worst part so far is my wife... She doesn't handle stress well. She's ready to have a full-time nurse for me for the next few weeks after the surgery.. Thanks for listening",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by steveinErie Greetings. Newly diagnosed, details below. As I follow in all of your footsteps, doing as much online research as humanly possible to determine which treatments to consider, I'd pose the following question: In Dr. Walsh's book, he advocates for a biopsy second opinion. Has anyone requested and benefited from having their results reviewed by a another pathologist? Thanks in advance for any help. {Congrats on a terrific and useful Forum} In my case, if I were diagnosed with G6, AS would have been an option... I then would have had a second opinion to validate the first diagnosis. If BOTH were G6, then a second opinion would have been a huge benefit. (I decided since I was \"awarded\" a G3+4 on my first biopsy, my \"threshold\" for AS was exceeded and it was time for active treatment.) I know this does not directly answer your question, but at least in my case of deciding whether AS would have been appropriate for me, if my first biopsy was G6, then a second opinion would have been absolutely essential.",

      "Content": "thanks for the support and kind words... jfd - a question for you. - I was just offered a new job... .. Obviously I can't go there immediately, but if I have the surgery on July 18th then would an August 19th or 26th start date be reasonable? It's a desk job (In I.T.)... The Doctors say it is no problem but hearing it from one who has \"been there, done that\" would be appreciated. Thanks!",

It is a myth that age has anything to do with radiation as a treatment for PCa. The dry part is a good question. What sort of results does your surgeon have with that? How about erections? Cancer control? I had seeds done in March and have no urinary or erection problems at all - the only weird sexual side effect I have is an orgasm that is dry or nearly drug. Good luck with your surgery! According to the surgeons, there is a lack of data past 15 years for seeds... They said that if I was 70 they would recommend seeds....",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Deb 27 It sounds like the robotic surgery is a little easier. Robotic surgery is actually harder. You are under longer and deeper. It's not recommended for patients with heart or other health conditions. However, recovery is usually faster and there is some research which shows that the usual side effects (incontinence, etc) are not as severe. However, may far the most important criteria is the experience of the surgeon. I'd rather have open surgery with a surgeon whose done 1200+ vs someone who has performed 50 robotic surgeries... Make sure the Robotic surgeon is in the VERY experienced... in the 1200+ surgery category. Good Luck",

Good luck moving forward and keep us updated! MF Strong Agree on all points... Get the T3 MRI first....",

(There's no right or wrong answer, some of us just want to \"get it out\", and would stay up night wondering about whether or not the biopsy missed anything and whether or not there is higher-grade PCa lurking and growing down there). If you are wired...: Get a second opinion with another experienced urologist to ensure this person agrees. Send your slides out to Dr Epstein and make sure he agrees with the G6. Find a medical center which does a guided T3 MRI biopsy, in case you need to have another one. Decide on surgery vs radiation, and pick a good experience no matter which way you go,. That way if a second option from another urologist, and a second opinion on the slides all agree you are a candidate for AS, you know that you've done your due-diligence, and if you need to have active treatment in the future, your research on a course of action has already been completed, and you can pull the trigger if needed, without any delay. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Read the AS sticky, there's some of additional tests listed there which would give you a full \"baseline\" on your AS journey. I would also send your slides out for a second opinion, to be sure two labs agree that the G3+3 stays a 3+3. I also read somewhere that surgery gets more difficult after each biopsy, so make each one count - maybe a MRI-Guided saturation biopsy? You may wish to ask you Dr about how many biopsies you can have before it affects surgery. Basically, you have to decide on what your \"trigger\" is before seeking treatment. Is it additional G6? If G7 is discovered? A 25% increase in PSA over 3 months? My trigger (if I had a choice, which I did not) would have been very low for going off AS and seeking treatment. Some people have zero trigger and are just not \"wired\" for AS (no right or wrong answer). For example, one Dr suggested I have my slides reevaluated to see if my G3+4 would be downgraded to a G3+3. I decided that for me to be on AS I would have needed TWO independent labs both agreeing on a G6, so AS was out for me (and I did have more PC than the initial biopsy indicated). But for every month on AS you are enjoying \"normalcy\" such as sex life. So it is a trade-off... Good luck and keep in touch",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi F54! Your PSA is elevated - especially relative to your young age - and needs to be explained. Since it appears that the elevation is not due to infection/inflammation, Chuck has asked the key question: \"Did the uro say anything about an enlarged prostate?\" Since your Uro only did a DRE, the questions I would ask is: \"Can one have an enlarged prostate that is not detected by DRE?\" and \"Can this be the cause of my elevated PSA?\" I'm not qualified to challenge the judgement of your Uro MD; however, if me, I would not jump onto the biopsy table quite so quickly! I would inquire about getting a MP 3T MRI that can be later \"fused\" with subsequent a TRUS biopsy (IF and when biopsy is indicated). This MRI is about 90% effective in detecting and locating Prostate Cancer (PC). Fairwind points out the reimbursement issue that must be addressed in advance. PC can only be diagnosed by histologic evaluation of tissue obtained from a biopsy. However, prostate biopsy is not an exact science or technique. It is like shoving a fine needle into a relatively large haystack hoping to hit a \"needle\" (focus of PC) deep inside! The 12 core biopsy can miss PC cells and result in a \"False Negative\" biopsy. Also, biopsy in not without risk. Infection is a known risk. Several on this Forum have had infections due to biopsy. Also, theoretically and possibly in reality, \"needle tracking\" can displace PC cells outside of the prostate and create a worsened PC scenario. What part of the country do you live and how far from a major medical center? If me, I would go to the nearest academic teaching hospital that has a Urology Program and make an appointment to get evaluated. If biopsy is indicated, they will likely perform an MRI fused TRUS biopsy. If the MRI is (-), you will likely NOT have a biopsy at his time and thus will have been spared an unnecessary procedure on June 6. Also, another benefit of having this MRI is it will serve as a \"baseline\" to compare any future changes or developments. At very least, I'd get a 2nd opinion about having a biopsy at this time. If you are in a small community, turn to the nearest large city and make an appointment with a Uro MD who specializes in PC for a 2nd opinion. Keep in mind that if/when you are diagnosed with PC either now or in the future (hopefully never!) you want to be treated by an expert PC specialist who is treating at least 3 PC patients per week. By finding such an MD now and getting a 2nd opinion puts you in that MD's patient population. Continue to ask questions and take control of your course of action(s). Good luck moving forward and keep us updated! MF Strong Agree on all points... Get the T3 MRI first....",

Find a medical center which does a guided T3 MRI biopsy, in case you need to have another one. Decide on surgery vs radiation, and pick a good experience no matter which way you go,. That way if a second option from another urologist, and a second opinion on the slides all agree you are a candidate for AS, you know that you've done your due-diligence, and if you need to have active treatment in the future, your research on a course of action has already been completed, and you can pull the trigger if needed, without any delay.

Actually you'll see web pages stating that with robotic it's easier to reconstruct the muscles \"down there\" and there is a greater rate of full urinary control, as compared to open. Of course, these reports and web pages are all located on sites of Robotic centers and surgeons",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by thunderchief Brad, Not sure if it is a bounce or not. Since you still have a prostate it could be an infection and that could explain the increase in PSA. I had IMRT 10 years ago . My lowest PSA was 0.295 after two years. It then bounced around going as high as 0.47 six months after the 0.295 reading. For the most part my readings have been in the 0.35 range. My radiation doctor first told me that after treatment the PSA would be like a saw blade. It would probably go up and down , up and down\u0085\u0085and it has. I can remember him telling me that I had an 88% chance of being under 0.50 mark ten years down the road. I would say relax and see what it is in 6 months How about a retest to be sure this isn't an outlier, and then another PSA test in 3 months?",

You are under for a longer period of time and as Chuck says you are basically placed at a 45 degree angle with the legs above the head. Do you have high blood pressure or any medical condition which would preclude you from Davinci? The actual recovery time from Davinci (and I guess laparoscopic as well) is quicker. When I researched laparoscopic, I quickly excluded it because, which there was less blood loss, I read somewhere that extremely advanced laparoscopic skills were needed to maneuver the rigid laparoscopic instruments, with less room for maneuvering than open surgery (which is needed to ensure the nerves are spared and things are restitched the best way possible to help with incontinence. I was then left with DaVinci vs Open. I chose DaVinci because I remember reading that due to the angle that the DaVinci machine can move (it has a much larger range of motion vs the human wrist), the continence rate and nerve-sparing was slightly higher. (Sorry, this is all from memory). However, as Chuck has mentioned, that is if ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL. I believe that we all agree that it's better to have a very skilled open surgeon over an inexperienced DaVinci surgeon. HTHs, and good luck.",

I also had been using stool softeners but they couldn't get that first good BM. Hydration is a key factor. Don't cut back to far or you will pay for it. Actually two liters per day seems about right. Just stop about 3-4 hours before bedtime. Only consume enough right before bedtime to prevent dry mouth. My surgeon was against any kind of suppositories or anything \"up there\" for the first six weeks. He suggested as much fruit as possible, especially Watermelon, Dulcolax, and prunes in their own juice. I'll happen, just don't push too much or you can create hemorrhoids or make existing ones worse.",

      "Content": "My coworker's brother is 60 years old. He never had physicals nor had PSA tested. About two months ago, he had severe urination problems, to make a long story short, he had a TURP. It turns out that the analysis of the tissue removed was a Gleason Score is G9 (not sure if it is a 4+5 or 5+4), and his PSA is \"over 700\". It did spread to \"his bones\". He is scheduled for a full-body scan as well. He's saw an oncologist, and today, he will receive a one-month hormone shot, and after assessing how he responds to the initial treatment, and then have the dosage or meds adjusted if needed, and go for another (three-month?) hormone treatment. The oncologist will also be consulting with her colleagues as to the best course of treatment. In addition, his oncologist aalso recommended chemo. I am getting this all second-hand so forgive me if I I don't have all of the details. Her brother is the kind of person who trusts the Dr and doesn't want to know all of the details. My coworker (and I) are the opposite, the more information, the better. She's an extremely strong person but I can see that this is eating her up inside. I think the world of her and she's like both my work-spouse and sister to me. Her mother passed away from breast cancer (and also had chemo) less than ten years ago so that's still a vivid and sad memory. Her brother's oncologist, who I have a good feeling about, has said that she will be with throughout his journey and she doesn't expect him to pass away from this evil disease. Anyway, I'm looking for some success stories, especially long-term ones, from anyone who had similar stats (very high gleason and very high PSA). Links to posts or profiles are fine... I've suggested that my coworker visits this forum as well as her brother, or even better, link to this post which has some \"success stories\". Thanks -Dave",

This morning, though, as I sit outside with coffee and laptop, I feel/see what appears to be a tan-colored mushy-looking stuff oozing out from the tip of my penis around the catheter. Not a lot; maybe the size of 2 BB's. And I feel a slight \"need to go\", though I've felt that before and it has passed. Been filling the urine bag well, and the urine looks healthy. Any thoughts on this? Wondering if it might be a sign of infection, but other than that feeling of needing to go, nothing else \"feels bad\". Thoughts? thanks- dave Does it have any smell or are you more tender than \"normal\" up there (if having a catheter can be described as \"normal\"...)? Anyway, I would call your surgeon if you have any concerns. Good Luck...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wolfgang Anyway, I forgot to mention in my original post that my CT and bone scans were done after the last biopsy and they were negative. It was some kind of relief after getting the first pathology results with most Gleason scores to be 9. I am still expecting the final pathology results to see more details. Will keep you posted as soon as I get them. I believe that with a G9 that you need to be aggressive with followup testing... My surgery was on 7/18; I had followup PSAs on 8/25, 11/4, and 2/6 and I'm now on a 6 month schedule. I were in your Gleason shoes I would feel better if I was tested very regularly.. My first thought would be to ask the Dr about being tested every six weeks for the first six months and then every three months thereafter for the following year... (I'm sure others will contribute their thoughts and knowledge as well). Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wolfgang Anyway, I forgot to mention in my original post that my CT and bone scans were done after the last biopsy and they were negative. It was some kind of relief after getting the first pathology results with most Gleason scores to be 9. I am still expecting the final pathology results to see more details. Will keep you posted as soon as I get them. I believe that with a G9 that you need to be aggressive with followup testing... My surgery was on 7/18; I had followup PSAs on 8/25, 11/4, and 2/6 and I'm now on a 6 month schedule. I were in your Gleason shoes I would feel better if I was tested very regularly.. My first thought would be to ask the Dr about being tested every six weeks for the first six months and then every three months thereafter for the following year... (I'm sure others will contribute their thoughts and knowledge as well). Good Luck!",

What do you do if the PSA keeps rising? Do you wait until the PSA reaches 14 -- or 20 -- or 30? Where do you draw the line? Who makes that decision? Speaking only for myself (and perhaps a handful of others), I would be measuring the distance that I needed to cover in doing a somersault onto an operating table. But that's just me. We all have different comfort levels. I wish you the best, Jim Good point... To lazythom: What if you get your PSA tested every two months and it keeps rising... what is your \"trigger\" to go off of AS? Is it when PSA reaches 11? 12? ... 14? For me, that trigger would have already passed and I would have started active treatment...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F As Chuck stated, most MDs will check the 1st post RP PSA at the 12 week mark. However, on this Forum and elsewhere we are seeing a growing trend where PSAs are being checked at 6 weeks. Possibly the PSA test at 6 weeks is being ordered due to elevated risk findings discovered at time of surgery or at pathology. Post RP, ones PSA should drop fairly quickly. The 1/2 life of PSA is between 2 - 3 days. Therefore, by 6 weeks, ones PSA should be \"0\" unless PC or residual healthy prostate tissues remain or PSA is being generated by peri prostatic tissues. For example, If your Piggy Bank had 100 pennies with a 1/2 Life of 2.5 days, at the 3 week mark you would have 1 penny remaining. At 6 weeks it would be down to $0.0001 which is 1/100th of a penny which is negligible. Make sure to discuss your PSA with your URO and the frequency of PSA testing moving forward. Good luck keeping your PSA off the radar screen! My surgeon does six weeks it as part of his standard process... - if PSA is Zero at six weeks then it's good news and he likes the idea of sharing that news... if not, then he has the extra data point for the three-month draw. I know I really liked the idea of knowing my PSA after six weeks was zero... it really reduced my stress and made the wait to the three-month PSA a lot easier. For that reason alone I would recommend that everyone ask for a six-week PSA test.",

What do you do if the PSA keeps rising? Do you wait until the PSA reaches 14 -- or 20 -- or 30? Where do you draw the line? Who makes that decision? Speaking only for myself (and perhaps a handful of others), I would be measuring the distance that I needed to cover in doing a somersault onto an operating table. But that's just me. We all have different comfort levels. I wish you the best, Jim Good point... To lazythom: What if you get your PSA tested every two months and it keeps rising... what is your \"trigger\" to go off of AS? Is it when PSA reaches 11? 12? ... 14? For me, that trigger would have already passed and I would have started active treatment...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F As Chuck stated, most MDs will check the 1st post RP PSA at the 12 week mark. However, on this Forum and elsewhere we are seeing a growing trend where PSAs are being checked at 6 weeks. Possibly the PSA test at 6 weeks is being ordered due to elevated risk findings discovered at time of surgery or at pathology. Post RP, ones PSA should drop fairly quickly. The 1/2 life of PSA is between 2 - 3 days. Therefore, by 6 weeks, ones PSA should be \"0\" unless PC or residual healthy prostate tissues remain or PSA is being generated by peri prostatic tissues. For example, If your Piggy Bank had 100 pennies with a 1/2 Life of 2.5 days, at the 3 week mark you would have 1 penny remaining. At 6 weeks it would be down to $0.0001 which is 1/100th of a penny which is negligible. Make sure to discuss your PSA with your URO and the frequency of PSA testing moving forward. Good luck keeping your PSA off the radar screen! My surgeon does six weeks it as part of his standard process... - if PSA is Zero at six weeks then it's good news and he likes the idea of sharing that news... if not, then he has the extra data point for the three-month draw. I know I really liked the idea of knowing my PSA after six weeks was zero... it really reduced my stress and made the wait to the three-month PSA a lot easier. For that reason alone I would recommend that everyone ask for a six-week PSA test.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Thom, I may have an experience much different than the others that have posted, but I will try to relate it to your case. I have found that a prostate biopsy can TRIPLE your psa, and that the rise can last for six months. This happened to me TWICE! No antibiotics were recommended the second time, and they didn't make any difference the the first time. I found that a week of hot sitz baths returned my psa to normal both times. Again, I don't mean to argue with the above advice, it's just that I have walked down a different path, and want to offer you this input. Say lazythom has the hot sitz baths regularly for a few weeks... Gets retested in six weeks. If the PSA continues to rise, would you then agree that it's time for lazythom to start active treatment? Or maybe wait another six weeks for a \"final\" PSA retest and if it continues to rise yet again, then start active treatment? Whie Lazythom is OK with waiting, what is the point (eg trigger) where a \"threshold\" has been reached and it's time bid farewell to AS? For most of us, especially those (such as myself) whose PCa was higher than what the biopsy indicated, that threshold already passed. While each person (and prostate) is different, I'm just wondering if that threshold could be quantified in some way...",

      "Content": "Hi Paul A sad welcome to our \"club\". The others have all given you good advise. Those with G6 could consider Active Surveillance (AS) although I don't see the number of cores involved, your age, or the percentage of involvement. Some of us are not \"wired\" for AS (and from the sounds of it you may not be) -- which is not a negative, only an observation. I had G3+4 in one core and was given the option of sending my slides out for a second opinion, and, if it came back as G6, then consider AS. I decided against it as in my mind I would need two \"reads\" of both G6 before considering AS. (While I was \"wired\" for AS, my results were above my \"trigger\", or threshold needed for me to consider AS instead of treatment.) Anyway I had surgery and I was one of those 20 or 30% whose results were greater than the biopsy report. The \"good\" news is that with G6 you don't need to run into treatment. Take a few weeks (or longer) to research the different treatment types and find a good experienced surgeon while deciding on your treatment and receive the rest of your results. You can even schedule a date for surgery with the idea of canceling it you decide on AS or radiation. That way, if you decide on surgery, your spot is already \"reserved\". If you decide on AS or radiation, you can just cancel the surgery. Good Luck and stay in touch",

What do you do if the PSA keeps rising? Do you wait until the PSA reaches 14 -- or 20 -- or 30? Where do you draw the line? Who makes that decision? Speaking only for myself (and perhaps a handful of others), I would be measuring the distance that I needed to cover in doing a somersault onto an operating table. But that's just me. We all have different comfort levels. I wish you the best, Jim Good point... To lazythom: What if you get your PSA tested every two months and it keeps rising... what is your \"trigger\" to go off of AS? Is it when PSA reaches 11? 12? ... 14?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Welcome Thom: It's fine that you're OK with waiting but you bring up one of the weaknesses in an active surveillance program. What do you do if the PSA keeps rising? Do you wait until the PSA reaches 14 -- or 20 -- or 30? Where do you draw the line? Who makes that decision? Speaking only for myself (and perhaps a handful of others), I would be measuring the distance that I needed to cover in doing a somersault onto an operating table. But that's just me. We all have different comfort levels. I wish you the best, Jim Good point... To lazythom: What if you get your PSA tested every two months and it keeps rising... what is your \"trigger\" to go off of AS? Is it when PSA reaches 11? 12? ... 14? For me, that trigger would have already passed and I would have started active treatment...",

Actually no, since I don't have colon cancer... but that's a good idea as long as the board admins don't mind me posting in a forum that I'm not a member of. I've read that a virtual colonoscopy a)is additional radiation, b)can find abnormalities in other organs c)it does a better job of looking at the entire colon, d)it may miss small polyps.. So what I've seen there are pluses and minuses, was wondering if anyone here has researched or had the virtual colonoscopy. Are there any advantages or disadvantages of us club members to have a virtual vs an optical colonoscopy...",

      "Content": "Hi Paul A sad welcome to our \"club\". The others have all given you good advise. Those with G6 could consider Active Surveillance (AS) although I don't see the number of cores involved, your age, or the percentage of involvement. Some of us are not \"wired\" for AS (and from the sounds of it you may not be) -- which is not a negative, only an observation. I had G3+4 in one core and was given the option of sending my slides out for a second opinion, and, if it came back as G6, then consider AS. I decided against it as in my mind I would need two \"reads\" of both G6 before considering AS. (While I was \"wired\" for AS, my results were above my \"trigger\", or threshold needed for me to consider AS instead of treatment.) Anyway I had surgery and I was one of those 20 or 30% whose results were greater than the biopsy report. The \"good\" news is that with G6 you don't need to run into treatment. Take a few weeks (or longer) to research the different treatment types and find a good experienced surgeon while deciding on your treatment and receive the rest of your results. You can even schedule a date for surgery with the idea of canceling it you decide on AS or radiation. That way, if you decide on surgery, your spot is already \"reserved\". If you decide on AS or radiation, you can just cancel the surgery. Good Luck and stay in touch",

I've read that a virtual colonoscopy a)is additional radiation, b)can find abnormalities in other organs c)it does a better job of looking at the entire colon, d)it may miss small polyps.. So what I've seen there are pluses and minuses, was wondering if anyone here has researched or had the virtual colonoscopy. Are there any advantages or disadvantages of us club members to have a virtual vs an optical colonoscopy...",

Before deciding on AS, you should have a second opinion on the slides from someone like Dr Epstein to corroborate the first reading, as well as MF's suggestion about a 3T MRI and retest your PSA in three months. If you still plan on AS, then read the AS sticky as it contains other tests you can have. Also research surgeons and decide on one you like in case you change your mind about radiation. Good Luck.",

If it's confirmed that it's PC, then its time for aggressive treatment, such a HT therapy (which will deprive any PC of testosterone and therefore stop the PC from growing any more while other treatment (such as radiation) is started. There are some members here who had PC much higher and with treatment its been under control for many years and there's every reason to believe that it continue to be under control for many more years.

Once I \"graduated\" to annual testing, there was always the thought in the back of my mind that it could be 11 months before a recurrence is discovered, which caused me lots of \"PSAnxiety\". I now schedule my annual surgical visit and my annual physical six months apart, with each drawing PSA. Knowing that I'm getting tested twice as often as recommended has greatly decreased my anxiety. PS - I take the standard PSA test so I don't have to sweat every decimal place...",

Radiation specialists will tend to recommend radiation and surgeons will tend to recommend surgery.... For your age group, many doctors (and us here) will lean towards surgery but my no means is that etched in stone. (There are many spirited debates here of surgery -vs- radiation. ) Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mark524 Hi everyone. I am 57 and in October I found out my PSA had increased from 2.5 two years ago to 5.0 . Went to Urologist and DRE was normal - he put me on antibiotics and 5 weeks later PSA down to 3.8. Just had a 3T MRI which came back relatively clean with Pi-RADS score of 2 (and no significant lesions). He now wants me to get a biopsy (standard 12 core). I am wondering if it is my best course of action to just jump into an invasive procedure or if anyone else with a similar circumstance went a different route? He didn't really give me any other options (he strongly suggested the biopsy) but I really want to do some homework before I get this done. Right now I am thinking the good from it (either a little more piece of mind or perhaps something being found that the MRI did not catch) most likely outweighs the bad (slight chance of infection and an uncomfortable 15 minutes!) but I would love to hear others thoughts or experiences. Schedule another PSA in eight weeks... if your PSA rises again, then yes, a biopsy would be a good idea... A \"guided\" biopsy would be best, unless the MRI you already had would qualify. If it stays below 4, then retest every three months. As Chuck mentions, asking for other tests is a good idea. I remember being low on vitamin D3 and found out after-the-fact that low vityamin D levels are also a marker for PCa. You are doing great by staying on top of things. Good Luck",

      "Content": "I agonized over which path to choose and I finally choose surgery. If I was 10-15 years older, or there was more research onto the long-term survival and occurrence rates (>20 years) of brachy vs surgery, perhaps I would have chosen differently. Then again, maybe not, as I'm the kind of person who felt best to \"get it out and as far away from my body as possible\" and deal with the side effects. It's a personal choice, there is no right-or-wrong answer, and, like the AS-vs-treatment debate, it stirs up some strong emotions which we all have seen and need to be aware of... Good Luck.",

It's made a huge decrease in my anxiety level while waiting for the PSA results, the last test was six months ago (and not a full year), and knowing that even if the PSA does go up, I've potentially caught it months earlier.

So as chuck says it seems to be simply your Doctor's preference. I decided to have my annual physical and annual PSA test six months apart so I can still have the PSA test every six months (not because any Dr told me to, but for my own sanity). Anyway, we have spot reserved at the zero-club with your name penciled in. Hope we can change it to pen (or, even better, indelible ink) soon. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Badman Am 7 weeks post op and am doing better. I spurt every time I move quickly or strain in any way. Also when sneezing or at work, as I am always up and down at work. So is the spurting versus the constant dribble I had a sign of my Kegels working? I do them twice a day and also at night the flow is greatly reduced. Just wondering if anyone has this experience also and is it a good sign? I had the same thing... The muscle is working and then sort of fails for a bit. So I believe its a good sign... You may wish to stop the kegels for a day or two in case you are overworking the muscle, or try an every-other-day schedule to give the muscle a chance to heal (like what is usually recommended for when lifting weights). You are ahead of where many of us were at 7 weeks.",

      "Content": "I had zero symptoms, first biopsy negative, second one positive. I was undecided but leaning towards surgery. I decided to schedule the surgery while exploring other treatment options. That way if I decided on the surgery I had the first available slot and if not then I would just cancel the surgery. I decided on the surgery. Assuming that the rest of your scans are OK, then most of us would suggest surgery as well, as you could always have followup \"salvage\" radiation but having surgery after radiation is much more difficult. Read the stickies and put up a book by Dr Walsh caled \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". Good Luck!",

And I would have needed TWO G6's (in my mind, a \"solid\" G6), to consider AS. Also as a biopsy only samples a small portion of the prostate, there's a chance that there was more bad stuff out there in my prostate which was missed by the biopsy... It turns out I was upgraded to a G4+3 after my RP, so I'm glad I did what I did. Good Luck",

And I would have needed TWO G6's (in my mind, a \"solid\" G6), to consider AS. Also as a biopsy only samples a small portion of the prostate, there's a chance that there was more bad stuff out there in my prostate which was missed by the biopsy... It turns out I was upgraded to a G4+3 after my RP, so I'm glad I did what I did. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Uncle Bill This is my first post since 2013. I'm hoping someone can help me understand what's going on with me. My PSA count in July 2015 was 4.9, a big jump from January 2015 at 3.0. I included below about an eight year history of my PSA counts. As you can see my counts have always been high for my age group. Earlier this month my doctor put me on Bactrim twice a day for thirty days and will retest me again in September. I have a feeling another biopsy is coming. Should I ask for an MRI first? I'm very active. I workout twice a day 5 times a week and I run a couple times a week. I been having a lot of lower abdominal pain, most of the pain happens when I run. It seems I have a lot of inflammation in my pelvic area and lower back area. Would this cause an increase in PSA levels? I stopped taking fish oil because I heard it can cause an increase. I'm very worried Date PSA age 7/15 4.9 49 1/15 3.0 49 5/14 3.6 48 9/13 3.6 47 3/12 3.2 46 free PSA 14% 4/11 3.4 45 7/11 biopsy 44 5/10 3.1 44 9/9 3.2 43 2/9 2.3 43 5/8 2.1 42 1/8 2.4 42 If your insurance covers it, you should consider a T3(?) MRI which would help \"target\" the biopsy to suspicious-looking spots. Others will have the exact name of the test and process. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Merc428 To me, the thin liners were all about placement. Too high and they're no good...the end of the penis is too low. Too middle and they weren't as effective as they could be because I naturally \"hang\" to the left. I had to place them where the end of my penis was most likely to be in the middle of the pad. Not the center of my underwear (as the nurse showed me). Cialis and Viagra, I think, are different for everyone. I take low dose 5mg Cialis everyday. Some days I know I won't see my girlfriend and I don't take it. Other days I'm sure I'll see her and I take 2 or 3. I rarely have a problem being floppy using this method. And I'm quite happy, not just \"OK\". But I know each mans journey is different. And the drugs that work for some don't work for others. And that even with nerve sparing surgery, the nerves can be stretched and damaged quite a bit and need 12-24 months to heal. So everyone is different. Your husband is lucky to have such a caring and understanding wife. All the best to both of you on this recovery journey. Agree. The fact that your hubby is having some \"action\" about three months after DaVinci is great news. I also tried a few brands of thin pads until I found one which was \"just right\". I also bought one of those 12-packs of cloth baby diapers and cut them into quarters and put one in front of the thin pad. I would just throw them out after I leaked a little. It helped me \"graduate\" from the medium pads to the thin pads. Or I would just go with one of those in the front for half a day or so as they were much softer than pads. Your hubby is doing great. Don't get discouraged if there isn't improvement for a few days. Also insist that if he wakes up with a bulge under the covers that he needs to wake you up as well, just for encouragement and to admire the view if nothing else....",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. Your post operation pathology is worrisome: G9, positive margin, with one positive lymph node and positive bladder neck. In my non professional opinion, your cancer is probably still there, so if I were you I would go immediately into plan B, with perhaps adjuvant RT and hormone start right away to hopefully catch the cancer before it goes systemic. Get a second opinion from a prostate oncologist ASAP if I were you. Good luck. I reluctantly agree with newporter. While you can hope for the best, you have to prepare for the worst. Plan out a course of action immediately with a prostate oncologist who specializes in salvage radiation. You've \"debulked\" the G9, gotten rid of at least 99.9% of it. If its not totally gone, then a tiny part is hiding in a corner, and needs one final blow to kill it off. Discuss with the oncologist whether immediate treatment is warranted in order to be 100% sure that it's banished forever. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Uncle Bill This is my first post since 2013. I'm hoping someone can help me understand what's going on with me. My PSA count in July 2015 was 4.9, a big jump from January 2015 at 3.0. I included below about an eight year history of my PSA counts. As you can see my counts have always been high for my age group. Earlier this month my doctor put me on Bactrim twice a day for thirty days and will retest me again in September. I have a feeling another biopsy is coming. Should I ask for an MRI first? I'm very active. I workout twice a day 5 times a week and I run a couple times a week. I been having a lot of lower abdominal pain, most of the pain happens when I run. It seems I have a lot of inflammation in my pelvic area and lower back area. Would this cause an increase in PSA levels? I stopped taking fish oil because I heard it can cause an increase. I'm very worried Date PSA age 7/15 4.9 49 1/15 3.0 49 5/14 3.6 48 9/13 3.6 47 3/12 3.2 46 free PSA 14% 4/11 3.4 45 7/11 biopsy 44 5/10 3.1 44 9/9 3.2 43 2/9 2.3 43 5/8 2.1 42 1/8 2.4 42 If your insurance covers it, you should consider a T3(?) MRI which would help \"target\" the biopsy to suspicious-looking spots. Others will have the exact name of the test and process. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mikla Hi Barry... you may want to get a second opinion on the biopsy. Your uro may know of someone or you can have him send it to John Hopkins. Also given no findings on the DRE any treatment you may decide to go with should have an excellent chance of success. But if a second opinion comes back as a 3+3 it means you may also have the alternative of AS. In any case, it sounds like you have some time to absorb and learn that the best choice is for you. Good Luck! I was also diagnosed with a G3+4 and was given the choice of having a second opinion, and if it was G3+3, researching AS. After much deliberation, I decided not to, because for me (and everyone is different), as someone who was qualified did rate me as a G3+4. For me to proceed with AS, I would need TWO reports of G6 (ie, a \"solid\" G6). I'm also not the type of person who would feel comfortable with AS (I wanted the surgery the day after I found out the biopsy was positive and was told i needed to wait six weeks). Also, your testosterone replacement therapy may also contraindicate AS, if you decide to go that route. Read the stickies, take a deep breath, and good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ron_G So, I got my first issue of the 'Discovery' quarterly newsletter from Hopkins since my surgery. Pretty informative regarding PC and treatment developments. Aside from that, from what it's indicating, the new protocol regarding PC scores that were developed by Jonathan Epstein and presented at the American Urological Association meeting in New Orleans have been accepted by the World Health Organization and will be used in conjunction with the current Gleason system \"until it becomes widely accepted and practiced.\" It seems he's trying to simplify and categorize things better. Grade Group 1: Gleason 3+3=6 Grade Group 2: Gleason 3+4=7 Grade Group 3: Gleason 4+3=7 Grade Group 4: Gleason 8 Grade Group 5: Gleason 9 & 10 Some may have already heard of this proposal, but this is the first I've heard of its acceptance. Seems the G7 needed to be clarified, as well as the fact that nothing lower than a G6 would be diagnosed anyways. this looks interesting, as long as the number of cores and percent involvement are also reported and taken into account when deciding on whether or not AS is an option",

I decided that if I was diagnosed with G6, then AS would have been an option... and I would have had a second opinion to validate the first diagnosis. And if both reads were for G6, then I would have called it a \"True G6\", and would have started on the AS path. But I ultimately decided that since I was \"awarded\" a G3+4 on my first biopsy, SOMEONE saw something which looked like G4. Therefore, my \"threshold\" for AS was exceeded, and a second opinion did not matter, and it was time for active treatment. I made the right choice as I was one of those 20% or so who was upgraded, to G4+3.",

Also given no findings on the DRE any treatment you may decide to go with should have an excellent chance of success. But if a second opinion comes back as a 3+3 it means you may also have the alternative of AS. In any case, it sounds like you have some time to absorb and learn that the best choice is for you. Good Luck! I was also diagnosed with a G3+4 and was given the choice of having a second opinion, and if it was G3+3, researching AS. After much deliberation, I decided not to, because for me (and everyone is different), as someone who was qualified did rate me as a G3+4. For me to proceed with AS, I would need TWO reports of G6 (ie, a \"solid\" G6). I'm also not the type of person who would feel comfortable with AS (I wanted the surgery the day after I found out the biopsy was positive and was told i needed to wait six weeks). Also, your testosterone replacement therapy may also contraindicate AS, if you decide to go that route. Read the stickies, take a deep breath, and good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster22 Dave, suggest you read response to recent thread titled New here...looking for Lupron info. by those on it. Responses to that thread will give you info. As to answers to your co-workers situation, your questions are rather fragmented, and so difficult to answer. It is typical for men to have a psa test. If high, then a biopsy of the prostate to detect cancer, and Gleason score rating. Has this been done?? This then determines what needs, or needs not be done, in the way of future treatment. Apologies for the fragmented question. The information I received is from my \"work spouse\" so it's a bit spotty. Her brother never had physicals or had PSA tested. When he had urination problems, to make a long story short, he had a TURP. It turns out that his Gleason Score is G9 (not sure if it is a 4+5 or 5+4) and his PSA is \"over 700\". It did spread to \"his bones\". He is scheduled for a full-body scan as well. Today, he will receive hormone treatment for one month, reassess how he responds to the initial treatment, and then have the dosage or meds adjusted and go for another hormone treatment. In addition, his oncologist recommended chemo. So i'ts no longer a case of \"short-term\" hormone treatment. I've suggested several times that my coworker visits this forum as well as her brother.",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". I was a Gleason 3+4 and was given the choice of getting a second opinion to see if it could be downgraded to a G6. I decided against it as someone who was qualified decided I was a G3+4, and decided that I would have needed two \"solid\" G6's for me to go with AS. I then needed to decide what type of treatment. I scheduled my surgery (I believe you need to wait between 6 and 8 weeks after the biopsy to the prostate to heal) in the meantime. I figured I could always cancel my surgery if I changed my mind and went with radiation, but if I did not change my mind, I already had a place \"reserved\" for my surgery. After much agonizing, I went ahead with the surgery (robotic). I decided on robotic because, while it is a longer surgery (and therefore a greater risk for people with heart issues), it does have a faster recovery from surgery. I also believe that with robotic surgery, there's a larger percentage of people who regain full urinary control vs open. -- I believe because it's easier toreconstruct/restitch one of the muscles down there a bit better with Robotic vs Open. But the most important thing, if you decide on surgery, is to find an experienced one. (The above is my personal opinion and experiences) Please read all of the stickies on the top of the board, and good luck with whatever treatment you decide.",

      "Content": "First off, I'm happy to say that I am still in the Zero Club. Even though I could have my PSA teste annually, I am still having it tested every six months. It's reduced a lot of stress on my part knowing that if my PSA does rise, it will be caught in less than six months rather than a year. Anyway, a coworker's brother, 60 years old, did not have annual physicals or any PSA testing. Suddenly he could not pee. A catheter was put in and he was put on a drug to help with urinary flow. within a day after the catheter was taken out, he had the same issue so he had a \"scraping\" to help with his urinary problems. I believe it was open surgery but I am not 100% sure. The result of the \"scraping\" was positive for PCa. I don't know the Gleason score or any other details as present. His Dr is discussing radiation. The X-rays were negative and he's waiting word on the results of the MRI. A couple of questions... 1 - how long is a typical time to wait before radiation after surgery? 2 - while he heals, would a one-time hormone treatment be something to consider? I guess Lupron but I my be wrong. Or should this only be considered if his PCa did spread, and/or he has a high Gleason score? 3 - What are the side effects of a one-time treatment? Thanks! -Dave",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". I was a Gleason 3+4 and was given the choice of getting a second opinion to see if it could be downgraded to a G6. I decided against it as someone who was qualified decided I was a G3+4, and decided that I would have needed two \"solid\" G6's for me to go with AS. I then needed to decide what type of treatment. I scheduled my surgery (I believe you need to wait between 6 and 8 weeks after the biopsy to the prostate to heal) in the meantime. I figured I could always cancel my surgery if I changed my mind and went with radiation, but if I did not change my mind, I already had a place \"reserved\" for my surgery. After much agonizing, I went ahead with the surgery (robotic). I decided on robotic because, while it is a longer surgery (and therefore a greater risk for people with heart issues), it does have a faster recovery from surgery. I also believe that with robotic surgery, there's a larger percentage of people who regain full urinary control vs open. -- I believe because it's easier toreconstruct/restitch one of the muscles down there a bit better with Robotic vs Open. But the most important thing, if you decide on surgery, is to find an experienced one. (The above is my personal opinion and experiences) Please read all of the stickies on the top of the board, and good luck with whatever treatment you decide.",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". I was a Gleason 3+4 and was given the choice of getting a second opinion to see if it could be downgraded to a G6. I decided against it as someone who was qualified decided I was a G3+4, and decided that I would have needed two \"solid\" G6's for me to go with AS. I then needed to decide what type of treatment. I scheduled my surgery (I believe you need to wait between 6 and 8 weeks after the biopsy to the prostate to heal) in the meantime. I figured I could always cancel my surgery if I changed my mind and went with radiation, but if I did not change my mind, I already had a place \"reserved\" for my surgery. After much agonizing, I went ahead with the surgery (robotic). I decided on robotic because, while it is a longer surgery (and therefore a greater risk for people with heart issues), it does have a faster recovery from surgery. I also believe that with robotic surgery, there's a larger percentage of people who regain full urinary control vs open. -- I believe because it's easier toreconstruct/restitch one of the muscles down there a bit better with Robotic vs Open. But the most important thing, if you decide on surgery, is to find an experienced one. (The above is my personal opinion and experiences) Please read all of the stickies on the top of the board, and good luck with whatever treatment you decide.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Hello Brava, I also have one metal hip and my surgeon said there was no point of a MRI since the picture gets very distorted so they did not do it. I had the surgery anyway and for me it went fine. Nerves spared, cancer free after one year and very little incontinence. As I understand it the surgeon takes the decision on nerve-sparing when he actually sees the prostate during surgery and if there is no visible tumor he can go ahead. Good Luck Would a metal hip complicate radiation? Brava - stock up on the Viagra now... some insurance companies will only approve 6 or so a month, so make sure you have a head-start. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Whitney777 I'm starting a Low-Iodine soon in preparation for RAI treatment. Any good menu ideas? Does anyone have advice on good Hormone Replacement, T4 only, T4, T3 combo (Thyrolar) or natural such as Armour. Also curious if besides diet and exercise if there is any other metabolism boosting supplements I can take? I have been slender and athletic my entire life and am so afraid to start gaining weight. My wife has been on synthroid and armour and for the past 15 years. It takes a while to get the dose right but once it is correct everything will be fine. There is a school of thought that Armour is better because it contains both T-3 and T-4 but there have been severe shortages lately. One endocrinologist she spoke to said that the amount of T3/T4 in Armour may vary a bit (since it is natural) which makes identifying the correct dosage more difficult. For a while she was on both Syntheroid and Armour (the Armour in a smaller dose) with her endocrinologist doing some fancy math to convert it to a pure Syntheroid dosage. She said she felt better that way but I never noticed a difference.... But for the last three years or so the shortages of Armour have made it very difficult and challenging so she's been on just Syntheroid. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Whitney777 I'm starting a Low-Iodine soon in preparation for RAI treatment. Any good menu ideas? Does anyone have advice on good Hormone Replacement, T4 only, T4, T3 combo (Thyrolar) or natural such as Armour. Also curious if besides diet and exercise if there is any other metabolism boosting supplements I can take? I have been slender and athletic my entire life and am so afraid to start gaining weight. My wife has been on synthroid and armour and for the past 15 years. It takes a while to get the dose right but once it is correct everything will be fine. There is a school of thought that Armour is better because it contains both T-3 and T-4 but there have been severe shortages lately. One endocrinologist she spoke to said that the amount of T3/T4 in Armour may vary a bit (since it is natural) which makes identifying the correct dosage more difficult. For a while she was on both Syntheroid and Armour (the Armour in a smaller dose) with her endocrinologist doing some fancy math to convert it to a pure Syntheroid dosage. She said she felt better that way but I never noticed a difference.... But for the last three years or so the shortages of Armour have made it very difficult and challenging so she's been on just Syntheroid. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Hello Brava, I also have one metal hip and my surgeon said there was no point of a MRI since the picture gets very distorted so they did not do it. I had the surgery anyway and for me it went fine. Nerves spared, cancer free after one year and very little incontinence. As I understand it the surgeon takes the decision on nerve-sparing when he actually sees the prostate during surgery and if there is no visible tumor he can go ahead. Good Luck Would a metal hip complicate radiation? Brava - stock up on the Viagra now... some insurance companies will only approve 6 or so a month, so make sure you have a head-start. Good luck",

That way if I decided on the surgery, I knew my spot was already \"reserved\" and if I decided against surgery I could always cancel. I believe surgeons will always try to perform nerve-sparing surgery if they can. The surgeon could give an indication when they read the report butthere's no guarantee. Depends on the location of the PCa and the skill of the surgeon.... In my case, I'm not where I was before my surgery sexually. In your case, you'll want to pick the absolutely most experienced surgeon possible even if it means traveling several hundred miles or more.. Or decide against the surgery and do some other treatment. Good Luck",

You should ask about it. In the meantime, find a good experienced (400+) surgeon just in case the biopsy was positive. That way you will already be prepared just in case. I believe you are also going to prescribed a few days of antibiotics to take after the biopsy. I'm wondering if you could ask for a larger dose (maybe 10 days worth, ask your urologist), in case the cause of your high PSA is an infection. Then you'll already be on the antibiotics you'll need.

As you will soon find out, surgeons tend to recommend surgery and radiologists tend to recommend seeds or other types of radiation. To my case, deciding upon a treatment course was almost as stressful as the initial diagnosis. Whichever way to choose, experience is key.... For example, if you decide on surgery, then choose one (open or DaVinci) who's performed at least 300-400 (some say 1200) of those surgeries. Read the stickies at the top of the forum, Get Walsh's book. No matter what you decide, you have some time to decide -- For example, even if you decided on surgery today, you have to wait a minimum of six weeks after the biopsy to proceed (not sure about the other treatments). Good luck. You are not alone...",

      "Content": "Sorry you had to join our \"club\". You can add to your signature some details (number of positive cores, location of the positives, % involvement, Gleason 3+4 or 4+3, etc). As you will soon find out, surgeons tend to recommend surgery and radiologists tend to recommend seeds or other types of radiation. To my case, deciding upon a treatment course was almost as stressful as the initial diagnosis. Whichever way to choose, experience is key.... For example, if you decide on surgery, then choose one (open or DaVinci) who's performed at least 300-400 (some say 1200) of those surgeries. Read the stickies at the top of the forum, Get Walsh's book. No matter what you decide, you have some time to decide -- For example, even if you decided on surgery today, you have to wait a minimum of six weeks after the biopsy to proceed (not sure about the other treatments). Good luck. You are not alone...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mosserj Hi members After putting off a biopsy for awhile I finally had one recently and received my results by email, at my request, as my urologist is away for a week. The results for this healthy 66 year old were a Gleason 7 (3+4) on 6 cores and Gleason 6 (3+3) on a further 6 cores of the 15 taken. Some perineurial invasions on 2 cores. Recent PSA of 9.1 and %fPSA of 9 and PHI of 62. Having read many forum posts the first thing I am doing is keeping calm and reading. Life is what it is and the way forward for me has always involved no panicking and informed decision making. Clearly my next step will be to understand from my urologist surgeon the initial biopsy results, any further imaging and suggestive curative treatments. In the mean time I am avidly reading for information. Happy for any member feedback to assist me in my initial phase and considerations, noting choices for the future will be supported by the Doctors recommendations and my gained knowledge. A warm but reluctant welcome to the forum and our \"club\". \"Step Zero\" would be to order Dr. Patrick Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". I'm not sure a second opinion on the sides is necessary as you are in the \"absolutely need treatment\" category. You should ask about additional scans to ensure that nothing has spread... Also, if surgery is an option, then then find a good experienced (minimum 400+) surgeon and schedule the surgery. (You need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy). Then research and interview radiation and other treatments. That way if you decide on another treatment, you can simply cancel the surgery. But if decide to on the surgery, you already have it scheduled for the earliest possible date and will never have to second-guess yourself regarding treatment. Good luck",

Maybe all of you should go out to an IMAX 3D movie and get all of your minds off of things for a few hours. Or find out his favorite movie and rent it.

      "Content": "I find carbonated beverages, alcohol, and especially beer cause me to leak. Don't overdo the Kegals - it's a small muscle and you may be tiring it out without realizing it. I wonder if Kegals should be treated like weightlifting and done every other day in order to give the muscle time to rest and rejuvenate (or at least alternate \"heavy\" kegal days with \"light\" ones). I seem to recall someone mentioning that the best way to determine if the Kegals are being performed correctly is to try them while urinating as there should be some change in the flow if you are targeting the right muscle. Some people have also mentioned biofeedback, so you may wish to see if there's someplace nearby which specializes in this type of biofeedback. It will get better. Good luck.",

That way if I decided on the surgery, I knew my spot was already \"reserved\" and if I decided against surgery I could always cancel. I believe surgeons will always try to perform nerve-sparing surgery if they can. The surgeon could give an indication when they read the report butthere's no guarantee. Depends on the location of the PCa and the skill of the surgeon.... In my case, I'm not where I was before my surgery sexually. In your case, you'll want to pick the absolutely most experienced surgeon possible even if it means traveling several hundred miles or more.. Or decide against the surgery and do some other treatment. Good Luck",

I still have a question though. I'm completely lost on what we should get him for his birthday which is in 2 weeks. For his birthday... Maybe all of you should go out to an IMAX 3D movie and get all of your minds off of things for a few hours. Or find out his favorite movie and rent it. Don't give up hope... here are members here who had PSA in the hundreds and even THOUSANDS who are around for almost ten years (I hope they post here).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mosserj Hi members After putting off a biopsy for awhile I finally had one recently and received my results by email, at my request, as my urologist is away for a week. The results for this healthy 66 year old were a Gleason 7 (3+4) on 6 cores and Gleason 6 (3+3) on a further 6 cores of the 15 taken. Some perineurial invasions on 2 cores. Recent PSA of 9.1 and %fPSA of 9 and PHI of 62. Having read many forum posts the first thing I am doing is keeping calm and reading. Life is what it is and the way forward for me has always involved no panicking and informed decision making. Clearly my next step will be to understand from my urologist surgeon the initial biopsy results, any further imaging and suggestive curative treatments. In the mean time I am avidly reading for information. Happy for any member feedback to assist me in my initial phase and considerations, noting choices for the future will be supported by the Doctors recommendations and my gained knowledge. A warm but reluctant welcome to the forum and our \"club\". \"Step Zero\" would be to order Dr. Patrick Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". I'm not sure a second opinion on the sides is necessary as you are in the \"absolutely need treatment\" category. You should ask about additional scans to ensure that nothing has spread... Also, if surgery is an option, then then find a good experienced (minimum 400+) surgeon and schedule the surgery. (You need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy). Then research and interview radiation and other treatments. That way if you decide on another treatment, you can simply cancel the surgery. But if decide to on the surgery, you already have it scheduled for the earliest possible date and will never have to second-guess yourself regarding treatment. Good luck",

Also, have they done a \"bone scan?\" MF A 3T MRI sounds like a very good idea, even if the biopsy can be performed - it should help the urologist \"zero in\" on any suspicious spots. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JMorris271 Hi Everyone. I'm so thankful I found this forum and the good people here. Ok. Here it goes. I was just informed that I had joined the 7 (3+4) club 3 weeks ago. and have been trying to glean what I can to have my cancer treated. One point that resonates with me is to find the best surgeon, Rad/oncol possible. I'm at a loss of how to go about that. With no contacts in medical circles or first hand knowledge of my areas talent. Does anyone have suggestions on where I can begin researching and rating my doctor options? Thank you so much and Merry Christmas. A reluctant welcome to our \"club\". I would get a copy of the latest edition of Dr Wash's book \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". A few questions to consider: How many cores were positive? Would you be willing to have the slides sent out for a second opinion to determine if it a G3+3 instead? (and if so, would that even make a difference or do you just want treatment and not consider AS)? Do you have any leanings toward radiation vs surgery? (such as wanting the cancer \"out\" as quickly as possible? ) Do you live close to a first-class medical center (or would you mind traveling to one and staying a few days)? Do you have any preexisting medical conditions (such as heart trouble) which may preclude surgery? As far a a surgeon goes, the most important item is experience - at least 400 (or even better, 1000+ surgeries). I was also a G3+4. One Dr highly recommended that I get a second opinion on my slides to see if I could be downgraded to a G3+3 and start on AS. I decided against it, because even though I am \"wired\" for AS, my \"threshold\" or \"trigger\" to go off AS is rather low, and I would have required two different labs agreeing on a G3+3 as a prerequisite before even starting on AS. I then researched surgeons and picked one who had more than 400 surgeries (robotic). I scheduled the surgery while STILL researching radiation -- that way I could cancel the surgery if I decided on radiation but keep the appointment if I decided on the surgery after all. I kept my original appointment and had the surgery -- and since I already had the appointment, I never had to second-guess myself with \"what ifs\" because I put off the surgery while researching the alternatives. Good luck with whatever you choose, we have a reservation in your name in the \"zero\" club waiting for you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mosserj Hi members After putting off a biopsy for awhile I finally had one recently and received my results by email, at my request, as my urologist is away for a week. The results for this healthy 66 year old were a Gleason 7 (3+4) on 6 cores and Gleason 6 (3+3) on a further 6 cores of the 15 taken. Some perineurial invasions on 2 cores. Recent PSA of 9.1 and %fPSA of 9 and PHI of 62. Having read many forum posts the first thing I am doing is keeping calm and reading. Life is what it is and the way forward for me has always involved no panicking and informed decision making. Clearly my next step will be to understand from my urologist surgeon the initial biopsy results, any further imaging and suggestive curative treatments. In the mean time I am avidly reading for information. Happy for any member feedback to assist me in my initial phase and considerations, noting choices for the future will be supported by the Doctors recommendations and my gained knowledge. A warm but reluctant welcome to the forum and our \"club\". \"Step Zero\" would be to order Dr. Patrick Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". I'm not sure a second opinion on the sides is necessary as you are in the \"absolutely need treatment\" category. You should ask about additional scans to ensure that nothing has spread... Also, if surgery is an option, then then find a good experienced (minimum 400+) surgeon and schedule the surgery. (You need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy). Then research and interview radiation and other treatments. That way if you decide on another treatment, you can simply cancel the surgery. But if decide to on the surgery, you already have it scheduled for the earliest possible date and will never have to second-guess yourself regarding treatment. Good luck",

      "Content": "I find carbonated beverages, alcohol, and especially beer cause me to leak. Don't overdo the Kegals - it's a small muscle and you may be tiring it out without realizing it. I wonder if Kegals should be treated like weightlifting and done every other day in order to give the muscle time to rest and rejuvenate (or at least alternate \"heavy\" kegal days with \"light\" ones). I seem to recall someone mentioning that the best way to determine if the Kegals are being performed correctly is to try them while urinating as there should be some change in the flow if you are targeting the right muscle. Some people have also mentioned biofeedback, so you may wish to see if there's someplace nearby which specializes in this type of biofeedback. It will get better. Good luck.",

Biopsies do have a risk, such as infections You can't have an infinite number of biopsies without issues such as scarring Biopsies can miss PCa Biopsies may catch PCa but miss the higher Gleason Grade Until an MRI is found to be as accurate or more accurate than a biopsy, biopsies are the \"Gold Standard\" and will continue to be used. Therefore, I would do my best to ensure that each biopsy has the best chance being accurate. Therefore, I'm wondering if one should always have an MRI Guided/Targeted biopsy instead of a \"blind\", 12-core standard biopsy... For example, see this article: http://www.nwhroboticsurgery.org/def...lay/news_id,10. (This was my surgeon, who I do recommend. He did not do my biopsies)",

Also, ask about a MRI-guided/targeted biopsy - I believe with a targeted biopsy, more samples will be taken from \"suspicious\" areas. Since repeated biopsies (I believe more than 3 or 4) can cause issues if you need have your \"friend\" removed, you need to make sure each biopsy counts! You may also consider going to a \"center of excellence\" and consult with surgeons who are experienced with large prostates. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Prowler My purpose here is not to scare anyone from their choice of treatment options but to make them aware of possible complications and a better advocate for themselves. Believe it or not, you may know your body better than your doctor. About three days after surgery at NYU hospital in Sept 2013, I developed a fever just under the cutoff for calling in to the doctor 101F. As you are on pain and antibiotic meds your temperature will be suppressed. I called the hotline anyway and was told not to worry but call back if you surpass 101F which it never did. As I live 200 miles north of NYC I had retained a hotel near NYU for ten days in the event a complication should occur. As it turned out the large incision at the umbilicus where the prostate gland was pulled through, had opened. When I presented myself first thing Monday morning at the doctors offices I at first was treated very poorly as to why I was there and then their response was that my wife should be able to dress my wound. When they saw that the wound was open and you can look at the deep hole in my body their attitude changed. However, they kept telling me the wound wasn't infected as the drainage was clear but since I was on Cipro as the cath was still in place they were wrong. Every morning I went to the doctors office and was told the same thing (no infection) as they had to pack a wet dressing deep into the wound. They had to arrange for a nurse to come to my home each day to dress the wound and allow it to heal from the bottom up. Once an incision opens it is considered a dirty wound that must be allowed to heal on its own. This took three months to heal and when I got home my internist changed the antibiotic after lab tests showed a staph infection that proved very difficult to resolve. I took antibiotics for nearly three months to clear the infection that would return every three days after completing that course of drugs. The problem here was that even though I felt I had a wound infection and kept telling them so from right after surgery, no doctor would believed me until I completed a round of drugs and smelly yellow fluid squirted out into my doctor's face as she pressed around the open wound that at least three doctors and many nurses said was not infected. Now that they had proof, they could then collect the yellow fluid to send to the lab and determine the best antibiotic treatment. Finally clear of infection, at my urging, my doctor ordered a CAT scan to see that there was no internal access and make sure all was well. The scan showed a huge mass in my abdominal area that the radiologist thought was cancer. My doctor thought I was history. It was nearly two liters in size, compressing and displacing my bladder to the left. After much worry a good surgeon I went to said it wasn't cancer but rather a very large lynphocele caused by removing a lymph node and not having a proper seal to stop the leakage of fluid. This process developed a cyst with many cambers containing fluid. Even though you may pick a fine surgeon to perform the robotic surgery he may be training others who may perform the lesser tasks like removing and sealing off lymph nodes. This may be especially true in teaching hospitals. I was told the lymphocele could be left in place unless it presented a problem. Some research literature states that small lymphoceles about the size of golf balls are quite common after cancer surgery but go undetected unless found as a result of imaging tests for some unrelated problem. About two months later I developed a very high fever 103+F and was rushed to a hospital and treated as a septis patient, a life threatening blood infection. I was put on every interveinous drug they had on the shelf and nothing lowered my fever. It turned out that Strep bacteria had invaded the lymph fluid in the lymphocele and I needed immediate surgery as drugs cannot get to the infected fluid. This was a very big surgery a difficult recovery with a large incision from my umbilical to nearly my penis. Then after about six months recovery from these issues I developed a very big incisional hernia with small intestine bulging about four or five inches out from my stomach. The surgeon said it was probably a result of the tissue having been weakened from the prior infection. He wants me to undergo a four hour surgery to repair the hernia by patching in some pig skin at the defect. I am reluctant to do this as there is about a 40% chance it will fail and the hernial will return. I wear an elastic wrap to somewhat hide and protect the hernia. The good news is that my PSA at two years post op is 0.00! Although all of the many doctors and radiologists I saw steered my toward surgery due to my age and general good health, I may have been better served or had an easier experience had I chosen another treatment or maybe a local surgeon rather than a \"world class\" university hospital. Holy Sh*t!!! The space where my prostate was hurts just reading your story! I hope its all downhill from now on!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by glr3 Did not find a post about \"What I Wish I Knew About Prostate Biopsies\" before I had one. If there is one, can anyone direct me to it. If not, would anyone care to provide comments? My biopsy was painless. First one did not detect anything, the second one six months later did... It did feel weird when the needle(?) was pushed up there but since I had nerve blockers it didn't hurt at all. For some reason during my two biopsy visits the Dr had the most beautiful assistants that day... It was almost like he planned it The urine may have blood for the next week or so, the semen definitely will. The \"standard\" biopsy is 12 \"cores\". There are different types of biopsies, such as a \"saturation biopsy\" and a \"guided biopsy\", which can be used if the PSA level continues to rise to hopefully detect if there's cancer cells... I believe these \"special\" biopsies are usually used for people on AS or where the PSA continues to rise. There's also a limit to the number of biopsies one can have (3 or 4 I believe) before the scar tissue becomes an issue",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut Interesting article from Bloomberg. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-0...-concerns.html Clip from the article: \u0093Given the recent spike in infection complications after prostate biopsy, the ideal method to diagnose prostate cancer must be pondered,\u0094 Matthew Gettman, professor of urology at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota, wrote in an editorial in the journal European Urology last May. \u0093Despite local anesthetics, the whole procedure is barbaric, and it is surprising that the issue of infection has not come to light years ago.\u0094 Knowing what I do now (hindsight is always 20-20), knowing that... Biopsies do have a risk, such as infections You can't have an infinite number of biopsies without issues such as scarring Biopsies can miss PCa Biopsies may catch PCa but miss the higher Gleason Grade Until an MRI is found to be as accurate or more accurate than a biopsy, biopsies are the \"Gold Standard\" and will continue to be used. Therefore, I would do my best to ensure that each biopsy has the best chance being accurate. Therefore, I'm wondering if one should always have an MRI Guided/Targeted biopsy instead of a \"blind\", 12-core standard biopsy... For example, see this article: http://www.nwhroboticsurgery.org/def...lay/news_id,10. (This was my surgeon, who I do recommend. He did not do my biopsies)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rebern Greater Atlanta area. Travel would be very difficult. Would like to be able to travel but have local issues I can not get out of. Not to mention insurance issues. I would check out http://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/area/atlanta-ga and other web sites and first choose a good hospital (a teaching hospital would also be good choice, as long as it's highly rated). Then research the individual Drs at those hospitals for ratings at healthgrades and other DR-ratings sites. Hopefully you'll have a \"short list\" of surgeons who are a)highly rated, b)work at a highly-rated hospital, and c)accept your insurance. Then you can set up appointments with each one and ask your questions. I can't find any right now, but there have been several posts regarding questions to ask your surgeon like positive margins, number of surgeries, etc. Good Luck!",

So far so good. it's like I'm back three weeks after surgery in that I'm paying attention down there again to make sure I don't leak. One small squirt the first day and otherwise only a small drop or two. I only put a pad on before the gym. Two down, one to go.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by glr3 Did not find a post about \"What I Wish I Knew About Prostate Biopsies\" before I had one. If there is one, can anyone direct me to it. If not, would anyone care to provide comments? My biopsy was painless. First one did not detect anything, the second one six months later did... It did feel weird when the needle(?) was pushed up there but since I had nerve blockers it didn't hurt at all. For some reason during my two biopsy visits the Dr had the most beautiful assistants that day... It was almost like he planned it The urine may have blood for the next week or so, the semen definitely will. The \"standard\" biopsy is 12 \"cores\". There are different types of biopsies, such as a \"saturation biopsy\" and a \"guided biopsy\", which can be used if the PSA level continues to rise to hopefully detect if there's cancer cells... I believe these \"special\" biopsies are usually used for people on AS or where the PSA continues to rise. There's also a limit to the number of biopsies one can have (3 or 4 I believe) before the scar tissue becomes an issue",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut Interesting article from Bloomberg. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-0...-concerns.html Clip from the article: \u0093Given the recent spike in infection complications after prostate biopsy, the ideal method to diagnose prostate cancer must be pondered,\u0094 Matthew Gettman, professor of urology at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota, wrote in an editorial in the journal European Urology last May. \u0093Despite local anesthetics, the whole procedure is barbaric, and it is surprising that the issue of infection has not come to light years ago.\u0094 Knowing what I do now (hindsight is always 20-20), knowing that... Biopsies do have a risk, such as infections You can't have an infinite number of biopsies without issues such as scarring Biopsies can miss PCa Biopsies may catch PCa but miss the higher Gleason Grade Until an MRI is found to be as accurate or more accurate than a biopsy, biopsies are the \"Gold Standard\" and will continue to be used. Therefore, I would do my best to ensure that each biopsy has the best chance being accurate. Therefore, I'm wondering if one should always have an MRI Guided/Targeted biopsy instead of a \"blind\", 12-core standard biopsy... For example, see this article: http://www.nwhroboticsurgery.org/def...lay/news_id,10. (This was my surgeon, who I do recommend. He did not do my biopsies)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut Interesting article from Bloomberg. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-0...-concerns.html Clip from the article: \u0093Given the recent spike in infection complications after prostate biopsy, the ideal method to diagnose prostate cancer must be pondered,\u0094 Matthew Gettman, professor of urology at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota, wrote in an editorial in the journal European Urology last May. \u0093Despite local anesthetics, the whole procedure is barbaric, and it is surprising that the issue of infection has not come to light years ago.\u0094 Knowing what I do now (hindsight is always 20-20), knowing that... Biopsies do have a risk, such as infections You can't have an infinite number of biopsies without issues such as scarring Biopsies can miss PCa Biopsies may catch PCa but miss the higher Gleason Grade Until an MRI is found to be as accurate or more accurate than a biopsy, biopsies are the \"Gold Standard\" and will continue to be used. Therefore, I would do my best to ensure that each biopsy has the best chance being accurate. Therefore, I'm wondering if one should always have an MRI Guided/Targeted biopsy instead of a \"blind\", 12-core standard biopsy... For example, see this article: http://www.nwhroboticsurgery.org/def...lay/news_id,10. (This was my surgeon, who I do recommend. He did not do my biopsies)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I believe this muscle is not in the prostate, but is located in the bladder neck, which is usually cut out during prostate removal. This is called the internal sphincter. From what I've read, there is a new technique being developed in which the surgeon can sometimes leave the bladder neck intact and, thus, spare this internal sphincter. I'm willing to bet that experienced surgeons who \"brag\" about their patients being \"completely dry\" (ie no pads at all) within 3 months are sparing that second muscle. When I asked my surgeon about the \"Rocco Stitch\", he sort of smirked and said that he uses a variation which is \"better\" and bragged that his patients have been 100% dry within 3 months and he's not going to let me break his \"perfect record\", and that's he's submitted his results for publication.... No complains from me on this... If I achieve the \"prostate trifecta\" he can put a picture of my smiling face up in his office and web site for all I care...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Now What? This is to the ladies or the male partners among us. Most of what I read here is about the physical healing of the men who underwent the prostatectomy. II absolutely love the support I have found here but I would love to hear about the emotional effects on their partners, either in the forum here or through private messages. I have been strong ever since he was diagnosed last year, all the way through the surgery last month and up until now at 3 weeks post-op. He is amazingly strong and seems to be healing well. We love each other very much and have a very good marriage (34 + years or so) But today for the very first time I broke down when I it hit me that the physical love life we had before the surgery, is now gone. But we are still happy with each other and sometimes it is fun as well. I cannot talk to my friends or family members (adult kids in particular!!) about this emotional aspect so that's why I put this out here. All my best to all of you. The physical love is not gone permanently. Viagra and other ED meds may help, or an injectable like caverject or trimex. <warning- \"R\" rated> I can get about \"60% there\" on my own, and use caverject to reach 100%... and I'm only limited by my endurance or when my wife has to beg me to stop..

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Walnut Interesting article from Bloomberg. http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-0...-concerns.html Clip from the article: \u0093Given the recent spike in infection complications after prostate biopsy, the ideal method to diagnose prostate cancer must be pondered,\u0094 Matthew Gettman, professor of urology at the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota, wrote in an editorial in the journal European Urology last May. \u0093Despite local anesthetics, the whole procedure is barbaric, and it is surprising that the issue of infection has not come to light years ago.\u0094 Knowing what I do now (hindsight is always 20-20), knowing that... Biopsies do have a risk, such as infections You can't have an infinite number of biopsies without issues such as scarring Biopsies can miss PCa Biopsies may catch PCa but miss the higher Gleason Grade Until an MRI is found to be as accurate or more accurate than a biopsy, biopsies are the \"Gold Standard\" and will continue to be used. Therefore, I would do my best to ensure that each biopsy has the best chance being accurate. Therefore, I'm wondering if one should always have an MRI Guided/Targeted biopsy instead of a \"blind\", 12-core standard biopsy... For example, see this article: http://www.nwhroboticsurgery.org/def...lay/news_id,10. (This was my surgeon, who I do recommend. He did not do my biopsies)",

Most of what I read here is about the physical healing of the men who underwent the prostatectomy. II absolutely love the support I have found here but I would love to hear about the emotional effects on their partners, either in the forum here or through private messages. I have been strong ever since he was diagnosed last year, all the way through the surgery last month and up until now at 3 weeks post-op. He is amazingly strong and seems to be healing well. We love each other very much and have a very good marriage (34 + years or so) But today for the very first time I broke down when I it hit me that the physical love life we had before the surgery, is now gone. But we are still happy with each other and sometimes it is fun as well. I cannot talk to my friends or family members (adult kids in particular!!) about this emotional aspect so that's why I put this out here. All my best to all of you. The physical love is not gone permanently. Viagra and other ED meds may help, or an injectable like caverject or trimex. <warning- \"R\" rated> I can get about \"60% there\" on my own, and use caverject to reach 100%... and I'm only limited by my endurance or when my wife has to beg me to stop..

Allen How often does your Dr recommend having your PSA tested? Would increasing the frequency help? I know every situation is different, but I even though I was told by my surgeon to have it checked annually, I decided on every six months. It made a huge difference knowing that I was having it checked twice as often as \"required\".",

I would suggest scheduling the surgery (there needs to be about six weeks after a biopsy before surgery). Then research radiation. That way, if you decide on surgery, your spot is already \"reserved\" and you don't have to ever second-guess waiting for a spot to open. If you decide to have other treatment, you can simply cancel the surgery. Someone here recommended this page: http://www.pcf.org/site/c.leJRIROrEp...ons_to_Ask.htm.

Unfortunately 2 weeks before the blood draw I revert to sweating bullets. Somehow and for no specific reason I feel if/when I go on HT my days are numbered. Allen How often does your Dr recommend having your PSA tested? Would increasing the frequency help? I know every situation is different, but I even though I was told by my surgeon to have it checked annually, I decided on every six months. It made a huge difference knowing that I was having it checked twice as often as \"required\".",

Me, I've got to be the biggest wuss on the planet because I have chills just thinking about a needle going into a pecker. Couldn't do it. Wish the best for you. Jim There's a version of MUSE which isn't injectable, you may wish to check it out. For me, I tried Viagra and friends and it didn't work well enough to offset the headaches.

Since you are \"nearly convinced\" about robotic -- schedule it -- while researching the other treatments. If you decide to switch to another type of treatment, you just have to cancel the robotic. But if you decide to stick with surgery, your spot will be \"reserved\" and there won't be any delay in getting treatment. Good Luck!",

There are two types of Muse, one is injectable, called \"Caverject\" and the other is some sort of \"pill\" you insert down there. My uro strongly dissuaded me from the \"pill\" form - he said it, and I quote \"it hurts like hell\". Then it was between Caverject (the injectable Muse) and trimix for me. My uro likes trimix but you need to go to a compounding pharmacy and it was not covered by my insurance while Caverject was. Since I do have some \"action\" down there, we agreed that I would try the Caverject first and if that doesn't work then \"graduate\" to the Trimix. I just dropped off the prescription. Once I get from the pharmacy I make a short appointment and he'll show me how to inject it. I requested the prettiest nurses to be on duty that day but he wouldn't guarantee it.... Wish me luck",

Unfortunately 2 weeks before the blood draw I revert to sweating bullets. Somehow and for no specific reason I feel if/when I go on HT my days are numbered. Allen How often does your Dr recommend having your PSA tested? Would increasing the frequency help? I know every situation is different, but I even though I was told by my surgeon to have it checked annually, I decided on every six months. It made a huge difference knowing that I was having it checked twice as often as \"required\".",

But, he does not see the point of a second opinion if any G4 was seen as he would not recommend AS for anyone who had a reading with a G4 or higher. Just his opinion.... He also mentioned that his last two patients had cyberknife and unfortunately he's seeing more and more unsuccessful cyberknife patients. He thinks it will be between 5 and 10 years from now when the nextgen MRI machines will have enough accuracy to ensure that all there aren't any missed areas, that that will be the real game-changer.

      "Content": "I really can't add much more than the already excellent responses listed above, but here is my two cents anyway... No one will suggest surgery now (and insurance will not cover it). If you have low-risk PC (G6, 1 core, etc), then there's a \"tipping point\", or \"trigger\", for one to switch from AS to treatment. Everyone's trigger is different. There is no right or wrong. For some, the trigger is already met and it's \"I don't care if it's G6, lets get rid of the cancer before it spreads\". For others, it's higher, like rising PSA or a second biopsy result. In some ways you could consider yourself on AS right now. Follow the \"AS Diet\" as listed in the stickies. As you seem to have a low \"trigger\" (again, not judging you at all), you may wish to consider increasing the frequency of your PSA tests from every six months to every three or four months. There are also some other kinds of tests (PCA-III, etc) listed on this board which may help as well. Also, there are types of biopsies (saturation biopsy, Guided (MRI?) biopsies, etc, which should have a better chance of finding out if actually have PC. I've read here that having too many biopsies can cause scar tissue which could make treatment more complicated. So you want to be sure each biopsy is as sophisticated as possible and gives you the best chance of finding (or hopefully not finding) and PC. Good Luck, and we hope you never have to join our \"club\".",

I have read this may show aggression, I will be sending my slide to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion soon, any advise on surgery that may help , open vs robotic? Looks like basically the whole prostate has cancer, 12out of 15, does this also determine treatment options ? Any reply or experience is helpful. I would do it in this order: 1. Find a good experienced (400+) surgeon and schedule the surgery. At your age, unless you have an underlying medical condition, robotic sounds best. 2. After you've scheduled the surgery (about six weeks after the biopsy), then research radiation alternatives. You can always cancel the surgery if you decide to go with radiation. And if you decide to go with surgery, you'll have the first available time \"reserved\" and you will never have to second guess yourself about waiting...",

      "Content": "Here's a reluctant welcome to our club. With all G6's, some would argue that you could consider Active Surveillance (AS). Other may suggest seeds or other treatments. But at your age, I believe most doctors would lean towards surgery. Also, you seem to have an excellent, experienced, caring surgeon. with your stats, there isn't a huge rush to have the surgery and I believe waiting a few extra weeks to decide wouldn't make a difference one way or another. If I were you, I would schedule the surgery and research other options since you can always cancel the surgery if you decide on AS or another treatment. But if you decide to go through with the surgery, your \"spot\" is already reserved... Take a deep breath, read the stickies, start your kegels now, get the viagra/cialis pills immediately (some insurance plans limit the number of six a month so you can \"hoard\" a few now). Have as much sex as possible right now. We have a ticket with your name on it already filled out for membership in the \"zero\" club. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Here's a reluctant welcome to our club. With all G6's, some would argue that you could consider Active Surveillance (AS). Other may suggest seeds or other treatments. But at your age, I believe most doctors would lean towards surgery. Also, you seem to have an excellent, experienced, caring surgeon. with your stats, there isn't a huge rush to have the surgery and I believe waiting a few extra weeks to decide wouldn't make a difference one way or another. If I were you, I would schedule the surgery and research other options since you can always cancel the surgery if you decide on AS or another treatment. But if you decide to go through with the surgery, your \"spot\" is already reserved... Take a deep breath, read the stickies, start your kegels now, get the viagra/cialis pills immediately (some insurance plans limit the number of six a month so you can \"hoard\" a few now). Have as much sex as possible right now. We have a ticket with your name on it already filled out for membership in the \"zero\" club. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mrs. GG Okay, another question that is on my mind. I know bruising and swelling is to be expected after RALP around the testicles and penis. My husband doesn't have that (he is one week post surgery) but he is massively black and blue from his hip bone to his rib cage on his right side. Just the right side and it is wicked. Every color of the rainbow and it looks like he's been beaten with a baseball bat. We are wondering if this was from the straps from the operating table (but just on one side?) or perhaps the doctor took more tissue sample from this side causing more internal bleeding?? We're stumped and will ask the doc about it tomorrow during catheter removal. I haven't noticed any other comments about torso bruising. Anybody else have this? GG I don't remember bruising, but my shoulders and right side were very stiff and sore as well as my mouth. I assume it was from the position you are in for the DaVinci and some sort of breathing assist thingy. Asking your Dr makes sense.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH A 7 week post-op PSA of 0.0 cannot be any better. He probably wants to measure your PSA as the future unfolds and then trigger radiation treatments only if the PSA begins to rise. I suppose it can be done either way -- start adjunct radiation now or be prepared for salvage radiation in the future. The main reason is to spare you from any of the ravages of radiation if it is not really needed. A PSA of 0 sounds like a great start. What testing schedule has your Dr recommended? Every six weeks for the first six months? Every three months? Also - Welcome to the Zero-Club and hope we can change your membership card from pencil to indelible marker.",

You actually don't feel bad after a few weeks but you can't lift anything heavy for at least six as the stitches are still healing from the inside. Read the DaVinci Sticky on the top of the forum, they contain many links to first-hand experiences of those of us in the club. Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon LOL, the pain is no where near severe enough to warrant anesthetic. I would estimate the needle they give you hurts more than the biopsy. Put plugs in your ears and you won't even hear the noise, and that's the worse part. Allen Yes, the needle did hurt more (although it was more like the pain of the needle at the dentist, just in a strange place). But some people insist on getting the \"happy gas\" at the dentist, so if getting knocked out for a biopsy is needed, then by all means do it.",

Also, are there any side effects or risks of such a biopsy above and beyond a \"regular\" biopsy? Edit: here is one article: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845744/ Based on this article, I wonder why the urologist did not recommend a 20-core for my repeat biopsy. Also, IF I was a candidate for AS (which unfortunately I was not), and was leaning towards it, from what I know now I would feel that a standard 12-core biopsy wouldn't be enough for me. I think I would personally only consider it if had a 'saturation biopsy\" first to be sure any Gleason 7's wasn't hiding somewhere...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Wilde Hi Gary, I was diagnosed with G7 in october and was in shock of course. The advice you are given here are excellent and given by guys who are experienced so you are in the right place. The two things that stuck in me which helped a lot was: 1. You are not in a hurry, you have the time to make an informed decision, but with G7 you need to make a decision 2. Talk to an urologist AND an oncologist and if you do not have confidence in them find another. You need input from both sides. Good luck Not to be an alarmist, but with a G3+4 involving at 95%, and another G4+3 on the other side, in my opinion you should start treatment as soon as possible (which if you decide on surgery is about 6 weeks after the biopsy). If I were you, I'd schedule the surgery with an EXPERIENCED surgeon, and then explore other options. You can always cancel the surgery if you decide on something else. And if you decide to go through with the surgery you'll have not had any delay in treatment. I'm also not quite sure what the benefit of a second opinion on the slides would be in this case... You already know you need treatment..... I assume the Drs will be asking you to have scans run to ensure that everything is localized to your prostate, which by every indication seems to be (cross fingers). Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by cvictim Cialis did not work for me, besides it gave me a lot of back ache and it states that in the small instruction leaflet inside the pak. I told my GP that and he snickered and said that he never heard that before, I adamantly told him it is written..as such a side effect... Tell me what you think. It may just take time... Cialis and Viagra didn't work for me. I'm very slowly improving (sometimes I'm waking up at night with some nice feeling down there. Not \"hang wet towels\" hard but at least something) so the Dr is happy. On my next visit I will ask for Trimix. Check out this thread: What-I-Need-to-Know-About-ED Chuck - Perhaps it's time to add back the ED sticky? Or set up a master \"What I wish or need to know about\" sticky and put all of the \"demoted\" stickies (and other useful threads) into it for easy reference?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JoeInBucks Kozmic sounds like you are only doing cardio type exercises. I agree that that type of work out can be extreamly boring. Try some resistance training instead or mix it in. The advantage of resistance training is that as you increase muscle mass your resting metabolic rate increases. If partook your goal is to keep your heart rate up don't rest between sets, just alternate between two different exercises. I keep reading good things about circuit training (where you don't use heavy weights, move from exercise to exercise with zero or minimal rest). It is supposed to raise your heard rate and as much as cardio with the added benefit of exercises all of the muscles in your body. About the kegels: I found doing them every other day worked best. Give that weak lil' muscle down there time to recover and build up it's strength. After RP you'll be depending on that muscle a lot more than you used to, so treat it with some TLC",

Not to scare you further (if that is possible), but wouldn't it be better to kill one or two cells of G9 lurking in the area surrounding the prostate rather than waiting until it spreads and then shows up on a PSA test? A google of \"G9, radiation post ddr\" does show that some Doctors seem to recommend radiation even for \"G9, PSA 0\". Get a second opinion, and good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by loves Husband, 61 years ~ Biopsy gleeson 7 & 8 right side only . Left side was clear . No symptoms this was caught on routine physical .. Just had Divinci last week now got results today from that upgraded to Gleeson 9 It was contained to prostate lymph glands clear, surgeon said everything was clear and free on edges . Bone scan ..negative Wondering if we dodged a bullet or 2 My question is do you all think we are out of the clear or should I still be worried . Have followed this since he was diagnosed and this seems not to be very good to have a score such as a 9 . We have a appt for cath removal next monday and will have a sit down with him then but I have gone from complete excitment that it was all gone to air sucking omg when he said it was up graded to a 9 ....thoughts We all hope you dodged a bullet! You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

Anyone from Missouri know a good Dr for surgery? Agree, at your age with four young kids you should seek treatment. Most of us would recommend DaVinci rather than open surgery. I would suggest finding a good surgeon (400+ surgeries, perhaps at a major teaching hospital. and schedule the surgery (which will be 6-8 weeks after your biopsy). Then research radiation and other treatments (as well as undergo further tests if needed). You can always reschedule or cancel the surgery if necessary. But if you decide to go through with the surgery, your spot will be \"reserved\" for the earliest possible time and you will never second guess yourself about waiting an extra few weeks before having the surgery.

You may be a candidate for active survallence (AS). some people aren't \"wired\" for AS (for example, knowing that there's a chance the biopsy missed a higher grade of PCa). Others go on AS while realizing that probably will need treatment in the future but feel comfortable with active monitoring. If you decide on treatment, then given your age, most of us on this board would suggest DaVinci surgery.

So, what I'm writing now is what I wish I would have done myself after my first biopsy was negative... (I hope this doesn't sound too negative so soon after you received good news)... I wish I would have considered myself on Active Surveillance (AS), as there's a chance that the standard 12-core biopsy missed my PCa. I wish I had done better with my diet, exercise, etc (for example, read the AS sticky) I wish I had asked my Doctor about having the followup PSA test after three or four months instead of six After my PCa continued to rise, and was told that I needed another biopsy, I wish I had pushed for a more aggressive biopsy (such as a guided biopsy) instead of a standard one to be sure that nothing was missed the second time... During the six months, I wish I had researched PCa and purchased Dr Walsh's book, and really learned about every treatment method, learning about each surgeon and treatment center, instead of waiting until after the second biopsy was positive, and then getting overwhelmed. \"Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\" Hope this isn't a \"downer\"... one last thing... After my first biopsy was negative, I wished that I had told my wife that the Dr said that I must have as much sex as possible as it exercises the prostate and the muscles around the prostate. I mean, I just came from the Dr, so she maybe she would have believed it!",

Wounds are healing well, he needs to go to the bathroom twice at night and pees quite a bit from what I can hear. Leaking at night is minimal. My question is about rehabbing the penis for erections. We do get a careful, hesitant response so that is hopeful. How often do we need to practice rehab (masturbation) in order to maintain progress? At this time it is just rehab, not desire. He is not taking any Cialis or Viagra. Hubby is upbeat and beside all this basically back to his old self. Thanks for your support. There's still a month or so of healing, so one needs to be very careful notto do any pulling or stretching... One thing I would add is to \"stock up\" on the cialis and viagra now each month, in case his friend gets \"stuck\" at 50% or 70% firmness and needs a bit extra push...",

      "Content": "Some of us aren't \"wired\" for AS with the thought of active cancer living --and possibly growing -- like a parasite inside. I was wired for AS, but the decision was taken out of my hands as I had G4. Even though it was a single core with G3+4, it put me out of the standard (and my) threshold for AS. One Dr suggested I have a second opinion in case it was downgraded to a G3+3. I decided against it, as in my mind someone saw something which rated as a G4. For me to go on AS, I would have needed two different doctors both rating my core as a G3+3. Turns out after surgery I was a G4+3 and my surgeon and GP use me as a textbook case to seek active treatment if there's anything beyond a G3 living in a prostate. IF you decide to go on AS, then I suggest you get every test you can which are listed in the AS sticky and have a strict \"threshold\" to get off AS and seek active treatment (most of us would argue that you are already past that threshold). Have a mri-guided saturation biopsy to be 100% sure nothing is \"hiding\" in there. Have your PSA tested every three months. And have a plan in place for the day when you may have to seek active treatment. Decide on your treatment plan NOW (for example, have a surgeon already chosen). Good luck",

If it was, say, G9, but it all came out, why would it matter? Is it just the concern that maybe a little bit escaped that we don't know about? Exactly. But with only 5% of G4, the odds are really looking good that we'll have a new member of the Zero Club",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by murphy749 Thanks for your response. I did ask about the PSA Free and the Urologist didn\u0092t think it was needed. I think I\u0092m going to insist on this test. If the biopsy is negative, then insist on having his PSA checked three or four months later. If it continues to rise, then ask for on a MRI-guided biopsy. Resist the urge to start taking any of those \"prostate health\" supplements, as you dont want to change the baseline already established. I hope he doesn't have to join our club, but the good news is that you guys are on top of it. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Some of us aren't \"wired\" for AS with the thought of active cancer living --and possibly growing -- like a parasite inside. I was wired for AS, but the decision was taken out of my hands as I had G4. Even though it was a single core with G3+4, it put me out of the standard (and my) threshold for AS. One Dr suggested I have a second opinion in case it was downgraded to a G3+3. I decided against it, as in my mind someone saw something which rated as a G4. For me to go on AS, I would have needed two different doctors both rating my core as a G3+3. Turns out after surgery I was a G4+3 and my surgeon and GP use me as a textbook case to seek active treatment if there's anything beyond a G3 living in a prostate. IF you decide to go on AS, then I suggest you get every test you can which are listed in the AS sticky and have a strict \"threshold\" to get off AS and seek active treatment (most of us would argue that you are already past that threshold). Have a mri-guided saturation biopsy to be 100% sure nothing is \"hiding\" in there. Have your PSA tested every three months. And have a plan in place for the day when you may have to seek active treatment. Decide on your treatment plan NOW (for example, have a surgeon already chosen). Good luck",

He's been great since coming home on Friday (managing pain, eating, walking, etc). Had a bit of a set back tonight. He got a sudden fever, shakes and severe pain in loser abdomin. Called the nurse again and she said this was likely a bladder spasm. Fever is gone but he's had2 more \"spasms\" since. They last a few minutes and pain subsides a but but doesn't go away completely. Has anyone experienced this? He did have any \"spasms\" up till now...is it normal to start 6 days after surgery? If the pain is that severe, then I strongly recommend a Dr visit. Otherwise sounds like he is doing OK. Read the DaVinci \"sticky\" as it contains first hand experience from others who also had surgery. Glad to hear it was a G6. Good luck",

      "Content": "In some ways your story is similar to mine, as my first biopsy was also negative. So, what I'm writing now is what I wish I would have done myself after my first biopsy was negative... (I hope this doesn't sound too negative so soon after you received good news)... I wish I would have considered myself on Active Surveillance (AS), as there's a chance that the standard 12-core biopsy missed my PCa. I wish I had done better with my diet, exercise, etc (for example, read the AS sticky) I wish I had asked my Doctor about having the followup PSA test after three or four months instead of six After my PCa continued to rise, and was told that I needed another biopsy, I wish I had pushed for a more aggressive biopsy (such as a guided biopsy) instead of a standard one to be sure that nothing was missed the second time... During the six months, I wish I had researched PCa and purchased Dr Walsh's book, and really learned about every treatment method, learning about each surgeon and treatment center, instead of waiting until after the second biopsy was positive, and then getting overwhelmed. \"Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\" Hope this isn't a \"downer\"... one last thing... After my first biopsy was negative, I wished that I had told my wife that the Dr said that I must have as much sex as possible as it exercises the prostate and the muscles around the prostate. I mean, I just came from the Dr, so she maybe she would have believed it!",

      "Content": "Agree with most posters - unless the treatment will change if one or more cores was upgraded to G7 or G8, then having a second opinion is optional since you need treatment. As you are deciding on surgery vs radiation, then I suggest doing it in this order: 1) find a good, experienced surgeon with 400+ surgeries. 2)immediately book the surgery (which will be about 6-8 weeks after the biopsy). 3) then research radiation treatment. If you decide to change to radiation, all you have to do is cancel the surgery. If you decide on surgery, then your spot is already \"reserved\" at the earliest possible time and you will never have to second guess yourself about having to wait to have the surgery (for example, if the second opinion or pathology find G7 or higher). Good Luck",

      "Content": "Some of us aren't \"wired\" for AS with the thought of active cancer living --and possibly growing -- like a parasite inside. I was wired for AS, but the decision was taken out of my hands as I had G4. Even though it was a single core with G3+4, it put me out of the standard (and my) threshold for AS. One Dr suggested I have a second opinion in case it was downgraded to a G3+3. I decided against it, as in my mind someone saw something which rated as a G4. For me to go on AS, I would have needed two different doctors both rating my core as a G3+3. Turns out after surgery I was a G4+3 and my surgeon and GP use me as a textbook case to seek active treatment if there's anything beyond a G3 living in a prostate. IF you decide to go on AS, then I suggest you get every test you can which are listed in the AS sticky and have a strict \"threshold\" to get off AS and seek active treatment (most of us would argue that you are already past that threshold). Have a mri-guided saturation biopsy to be 100% sure nothing is \"hiding\" in there. Have your PSA tested every three months. And have a plan in place for the day when you may have to seek active treatment. Decide on your treatment plan NOW (for example, have a surgeon already chosen). Good luck",

      "Content": "Agree with most posters - unless the treatment will change if one or more cores was upgraded to G7 or G8, then having a second opinion is optional since you need treatment. As you are deciding on surgery vs radiation, then I suggest doing it in this order: 1) find a good, experienced surgeon with 400+ surgeries. 2)immediately book the surgery (which will be about 6-8 weeks after the biopsy). 3) then research radiation treatment. If you decide to change to radiation, all you have to do is cancel the surgery. If you decide on surgery, then your spot is already \"reserved\" at the earliest possible time and you will never have to second guess yourself about having to wait to have the surgery (for example, if the second opinion or pathology find G7 or higher).

IMO you need to go through the \"what-if\" scenarios. (I don't know much about kidney treatment and a possible transplant, so please excuse me if I'm off-base). For example: If your husband's number is called and he has the transplant, would that change his PCa treatment options? If your husband's number is called in the middle or radiation or seed therapy, can he still have the transplant? Regarding surgery, I believe my Dr said that I needed to check with him for three months if any other medical condition came up. How soon after the surgery would he be able to have a transplant?

Since then I have been taking periodic PSA tests (around every six months) and they have been in the 3.6 range. Last week I had my latest PSA blood test and it spiked up to 6. I have scheduled an appt. with my Urologist for this Wed, 3/16. Needless to say my anxiety level has spiked as well. Anything specific I should be asking my Urologist? Thanks everyone in advance for any advice you can share. Some urologists would recommend another biopsy... But consider asking your urologist about a course of antibiotics, and PSA retest, and a T3-MRI first....",

I am glad to see that you were able to detect your PC early enough and doing well. Unfortunately my case so far seem to be similar to yours, fairly young, with an initial negative biopsy followed up by another PSA spike with followup needed. While we hope we can reject your \"application\", but you'll be fine no matter as you are doing a great job of staying on top of this...",

Just did the required tests, Colonoscopy (they removed 9 polyps (good decision this was)), and biopsy as a result of the elevated PSA, 21.7; 7 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7, one 3+4, and another 4+3, the rest not as high, all on the left side, prostate normal size at 25cc. With 7 out of 12 cores positive (I guess five are G6, one G4+3, and one G3+4), you should ask your Dr about having an MRI(?) to be sure it hasn't spread. I also wouldn't wait to long to make a decision.... Pick an experienced surgeon and schedule the surgery (you need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy to have surgery) while also researching proton and other treatments (and make sure that treatment is covered by your insurance). If you decide on surgery, you'll have it at the earliest possible moment and never have to second guess yourself about waiting. If you decide on proton or other treatment, then you can simply cancel the surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH A 7 week post-op PSA of 0.0 cannot be any better. He probably wants to measure your PSA as the future unfolds and then trigger radiation treatments only if the PSA begins to rise. I suppose it can be done either way -- start adjunct radiation now or be prepared for salvage radiation in the future. The main reason is to spare you from any of the ravages of radiation if it is not really needed. A PSA of 0 sounds like a great start. What testing schedule has your Dr recommended? Every six weeks for the first six months? Every three months? Also - Welcome to the Zero-Club and hope we can change your membership card from pencil to indelible marker.",

      "Content": "Agree with most posters - unless the treatment will change if one or more cores was upgraded to G7 or G8, then having a second opinion is optional since you need treatment. As you are deciding on surgery vs radiation, then I suggest doing it in this order: 1) find a good, experienced surgeon with 400+ surgeries. 2)immediately book the surgery (which will be about 6-8 weeks after the biopsy). 3) then research radiation treatment. If you decide to change to radiation, all you have to do is cancel the surgery. If you decide on surgery, then your spot is already \"reserved\" at the earliest possible time and you will never have to second guess yourself about having to wait to have the surgery (for example, if the second opinion or pathology find G7 or higher).

I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well its a small town. Seems like word will get around regardless. If you go the route of full disclosure, you have to overcome the word \"cancer\", which to the uninformed means ALL cancers. You'd be surprised at how uninformed the general public is about prostate cancer. Aside from telling them that only 1 in 6 prostate cancer patients ever dies from the condition, you would do well to supply current day examples of men who are in the news... after surgery for prostate cancer and living a completely normal life. A few you might include 1. Secretary of State, John Kerry, who has to be the most busy man on the planet. He had surgery 11.5 years ago. (heck, he ran for President ... shortly AFTER... he had surgery.... what could be more demanding than running for president?) 2. Rudy Giuliani, check the dates, but it was years ago, and he is traveling all over the country. 3. Arnold Palmer, had surgery 18 years ago. 4. Former Sec. of State, Colin Powell, 11 years ago in 2003. The man is very active and busy today and was shortly after surgery. There are hundreds of examples you could pick from... sports stars, politicians, seems you can't pick up the paper without seeing someone new. You need to give these ongoing examples to impress upon the staff, that this surgery will less disruptive than something like hip replacement surgery. That the chances you'll still be alive in 10 years is about 95%. There may be local town examples. Frankly I don't personally know of anyone who has actually died from the disease in my circle of acquaintances. This surgery will be far less disruptive than heart surgery. Anyway... I'd let them know via other examples. Great advise. Being from New York, I told people I decided to go the \"Joe Torre\" (surgery) treatment instead of the \"Rudy Guilani\" (non-surgical) treatment. (Yes I know I oversimplified things but I chose people from around the area I lived).",

      "Content": "Did the Dr also tell you to have yogurt or acidophilus along with the Antibiotic? While Antibiotics kill bacteria-based germs, it also kills some of the good stuff in your body and stomach so many Drs tell you to have a lot of foods with \"active cultures\" like yogurt and acidophilus. Even though you are off of the Bactrim, continue having yogurt several times a day along with something like \"culturelle\" which has lots of active cultures. Prednisone is a type of steroid (not the type that athletes use)... It prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It also suppresses the immune system. I'm prescribed it when I have a nasty sinus infection... I remember peeing more often when on it, and a search on the internet shows that some people complain that prednisone will cause more frequent urination, so that may be related to what you are going through. Are you on a \"medrol\" pack, which means you take one less pill each day for six days? If so, a day or two after you are off the prednisone you should begin to get back to normal. Have you contacted your surgeon? Another search of \"Dr Google\" shows that prednisone can affect PSA level, which you'll be tested for regularly post-surgery... So your surgeon needs to know ASAP about the predisone in case he wants to move back any testing by a week or two while the prednisone gets out of your system. (to be clear, I'm not questioning the need for prednisone, it sounds like you really needed it). Also, as Chuck says, asking your pharmacist would also be a good idea. Lets hope this is your only pothole in your road to recovery. Goo luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

If they are on the outer edge of the prostate, or at the Apex, that is something to consider before deciding on \"active surveillance\"..... And, if positive core is by the bladder neck, that could be a data point to be considered as part of the radiation-vs-surgery decision. (I hope I got this right) Would really be interesting for everyone to ask their urologist/radiologist about this...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCWIFE3 Thanks everyone for your quick responses and any he warm welcome. I heard back from the nurse and she confirmed what you all said. Just have one issue. He's been great since coming home on Friday (managing pain, eating, walking, etc). Had a bit of a set back tonight. He got a sudden fever, shakes and severe pain in loser abdomin. Called the nurse again and she said this was likely a bladder spasm. Fever is gone but he's had2 more \"spasms\" since. They last a few minutes and pain subsides a but but doesn't go away completely. Has anyone experienced this? He did have any \"spasms\" up till now...is it normal to start 6 days after surgery? If the pain is that severe, then I strongly recommend a Dr visit. Otherwise sounds like he is doing OK. Read the DaVinci \"sticky\" as it contains first hand experience from others who also had surgery. Glad to hear it was a G6. Good luck",

Put plugs in your ears and you won't even hear the noise, and that's the worse part. Allen Yes, the needle did hurt more (although it was more like the pain of the needle at the dentist, just in a strange place). But some people insist on getting the \"happy gas\" at the dentist, so if getting knocked out for a biopsy is needed, then by all means do it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SeaCock I'm almost 12 weeks post op and last week did some light ab's and never felt a thing. I have been stretching them briefly for the last three weeks getting them ready to do some work. I started light lifting when the NP said it was ok...which was 4 weeks post op. Last week I started trying to back to my normal weights...lost 10lbs waiting to get back in the gym...still no legs yet...don't want to stress anything down below until the little man wakes up a little more... Interesting... When I started lifting again (circuit training), also about 12 weeks out, my abs and the area felt \"different\", and were the absolute last thing to come back. It took almost a year for me to feel that I could do normal ab work. Maybe it was the scar tissue, maybe I was just a bit hesitant to put stress anything down there. I don't see the scars anymore either, but then again they are covered with my gorilla hair...",

She then realized I had the catheter and said \"hmmm, maybe we should wait for the Doctor\". The Doctor came in and removed the staples and stitches, no big deal. Then he started to pull out the catheter. I'll use that famous pain scale on 1 to 10 with a slight modification.. 1 = no pain and 10 = It fells like you are pissing out a bowling ball covered with thumb tacks and razor wire It was a two and sometimes a three for about 5 seconds. It jumped to a four for one second. The Dr said that was the catheter passing the anal sphincter. Another five seconds of a two or three. Then I hit a four for about two seconds and it was out! It was actually less pain than when the drainage tube was pulled from my stomach. It was probably less time than what I have above, that's just what it felt like... When I stood up, I immediately pee'd all over the floor (it was kinda nice seeing the pee leaving my actual pee-hole). The Doctor caught enough for his purposes. I told him I wish I had time to aim at him as revenge for what he put me through (don't forget the catheter was already out...) I put on a depends and an extra pad in there. The Dr recommended buying some \"tightie whities\" underwear for the pad. He also said not to do the Kagel exercises for a few days and then I can start. We all dread \"the pulling out of the catheter\" but after everything else we've gone through it really wasn't that horrible.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Now, while this looks to be a strong testament for AS, it has to be noted that all of the men involved were classified as low risk at the time they made their decisions. So, it is perhaps more useful as a caution against choosing possible over-treatment, when AS is being suggested as an option by your physician(s). Actually, all men involved were classified as low-risk AND between 66 and 69 years of age at diagnosis. I would also be interested in the exact definition of low-risk, as the definition isn't consistent, as well as what other tests were performed to validate the low-risk classification (MRI?) I know that if I was 69, low-risk, I'd have chosen AS as well. But since at the time of my diagnosis I was 54, with a 12-year-old, it would take a lot for me to have considered AS (like one G6 core <5% with every MRI and test known to man). But with the right numbers, I would have done AS, but with a very low \"trigger\" to begin active treatment. No right or wrong answer, some of us are just not wired for AS and some are.",

I have read this may show aggression, I will be sending my slide to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion soon, any advise on surgery that may help , open vs robotic? Looks like basically the whole prostate has cancer, 12out of 15, does this also determine treatment options ? Any reply or experience is helpful. I would do it in this order: 1. Find a good experienced (400+) surgeon and schedule the surgery. At your age, unless you have an underlying medical condition, robotic sounds best. 2. After you've scheduled the surgery (about six weeks after the biopsy), then research radiation alternatives. You can always cancel the surgery if you decide to go with radiation. And if you decide to go with surgery, you'll have the first available time \"reserved\" and you will never have to second guess yourself about waiting...",

The best I can do now is insist that I can oogle every pretty girl for as long as I want as part of my recovery She agreed for about 3 minutes...

But at your age, I believe most doctors would lean towards surgery. Also, you seem to have an excellent, experienced, caring surgeon. with your stats, there isn't a huge rush to have the surgery and I believe waiting a few extra weeks to decide wouldn't make a difference one way or another. If I were you, I would schedule the surgery and research other options since you can always cancel the surgery if you decide on AS or another treatment. But if you decide to go through with the surgery, your \"spot\" is already reserved... Take a deep breath, read the stickies, start your kegels now, get the viagra/cialis pills immediately (some insurance plans limit the number of six a month so you can \"hoard\" a few now).

The advice you are given here are excellent and given by guys who are experienced so you are in the right place. The two things that stuck in me which helped a lot was: 1. You are not in a hurry, you have the time to make an informed decision, but with G7 you need to make a decision 2. Talk to an urologist AND an oncologist and if you do not have confidence in them find another. You need input from both sides. Good luck Not to be an alarmist, but with a G3+4 involving at 95%, and another G4+3 on the other side, in my opinion you should start treatment as soon as possible (which if you decide on surgery is about 6 weeks after the biopsy). If I were you, I'd schedule the surgery with an EXPERIENCED surgeon, and then explore other options. You can always cancel the surgery if you decide on something else. And if you decide to go through with the surgery you'll have not had any delay in treatment. I'm also not quite sure what the benefit of a second opinion on the slides would be in this case... You already know you need treatment..... I assume the Drs will be asking you to have scans run to ensure that everything is localized to your prostate, which by every indication seems to be (cross fingers). Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SeaCock I'm almost 12 weeks post op and last week did some light ab's and never felt a thing. I have been stretching them briefly for the last three weeks getting them ready to do some work. I started light lifting when the NP said it was ok...which was 4 weeks post op. Last week I started trying to back to my normal weights...lost 10lbs waiting to get back in the gym...still no legs yet...don't want to stress anything down below until the little man wakes up a little more... Interesting... When I started lifting again (circuit training), also about 12 weeks out, my abs and the area felt \"different\", and were the absolute last thing to come back. It took almost a year for me to feel that I could do normal ab work. Maybe it was the scar tissue, maybe I was just a bit hesitant to put stress anything down there. I don't see the scars anymore either, but then again they are covered with my gorilla hair...",

Not to scare you further (if that is possible), but wouldn't it be better to kill one or two cells of G9 lurking in the area surrounding the prostate rather than waiting until it spreads and then shows up on a PSA test? A google of \"G9, radiation post ddr\" does show that some Doctors seem to recommend radiation even for \"G9, PSA 0\". Get a second opinion, and good luck.",

And with a G8, you should not wait too long to decide on the treatment type. I think you should choose a good, very experienced surgeon and set a date. You need to wait 6-8 weeks after a biopsy anyway for surgery. Then research radiation specialists. If you decide to choose radiation, you can just cancel the surgery. If you decide on surgery, then it's already \"reserved\" for the earliest date possible (especially in light of several G7s and a G8 ). Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Steven72 Hi again. Just an interim update. I took two weeks of Cipro, and there has been only minor improvement in the diarrhea situation. Unfortunately my appointment with the urologist did not get scheduled until next week. December 20 is when my GP referred me - a long wait time, but she said he is an excellent urologist. I am having all new blood work and my PSA retest in a couple days. I'll provide another update after my urology appointment. Sometimes antibiotics kill the \"good\" bacteria in your stomach and cause diarrhea and other issues... Have you been eating plenty of yogurt and taking an acidophilus/probiotic supplement something like culturelle?",

I am having all new blood work and my PSA retest in a couple days. I'll provide another update after my urology appointment. Sometimes antibiotics kill the \"good\" bacteria in your stomach and cause diarrhea and other issues...

      "Content": "Originally Posted by loves I asked before surgery.. how often we would re test he said \" 3 months, 3 months , 6 months then yearly. ... I then asked what if the numbers come up? He then said we would start radiation before it hit 1 and it should knock out any remainder... but those questions were asked when we thought we were dealing with a 7 & small 8 .. My surgeon tested me at 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 3 months, 6 months and then yearly... it seems to be the preference of the surgeon. If I was in your situation, I would request, \"out of an abundance of caution\", if the testing could be done something like 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 3 months... etc. Perhaps say something like your\"quality of life\" increase if that schedule could be followed as, it would reduce your stress. I believe there is no guarantee that the PSA will be zero the first or second test, but it should steadily decrease... Finally (fingers crossed that it would not be necessary), if your surgeon still believes that salvage radiation would be the next treatment, perhaps you should interview and choose a radiation center/radiation oncologist now. That way if further treatment is needed (lets cross our toes as well that it would not be needed), your basically ready to jump on the treatment the same day. Good luck!",

Bone scan ..negative Wondering if we dodged a bullet or 2 My question is do you all think we are out of the clear or should I still be worried . Have followed this since he was diagnosed and this seems not to be very good to have a score such as a 9 . We have a appt for cath removal next monday and will have a sit down with him then but I have gone from complete excitment that it was all gone to air sucking omg when he said it was up graded to a 9 ....thoughts We all hope you dodged a bullet! You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by loves Husband, 61 years ~ Biopsy gleeson 7 & 8 right side only . Left side was clear . No symptoms this was caught on routine physical .. Just had Divinci last week now got results today from that upgraded to Gleeson 9 It was contained to prostate lymph glands clear, surgeon said everything was clear and free on edges . Bone scan ..negative Wondering if we dodged a bullet or 2 My question is do you all think we are out of the clear or should I still be worried . Have followed this since he was diagnosed and this seems not to be very good to have a score such as a 9 . We have a appt for cath removal next monday and will have a sit down with him then but I have gone from complete excitment that it was all gone to air sucking omg when he said it was up graded to a 9 ....thoughts We all hope you dodged a bullet! You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

Dr said it's possible he might Of missed other tumors or the tumor he found possibly just nicked it and could be more Than 1%. I will try and copy my pathologist report today. Anyone from Missouri know a good Dr for surgery? Agree, at your age with four young kids you should seek treatment. Most of us would recommend DaVinci rather than open surgery. I would suggest finding a good surgeon (400+ surgeries, perhaps at a major teaching hospital. and schedule the surgery (which will be 6-8 weeks after your biopsy). Then research radiation and other treatments (as well as undergo further tests if needed). You can always reschedule or cancel the surgery if necessary. But if you decide to go through with the surgery, your spot will be \"reserved\" for the earliest possible time and you will never second guess yourself about waiting an extra few weeks before having the surgery.

Wounds are healing well, he needs to go to the bathroom twice at night and pees quite a bit from what I can hear. Leaking at night is minimal. My question is about rehabbing the penis for erections. We do get a careful, hesitant response so that is hopeful. How often do we need to practice rehab (masturbation) in order to maintain progress? At this time it is just rehab, not desire. He is not taking any Cialis or Viagra. Hubby is upbeat and beside all this basically back to his old self. Thanks for your support. There's still a month or so of healing, so one needs to be very careful notto do any pulling or stretching... One thing I would add is to \"stock up\" on the cialis and viagra now each month, in case his friend gets \"stuck\" at 50% or 70% firmness and needs a bit extra push...",

You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by loves Husband, 61 years ~ Biopsy gleeson 7 & 8 right side only . Left side was clear . No symptoms this was caught on routine physical .. Just had Divinci last week now got results today from that upgraded to Gleeson 9 It was contained to prostate lymph glands clear, surgeon said everything was clear and free on edges . Bone scan ..negative Wondering if we dodged a bullet or 2 My question is do you all think we are out of the clear or should I still be worried . Have followed this since he was diagnosed and this seems not to be very good to have a score such as a 9 . We have a appt for cath removal next monday and will have a sit down with him then but I have gone from complete excitment that it was all gone to air sucking omg when he said it was up graded to a 9 ....thoughts We all hope you dodged a bullet! You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

I think I\u0092m going to insist on this test. If the biopsy is negative, then insist on having his PSA checked three or four months later. If it continues to rise, then ask for on a MRI-guided biopsy. Resist the urge to start taking any of those \"prostate health\" supplements, as you dont want to change the baseline already established. I hope he doesn't have to join our club, but the good news is that you guys are on top of it. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by loves Husband, 61 years ~ Biopsy gleeson 7 & 8 right side only . Left side was clear . No symptoms this was caught on routine physical .. Just had Divinci last week now got results today from that upgraded to Gleeson 9 It was contained to prostate lymph glands clear, surgeon said everything was clear and free on edges . Bone scan ..negative Wondering if we dodged a bullet or 2 My question is do you all think we are out of the clear or should I still be worried . Have followed this since he was diagnosed and this seems not to be very good to have a score such as a 9 . We have a appt for cath removal next monday and will have a sit down with him then but I have gone from complete excitment that it was all gone to air sucking omg when he said it was up graded to a 9 ....thoughts We all hope you dodged a bullet! You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

You may be a candidate for active survallence (AS). some people aren't \"wired\" for AS (for example, knowing that there's a chance the biopsy missed a higher grade of PCa). Others go on AS while realizing that probably will need treatment in the future but feel comfortable with active monitoring. If you decide on treatment, then given your age, most of us on this board would suggest DaVinci surgery.

Just had Divinci last week now got results today from that upgraded to Gleeson 9 It was contained to prostate lymph glands clear, surgeon said everything was clear and free on edges . Bone scan ..negative Wondering if we dodged a bullet or 2 My question is do you all think we are out of the clear or should I still be worried . Have followed this since he was diagnosed and this seems not to be very good to have a score such as a 9 . We have a appt for cath removal next monday and will have a sit down with him then but I have gone from complete excitment that it was all gone to air sucking omg when he said it was up graded to a 9 ....thoughts We all hope you dodged a bullet! You know the saying, \"hope for the best, but prepare for the worst\".... If I were in your shoes, I would discuss with the doctor that you want to be as aggressive as possible with post-op PSA testing, scans, etc (every six weeks?) for as-early-as-possible detection of anything which may need further treatment. Also, have a complete plan already in place just in case your husband's PSA doesn't drop to zero (radiation?) . Good Luck!",

If you decide on treatment, then given your age, most of us on this board would suggest DaVinci surgery.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by loves I asked before surgery.. how often we would re test he said \" 3 months, 3 months , 6 months then yearly. ... I then asked what if the numbers come up? He then said we would start radiation before it hit 1 and it should knock out any remainder... but those questions were asked when we thought we were dealing with a 7 & small 8 .. My surgeon tested me at 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 3 months, 6 months and then yearly... it seems to be the preference of the surgeon. If I was in your situation, I would request, \"out of an abundance of caution\", if the testing could be done something like 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 3 months... etc. Perhaps say something like your\"quality of life\" increase if that schedule could be followed as, it would reduce your stress. I believe there is no guarantee that the PSA will be zero the first or second test, but it should steadily decrease... Finally (fingers crossed that it would not be necessary), if your surgeon still believes that salvage radiation would be the next treatment, perhaps you should interview and choose a radiation center/radiation oncologist now. That way if further treatment is needed (lets cross our toes as well that it would not be needed), your basically ready to jump on the treatment the same day. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bobkeenan Not sure why they did this but I could look at my MyChart this Sunday and there was my biopsy results. I got to see them before i can talk to the doctor. Out of 12 samples one had gleason of 3+4 with 60% of the cells. i think it was left base. And one of 4 (of the 12) samples from the transition zone with gleason 3+4 at 5%. All 10 of the others were benign. My PSA has gone from about 2.8, 8 years ago to 5.75 a few months ago. The last few years it had gone up about .75/ yr. I had a 12 sample biopsy about 3 years ago but it was all benign. My prostate is small, smooth, and no irregularities. Except for having to pee at night once in a while I have no symptoms. I am 64. So..... Hopefully I can talk or see the urologist tomorrow. In the meantime..... 1. Does this sound like early stage? 2. Will the Doc likely want to run more tests? which ones? 3. what would be good questions for the first visit? 4. Any good books or other reading material that I should be reading? Thanks for any help. Sorry to hear that you've joined our club. With those results, most would agree that you need treatment (surgery or radiation). I'm not sure of your stats (such as age), but many of us (not all) have opted for DaVinci surgery. I was given a choice of a second opinion to see if my Gleason score could be downgraded to a 3+3, but I decided against it, as someone saw some Gleason-4 cells there, and therefore I felt I needed treatment. I also scheduled my surgery while deciding if I wanted to have surgery or radiation treatment. That way my place was \"reserved\" for the surgery in case I decided to go ahead with the surgery knowing that I could always cancel if I decided to go ahead with radiation treatments. Read Dr Patrick Walsh's book \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", and consult with a radiation oncologist and also a surgeon to learn all of the pros and cons of each treatment. Experience is the most important - pick someone with at least 300 surgeries. Hopefully you will keep in touch and become a member of the \"zero club\" soon. Good Luck",

You may be a candidate for active survallence (AS). some people aren't \"wired\" for AS (for example, knowing that there's a chance the biopsy missed a higher grade of PCa). Others go on AS while realizing that probably will need treatment in the future but feel comfortable with active monitoring. If you decide on treatment, then given your age, most of us on this board would suggest DaVinci surgery. (But remember, there's no right or wrong answer). good luck on your journey, you're among friends who know what you are going through.",

      "Content": "Going back to what Otago said... If I were in your shoes (err had your prostate), and were considering AS, I would consider this course of action: - having slides read again to make sure there is agreement that it's a 6 - discussing with your Dr having a \"saturation\" biopsy in 3 (or 4) months or so. If the saturation biopsy is still a 6, then in my eyes there would be a strong case for AS.... Regarding Testosterone... Your Dr mentioned that after 6 months of radiation, it's possible that you could go back on it. Is the six months true for other forms of treatment such as surgery? Would one type of treatment would give you a \"better\" changes of resuming the Testosterone over another? Is that something for you to consider? Again, none of us are medical professionals, and by now you can see that everyone has their own very strong opinions... But we all have been down this road, and wish you the best.",

Surgery cannot happen until about six weeks after the biopsy. Then research radiation.... If you decide on surgery, your spot is already \"reserved\" and you'll never second guess yourselves for any delay. If you decide on radiation, then you can simply cancel the surgery. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind ddayglo, it sounds like your doctor is assuming the reduction in PSA level is due to \"masking\" and is not due to a reduction in cancer activity..I wonder how he is able to determine that difference..Medical doctors have a bad habit of rejecting anything you can buy in a health food store as bunco. But if THEY had been diagnosed with terminal cancer, I bet they would not be so quick to reject natural or off-patent treatments and drugs...The drug industry is not interested in anything they can not get a patent on and proclaim to their stock-holders they have discovered a new billion dollar a year drug... I think you may be right... I believe he only ordered the second biopsy after my PSA continued to rise, and did not want me to start something which may lower my PSA, or \"mask\" a rise in my PSA which would cause him not to order a second biopsy.",

      "Content": "Read and memorize the \"AS\" sticky. If I had your prostate, err, were in your shoes I would do all of the tests in the AS sticky and then have followup PSA tests every four months (if your insurance allows it). That way if your PSA does increase, you've caught it two months earlier. I would also decide on a treatment plan now, as opposed to waiting for a positive result. That way if you have to switch off of AS, you can start immediately. I believe DaVinci surgery may be a bit stressful for your heart but Open could be an option as well as focal HIFU or radiation.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Frenchy One of the lucky one percenters to be diagnosed early. Just turned fifty. No symptoms. Just did the required tests, Colonoscopy (they removed 9 polyps (good decision this was)), and biopsy as a result of the elevated PSA, 21.7; 7 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7, one 3+4, and another 4+3, the rest not as high, all on the left side, prostate normal size at 25cc. With 7 out of 12 cores positive (I guess five are G6, one G4+3, and one G3+4), you should ask your Dr about having an MRI(?) to be sure it hasn't spread. I also wouldn't wait to long to make a decision.... Pick an experienced surgeon and schedule the surgery (you need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy to have surgery) while also researching proton and other treatments (and make sure that treatment is covered by your insurance). If you decide on surgery, you'll have it at the earliest possible moment and never have to second guess yourself about waiting. If you decide on proton or other treatment, then you can simply cancel the surgery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Frenchy One of the lucky one percenters to be diagnosed early. Just turned fifty. No symptoms. Just did the required tests, Colonoscopy (they removed 9 polyps (good decision this was)), and biopsy as a result of the elevated PSA, 21.7; 7 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7, one 3+4, and another 4+3, the rest not as high, all on the left side, prostate normal size at 25cc. With 7 out of 12 cores positive (I guess five are G6, one G4+3, and one G3+4), you should ask your Dr about having an MRI(?) to be sure it hasn't spread. I also wouldn't wait to long to make a decision.... Pick an experienced surgeon and schedule the surgery (you need to wait about six weeks after the biopsy to have surgery) while also researching proton and other treatments (and make sure that treatment is covered by your insurance). If you decide on surgery, you'll have it at the earliest possible moment and never have to second guess yourself about waiting. If you decide on proton or other treatment, then you can simply cancel the surgery.",

      "Content": "A sad welcome to our \"club\". While AS certainly seems like an option, Chuck's question about the your kidney situation is spot-on. IMO you need to go through the \"what-if\" scenarios. (I don't know much about kidney treatment and a possible transplant, so please excuse me if I'm off-base). For example: If your husband's number is called and he has the transplant, would that change his PCa treatment options? If your husband's number is called in the middle or radiation or seed therapy, can he still have the transplant? Regarding surgery, I believe my Dr said that I needed to check with him for three months if any other medical condition came up. How soon after the surgery would he be able to have a transplant? Good luck!",

      "Content": "I believe in your case with one core at 85%, and a PSA >10, you aren't a candidate for AS and need treatment no matter what, even if you had several labs agree you were a G6. When I was diagnosed with 3+4, one Dr suggested I get a second opinion and if the G7 was downgraded to a G6, then I could consider holding off one treatment and go on AS. I decided against it, as in my mind, I would have needed both labs to agree I was a G6 before going on AS (in my mind, a \"solid G6\"). So my suggestion would be to start researching treatment and not bother with a second opinion, since with your age and stats I don't think anyone would consider you a candidate for AS. Most of us, especially at our age, lean towards Robotic surgery. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

If they are on the outer edge of the prostate, or at the Apex, that is something to consider before deciding on \"active surveillance\"..... And, if positive core is by the bladder neck, that could be a data point to be considered as part of the radiation-vs-surgery decision. (I hope I got this right) Would really be interesting for everyone to ask their urologist/radiologist about this...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

      "Content": "Did the Dr also tell you to have yogurt or acidophilus along with the Antibiotic? While Antibiotics kill bacteria-based germs, it also kills some of the good stuff in your body and stomach so many Drs tell you to have a lot of foods with \"active cultures\" like yogurt and acidophilus. Even though you are off of the Bactrim, continue having yogurt several times a day along with something like \"culturelle\" which has lots of active cultures. Prednisone is a type of steroid (not the type that athletes use)... It prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It also suppresses the immune system. I'm prescribed it when I have a nasty sinus infection... I remember peeing more often when on it, and a search on the internet shows that some people complain that prednisone will cause more frequent urination, so that may be related to what you are going through. Are you on a \"medrol\" pack, which means you take one less pill each day for six days? If so, a day or two after you are off the prednisone you should begin to get back to normal. Have you contacted your surgeon? Another search of \"Dr Google\" shows that prednisone can affect PSA level, which you'll be tested for regularly post-surgery... So your surgeon needs to know ASAP about the predisone in case he wants to move back any testing by a week or two while the prednisone gets out of your system. (to be clear, I'm not questioning the need for prednisone, it sounds like you really needed it). Also, as Chuck says, asking your pharmacist would also be a good idea. Lets hope this is your only pothole in your road to recovery. Goo luck",

What I have so far is based on posts I've read here, input from my local support group, and Walsh's book. Would love feedback/additional suggestions if anyone has a moment! In your opinion, difference between robotic/open/laparoscopic -- pros/cons? Are you familiar with Patrick Walsh's book and what is your opinion of it? Number of surgeries performed: Total, per year, last year and type (open, larapro, robot)? How many surgeries does the hospital do per month/year? Patient mix in terms of stage and how many in my stage (T1C)? What are your clear margin rates per stage? % of your patients who have regained continence? % of your patients who have overcome ED? How do you reconstruct the urinary sphincter? I've read about a \"Rocco stitch\"? Who assists you in surgery? What days do you do surgery and how many do you schedule on one day? If I decide to go with an out-of-state surgeon, will you coordinate with him as my local specialist? Great list! Once it is finalized, it would be great to add it to DaVinci sticky post so others may benefit as well... Otago's points are very valid.... I'll have a tiny squirt when lifting a 40-50 lb bag of pellets or rock salt. My Dr defines that as \"continent\". Others say one pad per day. Maybe ask how many surgeries actually performed (not just observe) Maybe ask about the Dr's philosophy on Kegels? How soon to start Viagra?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Leob I asked him what about doing a saturation biopsy. He explained that the current 12 core biopsy samples 1/1000 of the prostate, so even if I would take 120 samples this would be statistically insignificant and increase very slightly the chances of identifying PCa therefore it is not worth running to have an additional biopsy so fast. I am aware that apart from doing a standard biopsy the only way to confirm PCa is to do a biopsy on the prostate after removing it, so I am asking myself if the chances of discovering PCa through a standard biopsy are so low why do it at all ?? I will probably at this point not ask for a 2nd opinion, just do the 2nd PSA test, don\u2019t really know if having the PCA3 would be beneficial? Any suggestions remarks would be appreciated? Thanking you all for all the answers and support I received up to now.!! Leo After my first biopsy was negative, I went for another PSA test, which was higher. That's when my Urologist recommended a second biopsy. I'm not sure I understand the logic of the Saturation Biopsy.... For example, wouldn't 24 cores double the chance of finding something?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lukasnyc Hi My fathers PSA from last year went from 4.5 to 5.2 . He had his 12 point biopsy done and today came back positive for pc. I dont know yet his number for sure but I believe he mentioned 7. His doctor send him for bone and lymph node scan. He is 64 years young. I'm also upset because previous doctor he went to when he was 4.5 told him not to worry and didn't order any fallow up tests. He never had any symptoms. Im just worried and scared. We are in NYC and I know that are few great surgeons that you guys recommend. Any help, advice will be highly appreciated. Im 37 now and I guess I have to make an appointment and get myself check too - is that a good idea ? Sorry that your father joined our \"club\" and we hope you never do. Your internist should be able to take your PSA as well as perform a \"DRE\" annually. You'll have a good baseline at a minimum for yourself. As far as your father goes, the more stats the better - the number of \"positive\" cores, the percent involvement, Grade (which sounds like either a G3+4 or a G4+3), etc. But with a G7, your father needs treatment and it is probably a choice between radiation and surgery. I'm sure others will also contribute. Dr Walsh has a book called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" - it's a must read. NYC has some of the best Doctors in the world; the more experience the better. Good Luck and we hope your father will soon join the \"Zero Club\" and also hope that you'll never be a member!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Leob I asked him what about doing a saturation biopsy. He explained that the current 12 core biopsy samples 1/1000 of the prostate, so even if I would take 120 samples this would be statistically insignificant and increase very slightly the chances of identifying PCa therefore it is not worth running to have an additional biopsy so fast. I am aware that apart from doing a standard biopsy the only way to confirm PCa is to do a biopsy on the prostate after removing it, so I am asking myself if the chances of discovering PCa through a standard biopsy are so low why do it at all ?? I will probably at this point not ask for a 2nd opinion, just do the 2nd PSA test, don\u2019t really know if having the PCA3 would be beneficial? Any suggestions remarks would be appreciated? Thanking you all for all the answers and support I received up to now.!! Leo After my first biopsy was negative, I went for another PSA test, which was higher. That's when my Urologist recommended a second biopsy. I'm not sure I understand the logic of the Saturation Biopsy.... For example, wouldn't 24 cores double the chance of finding something?",

Please find out what kind of treatment (hormone therapy?) can be started immediately to stop the PC from from spreading either outside the Prostate if it is localized or any further if it has. That could give you some time and \"breathing room\" to choose a major center-of-excellence knowing that you've \"frozen\" the PC from spreading further and tackling this head-on. I'm sure others will more experience will add their recommendations.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by regress I'm putting together questions for my local Uro. What I have so far is based on posts I've read here, input from my local support group, and Walsh's book. Would love feedback/additional suggestions if anyone has a moment! In your opinion, difference between robotic/open/laparoscopic -- pros/cons? Are you familiar with Patrick Walsh's book and what is your opinion of it? Number of surgeries performed: Total, per year, last year and type (open, larapro, robot)? How many surgeries does the hospital do per month/year? Patient mix in terms of stage and how many in my stage (T1C)? What are your clear margin rates per stage? % of your patients who have regained continence? % of your patients who have overcome ED? How do you reconstruct the urinary sphincter? I've read about a \"Rocco stitch\"? Who assists you in surgery? What days do you do surgery and how many do you schedule on one day? If I decide to go with an out-of-state surgeon, will you coordinate with him as my local specialist? Great list! Once it is finalized, it would be great to add it to DaVinci sticky post so others may benefit as well... Otago's points are very valid.... I'll have a tiny squirt when lifting a 40-50 lb bag of pellets or rock salt. My Dr defines that as \"continent\". Others say one pad per day. Maybe ask how many surgeries actually performed (not just observe) Maybe ask about the Dr's philosophy on Kegels? How soon to start Viagra?",

Ask him to be retested in three months and then again after another three months. Tell him that while it may not be logical, tell him that if you do this your level of anxiety will decrease and QUALITY OF LIFE will increase. Then after those tests are zero, your Dr will recommend annual PSA testing. Don't. Be tested every six months. I did this my scheduling my annual physical and annual surgical visit six months apart (and insisting that the PSA be tested). Knowing that I am being tested TWICE AS OFTEN as what is recommended significantly decreased my \"PSAnxiety\". You may have a problem with insurance although I haven't so far. When I told my internist how much it decreased my stress, he liked the idea so much that he's recommending it to all of his patients.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster22 From what I have read, it is difficult to get up from a sitting or lying position after DaVinci surgery. I remember how sore my abdomen was in this regard, when recovering from umbilical hernia surgery years back. I am doing DaVinci surgery on August 3rd. and strongly suspect much worse soreness abdominal pain compared to the hernia recovery. I am thinking of using snow ski poles to help hoist myself out of a chair, or up from a bed. I have practiced this a few times with the ski poles, and the strain on the abdomen is much reduced when using your shoulder muscles to pull yourself up. Has anyone tried this, or similar after DaVinci?? I have given some thought about sleeping on a recliner as suggested on this forum, but with my wife is recovering from knee replacement surgery, and she will be unable to move the recliner from the reclined position to regular upright chair position. So, don't think a recliner is the way to go. I am thinking our bed is better choice, and using the poles to help get up. Any thoughts or suggestions?? Rooster2 While I was sore like I did 1,000 situps, for me, it wasn't the soreness, it was a complete lack of strength in my abdominal area. Chairs were not a problem for me. I'm not sure how the poles would help with a recliner (they may work in a regular bed)",

      "Content": "I am Originally Posted by ourtime I don't have any questions, answers, or words of wisdom, just need a little support. I posted here a month ago or so. My husband at that time was a Gleason 5+3=8. Right: 4 cores of 6 positive, 25% involved by tumor. Left: 3 cores of 6 positive, 2.0% involved by tumor. Prostate size 75 grams.. Bone scan and CT were negative. Da Vinci surgery on Nov 23. Final Path; 1) Left peripheral margin, biopsy; positive 2)Apical margin, positive 3) Posterior apical margin, negative 4) Left peripheral margin, negative, 5) apical margin, negative 6) prostate gland, Adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+5=9. Tumor quantification; right and left lobes, percentage of prostate involved by tumor 80% Extraprostatic extension: present. Seminal vesicle invasion: present, right and left Margins: Focally positive for malignancy (apical, bladder neck, anterior lateral) 7)Right lateral biopsy: negative Lymph nodes, (4) right pelvic, 1 node positive (3.8 MM) 9)Lymph nodes, (7) left pelvic, 4 nodes positive (largest focus 10MM) Prostate size 82 grams. Pathologic staging: pT3b pN1 We are in for a battle! We have not made a plan written in stone just yet. We will wait for husband's body to heal and for a 3 month PSA to really develop the plan. Dr said with this path. report, he doubts that his PSA will be 0 in three months. He will more then likely will be starting ADT. Words of encouragement needed! With G9 and positive margins, I'm not sure why your Dr wants to wait 3 months for ADT and other treatment. Maybe I'm mistaken, but it doesn't seen aggressive enough - I would think the this needs to be attacked this head-on with both barrels and carpet bombed... I would seek a second opinion ASAP.

In the meantime, decide on a surgeon as quickly as possible and schedule the surgery (make sure the surgeon has 300+ or 400+ surgeries). Then research radiation treatment. The surgery needs to scheduled 6-8 weeks after the biopsy. And many times there is a waiting list for surgery. If you or your Drs decide that radiation is best, then you can simply cancel the surgery. Otherwise, you have the \"reservation\" for surgery already set at the earliest possible time and you will never have to second guess yourself worrying that you had to delay the surgery by a few weeks.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 if psa is undetectable, perform a genetic test on the prostatectomy sample - if score is high, this would lead to more caution by proceeding immediately with AR. If score is low, we could monitor closely. If psa is detectable - all bets are off and most likely looking at Early Salvage treatment. Steve Sounds like a good course of action, with the caveat that if the genetic score is low and the PSA is undetectable, monitor with follow up with six-week PSA tests for at least a year if not longer... Good Luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 if psa is undetectable, perform a genetic test on the prostatectomy sample - if score is high, this would lead to more caution by proceeding immediately with AR. If score is low, we could monitor closely. If psa is detectable - all bets are off and most likely looking at Early Salvage treatment. Steve Sounds like a good course of action, with the caveat that if the genetic score is low and the PSA is undetectable, monitor with follow up with six-week PSA tests for at least a year if not longer... Good Luck",

      "Content": "All excellent advise, especially the scans to see if anything has spread. In the meantime, decide on a surgeon as quickly as possible and schedule the surgery (make sure the surgeon has 300+ or 400+ surgeries). Then research radiation treatment. The surgery needs to scheduled 6-8 weeks after the biopsy. And many times there is a waiting list for surgery. If you or your Drs decide that radiation is best, then you can simply cancel the surgery. Otherwise, you have the \"reservation\" for surgery already set at the earliest possible time and you will never have to second guess yourself worrying that you had to delay the surgery by a few weeks.

Ask him to be retested in three months and then again after another three months. Tell him that while it may not be logical, tell him that if you do this your level of anxiety will decrease and QUALITY OF LIFE will increase. Then after those tests are zero, your Dr will recommend annual PSA testing. Don't. Be tested every six months. I did this my scheduling my annual physical and annual surgical visit six months apart (and insisting that the PSA be tested). Knowing that I am being tested TWICE AS OFTEN as what is recommended significantly decreased my \"PSAnxiety\". You may have a problem with insurance although I haven't so far. When I told my internist how much it decreased my stress, he liked the idea so much that he's recommending it to all of his patients.",

I believe one course of action would be hormone therapy, basically to stop the G9 in its tracks from spreading, while additional tests and an aggressive treatment is planned out. There are some posters here who have been diagnosed with G9 several if not many years ago and I'm sure will post as well. Good Luck and get rid of this Dr and find one ASAP who will treat this with the urgency it deserves. Good",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 if psa is undetectable, perform a genetic test on the prostatectomy sample - if score is high, this would lead to more caution by proceeding immediately with AR. If score is low, we could monitor closely. If psa is detectable - all bets are off and most likely looking at Early Salvage treatment. Steve Sounds like a good course of action, with the caveat that if the genetic score is low and the PSA is undetectable, monitor with follow up with six-week PSA tests for at least a year if not longer...

I believe one course of action would be hormone therapy, basically to stop the G9 in its tracks from spreading, while additional tests and an aggressive treatment is planned out. There are some posters here who have been diagnosed with G9 several if not many years ago and I'm sure will post as well. Good Luck and get rid of this Dr and find one ASAP who will treat this with the urgency it deserves. Good",

      "Content": "Sorry your husband had to join our \"club\". Read all of the stickies, they contain a wealth of information. At your husband's age, most of us would lean towards surgery..... Most would also recommend robotic (DaVinci) surgery as well. I thought about sending my slides out as well but decided against it. Even the slides were downgraded to a G3+3, someone had \"seen\" some G4 cells in there. Therefore I decided not to send my slides out and AS was off the table for me -- it would have taken two different labs to both agree on G6 before I would consider AS. I picked a good, experienced DaVinci surgeon, chose a surgery date, and then researched radiation alternatives. That way, my \"spot\" was reserved if I decided to go through with the surgery. If not, I could simply cancel the surgery and switch to alternative treatment and I would never have to second guess any delay in treatment. I went through with the surgery and it turned out I had G4+G3 instead of G3+G4. But so far all if good as it was caught early. One thing I would do immediately is order viagra or cialis in order to \"stock up\" as insurance usually doesn't cover more than a few a month. And have your husband start kegels now. You guys got this. No reason to panic, just make a decision and don't look back.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear your news. I assume he had a positive biopsy. Can you get a copy of the results and post it here? Will he advocate for himself at the Dr and find out as much as he can about treatment options or does he need someone to be there for him? Don't take it wrong, but many guys would feel shy about discussing prostate cancer with anyone, especially a female and very especially to their daughter. If there is someone he does listed to, then the best thing to do is have that person \"take point\" with your dad (maybe your mom?) . What you can do is research the best surgeons and radiologists in the area who are affiliated with a world-class hospital. Maybe find two or three very good experienced ones and then let himchoose which one to go to (that way he feels like he has some choice, you know us guys)... My gut feeling is that if the PC is still located within his prostate and since he's in good health then DaVinci surgery, with a good, experienced surgeon (400+ surgery's) could be an option (e.g. a CURE). But you'll have to await the results of the scans. In the meantime, there's a good book by Dr Patrick Walsh, you can order it on Amazon with express shipping. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Another thing is not to allow a doctor to perform a digital rectal exam before having a PSA test. It will temporarily elevate the number. In the 48-72 hours before having a PSA test, do NOT have: a DRE, sex, ride a bike, perform vigorous exercise. All of those things, including anything else that can place stress on the prostate, can put a temporary spike in the PSA. Good luck -- and welcome to the forum. We hope you're just \"passing through.\" LOL Chuck Interestingly, for a PCA3 test, you want to do those things! One Doc gave me a DRE right before he drew blood CORRECTION: I GAVE URINE for the PCA3 test. Then again, he's the one who said I could go on AS even with G3+4 since it was only in one core...",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear your news. I assume he had a positive biopsy. Can you get a copy of the results and post it here? Will he advocate for himself at the Dr and find out as much as he can about treatment options or does he need someone to be there for him? Don't take it wrong, but many guys would feel shy about discussing prostate cancer with anyone, especially a female and very especially to their daughter. If there is someone he does listed to, then the best thing to do is have that person \"take point\" with your dad (maybe your mom?) . What you can do is research the best surgeons and radiologists in the area who are affiliated with a world-class hospital. Maybe find two or three very good experienced ones and then let himchoose which one to go to (that way he feels like he has some choice, you know us guys)... My gut feeling is that if the PC is still located within his prostate and since he's in good health then DaVinci surgery, with a good, experienced surgeon (400+ surgery's) could be an option (e.g. a CURE). But you'll have to await the results of the scans. In the meantime, there's a good book by Dr Patrick Walsh, you can order it on Amazon with express shipping. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Sorry your husband had to join our \"club\". Read all of the stickies, they contain a wealth of information. At your husband's age, most of us would lean towards surgery..... Most would also recommend robotic (DaVinci) surgery as well. I thought about sending my slides out as well but decided against it. Even the slides were downgraded to a G3+3, someone had \"seen\" some G4 cells in there. Therefore I decided not to send my slides out and AS was off the table for me -- it would have taken two different labs to both agree on G6 before I would consider AS. I picked a good, experienced DaVinci surgeon, chose a surgery date, and then researched radiation alternatives. That way, my \"spot\" was reserved if I decided to go through with the surgery. If not, I could simply cancel the surgery and switch to alternative treatment and I would never have to second guess any delay in treatment. I went through with the surgery and it turned out I had G4+G3 instead of G3+G4. But so far all if good as it was caught early. One thing I would do immediately is order viagra or cialis in order to \"stock up\" as insurance usually doesn't cover more than a few a month. And have your husband start kegels now. You guys got this. No reason to panic, just make a decision and don't look back.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH If it were me, and my initial Gleason estimate was Gleason 7, and a second opinion gave a Gleason 6, I would consider it a jump ball and seek a THIRD opinion to break the tie. In other words, I'd be wondering WHICH one was the correct assessment, so the best 2 out of 3 would come into play. I my case, my biopsy had one core at G3+4 and one Dr highly recommended I get a second opinion, and if it was downgraded to a G6, then go on AS. I decided against it, as someone who was trained \"saw\" some G4 cells, and I would have needed TWO different labs both agreeing that I was a G6 before considering AS (and see my final stats, I was not a good candidate for AS) Pratoman - I agree that there is value in knowing the \"real deal\", but that's just the deal for whatever tissue was sampled (since something like 20% of higher grade PC's is missed. In your case, the G3+5 was \"strange\", and a second opinion was a good idea. I guess I'm seeing a lot of posts here suggesting a second opinion, which for some of the \"PC Newbies\" is causing some additional stress because of either resistance or delay from the biopsy center to sending the slides... It would be sad if sending the slides out causes any kind of delay in treatment.... I'm not sure I see the value in a second opinion for ALL biopsies.",

My first check was 0.3 and my DRE was normal. A year later my PSA was 0.6 and my DRE was normal. I am now 52, and just had my most recent check. My PSA is now 3.4. I did have a colonoscopy on Jan 12 and my PSA test was on Jan 28. I see my GP next week. I will likely head to the urologist as well. Very worried, as expected. Just wondering if you might think the colonoscopy may be the cause of the raised PSA. I know it can have an effect, just not sure how much and for how long?

      "Content": "Sorry your husband had to join our \"club\". Read all of the stickies, they contain a wealth of information. At your husband's age, most of us would lean towards surgery..... Most would also recommend robotic (DaVinci) surgery as well. I thought about sending my slides out as well but decided against it. Even the slides were downgraded to a G3+3, someone had \"seen\" some G4 cells in there. Therefore I decided not to send my slides out and AS was off the table for me -- it would have taken two different labs to both agree on G6 before I would consider AS. I picked a good, experienced DaVinci surgeon, chose a surgery date, and then researched radiation alternatives. That way, my \"spot\" was reserved if I decided to go through with the surgery. If not, I could simply cancel the surgery and switch to alternative treatment and I would never have to second guess any delay in treatment. I went through with the surgery and it turned out I had G4+G3 instead of G3+G4. But so far all if good as it was caught early. One thing I would do immediately is order viagra or cialis in order to \"stock up\" as insurance usually doesn't cover more than a few a month. And have your husband start kegels now. You guys got this. No reason to panic, just make a decision and don't look back.",

As has been mentioned here dealing with the catheter will be the major post surgery issue. Will keep you all posted on the pathology report in two weeks. Fran Glad to hear it. My surgery was yesterday. Pain is what I expected but I'm still in bed. The worst thing so far is that somehow I got the hiccups which is not fun... have not spoken to the Dr yet but from what I hear no surprises. Some cute nurses here..",

      "Content": "A reluctant welcome to our \"club\". Adding some stats about your age and general help would be useful (we are full of advise!) Some may disagree with me, but I'm not sure having a second opinion on the biopsy is necessary as you do need treatment. When I couldn't decide the type of treatment, I decided to choose a surgeon and surgical method first and schedule it as soon as I could (which was for me about seven weeks after the biopsy). I then interviewed and researched radiation. If I decided on radiation, then all I had to do was cancel the surgery. But then if I went through with the surgery, my spot on line was already \"reserved\" and I didn't ever have to second guess myself about delaying my treatment because of indecision. In the meantime, read the stickies, stock up on Viagra, and know that we all were exactly in the same place you were and we're happy to share our own experiences with a new club member. Good luck",

      "Content": "At this and other forums, I've read good things about the following three pharmacies: www.northwestpharmacy.com, www.affordabledrugs.com, and www.alldaychemist.com. Being a paranoid IT security guy, I decided to test strength of their SSL encryption. (At the risk of oversimplifying, SSL encryption is used to encrypt communication between your browser and the remote web server. It's basically mandated by Visa, MC, etc when entering credit card info. I tested them using www.ssllabs.com (a free service). Here are the results... www.northwestpharmacy.com: Grade A: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/anal...stpharmacy.com www.alldaychemist.com Grade B: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/anal...hideResults=on www.affordabledrugs.com: Grade F: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/anal..._reg_step1.cfm I would not overgeneralize and say that affordabledrugs is not secure internally, but, personally, to me, a failing score for the SSL certificate does raise a red flag. (I'll contact them and see if they upgrade their certificate, which would be a good indication that they do care about their security) I would also suggest using a prepaid card when ordering from one of the pharmacies (and many other internet web sites for that matter). Update 9/5/2013: never heard back from affordabledrugs. Also, northwestpharmacy and affordabledrugs are listed as members of the Canadian International Pharmacy Association: http://www.cipa.com/member/northwestpharmacy.com http://www.cipa.com/member/affordabledrugs.com",

Having a wife 18 years younger than me used to be a thrilling thing. Good luck to you all, Dan Assuming you've tried Viagra without any luck, ask your Dr about Trimix. He may think it's a bit early for you to resort to injections, but its worth asking. According to the ED thread and especially this thread (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/46091-Trimix-update), we all agree the shot isn't that bad, and the results vary from really good to hanging-wet-towels-to-dry or hailing-a-cab amazing, and that we should have asked about it much much sooner.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Well, today I go for my one year PSA Blood draw, I have an appointment with the Surgeon on Friday, so that's the latest I'll have the results, but who knows maybe they post it online tomorrow. Today is also, Ironically, one year to the day that I went under the knife. I'll never forget sitting in that hospital waiting room for over an hour waiting for them to take me in. I'm particularly nervous about this one, I guess because it's the one year mark, so in my mind (assuming I still have a mind) it's a big one. Probably also a little PSTD, after my experience 3 months ago, when Quest mistakenly reported my 9 month PSA as 3.88 Keeping my fingers crossed. Yup, one year is a huge \"birthday\". After my one year \"zero\", my surgeon put me on an annual PSA schedule. I decided to tweak my schedule for my physical to make it six months later and then insist the PSA be drawn. That way even though I \"graduated\" to annual testing I'm actually having my PSA tested every six months (once by the surgeon and once by my internist as part of my physical). Doubling the recommended testing more than halved my \"PSAnxiety\". Anyway, after all you've been through you deserve a big fat ZERO and then a big fat glass of scotch to celebrate!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Well, today I go for my one year PSA Blood draw, I have an appointment with the Surgeon on Friday, so that's the latest I'll have the results, but who knows maybe they post it online tomorrow. Today is also, Ironically, one year to the day that I went under the knife. I'll never forget sitting in that hospital waiting room for over an hour waiting for them to take me in. I'm particularly nervous about this one, I guess because it's the one year mark, so in my mind (assuming I still have a mind) it's a big one. Probably also a little PSTD, after my experience 3 months ago, when Quest mistakenly reported my 9 month PSA as 3.88 Keeping my fingers crossed. Yup, one year is a huge \"birthday\". After my one year \"zero\", my surgeon put me on an annual PSA schedule. I decided to tweak my schedule for my physical to make it six months later and then insist the PSA be drawn. That way even though I \"graduated\" to annual testing I'm actually having my PSA tested every six months (once by the surgeon and once by my internist as part of my physical). Doubling the recommended testing more than halved my \"PSAnxiety\". Anyway, after all you've been through you deserve a big fat ZERO and then a big fat glass of scotch to celebrate!",

He said not to worry about it and it would go away, so that was good news. Even better news, my PSA was undetectable!!! That made my day. I'm in the zero club now!! Good news all around. Congrats!",

Having a wife 18 years younger than me used to be a thrilling thing. Good luck to you all, Dan Assuming you've tried Viagra without any luck, ask your Dr about Trimix. He may think it's a bit early for you to resort to injections, but its worth asking. According to the ED thread and especially this thread (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/46091-Trimix-update), we all agree the shot isn't that bad, and the results vary from really good to hanging-wet-towels-to-dry or hailing-a-cab amazing, and that we should have asked about it much much sooner.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Well, today I go for my one year PSA Blood draw, I have an appointment with the Surgeon on Friday, so that's the latest I'll have the results, but who knows maybe they post it online tomorrow. Today is also, Ironically, one year to the day that I went under the knife. I'll never forget sitting in that hospital waiting room for over an hour waiting for them to take me in. I'm particularly nervous about this one, I guess because it's the one year mark, so in my mind (assuming I still have a mind) it's a big one. Probably also a little PSTD, after my experience 3 months ago, when Quest mistakenly reported my 9 month PSA as 3.88 Keeping my fingers crossed. Yup, one year is a huge \"birthday\". After my one year \"zero\", my surgeon put me on an annual PSA schedule. I decided to tweak my schedule for my physical to make it six months later and then insist the PSA be drawn. That way even though I \"graduated\" to annual testing I'm actually having my PSA tested every six months (once by the surgeon and once by my internist as part of my physical). Doubling the recommended testing more than halved my \"PSAnxiety\". Anyway, after all you've been through you deserve a big fat ZERO and then a big fat glass of scotch to celebrate!",

Having a wife 18 years younger than me used to be a thrilling thing. Good luck to you all, Dan Assuming you've tried Viagra without any luck, ask your Dr about Trimix. He may think it's a bit early for you to resort to injections, but its worth asking. According to the ED thread and especially this thread (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/46091-Trimix-update), we all agree the shot isn't that bad, and the results vary from really good to hanging-wet-towels-to-dry or hailing-a-cab amazing, and that we should have asked about it much much sooner.",

This support group is excellent and I thank you in advance for your help.

If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't ask for it. Am I overreacting? It's my understanding that the Grade Group system is pretty new.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PaulG Thought I'd introduce myself. I'm 53 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer just five days ago, so I'm just starting to learn about all this. (I'm reading the Dr. Walsh book now.) Based on what I know so far, it was caught early and I'm in a low-risk category. I've got a Gleason score of 6 (3+3) and a PSA of just 0.6 ng/mL. Nothing unusual was felt with DRE. My cancer was caught only because I had a 10-month history of hematospermia (blood in semen). No other symptoms. They assumed prostatitis, but when antibiotics did nothing and the bleeding continued, a new urologist suggested a biopsy to rule out anything serious. Imagine my surprise. I will meet with my urologist again in two weeks to discuss treatment options in more detail, and I am seeing a different urologist for a second opinion soon after that. (Also, awaiting lab results on whether PTEN is absent.) My initial reaction is that prostatectomy seems best, given my age and life expectancy (dad lived to 87). But I'm keeping an open mind, and I'd welcome any suggestions. One question: I'll ask the doctors about the number of RPs they've done, rates of complications, how much incontinence their patents reported 3, 6, 12 month out, etc. (Q's that Dr. Walsh's book suggests.) Is there any resource that compiles that sort of information and makes it publicly available? One problem is that the more experienced surgeons take on the harder cases, so their results may look \"worse\" than other surgeons. But a surgeon at a center of excellence from a teaching hospital with over 400 surgeries would be a good start! Also, ask the surgeons about whether or not hematospermia is a potential complication for RP, and also how they define being \"dry\" (some call it one pad a day, some say zero pads. This thread and the DaVinci sticky also have some questions to ask your surgeon. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PaulG Thought I'd introduce myself. I'm 53 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer just five days ago, so I'm just starting to learn about all this. (I'm reading the Dr. Walsh book now.) Based on what I know so far, it was caught early and I'm in a low-risk category. I've got a Gleason score of 6 (3+3) and a PSA of just 0.6 ng/mL. Nothing unusual was felt with DRE. My cancer was caught only because I had a 10-month history of hematospermia (blood in semen). No other symptoms. They assumed prostatitis, but when antibiotics did nothing and the bleeding continued, a new urologist suggested a biopsy to rule out anything serious. Imagine my surprise. I will meet with my urologist again in two weeks to discuss treatment options in more detail, and I am seeing a different urologist for a second opinion soon after that. (Also, awaiting lab results on whether PTEN is absent.) My initial reaction is that prostatectomy seems best, given my age and life expectancy (dad lived to 87). But I'm keeping an open mind, and I'd welcome any suggestions. One question: I'll ask the doctors about the number of RPs they've done, rates of complications, how much incontinence their patents reported 3, 6, 12 month out, etc. (Q's that Dr. Walsh's book suggests.) Is there any resource that compiles that sort of information and makes it publicly available? One problem is that the more experienced surgeons take on the harder cases, so their results may look \"worse\" than other surgeons. But a surgeon at a center of excellence from a teaching hospital with over 400 surgeries would be a good start! Also, ask the surgeons about whether or not hematospermia is a potential complication for RP, and also how they define being \"dry\" (some call it one pad a day, some say zero pads. This thread and the DaVinci sticky also have some questions to ask your surgeon. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PaulG Thought I'd introduce myself. I'm 53 and was diagnosed with prostate cancer just five days ago, so I'm just starting to learn about all this. (I'm reading the Dr. Walsh book now.) Based on what I know so far, it was caught early and I'm in a low-risk category. I've got a Gleason score of 6 (3+3) and a PSA of just 0.6 ng/mL. Nothing unusual was felt with DRE. My cancer was caught only because I had a 10-month history of hematospermia (blood in semen). No other symptoms. They assumed prostatitis, but when antibiotics did nothing and the bleeding continued, a new urologist suggested a biopsy to rule out anything serious. Imagine my surprise. I will meet with my urologist again in two weeks to discuss treatment options in more detail, and I am seeing a different urologist for a second opinion soon after that. (Also, awaiting lab results on whether PTEN is absent.) My initial reaction is that prostatectomy seems best, given my age and life expectancy (dad lived to 87). But I'm keeping an open mind, and I'd welcome any suggestions. One question: I'll ask the doctors about the number of RPs they've done, rates of complications, how much incontinence their patents reported 3, 6, 12 month out, etc. (Q's that Dr. Walsh's book suggests.) Is there any resource that compiles that sort of information and makes it publicly available? One problem is that the more experienced surgeons take on the harder cases, so their results may look \"worse\" than other surgeons. But a surgeon at a center of excellence from a teaching hospital with over 400 surgeries would be a good start! Also, ask the surgeons about whether or not hematospermia is a potential complication for RP, and also how they define being \"dry\" (some call it one pad a day, some say zero pads. This thread and the DaVinci sticky also have some questions to ask your surgeon. Good Luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mitchden Two days ago, I learned that I have prostate cancer. My urologist gave me some literature to review and I will be meeting with him next week to discuss the treatment alternatives. This support group is excellent and I thank you in advance for your help. With regard to the pathology report, I asked my doctor if I should get a second opinion on the pathology and he said it's up to me. He told me the pathologist who read the slides is excellent. The core sample from the right lateral apex is \"prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 7 (3+4) (Grade Group 1 of 5), involving one of two fragments, less than 5% of the tissue\". The new prostate cancer group grading system (see below) says Grade Group 1 is for a Gleason score of 6. My Gleason score is 7 (3+4) and I think it should be a Grade Group 2, not Grade Group 1 - as the pathology report states. If the pathologist is wrong, do you think I should question his overall diagnosis and tell my doctor that I want another pathologist to review the slides? If it wasn't for this, I probably wouldn't ask for it. Am I overreacting? It's my understanding that the Grade Group system is pretty new. The new grading system is: Grade Group 1 (Gleason score 6) Only individual, discrete, well-formed glands Grade Group 2 (Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7) Predominantly well-formed glands with a lesser component of poorly formed/fused/ cribriform glands Grade Group 3 (Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7) Predominantly poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands with a lesser component of wellformed glands Grade Group 4 (Gleason score Only poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands or Predominantly well-formed glands with a lesser component lacking glands or Predominantly lacking glands with a lesser component of well-formed glands Grade Group 5 (Gleason scores 9\u009610) Lacks gland formation/necrosis with or without poorly formed/fused/cribriform glands A second opinion on the slides is never a bad idea. Sorry you had you had to join our \"club\". The good news is that with one core G3+4 at <5% you don't have to rush into treatment.",

      "Content": "Even his PSA is now zero, while it sounds aggressive, attacking what little PC which may may have been left behind does sound reasonable. The PC in your dad's body is on the ropes. Something like 99% of it was been removed. The radiation would make sure it it stays at 100% gone. Not sure about going into a \"full court press\" and adding HT - I'm sure others will add their experiences. Posting a copy of the full report would be useful. For example, G7 could be G3+4, which means it was mostly G3, the \"better\" kind of PC. Good Luck!",

      "Sample": "I ended up doing the surgery, which is what most Doctors will recommend for someone our age. Read the stickies about the different treatments, do your own research, and chose what you feel is best for you....You can add to your signature some details (number of positive cores, location of the positives, % involvement, Gleason 3+4 or 4+3, etc). As you will soon find out, surgeons tend to recommend surgery and radiologists tend to recommend seeds or other types of radiation....Some doctors don't advise surgery after the age of 70 or 75. Sorry you had to join our group....I would suggest finding a good surgeon (400+ surgeries, perhaps at a major teaching hospital. and schedule the surgery (which will be 6-8 weeks after your biopsy)....Assuming that the rest of your scans are OK, then most of us would suggest surgery as well, as you could always have followup \"salvage\" radiation but having surgery after radiation is much more difficult. Read the stickies and put up a book by Dr Walsh caled \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\"....Most of the time, Drs will recommend treatment based on their area of speciality.... surgeons will recommend surgery and radiation specialists will recommend radiation....For me at least, deciding on a treatment course was more stressful than actually finding out I had PCa. Radiation specialists will tend to recommend radiation and surgeons will tend to recommend surgery.......As you will soon find out, surgeons tend to recommend surgery and radiologists tend to recommend seeds or other types of radiation. To my case, deciding upon a treatment course was almost as stressful as the initial diagnosis....Most of us would recommend DaVinci rather than open surgery. I would suggest finding a good surgeon (400+ surgeries, perhaps at a major teaching hospital....As you are deciding on surgery vs radiation, then I suggest doing it in this order: 1) find a good, experienced surgeon with 400+ surgeries. 2)immediately book the surgery (which will be about 6-8 weeks after the biopsy)....Radiation specialists will tend to recommend radiation and surgeons will tend to recommend surgery.... For your age group, many doctors (and us here) will lean towards surgery but my no means is that etched in stone....Agree with most posters - unless the treatment will change if one or more cores was upgraded to G7 or G8, then having a second opinion is optional since you need treatment. As you are deciding on surgery vs radiation, then I suggest doing it in this order: 1) find a good, experienced surgeon with 400+ surgeries....Originally Posted by fxoptions I received my result the other day and my Dr told me the following 12/15 samples positive - Gleason 7= 3+4 positive in following Samples: right base 70%, right lateral base 15%,right mid 85%, right lateral mid 100%, right apex 50%, right lateral apex 15%, left lateral base 35%, left mid 5%, left apex 40%, apical nodule 40% Multiple cores (3) PNI (Perineural Invasion present) in 4 cores. my age is 55 Before Biopsy CT showed nodule on apex of prostate (this is why I went to urologist) DRE positive PSA 2.5 was 1.5 10 months ago I will going back to DR soon, I guess he may suggest surgery, what I am concerned about is the PNI in four cores and the nodule....If I decided on another treatment, then all I would have to do is cancel the surgery. I ended up doing the surgery, which is what most Doctors will recommend for someone our age....This thread (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...ns-for-Surgeon) and the surgery sticky has some advise on how to choose a surgeon....Originally Posted by Michael F Also, in high risk post RP patients, some Medical Oncologists will recommend a short course of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) commencing soon after surgery and prior to the start of AR....Decided to have DaVinci, turns out I had 4+3 and more widespread than the biopsy suggested. Definitely get that second opinion, and research whether a \"saturation biopsy\" would give you and your Dr additional data for your decision....Originally Posted by Michael F Also, in high risk post RP patients, some Medical Oncologists will recommend a short course of Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) commencing soon after surgery and prior to the start of AR. Certainly discuss this with your expert MDs....At age 57, many Drs and people here would recommend surgery.... if additional treatment is needed, it's \"easier\" to have \"salvage\" radiation after surgery than the other way around. I would suggest scheduling the surgery (there needs to be about six weeks after a biopsy before surgery)....All excellent advise, especially the scans to see if anything has spread. In the meantime, decide on a surgeon as quickly as possible and schedule the surgery (make sure the surgeon has 300+ or 400+ surgeries)....Other may suggest seeds or other treatments. But at your age, I believe most doctors would lean towards surgery....Was there a nodule on the prostate? Some doctors don't advise surgery after the age of 70 or 75....At age 57, many Drs and people here would recommend surgery.... if additional treatment is needed, it's \"easier\" to have \"salvage\" radiation after surgery than the other way around....This thread (http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...ns-for-Surgeon) and the surgery sticky has some advise on how to choose a surgeon. A reluctant welcome to our \"club\"...Turns out after surgery I was a G4+3 and my surgeon and GP use me as a textbook case to seek active treatment if there's anything beyond a G3 living in a prostate. IF you decide to go on AS, then I suggest you get every test you can which are listed in the AS sticky and have a strict \"threshold\" to get off AS and seek active treatment (most of us would argue that you are already past that threshold)....my age is 55 Before Biopsy CT showed nodule on apex of prostate (this is why I went to urologist) DRE positive PSA 2.5 was 1.5 10 months ago I will going back to DR soon, I guess he may suggest surgery, what I am concerned about is the PNI in four cores and the nodule. I have read this may show aggression, I will be sending my slide to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion soon, any advise on surgery that may help , open vs robotic?...He did have any \"spasms\" up till now...is it normal to start 6 days after surgery? If the pain is that severe, then I strongly recommend a Dr visit....Most of the time, Drs will recommend treatment based on their area of speciality.... surgeons will recommend surgery and radiation specialists will recommend radiation. Sort of surprised AS was not presented as an option....",
