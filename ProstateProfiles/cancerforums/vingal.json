I'm 59 yo. My PSA was reported to me as .9 on a 4.0 scale, which confuses me because I haven't seen PSA reported like that anywhere else. At any rate, my doctor says it is low. The Gleason score is 7 (4+3); stage 1, bordering on 2. The core with cancer was not taken from the area of the nodule or the area identified on the MRI. My doctor is Badar Mian MD. He is trained in robotic surgery. Everything I can find on him seems to be very positive. When I see him on 2/27, I'll ask him questions like how many robotic surgeries has he performed, success rate re incontinence, ED, etc. He discussed all options, radiation, seeds, AS, but was definitely recommending surgery. I'd like to get a second opinion. Any suggestions on how to find an expert in the Albany, NY area? The first thing I did was to order Dr. Walsh's book. Thanks for that suggestion. I'm well into it and learning a lot.",
