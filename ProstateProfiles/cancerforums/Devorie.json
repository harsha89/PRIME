      "Content": "Hello everyone, my father has just been diagnosed with Gleason scale stage 9 prostate cancer. This seems to be a very aggressive and quickly growing form. The doctor wants to jump directly into outside radiation and seed implantation. Like all men, my father is very concerned with both his bladder function and sexual function after these treatments. From what I have read, outside radiation is the most likely to cause sexual, bladder, and potentially bowel disfunction. It seems that the prostatectomy might be a better option, but this whole subject is new to me. I was wondering if those of you who have been through this journey have any opinions or recommendations on radiation vs prostatectomy? Also his doctor seems to think he will be able to get radiation before work daily. His job is labor intensive and I have my doubts that this will be an option. For any of you that had outside radiation, were you able to continue working daily? Thank you so much in advance for your advice ❤️",
