      "Content": "Hello, folks. First post here -- I'm happy to have this opportunity to discuss my situation. A biopsy in September detected a low level of cancer in my prostate. On the graduated scale of life, I guess I'm lucky -- only one core of 10 turned up any cancer, and that core had only 5% involvement. My now-former urologist seemed to be pushing me toward surgery, or at least it seemed so at the time. At any rate, I got a second opinion from a radiation oncologist, and she recommended \"active surveillance\" -- a PSA test every three months and another biopsy in a year. I won't deny it -- she told me what I wanted to hear. It is the strategy I will pursue for now. I had the biopsy in the first place based soley on my PSA, which was climbing. It was under 2 in 2010, then 2.54 in early 2012 and 2.82 in August. I just had a fourth PSA on Monday, and it came back at 2.33. Needless to say, I was elated that it hadn't continued trending upward. At this point I'm looking for another urologist. Perhaps I'm being unfair to the original guy, but he just didn't inspire confidence. I'm going to check out a physicians group of urology specialists in my area (southern Wisconsin) next week. My hope is that I can find a physician who will support my decision to delay treatment while monitoring the condition closely. Has anybody got any ideas what qualities I should look for in my search? I should mention that I'm nearly 59, with no documented history of PC in the family. Thanks very much.",

      "Content": "I appreciate the response! JohnT, I will definitely look up Scholz's book. I plan to be religious on my surveillance. Lancepeace, I'll look into the diet recommendations from Ornish and Smith. LL, My Gleason was indeed a 6. I hadn't asked about free PSA, but I will. Thatbiopsy, I hear where you're coming from. I have a good friend who was diagnosed before he was 50, and he required salvage radiation therapy because the cancer had escaped. He reminds me that I don't want it to get that far. But therapeutic methods are advancing, so even if I require more aggressive therapy in the future, perhaps there's something out there worth waiting for. You guys are great. I appreciate your kindness and your insight.",
