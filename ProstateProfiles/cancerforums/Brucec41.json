However, the timing of action(s) will ultimately be determined by your URO MD. Questions & Suggestions: - Was the blood drawn for PSA taken before or after the DRE? - Wait for the results of the Select MDX test. Be sure that your MD fully understands and can explain these results. - If not already done, ask your URO MD about repeating the PSA test in about 8 weeks and to request a PSA test that measures both PSAfree and PSAbound fractions. - If & when biopsy is indicated, follow SubDenis' suggestion and ask about a \"multiparametric MRI and fusion biopsy.\" There may be a problem with insurance reimbursement. The MRI can detect most areas of suspicion and the spacial locations programmed so that the TRUS biopsy can be \"guided\" to any hot spots. Try to relax and not panic.
