      "Content": "Met with oncologist this morning to discuss radiation treatment. Going in I was already leaning toward surgery, and the urologist warned me that each doc would lean toward his/her own specialty. Not surprising that he was recommending hormone + radiation treatment. His compelling argument is that the PSA is so high, and the biopsy showed one side was all positive, so he feels the likelihood of the cancer already at the surface and possibly beyond is very high. So, he thinks radiation would very likely be needed after surgery. Haven't met with the surgeon yet, so it will be interesting to see if he feels he can get it all with the surgery. I'm pretty square on the fence now, not leaning on way or the other. Does it make sense to get the PSA retested since the extremely high reading seems to be weighing heavily on the prognosis?",
