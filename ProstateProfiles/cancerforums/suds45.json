      "Content": "what are the highest psa numbers that you have heard of with out complications? looking back at my numbers over the years,starting at 6.9 down to 5.0 and then recently ging up to 14.2 over a period of 6 years. i'm reading that they recommend to refrain from sex or masturbation 48 hrs. before the test. not one of my doctors mentioned that at all to me(and i didn't know) until i just read about it and the test. no back pain (except when i shave) what so ever in anyting that i do,my weight has been steady for years now (17 i bowl twice a week with no pain in my back, i go to the bathroom steady like clock work everymorning at @7..... could it be the results of having sex the night before my testing or just an enlarged prostate through life? thanks",
