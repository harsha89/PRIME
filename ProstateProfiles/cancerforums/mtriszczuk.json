    "Content": "As a result of the DRE during my annual physical of Aug 2011, my Dr said he felt a lump and sent me to a Urologist for another opinion. The Urologist concurred and had me come back for a biopsy. My PSA readings for the previous decade ranged from .9 to 1.4 at the time of the biopsy. Of the thirteen biopsy samples taken two came back positive. Results: (5% left apex) (20% left lateral) (Gleeson3+3) (T2a) The Urologist then said, \"You're young enough for surgery and old enough for radiation, choose one.\" ( I was 59 at the time) It was nearly three months between my annual physical and the biopsy which gave me plenty of time to read and study about treatment options. I returned to my Dr and asked him to refer me to another Urologist. The new Urologist had the time to answer all of my questions and concerns and we agreed he would do the robotic surgery for me. He performed an ultra-sound prostate exam to gather more information about my condition. After the surgery I spent two nights in the hospital and then went home with a catheter in place. I returned to the hospital a week later for an X-ray to check for leaks and then the catheter was removed. Other than when the nurse removed the abdominal drain tube, I never had much pain before or after the surgery. I have been extremely fortunate, my continence is the same as before surgery and erections are nearly the same as before surgery. If my bladder is full and I bend over, lift something heavy, or cough I will feel a drip, but during everyday normal living I have no incontinence issues. The Urologist/surgeon prescribed 100 mg Viagra to keep the blood flowing; and I took the pills for a few months but finally could not handle the blurry/distorted vision and the plugged nose/sinuses any longer. I now take a 20 mg Cialis once or twice a month and feel so very fortunate to have the same erections as before surgery. My PSA readings have been <.01 for over two years. I would conclude with the advice \"Get a DRE, just because you have a low PSA doesn't mean you may not have PCa.",
