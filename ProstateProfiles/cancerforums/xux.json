      "Content": "Hi there, I'm new to this forum so please bear with me. My dad had his routine checkup in May and his PSA number was 1.4. He has never had any prostate related issues. Couple weeks ago he started to have the frequent urges to urinate. He went to see his doctor. Given his PSA level was normal 3 months, the doctor gave him the medication to treat BPH but ordered PSA test anyway. The PSA result came back yesterday and it is shockingly at 67. He has an appointment with a urologist next week. But the wait is killing us. Is it normal for PSA to rise that fast? Thanks.",
