      "Content": "I hope with the following feedback to ease some of you who are new to this new PSA circuit. (I am the wife, by the way ). My toughest time was when my hubby of 34 years, who I love more than anything in the world, came home after a routine blood test, saying that his PSA levels were 12. Month later it was 16 and that he needed a biopsy at one point. So we started researching in panic mode. I was overwhelmed, afraid to lose him soon, to spend the rest of my life as a widow. I started envying old couples as they at least made it to old age together. We were afraid. I was ready to give up a new puppy, even. We decided on watchful waiting with the urologists consent, and in the meantime consulted with a Chinese herbalist. After a few months of herbs his PSA level was 15 and we were elated. Next month it was 22, biopsy showed low to moderate form of cancer (genetically tested). Hubby numb and me in panic mode and stressed to the max. Few weeks later robotic surgery. It is now 10 days post-op and he is doing amazingly well. Cancer contained, nerves spared, lymph nodes clear. We are very happy and relaxed together, he was super healthy to begin with (beside the PC). Looking back we were way too afraid because we didn't know enough. Most of you have time on their hands and the stigma of this surgery should be lifted. My hubby was convinced that he would come back as an old guy but he is actually feeling great, despite the leaking during the day and 99% impotence (the 1% is hopeful!). We have bonded even more than ever before. Looking back, I think the Chinese herbs were a form of denial. Now I think, if they detect cancer, get rid of it. For us it has been a great decision to opt for the robotics and I am confident about a long and happy future with my sweetie. By the way, I kept the pup, which was actually a great distraction in the days of misery. I hope this helps if you are afraid of the future if you have been newly diagnosed. Take charge of your health, your life is worth it. For us, the unknown has been the scariest part of all. Our happy days resumed the moment we saw each other after surgery. Good luck to all of you and to everyone on this forum, who has been so helpful. It has made such a difference.",

Do you use tighter underwear? He is insecure about trying the thin ones. Next: with Cialis we are able to have \"floppy\" intercourse for a minute or so once in a while, which I am excited about but for him it is just \"OK\" or \"yes, it does feel good\". Is that normal after about 3 months post-op? Will it ever get super exciting, like it was pre-op, for a guy after surgery?

Nerves preserved and functions basically intact (no incontinence anymore). PSA was 0.02 for several months after surgery. Blood test every three months so far. It fluctuated from 0.02 - 0.03. And between 0.03 and 0.04 as time went on. Yesterday it was 0.05. His doc, who we regard as a very good and pleasant surgeon, doesn't seem to worry until it hits the 0.1 mark. Hubby took up cross-fit 2 years ago, consistently 3 x a week and looks and feels healthy. Any takes on this PSA info? Take care.",

      "Content": "Hi all. It's been a while and I sincerely hope that everyone is doing and coping well. My husband had Davinci surgery almost three years ago (Jan. 2016). Nerves preserved and functions basically intact (no incontinence anymore). PSA was 0.02 for several months after surgery. Blood test every three months so far. It fluctuated from 0.02 - 0.03. And between 0.03 and 0.04 as time went on. Yesterday it was 0.05. His doc, who we regard as a very good and pleasant surgeon, doesn't seem to worry until it hits the 0.1 mark. Hubby took up cross-fit 2 years ago, consistently 3 x a week and looks and feels healthy. Any takes on this PSA info? Take care.",

But during the day there is no progress after the initial improvements of the first two weeks post op. My thoughts are that he needs to be confident and patient that it will get better over time but it is weighing on him now, incl the ED. He worked with a small chainsaw this weekend and I wonder how smart that was.....He just needed to get out after 6 weeks. What can you all tell me to tell him?",

      "Content": "My husband had Davinci surgery 15 months ago. Now, no longer incontinent (no more pads!), even during cross fit, and semi firm erections. A cock ring helps with the rest. He doesn't use Viagra or Cialis but his surgeon prescribed Citruline, that is the only thing he takes. Question:his PSA levels have been tested every three months and the last three one have been 0.01, 0.02 and 0.03,. So the line is going up. His doc is not worried but keep monitoring it every three months. What is your take on this? of course we don't like that line going up.",
