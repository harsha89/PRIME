However, while the MRI can detect areas of interest for a biopsy, it cannot, at this time, classify the grade of cancer. For example, I have a PIRADS 4 lesion. Sounds serious, right? But, it is almost all HGPIN, with less than 5 percent G3+3 cancer. FIVE biopsies to prove that! So, just keep going slow and accumulate the pathology data and knowledge that you need. You may want to add your birth year to your signature. Good luck.[/QUOTE I think this is to rule out immediate surgery. I will add DOB. He even mentioned an MRI biopsy if anything shows.

Now for the right side he said 80% chance of being a high grade cancer and it was a Pyrade 4 ( spelling error I am sure) so he asked me either take it Out of fusion biopsy on right side. I picked the biopsy so I have to wait till Nov 1 to get me in. I do have a copy of the MRI if anymore information you guys want may help in advice. I assume the lesion cannot be benign?

      "Content": "[QUOTE=ASAdvocate;315953]Gunrun, I'm glad to hear that you changed doctors. Recommending surgery for a one percent G3+4 seems very drastic and unnecessary. However, while the MRI can detect areas of interest for a biopsy, it cannot, at this time, classify the grade of cancer. For example, I have a PIRADS 4 lesion. Sounds serious, right? But, it is almost all HGPIN, with less than 5 percent G3+3 cancer. FIVE biopsies to prove that! So, just keep going slow and accumulate the pathology data and knowledge that you need. You may want to add your birth year to your signature. Good luck.[/QUOTE I think this is to rule out immediate surgery. I will add DOB. He even mentioned an MRI biopsy if anything shows. I like this guy a lot better than the other let's take it out guy.",

My pathology was similar to yours, and PSA remains undetectable three years out. As he was excising my prostate he noticed it was leaking urine, which is odd to say the least. Turns out my left kidney has two ureters, one of which had attached itself to the prostate rather than the bladder. So he \"simply\" made an opening in the bladder and stitched it in place. So I got to spend two night rather than one. It's a big practice, but Thrasher's THE guy.",
