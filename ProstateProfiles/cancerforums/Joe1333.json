      "Content": "Hey, I'm 22 years old and recently went to my GP after suffering problems. I have started urinate much more frequently than usual. It is especially bad when I go out and drink alcohol, I can be going every 30 mins if I'm constantly drinking. I get weird pains and sensations in my penis every now and then. I don't get up in the middle of the night to pee (something my GP asked). There is no blood in my pee either, although sometimes it burns a little. More often the day after a night out. I saw my GP and she suggested I do a urine sample. I did it and the tests came back clear. I'm not sure what the urine sample tested (around 10 things she said). I'm obviously going to see my GP again. What do you think? Thanks",
