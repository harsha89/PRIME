Well, I'm somewhat embarrassed to say, I don't know as much about all the details, as most of the other guys on here. Part of my ignorance, is due to the fact that I use VA healthcare, and my records are never easy to get... I'll try a rough draft- age 48 psa 7 4+3 T2c My treatment plan started with gold fiducial marker implants, then 5 weeks of \"prophylactic\" high dose, double arc external beam radiation that also covered the area around the prostate. I then got 2 weeks of rest, followed by low dose brachytherapy which means 81 radioactive nuggets were implanted in my prostate on March 19 2015. My urologist advised me against having hormone therapy, saying that the added benefit is small, and side effects are many. My oncologist said it was an option I could consider, but also agreed that my treatment plan had a good chance of a cure without the hormone therapy. So, I decided against it-",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Sounds like this was external beam treatments followed by inserting the radioactive seeds? Sounds like a pretty good plan of action. Does this complete your primary treatment? Yes sir... In a cruel twist of fate, my next door neighbor (who was an influence on my treatment decision) had his PCa treated with radiation 10 years ago with a low, steady psa ever since... Well, he just told me yesterday his psa shot up to 24 and has to start hormone therapy right away... His doctor told him that his psa test 6 months prior of 4 must have been a mistake... And a fellow legionnaire at my post only got 5 years out of his EBRT, but on the bright side, said he's doing ok on the new hormone shot he's getting. Now I guess it's all about dealing with side effects, and wait to see how long my psa says low.",
