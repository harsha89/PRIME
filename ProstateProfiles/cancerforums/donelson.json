      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Donelson, when dealing with prostate cancer, there is no such thing as \"normal\"....Every case is different. Have you read Dr. Walsh's book? I would be questioning your surgeon about whether surgery is the most appropriate, effective treatment at this point..It may very well be that surgery + radiation + hormone treatment is your best course of treatment, your best shot at a cure, but it also subjects you to the heaviest possible side-effect load....Have you consulted with a Radiation Oncologist and Medical Oncologist and heard their opinions on how you should proceed? Thanks very much. Yes, talked with both surgeon and radiation oncologist. My feeling is that my prostate and seminal vesicles are a reservoir of cancerous cells, any of which may decide at some point to mutate into metastasis. If all those cells are removed from me, then I am not at risk from them after removal. After discussion they both agreed. I also have a friend in the UK who was diagnosed almost identically to me (everyone is different yes) and had both surgery and radiation and is doing well without serious side effects, other than the usual short term mostly. What I am worried about is the jump in my PSA while on Casodex...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Donelson, when dealing with prostate cancer, there is no such thing as \"normal\"....Every case is different. Have you read Dr. Walsh's book? I would be questioning your surgeon about whether surgery is the most appropriate, effective treatment at this point..It may very well be that surgery + radiation + hormone treatment is your best course of treatment, your best shot at a cure, but it also subjects you to the heaviest possible side-effect load....Have you consulted with a Radiation Oncologist and Medical Oncologist and heard their opinions on how you should proceed? Thanks very much. Yes, talked with both surgeon and radiation oncologist. My feeling is that my prostate and seminal vesicles are a reservoir of cancerous cells, any of which may decide at some point to mutate into metastasis. If all those cells are removed from me, then I am not at risk from them after removal. After discussion they both agreed. I also have a friend in the UK who was diagnosed almost identically to me (everyone is different yes) and had both surgery and radiation and is doing well without serious side effects, other than the usual short term mostly. What I am worried about is the jump in my PSA while on Casodex...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH ... Gleason score has been reduced from 9 to 7... Thanks very much, Chuck. It is a 4+3 Gleason, and a great relief from the 5+4 I had before, although all 12 samples had 12mm of cancer tissue in them. I am classed as T3bN0M0 right now. Dr Chris Ogden will be doing the surgery (1,300 or so DaVinci ops) - very very skilled and bright. I very much enjoyed talking to him about \"theory\". He is interested in a study of prostatectomy PLUS radiation for advanced cases, but such a study would take time to organise. He was happy with the Choline F-18 scan, and will remove the lot. Then mop up with radiation sometime after. Waiting until August does make me a bit nervous. I have read that sometimes, some small number of men don't respond to Casodex, so I will ask for a test of testosterone levels in a month or so. Right now I can still get erections etc. Good luck to you, Chuck, and thanks again for your support. William",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter You did not mentioned if your doctor ruled out prostatitis or inflammation? PSA could spike due to infection. Did your doctor give you an antibiotic treatment after the high PSA to rule it out? No, but that is a good idea, and a hope. Thanks! Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Good point newporter, William, I am also wondering about your previous urination problem. Did the doctor, after performing a DRE, ever say that your prostate was enlarged? This is a classic reason for having some urination troubles. The key here is that an enlarged prostate pushes up the PSA reading because PSA is generated by prostate tissue. Hence, the more prostate tissue (as with enlargement), the higher the PSA. Although your PSA is pretty high at 33, at least some of this could be attributed to an enlargement. Also, if you rode a bike, had sex within that 48-72 hour period before the PSA test, it must might be enough to boost it to 33. So it could be that a case of BPH, combined with the aforementioned activity within 2-3 days prior to the blood test, could account for the PSA. Your PSA of around 4 in your early 50s was also a bit high, so it very likely was an enlargement that the green laser was used to treat. It kind of all connects and hopefully means there is no prostate cancer present. Also, a PSA over 20 does not necessarily mean the cancer (if any) has spread. If you have a biopsy soon, the situation will hopefully be made clearer. Regarding a biopsy, if possible try to make sure that it is with a highly experienced urologist who has done many of them in the past. Also you would want to ensure that the urologist uses a numbing jell before inserting the probe and then injects a local anesthetic before taking the samples. Makes for a pain-free experience. Good luck! Chuck As regards DRE, I have had a few, and none have shown lumps or other problems. \"Some enlargment\" in 2004 when I was having trouble urinating. The laser surgery fixed that in August of 2005 and although my flow is reduced from that, it has not been reduced to discomfort, or getting up in the night more than once. And I have increased liquid intake (choc milk mostly, boy inside here. And can't have cranberry juice anymore due to kidney stones troubles ) As regards biopsy; thanks for the advice, and for the hope. Question: --> Will the MRI show the cancer nodules etc? Can it miss those? W",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Sorry you have to wait several weeks for the MRI results. In the states, it usually takes only a few days. Take care, Chuck Thanks, Chuck. Your interest and support means a lot to me. 60 years old now. 1. The MRI scans were ready in 20 mins, etc etc, but the Urologist had to delay my appointment by a week. For these tests, they allow 2 weeks for an appointment for the doc to review the results, and to have a 2nd opinion, oncologist etc etc. Not keen on waiting 3 weeks though. 2. DRE- yes, he did one in Feb. 3. I had no sex for more than 24 hours before last PSA test. I was aware of that. Not 48 though. I was told it might bump the results up a few points, but certainly not to 33. 4. I had a PSA about 18 months ago (?) and it was 4. Eight years ago it was 3.7 then back to 3.2 when I was 52. The urologist noted this was a bit high for my age then 52. 5. I do ride my bike as well, but not for long rides this winter much. Maybe 5-10 mins at most. 6. No biopsy yet. 7. I don't really have urination problems now, but it's not quite as free flowing as it was after the green light laser hole drilling in late 2004. 8. No blood, no pain, etc. I started serious insomnia pretty suddenly during the early autumn last year, not sure why. Also put on 25 lbs in 4-5 months, strange. I saw some reports that said 100% of PSA's over 20 were metastasised. Ugh, that's my main worry now. Again, thanks. William",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Sorry you have to wait several weeks for the MRI results. In the states, it usually takes only a few days. Take care, Chuck Thanks, Chuck. Your interest and support means a lot to me. 60 years old now. 1. The MRI scans were ready in 20 mins, etc etc, but the Urologist had to delay my appointment by a week. For these tests, they allow 2 weeks for an appointment for the doc to review the results, and to have a 2nd opinion, oncologist etc etc. Not keen on waiting 3 weeks though. 2. DRE- yes, he did one in Feb. 3. I had no sex for more than 24 hours before last PSA test. I was aware of that. Not 48 though. I was told it might bump the results up a few points, but certainly not to 33. 4. I had a PSA about 18 months ago (?) and it was 4. Eight years ago it was 3.7 then back to 3.2 when I was 52. The urologist noted this was a bit high for my age then 52. 5. I do ride my bike as well, but not for long rides this winter much. Maybe 5-10 mins at most. 6. No biopsy yet. 7. I don't really have urination problems now, but it's not quite as free flowing as it was after the green light laser hole drilling in late 2004. 8. No blood, no pain, etc. I started serious insomnia pretty suddenly during the early autumn last year, not sure why. Also put on 25 lbs in 4-5 months, strange. I saw some reports that said 100% of PSA's over 20 were metastasised. Ugh, that's my main worry now. Again, thanks. William",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter You did not mentioned if your doctor ruled out prostatitis or inflammation? PSA could spike due to infection. Did your doctor give you an antibiotic treatment after the high PSA to rule it out? No, but that is a good idea, and a hope. Thanks! Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Good point newporter, William, I am also wondering about your previous urination problem. Did the doctor, after performing a DRE, ever say that your prostate was enlarged? This is a classic reason for having some urination troubles. The key here is that an enlarged prostate pushes up the PSA reading because PSA is generated by prostate tissue. Hence, the more prostate tissue (as with enlargement), the higher the PSA. Although your PSA is pretty high at 33, at least some of this could be attributed to an enlargement. Also, if you rode a bike, had sex within that 48-72 hour period before the PSA test, it must might be enough to boost it to 33. So it could be that a case of BPH, combined with the aforementioned activity within 2-3 days prior to the blood test, could account for the PSA. Your PSA of around 4 in your early 50s was also a bit high, so it very likely was an enlargement that the green laser was used to treat. It kind of all connects and hopefully means there is no prostate cancer present. Also, a PSA over 20 does not necessarily mean the cancer (if any) has spread. If you have a biopsy soon, the situation will hopefully be made clearer. Regarding a biopsy, if possible try to make sure that it is with a highly experienced urologist who has done many of them in the past. Also you would want to ensure that the urologist uses a numbing jell before inserting the probe and then injects a local anesthetic before taking the samples. Makes for a pain-free experience. Good luck! Chuck As regards DRE, I have had a few, and none have shown lumps or other problems. \"Some enlargment\" in 2004 when I was having trouble urinating. The laser surgery fixed that in August of 2005 and although my flow is reduced from that, it has not been reduced to discomfort, or getting up in the night more than once. And I have increased liquid intake (choc milk mostly, boy inside here. And can't have cranberry juice anymore due to kidney stones troubles ) As regards biopsy; thanks for the advice, and for the hope. Question: --> Will the MRI show the cancer nodules etc? Can it miss those? W",

      "Content": "Hello all, and thank you. Yes, I am concerned about the high PSA. I guess I will have to wait until 2nd May to get some straight answers - I think the Urologist and Cancer Nurse are probably having trouble expressing their opinions, deferring to the higher skill/knowledge of the surgeons etc. With the high PSA and the Gleason 9, my feelings of being able to beat this for \"15 years\" are drastically reduced. I am in the UK, not sure about Sand Lake Imaging techniques... It seems that we should get the prostate removed in any case, to reduce the load if more metastasis occurs. I worry a bit about hormone deprivation, but only as it might affect my ability to work. For me, no work = no pay. Mostly I do programming, sitting in front of a computer, etc. Sometimes I need to go out into the field for a few days of photography. Since I am done with kids, and living is a bit higher score than having sex for me, I am willing to do whatever is available (radiation, seed, DaVinci, HDT) to extend my life as long as the quality/pain is not bad. Reading the internet and here, its hard for me to gain an idea of how long I probably can survive with reasonable quality.
