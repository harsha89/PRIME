In the four weeks that it took to get an appointment with the urologist and see him, this forum has proven to be an incredibly helpful resource. I'm sure that without the combined wisdom of all of you, I would've been a nervous wreck by now. My urologist even complimented me: \"You ask all the right questions\". So I'm all of you very thankful for that. What my biopsy, scheduled in March, will bring, I don't know, but what I do know is that whatever happens, I will be well prepared.

      "Content": "Hey Guys, Please allow me to introduce myself. I'm Hans, 57 years old, living in Los Angeles and I stumbled upon this forum about four weeks ago when my GP decided that my rising PSA granted some further investigation. In the four weeks that it took to get an appointment with the urologist and see him, this forum has proven to be an incredibly helpful resource. I'm sure that without the combined wisdom of all of you, I would've been a nervous wreck by now. My urologist even complimented me: \"You ask all the right questions\". So I'm all of you very thankful for that. What my biopsy, scheduled in March, will bring, I don't know, but what I do know is that whatever happens, I will be well prepared. Not looking forward to becoming a part of 'the club', but if it has to happen, it's a good group of people to be a part of. Hans",

      "Content": "While researching which treatment is best for me (I narrowed it down to RALP or SBRT, AS is not an option for me), I discovered that the general consensus is: if there's a biochemical recurrence after a radical prostatectomy, you can always fall back on salvage radiation. If your initial treatment is radiation therapy, you're kinda limiting your possibilities. It's not hard to see why that makes sense. Your prostate and surrounding tissues will change anatomy during radiation, so it must be really challenging after that to do a prostatectomy. You only have to watch a few videos on Youtube of a RALP procedure (I recommend Dr. Ahlering's procedure) to get a good understanding of how complicated the surgery is as is. Therefor it was very interesting to me to find the following paragraph from Memorial Sloan Kettering after reading a link that my urologist recommended I visited: Salvage Radical Prostatectomy Some men with localized prostate cancer choose radiation therapy for their initial treatment. However, a rising PSA level and a positive prostate biopsy after radiation therapy may indicate that your cancer hasn\u0092t been completely eliminated or that it has returned. Our surgeons are the world\u0092s most experienced in performing a procedure called salvage radical prostatectomy, which we do following radiation therapy. This procedure destroys the disease in a high proportion of men when the cancer is confined to the prostate or the tissues immediately surrounding it, and has been shown to eliminate prostate cancer for ten years or more. Salvage radical prostatectomy can be more difficult to perform than a radical prostatectomy that is done when the cancer is first diagnosed, before radiation therapy has been given. This is because of the effects of radiation on the prostate gland. Many hospitals do not offer this procedure because of its many technical challenges. I thought this may be helpfukl for people on the verge of making a decission about treatment.",
