      "Content": "My 68 year old husband was diagnosed about 2 years ago with a very rare and aggressive prostate cancer. They started him on a hormone shot in March of last year. In September when they did a bone scan it showed it has spread to his hip and his spine. He decided against radiation treatment. But he did decide to continue his hormone shot. He goes every 6 months for that. He's due to go back this month for another one. He simply will NOT tell me how he is feeling but he says He does say that he feels bloated and has had to go up one pants size. He looks very pale to me. He got very angry with me the last time we went to the dr and the dr said to be sure we told him if he has any tooth issues. I told the dr that he had just had a tooth removed. The dr didn't say anything more. What was the purpose if it didn't make any difference? He had to have another tooth removed 2 months ago and I told him he should contact his dr. He refused. I know you don't have a magic ball you can look into but can you give me your honest opinion about his prognosis. I can handle anything if I'm somewhat prepared but I feel like I'm flying blind here. The Drs won't even give us a stage the cancer is in but if it's spread to the bone with my research I'm guessing it's stage IV. just a little insight would be great.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for responding so quickly and I appreciate your honesty. Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Debby, We're so very sorry to learn what your husband is going through -- and yourself as well. Yes, as Rob noted, having mets in the bones means stage 4. At this stage, they no longer look to cure the patient and all efforts usually are geared to prolonging his life as long as possible, making him comfortable, keeping a normal life for as long as possible, etc. The general statistics say that a PC patient lives an average of 4 years after it has spread to the bones. However, this is just an average of thousands of patients. So, while some may live less than 4 years, it also means that many others lived much longer than 4 years. I'm hoping & praying that your husband can live far longer than the average span -- and with a good quality of life. I wish we could have better news for you, but that is the reality of it. But also remember that continuing treatment improvements and breakthroughs are also part of reality. So, as long as there is life, there is always hope -- especially in this modern age of medical miracles. Please stick around with us and feel free to ask any questions that come to mind -- even if you just need to have someone to talk with. We're always here for you! Chuck",
