      "Content": "Part 2 Day 4 (Friday): Urine in bag starts turning red. Disconcerting. I start thinking about calling the doctor's office. However, per post-op written instructions, this is normal to some degree. I monitor over the next three hours, and urine isn't nearly so red. Seems OK now. Another long walk at the local mall. Digestive system still isn't normal. Lots of rumbling/gurgling (output is very loose). I was told to take my incision tape off when I got home from the hospital and then place clean bandages over the incisions. Taking the originals off makes me nervous. However, one by one they came off - there are metal staples on the incision points. I replaced the bandages. Guess they will take the metal staples off on the 7-day follow-up appointment. Day 5 (Saturday): Digestive system still rumbling/gurgling (output still very loose). More walking at mall. Able to push a little during bowel movement. Energy level seems slow to recover. Day 6 (Sunday): Girlfriend has to fly back home to Texas, where she is currently living (long story). I will be by myself now. The drive back home is my first time driving since the operation. Driving is easy, but I move my butt around on the car seat a lot to be comfortable. The incision points are healing nicely. I can cough and sneeze without so much pain. There were four incision points for the robot, and a fifth for the JP drain. Urine in bag starts turning red again in the evening like it did in day 4. This occurred after I went grocery shopping by myself for the first time (which involved a lot of physical activity). The physical activity may have contributed to it. I watch TV on the couch for a couple of hours, and the red color starts to dissipate. Color goes back to normal over night. Today I noted various areas of the penis/testicles have turned blue from internal bruising. Not concerned, I already knew this was common. Day 7 (Monday): Continue my daily walk at the mall. Poop starts turning more solid and towards normal. I wonder if the antibiotics are partially responsible for the previously loose stools. Started taking probiotic supplements yesterday. Blood in urine again - this seems to happen everyday for a couple of hours - then clears up. Day 8 (Tuesday): Today is the 7-day follow up appointment at the surgeon's office. The metal staples were removed by a nurse. The catheter was removed by the physician's assistant. Her technique was to yank it out quickly (in about two seconds). Yea, it hurt, but was over quickly. She had me do deep breathing before she pulled it out. She told me the blood in the urine was OK - said the catheter/balloon rubs on the repair point where the urethra was reattached to the bladder. She said I could expect to see some blood in the urine going forward. When the catheter was removed, I put on a depends-type underwear that was given to me by the hospital just before I was discharged. Before leaving, I received about a ten minute lecture (each) on incontinence and ED. She said I shouldn't judge the incontinence issue by the first two days. She also said it would be worse in the evenings when the muscles are more tired. I was given a physician's release statement that allows me to go back to work on the 26th, the day after Christmas. This would be two weeks and two days after surgery. The first few days will only be half days (four hours). As an electronic technician, the physical nature of my job is the equivalent of light office work. I was the one who asked to be released back to work after two weeks. Day 9 (Wednesday). I have an appointment at the hospital with a staff dietician who knows a lot about anti-cancer diets. I want to hear what she has to say. The meeting went very well, about an hour talking about diet and nutrition. She gave me lots of handouts. My diet is already pretty good. There are a few things I need to incorporate into my diet going forward. Day 10 (Thursday): Well, there's not much to report. There is one thing I've noticed that I haven't read about here on the forum. My right leg is a bit less coordinated than it was before surgery. The right leg also fatigues much faster than the left - for no apparent reason. There is also a very sore muscle in the upper inner thigh that has no explanation, which makes me walk with a limp. I wonder if the surgery gets close to any nerve bundles that affect the legs? I will monitor going forward. Right now, I just assume this issue will resolve with time. I am looking forward to starting my Yoga practice back up next Monday with a 'gentle' Yoga class at my local studio. I am taking 2-3 naps during the day as the energy level is slow to return. For all I've read, this is typical. I am glad to get sugery behind me, and always felt surgery was the best option. Don't regret it for a second. =========================== Three-day incontinence report: Since it's been three days since catheter removal, I can now make some general comments on how this issue will affect me. In general, it appears I'm only affected by 'stress' incontinence. That is, I only leak when I reach/bend/move in just the right way - and I can feel the squirt. Other than that, there appears to be no leakage. I feel extremely lucky with this issue so far. I hope this can only improve. I do not leak at all during sleep. However, when the bladder fills during sleep, I'm woken up with sharp stabbing pains (I sense this is from the full bladder putting weight on the repair point). The stabbing pains go away after the bladder is emptied. This issue seems to be getting slightly better each day. I haven't been doing Kegels - although I may start. Finally, a note about the emotional impact of cancer diagnosis: I highly recommend a new experiential therapy I learned about 1.5 years ago called TRE (Trauma Releasing Exercises). This is a powerful tool for dealing with stress or any negative emotion. As a result of using TRE, I had virtually zero emotional impact from the time of PC diagnosis all the way through surgery and recovery. There was zero depression, and almost zero anxiety. I use this technique daily. TRE is a relatively new therapy that most people haven't heard of - an easy self-help technique that only takes the instructional DVD to learn. I can't recommend it enough. Developed by David Berceli, Google it for more info. I've had an interest in psychology since the seventies - and I've experimented with multiple methods for dealing with mental health issues (especially my own). TRE is by far the most powerful I've come across.",

      "Content": "Diagnostic history in signature. Note, this in part 1 (part 2 in reply), I couldn't post the entire journal in one post (ran up against character limit) Day 1 (Tuesday): Da Vinci surgery at 11:00am with Bruce Lowe in Portland Oregon (1600+ Da Vinci surgeries). In the surgery waiting area, I meet the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and some type of surgical nurse before being pushed into the surgery room. Once in the surgery room, I remember seeing the Da Vinci in a corner, then I was out. Don't remember anything about the recovery room. When they brought me to my hospital room around 5:00pm, I was at a '7' in pain. They gave me some pain medication then asked me what the pain level was. Told them it was still a '7'. They must have given me something to sleep, as I woke up much later in the evening and the pain was gone. Didn't get out of bed that first night because I was hooked up to too many things (1) oxygen via nose cannula (2) infusion pump (3) catheter (4) leg pump (5) JP drain Day 2 (Wednesday): Don't you just love being woken up at 4:15am for vitals? Stomach is very bloated and distended. A rather uncomfortable feeling. This is more uncomfortable than the incision pain. I'm on a liquid diet, can't have solids until I pass gas. Broth, Jello and juice get old really fast. Oxygen tube (cannula) removed by nurse. Leg pump removed/turned off. I can now get out of bed and start walking down the hall with fusion pump and catheter bag on a roll cart. I start this walking routine about every hour. I keep passing another man about my age doing the same walk. I keep wondering if he also had the same surgery. I get lots of walking in the 1st full day in the hospital (not much else to do anyway). The catheter does not bother me as much as I thought. The surgeon drops by and tells me \"everything looked good\". He did not visually see anything on the margins and no visual indication the cancer had spread. He said my results were the best he had seen in a while. He removed ten lymph nodes - which he apparently does routinely whether it looks like the cancer has spread or not. Later I would learn he routinely removes 5-15 lymph nodes, not sure what the criteria is for the specific numbers. Finally passed some gas. Day 3 (Thursday): Rudely awakened at 4:30am for vitals. My last day at the hospital. I was originally told I would in the hospital two nights (accurate). Finally get some solid food (eggs and toast). Yum, never thought such a simple breakfast would taste so good. Surgeon drops by and has the pathology report. **Nothing on the margins**. Final pathology report downgraded from Gleason 7 to 6. Because of the good pathology report, surgeon tells me there is only a 10% chance of recurrence. Tells me this is his Christmas present to me. I couldn't have hoped for a better outcome. Jackson-Pratt (JP) drain removed in the morning (one more tube/thingy out of me). I'm discharged around noon (nurse goes over the use of the large/small Bard urine bags). Walk out of the hospital with a urine bag strapped to my leg. Ah, my first sense of being somewhat free. My girlfriend (who flew in from out-of-state to take care of me) takes me to the mall that evening for a walk, which will become a routine. I will use our local mall for daily walking. Prescribed medications to take after going home (1) antibiotic (2) anti bladder spasm medication (3) pain medication (4) stool softener (over the counter stuff). Didn't get the pain medication because I didn't feel I needed it - had pain medication left over from recent prostate biopsy. Had first official poop since Monday (when I started fasting for the operation). To accommodate the urine bag, I had already bought a pair of cargo pants that were two sizes too big. This worked perfectly. Plenty of room for the bag. At night I switch over to the large bag which sits by my bed in a plastic bucket supplied by the hospital. I have no problems sleeping in my bed (back or side) - despite this quote from one of the forum stickys \"If you have a recliner, plan on using it to sleep. I could not even imagine getting in and out of a regular bed\". I didn't find this at all.",
