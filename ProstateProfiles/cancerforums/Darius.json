      "Content": "Thanks Highlander and thanks for posting the calcification info 1953MEB. That is encouraging to me. Hoping that the dense calcifications in my prostate could be part of the rise in my PSA and not an indicator if spreading cancer. Totally went blank at the doctors office today and forgot to ask about the calcification. My wife went with me and she forgot too. My prostate is really acting up now...severe pain this morning and constant but not as severe pain right now. My urologist previously told me that cancer is not the cause of those symptoms so I'm thinking I have an infection or maybe just a flare up. If my next PSA is high again.....I will have the biopsy and my doctor talked about radiation as opposed to surgery....if needed at all. This site is a great source of information and I'm so grateful I can read the information here. Dense calcification in otherwise unremarkable CT scan in December of 2016 12 core biopsy in February 2017 2 cores positive, both 3+3=6 (one 50% and one 5%) 1 core suspicious PSA Oct 2016 = 6.23 PSA Nov 2016 = 5.9 PSA April 2017 = 7.2 PSA July 2017 = ? PSA September 2017 = 6.8 PSA Nov 2017 = 8.7 (Having urinary symptoms)",

I was diagnosed at biopsy in February of 2017. I chose AS. My PSA is climbing and last was PSA 8.7. I have been corresponding with a friend who is a urologist and he said it may be time to consider radiation or surgery. In biopsy (February 2017) had 2 cores (3+3=6) and 1 that was 'suspicious for carcinoma.\" One core was 50% and the other 5%. 12 core biopsy. Was told by local urologist: Minimal, confined, you will not die from this, you will die \"with\" this. Latest PSA of 8.7 prompted urologist to request second biopsy. I requested to wait and take a round of Cipro as I am having urinary frequency. bladder pain and an episode of proctological fugax recently (after PSA test) so I think my prostate might just be aggravated. He never called back with an answer? I was told before that Pca does not cause my symptoms, so maybe I just have something else going on in addition to a small amount of Pca. Family doctor prescribed Cipro and I am 2 days into taking it with no change in symptoms. I've read that results from radiation and surgery are basically equal, so why do people choose one over the other? Could the increase in PSA be just because I have a large prostate and does Pca enlarge the prostate? It definitely feels enlarged and uncomfortable even sitting on a hard surface. I hated the biopsy but I had a bladder biopsy at the same time for two suspicious places in my bladder. No cancer was found in bladder. Based on my numbers, what would YOU do?",
