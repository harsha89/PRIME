      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I don't think anyone really knows the answer to this. Genetics seems to be the main factor. So I'd simply follow the old adage that you can have anything you want \"in moderation.\" I agree with Highlander. Don't get overly anxious about all this. It sounds like you have the right general idea. I think maintaining a healthy weight is important, and if you're doing that you're probably not eating a ton of cheeseburgers and milkshakes. If you want to get more strict about it, there are cookbooks for fighting cancer. But I think you've got the gist of it--more plant-based foods, less red meat. You'll be healthier on multiple fronts, especially if you exercise. Just my opinion, of course. I recently did genetic testing through 23andMe. It was fascinating to go through my results. From a bit of saliva, the test accurately showed my eye color, blood type, hair curliness, lactose intolerance, earwax type, and caffeine metabolism (quick!). But near the top of the risks list was prostate cancer, in bold red letters. Mind you, the testing firm had no idea I had been diagnosed. But my genetics had loaded the gun and probably pulled the trigger on me in terms of prostate cancer. I imagine a vegan diet and all the extreme workouts in the world would not have changed the fact that I would be diagnosed. However...if I had been obese, I think it's possible that my cancer might have been more aggressive. Studies have shown a correlation there. 23andMe showed my risk of prostate cancer to be 2.86 times the average man's. I had markers for high risk on 10 out of 12 genes known to be associated with prostate cancer. At this point, I seem to have taken care of my prostate cancer. Now I'm concentrating on another genetic risk identified by 23andMe: coronary heart disease. It is my highest risk on the 23andMe disease list. I'm also at increased genetic risk of Alzheimer's (1.98x the general population), rheumatoid arthritis, thromboembolism, psoriasis, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, esophogeal cancer, and multiple sclerosis. But of all those, the biggest danger and the one I can do the most about is heart disease. So I joined Weight Watchers (I'm a lifetime member--lost 35 lbs), started cycling, and cutting out a lot of red meat and dairy. We'll see how it goes. One thing's for sure. I feel a lot better these days. Weight Watchers could help you make healthy eating choices without feeling deprived. It did for me. I wish you well.",

My radiation oncologist gave me a prescription for Proctofoam, a topical analgesic foam (pretty easy to apply) that really helped. Like a fire extinguisher. About 2 weeks or so after treatment, the proctitis dropped off signifcantly, and within a couple of months was gone completely. A colonoscopy several years later did not reveal any visible damage, nor did I have any polyps or tumors.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I don't think anyone really knows the answer to this. Genetics seems to be the main factor. So I'd simply follow the old adage that you can have anything you want \"in moderation.\" I agree with Highlander. Don't get overly anxious about all this. It sounds like you have the right general idea. I think maintaining a healthy weight is important, and if you're doing that you're probably not eating a ton of cheeseburgers and milkshakes. If you want to get more strict about it, there are cookbooks for fighting cancer. But I think you've got the gist of it--more plant-based foods, less red meat. You'll be healthier on multiple fronts, especially if you exercise. Just my opinion, of course. I recently did genetic testing through 23andMe. It was fascinating to go through my results. From a bit of saliva, the test accurately showed my eye color, blood type, hair curliness, lactose intolerance, earwax type, and caffeine metabolism (quick!). But near the top of the risks list was prostate cancer, in bold red letters. Mind you, the testing firm had no idea I had been diagnosed. But my genetics had loaded the gun and probably pulled the trigger on me in terms of prostate cancer. I imagine a vegan diet and all the extreme workouts in the world would not have changed the fact that I would be diagnosed. However...if I had been obese, I think it's possible that my cancer might have been more aggressive. Studies have shown a correlation there. 23andMe showed my risk of prostate cancer to be 2.86 times the average man's. I had markers for high risk on 10 out of 12 genes known to be associated with prostate cancer. At this point, I seem to have taken care of my prostate cancer. Now I'm concentrating on another genetic risk identified by 23andMe: coronary heart disease. It is my highest risk on the 23andMe disease list. I'm also at increased genetic risk of Alzheimer's (1.98x the general population), rheumatoid arthritis, thromboembolism, psoriasis, colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, esophogeal cancer, and multiple sclerosis. But of all those, the biggest danger and the one I can do the most about is heart disease. So I joined Weight Watchers (I'm a lifetime member--lost 35 lbs), started cycling, and cutting out a lot of red meat and dairy. We'll see how it goes. One thing's for sure. I feel a lot better these days. Weight Watchers could help you make healthy eating choices without feeling deprived. It did for me. I wish you well.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goatts How long does it take to recover from one radiation treatment. How long before you can go back to work? Thanks Tom From one treatment? You shouldn't notice anything from an individual treatment. After a number of treatments you may start to have some fatigue or bowel issues. I did not experience fatigue. I kept working and just built the treatments into my work week. Each one only took a few minutes, maybe half an hour including waiting, getting positioned on the table, etc. I did have some bowel issues that started towards the end of the treatments, but they resolved within a few weeks, and were never serious enough to keep me from normal activities. My experience was with radiation as a secondary (salvage) treatment, but I can't imagine why having it as a primary treatment would be much different in terms of feeling something after an individual radiation session. You really don't feel anything but boredom from a treatment. The dose each time is pretty small, but they add up to a therapeutic level over time.",

      "Content": "great report. My history is very similar to your husband's: G7 cancer diagnosed in my 40's, RP, positive margin, initial PSA undetectable but rising thereafter. I also had SRT without ADT. I had some bowel issues (pain/discomfort during bowel movements) that turned about to be acute radiation proctitis. Treated with a topical (well, sort of topical, if you know what I mean) analgesic foam. Went on a low-residue diet. The proctitis resolved on its own within a few weeks after radiation treatments ceased. My PSA never rose in the subsequent 13+ years--although I'm knocking on wood because I had a blood draw last week as part of a physical. Best of luck to you and your husband!",

It\u0092s obvious that the three month Lupron injection suppresses the testosterone longer than three months. Would it not be better to monitor the testosterone and apply the injection when a rise is indicated. One other point how long can one expect before psa is reduced to undedectable when on HT.

      "Content": "Hi Jaha. Sounds like you're doing pretty well..PSA is only creeping up. I gather you decided against salvage radiation? Also, didn't you have an issue with low white blood cell count (leukopenia) or am I thinking of someone else? It's good to hear from you. Originally Posted by jaha Hi Replicant Thanks for your inquiry, I had my last Lupron injection April 2013, at that point my Psa was 0.074 and testosterone was 0.2. Since then my psa remained about <0.1 until November when it crept up to 0.2, by April this year it had gone up to 0.3 this was in line with the rise in testosterone. My urologist has recommended I now continue with Lupron, so I will have an injection within the next week, so it's back to hot flushes etc. I have also been on Advodart for the last 18 months, which has restricted the amount of free testosterone.",

      "Content": "Take a group of 100 men, PSA 4-6, Gleason 3+4=7. According to the Partin tables, 66 of them should have organ-confined disease. According to the Han tables, out of that group, 58 (88%) should be free of recurrence at 10 years. The men who had NON-organ confined disease number 34. According to the Han tables, 22 (66%) should be free of recurrence at 10 years. So out of the intial group, we have 58+22=80 who are recurrence-free at the 10 year mark from surgery. 80% of all the 3+4 guys. That's just guys in the PSA range of 4-6 or 4-10. When Epstein made his remark, he was talking about the total, not a subgroup based on PSA. He could have also been speaking rather loosely about \"cure\". When you look at prostate-cancer specific mortality, it is less than 10% for 3+4=7 at the 15 year mark. PCSM is not the same as being cured. It just means you didn't die from prostate cancer during that time. http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...prostatectomy/ Originally Posted by pjr Hi All, I'm wondering if anyone could enlighten me on how to understand what I think are odd stats that I read on the Johns Hopkins website. I may be missing the obvious, so any thoughts would be helpful! First, in the winter 2014 issue of their \"Prostate Discovery Magazine,\" (article on tweaking the Gleason system) they write: \"In the past, any Gleason pattern 4 tumor was considered aggressive,\" says Epstein. \"But we showed that Gleason score 3+4=7 cancer has a very favorable prognosis, with over 90 percent of men cured after radical prostatectomy.\" http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/20...er_2014_19.php Then I look at the Han Table. http://urology.jhu.edu/prostate/han_tables.php Han Table for PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4; Clinical T1c 3 years after surgery: 3% (1-10) 5 years after surgery: 5% (2-16) 7 years after surgery: 7% (2-23) 10 years after surgery:10% (3-2 Here's the Han Table with data after surgery. Han Table for PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4; Organ confined 3 years after surgery: 4% (1-10) 5 years after surgery: 6% (2-17) 7 years after surgery: 9% (3-24) 10 years after surgery: 12% (4-29) First, these numbers are pretty consistent with Epstein's quote, but I don't understand the slightly higher percentages given for after surgery if it's known to be organ confined. Then, here's the Han table if it's not organ confined: Han Table for PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4; Organ confined 3 years after surgery: 12% (5-30) 5 years after surgery: 19% (7-45) 7 years after surgery: 27% (11-59) 10 years after surgery: 34% (14-6 Finally, Partin Table for Clinical T1c; PSA 4-6; Gleason 3+4 lists the probability of organ confined to 66%. http://urology.jhu.edu/prostate/partin_tables.php Maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but I don't understand how people can quote a 90% cure rate for 3+4 when only 66% are predicted to be organ confined; and if it's not organ confined, then there's a 35% chance of recurrence. Can anyone help me understand that? It seems to have pretty important implications in terms of treatment decisions.... Thanks!! Mary",

      "Content": "Ali, sorry to hear it's prostate cancer. Can you clarify the stage? It's usually T2a, T2b, T3a, and so forth. I'm guessing you meant stage T2 something. There is a description of the various stages here: http://www.phoenix5.org/Infolink/ClinicalStaging.html and on other sites. I recommend getting a copy of the biopsy pathology report. It will have plenty of valuable information that you can use in conjunction with John (az4peak)'s sticky message at the top of this forum \"What every newly diagnosed PCa patient MUST know\" You mentioned HIFU. My impression of HIFU is that it is showing promise in low to intermediate risk cancer. In my layperson's view, that does not include Gleason 9, PSA 15 cancer. I base this view, that HIFU is not appropriate in high risk cases, from my reading of several study abstracts, including two separate Italian studies: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19260381 and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19081465 ; a Japanese study of 517 men : http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19863624 , a French study of 119 men: http://www.springerlink.com/content/2885g36408825j26/ , from a HIFU manufacturer, Edap: http://www.edap-tms.com/uploads/pdf/..._robertson.pdf , and multiple other sources. That's not to say you should not investigate HIFU on your own, or substitute my thoughts on the matter for qualified medical advice. I would consult specialists in each treatment modality available to you. A medical oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer, if you can find one close to you, could be a valuable asset. If you can post the specifics of your husband's biopsy report, there are others here who can provide more targeted assistance. You could also take the information from the report and plug it into the calcultor at the Memorial Sloan Kettering site, http://nomograms.org , to get various probabilities. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Hi. You are fairly young, but I was diagnosed at 43 after suspecting it for years. And like you, I had Gleason 3+4. What is your PSA history? Those options you listed are correct--sort of. But there are more variations than those you listed. You would have the option of traditional surgery (non-robot) if you want, but most guys go for the robot these days if it's available. You need to have an experienced surgeon, though, with hundreds of robotic procedures done already and good results. I had both surgery (robotic) and radiation, because my PSA came back after surgery. Surgery was the hardest to recover from and left me with some side effects. Mainly I'm left with some erectile problems although I can function fine with medication. Radiation didn't leave me with ANY long term side effects--I'm now over 5 years out from the end of radiation. However, one thing us young guys need to worry a little about with radiation is secondary tumors. The risk isn't extreme, but it is present, and we have a very long life ahead of us with plenty of time for a radiation-induced cancer to get going. I'm very aware that I should not skip recommended screening colonoscopies, for example. (I just had my first colonoscopy and it was fine. No cancer, no polyps, no sign of radiation damage.) Surgery has a long, well-known history of success, but as you know by now, some sexual side effects are likely, and how severe they will be is not possible to predict beforehand. However, if your surgeon can spare the nerve bundles, your youth will be an advantage in regaining erections. You may also have some problems with continence (holding your urine) and it's likely you will have to wear some kind of pads for a short time after surgery. How long and how severe the urinary problem will be is also impossible to predict ahead of time. I think most men are dry within a matter of weeks or months, but some have long term problems. **You need to find the best prostate surgeon you can if you choose surgery** Freezing is called cryotherapy. My father had it 20 or so years ago and it apparently cured his cancer. His PSA never came back. It fell out of favor for a while, due to extreme sexual side effects, but I think it's regained some popularity and techniques have probably gotten better. Radiation is not free from side effects. A lot of guys get a gradual erectile problem in the years after radiation. Sometimes you can have urinary side effects. The main advantage to radiation, in my book, is that it's a very easy treatment to tolerate. The treatments themselves are painless and non-invasive (if you have external radiation). You could also have seeds (brachytherapy) or a combination of external radiation and brachytherapy. I should add that I had some bowel problems after radiation--called radiation proctitis. But they got better and vanished within a matter of weeks. Some guys have longer term bowel issues after external radiation. Don't let the side effects scare you away from treating your cancer. You can't have erections or go to the bathroom in a coffin, after all. Try to focus on getting rid of the cancer by finding a treatment that is in line with your preferences and values, and find the best doctor you can who performs that treatment. Do not automatically go with doctors you already know. You have one big chance. Take your time and think things out. I highly recommend Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer (3rd edition). Best wishes. Originally Posted by OTCHU Hello everybody.

I know removing prostate will have side effects (going to the bathroom and sex). Are my result are bad ? If i choose radiation, can I avoid the side effects that I said before ? Is it smart to do that ? Please guys, I need some advices .... I am so young for that",

      "Content": "Hi. You are fairly young, but I was diagnosed at 43 after suspecting it for years. And like you, I had Gleason 3+4. What is your PSA history? Those options you listed are correct--sort of. But there are more variations than those you listed. You would have the option of traditional surgery (non-robot) if you want, but most guys go for the robot these days if it's available. You need to have an experienced surgeon, though, with hundreds of robotic procedures done already and good results. I had both surgery (robotic) and radiation, because my PSA came back after surgery. Surgery was the hardest to recover from and left me with some side effects. Mainly I'm left with some erectile problems although I can function fine with medication. Radiation didn't leave me with ANY long term side effects--I'm now over 5 years out from the end of radiation. However, one thing us young guys need to worry a little about with radiation is secondary tumors. The risk isn't extreme, but it is present, and we have a very long life ahead of us with plenty of time for a radiation-induced cancer to get going. I'm very aware that I should not skip recommended screening colonoscopies, for example. (I just had my first colonoscopy and it was fine. No cancer, no polyps, no sign of radiation damage.) Surgery has a long, well-known history of success, but as you know by now, some sexual side effects are likely, and how severe they will be is not possible to predict beforehand. However, if your surgeon can spare the nerve bundles, your youth will be an advantage in regaining erections. You may also have some problems with continence (holding your urine) and it's likely you will have to wear some kind of pads for a short time after surgery. How long and how severe the urinary problem will be is also impossible to predict ahead of time. I think most men are dry within a matter of weeks or months, but some have long term problems. **You need to find the best prostate surgeon you can if you choose surgery** Freezing is called cryotherapy. My father had it 20 or so years ago and it apparently cured his cancer. His PSA never came back. It fell out of favor for a while, due to extreme sexual side effects, but I think it's regained some popularity and techniques have probably gotten better. Radiation is not free from side effects. A lot of guys get a gradual erectile problem in the years after radiation. Sometimes you can have urinary side effects. The main advantage to radiation, in my book, is that it's a very easy treatment to tolerate. The treatments themselves are painless and non-invasive (if you have external radiation). You could also have seeds (brachytherapy) or a combination of external radiation and brachytherapy. I should add that I had some bowel problems after radiation--called radiation proctitis. But they got better and vanished within a matter of weeks. Some guys have longer term bowel issues after external radiation. Don't let the side effects scare you away from treating your cancer. You can't have erections or go to the bathroom in a coffin, after all. Try to focus on getting rid of the cancer by finding a treatment that is in line with your preferences and values, and find the best doctor you can who performs that treatment. Do not automatically go with doctors you already know. You have one big chance. Take your time and think things out. I highly recommend Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer (3rd edition). Best wishes. Originally Posted by OTCHU Hello everybody.

I dont understand : Core(cm) Gleason %PCA 1.5 3+3 5% 1.0 3+3 <5% 1.1 3+4 5% so the doctor told me that I will have to choose my options: - remove with a robot the prostate - freeze the prostate - radiation I really dont know right now and I am lost. I know removing prostate will have side effects (going to the bathroom and sex). Are my result are bad ? If i choose radiation, can I avoid the side effects that I said before ? Is it smart to do that ? Please guys, I need some advices .... I am so young for that",

      "Content": "Hi again. Yes, that's correct. My prostate was removed. Apparently, and hopefully, the reason my PSA came back was that a little cancerous tissue was left behind in the area where the prostate was. That can happen. It's not like removing a very well-defined body part. The reason my doctors and I think that some cancer was left behind in the area of the prostate was that radiation to that area was so effective in reducing my PSA to undetectable. If you have surgery, you will get a report on your surgical margins. \"Negative\" means that there was no cancer at the edges of the removed tissue. \"Positive\" means there was cancer right up to the edge (and presumably, OVER the edge and still inside you!) So you want negative margins after surgery. My margins were positive, meaning it was likely some cancer remained behind, and the salvage radiation pretty much confirmed that. If the cancer had been somewhere else (like my bones) the radiation would not have had the same effect. How long do you have? I'm no doctor, of course, but I don't think taking a couple of weeks to let the panic fade and educate yourself will hurt. The cancer has been developing over a very long time frame, and a couple of weeks to relax, learn, and evaluate your options can only help. You are not in imminent danger and there's no need to rush, but there's no reason to put off setting up some consultations. Just my opinion. Originally Posted by OTCHU thank you for reply ... I am very new to this so maybe my question will be stupid, so sorry about that. You said that you had a surgery, so that mean that they took out your prostate, right ? And you said that your PSA did come back .. that's mean the cancer was somewhere else ? I am confuse about that My PSA was at 2.86 ... the meds was doing nothing so they decided to do a biopsy and here we are Again I am very lost right now .. I really dont know what to do .... how long time I have before to take a decision, what decision to take ... I am so glad to have this forum ... thanks again",

      "Content": "Hi. You are fairly young, but I was diagnosed at 43 after suspecting it for years. And like you, I had Gleason 3+4. What is your PSA history? Those options you listed are correct--sort of. But there are more variations than those you listed. You would have the option of traditional surgery (non-robot) if you want, but most guys go for the robot these days if it's available. You need to have an experienced surgeon, though, with hundreds of robotic procedures done already and good results. I had both surgery (robotic) and radiation, because my PSA came back after surgery. Surgery was the hardest to recover from and left me with some side effects. Mainly I'm left with some erectile problems although I can function fine with medication. Radiation didn't leave me with ANY long term side effects--I'm now over 5 years out from the end of radiation. However, one thing us young guys need to worry a little about with radiation is secondary tumors. The risk isn't extreme, but it is present, and we have a very long life ahead of us with plenty of time for a radiation-induced cancer to get going. I'm very aware that I should not skip recommended screening colonoscopies, for example. (I just had my first colonoscopy and it was fine. No cancer, no polyps, no sign of radiation damage.) Surgery has a long, well-known history of success, but as you know by now, some sexual side effects are likely, and how severe they will be is not possible to predict beforehand. However, if your surgeon can spare the nerve bundles, your youth will be an advantage in regaining erections. You may also have some problems with continence (holding your urine) and it's likely you will have to wear some kind of pads for a short time after surgery. How long and how severe the urinary problem will be is also impossible to predict ahead of time. I think most men are dry within a matter of weeks or months, but some have long term problems. **You need to find the best prostate surgeon you can if you choose surgery** Freezing is called cryotherapy. My father had it 20 or so years ago and it apparently cured his cancer. His PSA never came back. It fell out of favor for a while, due to extreme sexual side effects, but I think it's regained some popularity and techniques have probably gotten better. Radiation is not free from side effects. A lot of guys get a gradual erectile problem in the years after radiation. Sometimes you can have urinary side effects. The main advantage to radiation, in my book, is that it's a very easy treatment to tolerate. The treatments themselves are painless and non-invasive (if you have external radiation). You could also have seeds (brachytherapy) or a combination of external radiation and brachytherapy. I should add that I had some bowel problems after radiation--called radiation proctitis. But they got better and vanished within a matter of weeks. Some guys have longer term bowel issues after external radiation. Don't let the side effects scare you away from treating your cancer. You can't have erections or go to the bathroom in a coffin, after all. Try to focus on getting rid of the cancer by finding a treatment that is in line with your preferences and values, and find the best doctor you can who performs that treatment. Do not automatically go with doctors you already know. You have one big chance. Take your time and think things out. I highly recommend Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer (3rd edition). Best wishes. Originally Posted by OTCHU Hello everybody.

I know removing prostate will have side effects (going to the bathroom and sex). Are my result are bad ? If i choose radiation, can I avoid the side effects that I said before ? Is it smart to do that ? Please guys, I need some advices .... I am so young for that",

When PSA is over 20, the odds of PCa are at least 90%. http://prostatecanceruk.org/informat...blems/psa-test A study by the University of Florida found that when PSA was 30 or higher, the probability of cancer is 100%: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17722667 and in fact when it's over 30, it is probably no longer organ-confined. http://www.prostate.org.au/testing-f...ate-cancer.php When PSA is over 100, it's extremely likely the patient already has metastases in the bone. http://omicsonline.org/1948-5956/JCST-03-112.php http://www.ijnm.in/article.asp?issn=...=Kamaleshwaran You should have a biopsy to confirm and find out the aggressiveness (Gleason score) and stage. Biopsies are nothing to be terrified of anymore, in terms of pain. Your urologist should give you a local anesthetic, and if you want, a mild sedative like Valium to take the edge off. I wouldn't be surprised if your doctor will want to start you on hormone therapy immediately, even before you get test results. You have stated that you don't want to fight this if the cost is high in terms of quality of life. My reaction is that you need to fight this just to preserve your QOL. Hormone therapy is well tolerated by a lot of men. It usually stalls prostate cancer for a period of months to a few years, and in some cases, decades. After that there are other treatments. I think that untreated, death from prostate cancer would be slow and very painful. In contrast, with treatment you may be able to enjoy a normal lifespan with side effects that you can easily live with. (A friend of my father's went in with a painful leg--turns out he had metastatic prostate cancer. He went on HT and for the next 8 years, lived a very normal life, enjoying his family and hobbies. He eventually succumbed, but his quality of life in the intervening years was very good) I'm not trying to diagnose you--I surely hope you *don't* have prostate cancer. Find out what's going on (biopsy) and I hope you let us know and stay active in this forum. There is a lot of help available here and elsewhere. Best wishes,",

      "Content": "Leroy, I'm sorry to hear about your troubles. In advanced prostate cancer, hormone therapy, (technically ADT, or androgen deprivation therapy), often does help. How long it helps varies widely from man to man, but it's common for it to help for a few years. However, I am aware of a man who says he has been on hormone treatment for over a decade. He was diagnosed after the cancer had already spread to the rectum wall. Such a long period of benefit from hormone therapy is probably the exception. I'm going to tell you what Walsh says in his book under the heading \"How Long Do Hormones Work?\", on p. 468: \"This varies from man to man, and we expect these numbers to change with the explosion of new strategies for attacking hormone-resistant cancer. Ten percent of men who are started on HT when they have metastases to bone live less than six months. Ten percent live longer than 10 years. The other 80 percent fall somewhere in the middle. Statistics have shown that half of these men live three years or fewer, and 25 percent are alive after five years.\" At some point, PSA rises, because the cancer cells that were resistant to the treatment gradually come to dominate the tumors. That's called becoming hormone refractory. After that point, there is still help from medicine in the form of chemotherapy. New treatments are in development. Your best strategy will be to delay and stall the cancer as long as possible while those treatments are being developed and tested. Don't give up hope--work is progressing on several fronts in this battle. You should be seeing a medical oncologist if you have not already. Radiation might be needed as well, to zap spots in your bones where you're having pain, and you would have to see a radiation oncologist for that. This would not be curative, of course, but it can often relieve pain. I wish you well. I hope you have friends and family you can call upon for support. Don't fight this alone. I'm sure people will support you on this discussion board. If you have not yet done so, I suggest finding the nearest \"US TOO\" support group in your area if you are in the United States.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DebbieMH Last week we went to the urologist and he did an exam, found nothing - then said just for giggles, do a PSA test. My husband did and it came back at 177. He went in for a bone scan Friday. The urologist said that he has advanced prostate cancer. That he didn't need to do a biopsy because his PSA was so high. The bone scan hasn't come back yet. He has no symptoms ... and is only 61 years old. Is that true ... a PSA that high actually means cancer, period? First of all, I'm sorry to hear about that PSA. It does not bode well. I'm curious--was this his first-ever PSA test? Did he also have a DRE (rectal exam)? If so, what was that result? As far as I know, as a layperson, only a biopsy can definitively diagnose prostate cancer. That said, when PSA is over 10, the probability of cancer is 67%, according to research by Alan Partin and others. When it's over 20, the odds increase to 90%, and many will be metastatic with mets visible on bone scans. When PSA is over 100, the patient almost certainly has prostate cancer and it is very likely metastatic. I don't know enough to discuss whether or not your husband should have a biopsy---what utility that would provide vs. the risk in his situation. It would tell you the Gleason score, an indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer. With advanced prostate cancer, the specialist to see is a medical oncologist, preferably one who specializes in prostate cancer. There are treatments available which potentially can stop cancer in its tracks, reduce metastasis, and maximize quality of life. They are, however, thought of as palliative and not curative. I would ask for a re-test to confirm the PSA results. I hope this helps. I'm sorry you've been dealt this challenge.",

      "Content": "I know what you mean, Fairwind, and it could be seen as jumping the gun to go to HT without a biopsy first. I would bet that a doctor at M.D. Anderson would want to to a biopsy. That said, the statistics show that it is virtually certain that he has cancer, if the lab test was not a huge error. What's less certain is whether it's metastatic yet or maybe just locally advanced. What I've read indicates that prostatitis can cause spikes in PSA five to seven times \"normal\". So if \"normal\" is (let's be generous) 4, then you'd be looking at at readings of 20 to 28. Not 177. And I can't imagine you could have normal prostate tissue producing any where close to 177 in a case of BPH. I've read about the same thing--readings can be as high as 25 or 30 from BPH, but not much higher. \"False-positive elevations in the PSA are increases in the PSA that are caused by conditions other than prostate cancer. For example, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and infection or inflammation of the prostate (prostatitis) from whatever cause can elevate the PSA. Note also that even a rectal examination or an ejaculation within the prior 48 hours can sometimes elevate the PSA. False-positive elevations are usually in the 4 to10 range, but they can go as high as 25 or 30.\" http://www.medicinenet.com/prostate_cancer/page5.htm PSA over 20 carries with it a 90% risk of cancer, and this gentleman is nearly 8 times that.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DebbieMH Last week we went to the urologist and he did an exam, found nothing - then said just for giggles, do a PSA test. My husband did and it came back at 177. He went in for a bone scan Friday. The urologist said that he has advanced prostate cancer. That he didn't need to do a biopsy because his PSA was so high. The bone scan hasn't come back yet. He has no symptoms ... and is only 61 years old. Is that true ... a PSA that high actually means cancer, period? First of all, I'm sorry to hear about that PSA. It does not bode well. I'm curious--was this his first-ever PSA test? Did he also have a DRE (rectal exam)? If so, what was that result? As far as I know, as a layperson, only a biopsy can definitively diagnose prostate cancer. That said, when PSA is over 10, the probability of cancer is 67%, according to research by Alan Partin and others. When it's over 20, the odds increase to 90%, and many will be metastatic with mets visible on bone scans. When PSA is over 100, the patient almost certainly has prostate cancer and it is very likely metastatic. I don't know enough to discuss whether or not your husband should have a biopsy---what utility that would provide vs. the risk in his situation. It would tell you the Gleason score, an indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer. With advanced prostate cancer, the specialist to see is a medical oncologist, preferably one who specializes in prostate cancer. There are treatments available which potentially can stop cancer in its tracks, reduce metastasis, and maximize quality of life. They are, however, thought of as palliative and not curative.

      "Content": "Jim, I don't have experience or knowledge about such situations, and your predicament sounds a little unusual. Hopefully your doctor is a top-notch medical oncologist. If not, I would consult one. Best wishes for your health. Originally Posted by jbdubose I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had prostatectomy in Dec. 09'. I had a high cancer score (8+). The follow-up PSA test a few weeks after showed my level at 2.9. The doctor was astounded saying the margins were clear from my surgery. So he did another PSA a week later and it was 3.2. Evidently he did not get it all and it was climbing up fast. So, in Mar. 10' I got sent to radiation for 40+ treatments and as an added \"bonus\" I got started on Lupron. Yes, I have now read all the bad stuff on the drug and completely agree with many assessments. It did a number on me as well. I was on the drug for 1.5 years getting zeros all the while and talked my doc into getting off of it (Nov. 11'). He said it would take the same amount of time for the drug to wear off before my PSA tests would be truly accurate and for my hormone levels to bounce back. But he did mention that I was not a candidate for HRT since I was stage 3 at one point (Radiation, etc). Since Nov. 11' I have continued to get zeros on my PSA but my pituitary gland never kicked back and my hormone levels ranged 68 until recently. Now they are dropping (50) again. Now, the doc has ordered some pituitary blood tests to see if a tumor is present. He has also relented and has put me on HRT (via gel). Options? Is there any medicine, natural or otherwise, out there that can \"jumpstart\" my pituitary? Although there may be a risk in doing HRT again, I have done extensive research and have found that prognosis unstable. So I am 50/50 on HRT. Has anyone in this forum experienced this or have heard of this happening? Any advice? Please help...I am pretty frustrated! Thanks in advance, Jim",

      "Content": "Gary, I'm sorry to hear that. You've been dealt a bad hand of cards, haven't you? Try a google search for this: mucinous adenocarcinoma prostate Take care with the spelling of the first two words for the best results. It would seem to be rare indeed. I found this article from the Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, 2005 (see the link for the full citation). The title is \"A Rare Prostatic Tumor in a 48-Year-Old Man\". It would seem from the article that there have been about 60 cases reported. The article notes that although the outlook is dismal, there HAVE been cases of long term survivors. http://tinyurl.com/5ab284 Another article indicates that mucinous adenocarcinoma is not any worse than other prostate cancers. The authors conducted what they believe to be the largest study of this rare cancer (14 cases) and concluded: \"MC appears to behave clinically in a similar fashion to AC, with no statistically significant difference in biochemical failure or survival.\" (By AC they mean \"regular\" prostate cancer, or conventional adenocarcinoma.) http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retri...90429506006212 It would seem that you are in mostly uncharted waters here. I suggest in addition to reading what literature that is available and consulting with the best cancer experts you can get to, that you contact a very knowledgeable layperson.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DebbieMH Last week we went to the urologist and he did an exam, found nothing - then said just for giggles, do a PSA test. My husband did and it came back at 177. He went in for a bone scan Friday. The urologist said that he has advanced prostate cancer. That he didn't need to do a biopsy because his PSA was so high. The bone scan hasn't come back yet. He has no symptoms ... and is only 61 years old. Is that true ... a PSA that high actually means cancer, period? First of all, I'm sorry to hear about that PSA. It does not bode well. I'm curious--was this his first-ever PSA test? Did he also have a DRE (rectal exam)? If so, what was that result? As far as I know, as a layperson, only a biopsy can definitively diagnose prostate cancer. That said, when PSA is over 10, the probability of cancer is 67%, according to research by Alan Partin and others. When it's over 20, the odds increase to 90%, and many will be metastatic with mets visible on bone scans. When PSA is over 100, the patient almost certainly has prostate cancer and it is very likely metastatic. I don't know enough to discuss whether or not your husband should have a biopsy---what utility that would provide vs. the risk in his situation. It would tell you the Gleason score, an indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer. With advanced prostate cancer, the specialist to see is a medical oncologist, preferably one who specializes in prostate cancer. There are treatments available which potentially can stop cancer in its tracks, reduce metastasis, and maximize quality of life. They are, however, thought of as palliative and not curative. I would ask for a re-test to confirm the PSA results. I hope this helps. I'm sorry you've been dealt this challenge.",

      "Content": "What are possible side effects? As others wrote, the most likely side effects would be some loose bowel movements, possibly diarrhea and painful bowel movements. He might have some increased urgency of urination. Not everyone gets these side effects, and most of the time, when men do, they're tolerable, treatable and temporary. It's possible he could have some increased erectile difficulties. The increased ED, if it happens, is a gradual phenomenon. Where could it have spread to? Not possible to say with existing scans where it might be, unless it's far enough along for mets to show up (very unlikely at his current PSA level) but hopefully it's still in the area where the prostate was, which is called the prostate bed, or fossa. If so, radiation offers a second chance at a cure. You didn't say whether he had positive surgical margins or not--if he did have pos margins, the odds are more favorable towards localized, curable cancer. If his lymph nodes or seminal vesicles were involved, the odds are not so favorable. The Gleason 9 does indicate an aggressive tumor and that is not good. There is a calculator on the Memorial Sloan Kettering website that can help you determine his odds of success, but you will need more information from his medical record, including pre-op PSA history, and the post-op pathology and staging. ***He may be angry that maybe the surgeon left something behind, but if this IS the cause of his rising PSA, it's good news, because radiation can mop it up*** Will he be able to drive to treatments or will it tire him out? I can only speak for myself. I was able to drive to treatments, just taking a half hour out of my work day. I didn't experience any fatigue. However, I was only 43. I know that some men report significant fatigue, but I think they would still be able to drive. What is life expectancy post radiology? You probably mean in terms of prostate cancer, not overall (since statistically, he is nearing the edge of male life expectancy anyway for the US). If the radiation is successful, he won't be bothered by prostate cancer ever again. If not, I don't think it's possible to say, but he would probably need to go on hormone therapy. And if that was as effective as it usually is, the cancer would be stalled for many months to several years, possibly allowing him to live out a normal lifespan not very bothered by the cancer itself. Can he be around his grand children during 7 weeks of radiology? Yes. It's not like brachytherapy. The patient is not radioactive at all. The most common treatment is IMRT, which uses X-Rays. The beams come in from various directions, controlled by computer. Each beam is weak, but they combine in the target area to cumulatively reach a therapeutic level. The treatments are painless, and they are not frightening or intimidating. Boring, mostly. You lay still for a few minutes, the machine makes some noise and moves a few times, and then you go back to your day. What did you find useful being done for you by your family. For me it was quite an easy thing to go through. If surgery was a \"10\" on the stress level, my salvage radiation was about a 1 or 2. So I didn't feel like I needed any kind of special attention from my family, other than understanding that I was anxious to see whether it worked. (And it did) You may find this article helpful: \"9 Decisions Before Electing Radiation Therapy After Radical Prostatectomy\" http://prostate-cancer.org/PDFs/Is13-2_p8-17.pdf and this one with good news about side effects: \"Few Side Effects Found From Radiation Treatment Given After Prostate Cancer Surgery\" http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases...928131212.htm# Originally Posted by squiggle Hi advice wanted My dad's cancer has recurred any my family naturally are devastated. Though I knew it would happen as his level was considered to be gleason 7 (4+3) stage 2c pre surgery but was revised to gleason 9 (5+4) on examination of operative samples. It was considered to be very aggresive at the time. Post operatively he had levels of 0,01 doubling to 0.02, and continuing to double until 18month post op level was 0,18 He has been referred to radiology, he is 70 and scared and angry as he feels that it wasnt all removed. What can I do to help him? He is worried that it has spread and where it has gone along with the side effects of radiology 5 days per week for 7 weeks testing in Jan start Feb. What are possible side effects? Where could it have spread to? Will he be able to drive to treatments or will it tire him out? What is life expectancy post radiology? Can he be around his grand children during 7 weeks of radiology? What did you find useful being done for you by your family. Any advice/ suggestions or bare fact reality welcomed. I was a nurse years ago but never in this area so all advice/experience welcome. Plain spoken truth welcome as I need to know facts as I am his go to for advice and I need to be ready.

They're also highly rated for urology--so for a urologic cancer like prostate cancer, that's a great combination.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DebbieMH Last week we went to the urologist and he did an exam, found nothing - then said just for giggles, do a PSA test. My husband did and it came back at 177. He went in for a bone scan Friday. The urologist said that he has advanced prostate cancer. That he didn't need to do a biopsy because his PSA was so high. The bone scan hasn't come back yet. He has no symptoms ... and is only 61 years old. Is that true ... a PSA that high actually means cancer, period? First of all, I'm sorry to hear about that PSA. It does not bode well. I'm curious--was this his first-ever PSA test? Did he also have a DRE (rectal exam)? If so, what was that result? As far as I know, as a layperson, only a biopsy can definitively diagnose prostate cancer. That said, when PSA is over 10, the probability of cancer is 67%, according to research by Alan Partin and others. When it's over 20, the odds increase to 90%, and many will be metastatic with mets visible on bone scans. When PSA is over 100, the patient almost certainly has prostate cancer and it is very likely metastatic. I don't know enough to discuss whether or not your husband should have a biopsy---what utility that would provide vs. the risk in his situation. It would tell you the Gleason score, an indication of the aggressiveness of the cancer. With advanced prostate cancer, the specialist to see is a medical oncologist, preferably one who specializes in prostate cancer. There are treatments available which potentially can stop cancer in its tracks, reduce metastasis, and maximize quality of life. They are, however, thought of as palliative and not curative. I would ask for a re-test to confirm the PSA results. I hope this helps. I'm sorry you've been dealt this challenge.",

I am looking for the earliest possible imaging such as C11 Acetate PET. and also possible consultation on risk/ befits of early treatment. I suspect at this point my best shot would be that I gained access to C11 Acetate PET, that a small hot-spot was found and radiated and BINGO ! Any one know of access to C11 Acetate PET within reasonable access to the east coast. Anyone ever hear of treatment at these low PSA levels? Thanks Hawk",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCWIFE3 Hello: back again with another question. My husband had Davinci surgery 3 weeks ago today. He had his catheter removed last Friday. While he had the catheter, there was ALWAYS blood in his urine. The doctor took a look and said that this was likely due to the catheter rubbing against the bladder and should go away within a few days of removing it. Since he had the catheter removed, he's had no problems with incontinence (thus far), but every time he urinates, he has a spasm and then a drop of fresh blood comes out. He said he has a really strong stream and just before he is done, it automatically stops with a sharp spasm and new blood. I called the nurses and they said that this could be normal and to follow up with his doctor. We don't see him until the 16th of November so just wondering if anyone else has had a similar issue? Again thanks to all of you who post here....you've really put my mind at ease about so much. I agree that it's a normal consequence of healing. I had the spasms, and got something (forgot now what it was) to reduce them. The doctor should be able to call in the Rx without seeing your husband ahead of schedule.",

      "Content": "I agree with Newporter. Especially in the case of radiation, therapies are more effective and patients suffer fewer side effects than 20 years ago. I would much rather be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2013 as opposed to 1993. IMRT, in particular, was a revolution in radiation therapy. It did not become widely available until about 10 years ago. I had IMRT as a salvage treatment after surgery failed to cure me. Proton beam therapy has also become available in the last 20 years. If you go back a little further, things have improved even more. Walsh introduced the nerve sparing prostatectomy in 1982, and I'm sure it took a few years for that technique to be widely disseminated. Before then, the nerve bundles were always removed with the prostate, leaving the man impotent. Now there's a good chance for the surgeon to preserve the bundles. And like newporter wrote, there is now chemo available for advanced cases. Although it's not curative, in many cases it extends survival time. In the 1980's I don't think there were any effective chemo therapies for prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Zentea Almost 4 years ago i had a radical prostatectomy. My gleason score had been6 or 7. the psa was 13.5 at its highest. Three months after surgery my first psa was.2. Long story short, it stayed that way for 3.5 years. This spring it went to .4. I had radiation and the first psa came back at .2. Seems im back where i started. After talking to my surgen and my oncologist i'm confused about what they said exactly and what this means. No one told me what to expect after the radiation. I assumed it would go to zero, more than likely, because my cancer had been contained and was in less than1% of the prostate. How Could it still even be there. Well, asked and ansewed with all the possibilities. On line i got some info, but nothing with numbers this low to start radiation. Not sure where i stand or whats next except more psas's and wait and see. Our cases aren't very different. What we had is often called \"salvage radiation\". The first PSA after salvage radiation is completed often isn't zero. Yours wasn't, mine wasn't. (Mine was 0.1). What's more important is what happens next. It does take a little time for the cancer cells that were irradiated to die off--in the meantime, they still produce PSA. If your salvage radiation was successful, your PSA should fall to \"less than 0.1\" on the standard test and stay there. The best outcomes are when this low point is reached within a year of the date you finished radiation. So 90 days after radiation my PSA was still detectable, at 0.1. But 90 days after that, it was less than 0.1, where it has stayed (I'm now 5 1/2 years out from the end of radiation). So don't sweat this first test result. Hopefully you'll trend downwards now and be effectively at zero before long--and cured. Hopefully we both are.",

      "Content": "Has he been diagnosed with prostate cancer? If not, I echo Chuck's question: has a biopsy been done, or is it scheduled? If he was diagnosed, what was his Gleason score? Although BPH and prostatitis (both benign) can raise PSA, you would not expect to see it at 300 or more and not be cancer. I've seen on numerous medical sites that when PSA reaches 100, it's almost certainly cancer and it has very likely escaped the prostate. For example: \"...for PSA levels more than 100 ng/ml, all subjects in our study had proven to have skeletal metastases on radionuclide bone scan. The positive predictive value using a cut off point of a serum PSA more than 100 ng/ml is 100%\" http://www.omicsonline.org/1948-5956/JCST-03-112.php I think it's safe to assume that he has PCa and that it is advanced. It's good that it's not showing up in his bones yet. Is he receiving treatment? Hormone therapy is effective in many men, at least for a matter of months or years (sometimes decades) and then there are other treatments.",

      "Content": "As Fairwind wrote, it does take time--assuming the radiation is successful at eradicating the remaining cancer--for PSA to fall. I had surgery, then radiation when my PSA rose. The day before I started radiation, my PSA was 0.7. I was not tested until 3 months elapsed after the radiation treatments. At that point, my PSA was still detectable on the standard test, at 0.1. My doctor said he would have been pleased even if had been higher, say 0.3. At the next test, at the 6 month post-radiation mark, my PSA was less than 0.1. It has remained there since. Maybe I'm cured, maybe I'm just enjoying a long term remission. Maybe a piece of plaque in my arteries will slough off as I reach for the morning paper tomorrow and drop me in the driveway! It hasn't been long since your radiation ended. The tumor cells that were irradiated should die now, without replicating, since the radiation damages their DNA, making replication impossible. As they die off, your PSA should come down. With luck, it should come down to less than 0.1, and for the best outlook, that should happen in less than 12 months from the end of radiation. So wait, and see what the next test brings. As Fairwind wrote, in the medium term, the odds are about 50/50. In the very short term, most men do see their PSA go down (about 3/4). Within a few years, about half of them will have a PSA recurrence. At the 10 year mark, that rises to 75%. (However, men who see a total response to radiation tend to be better off, with 1/3 of them making it to the decade mark without recurrence.) My blog has links to studies backing the above stats. But in the end, you're a man, not a number, as the 60's tv show \"The Prisoner\" used to say. You've rolled the salvage radiation dice, and now the only thing to do is wait for them to come to rest and see what the results are. If it's any encouragement, I've followed the stories of quite a few guys here, and on HealingWell.com, who have had salvage radiation. There have been a few failures, but there are more successes, at least a few years out. Best wishes!",

I had 70.2 grays over 38 sessions. I had some minor bowel issues that resolved soon after treatments ended. Otherwise, no side effects. And it seems to have wiped out the remaining cancer, as my PSA remains undetectable years later. I would find out what \"flavor\" of EBRT your place does. If you're not comfortable with it, travel to have your radiation done. I almost went out of state to have proton beam therapy, but opted to stay close to home for logistical reasons.",

Phase II trials normally recruit a few dozen participants (Phase III trials go for hundreds or thousands of patients). Phase II is to further evaluate safety and to begin evaluating how effective the procedure is. Fingers crossed that this one will work out as it promises.",

      "Content": "Carmen, If radiation is given to your husband, it will probably be in the hope that any cancer cells are still in the area where the prostate used to be, called the prostate bed, or fossa. There is no way to guarantee the cells are there. The CT and bone scans only rule out obvious mets, but can't detect microscopic cancer. The scans do *not* have to find a target for the radiation. Usually the cancer would be too tiny to show up, anyway. The radiation would be aimed at the prostate bed. The highest dose would be given to where the doctor thinks the cancer is most likely to be, and lower doses in outer areas. The radiation can be shaped to try to avoid hurting healthy tissue and organs. Radiation given this way is often called salvage radiation therapy, or SRT for short. It's what I (and a few others here) have had. It is a painless treatment that takes a few minutes a day, 5 days a week, for about 2 months. There would be no guarantees that it would work, but the sooner your husband started the treatments, the better his chances. However, if the cancer has escaped the pelvic region, the SRT will not do anything to help him. In the very short run--months to a couple of years out from SRT, most men, about 75%, see their PSA decrease. At the 5 year mark, the number of men who have not had a rise drops to around 50% (this is the 50/50 you read about). By 10 years, the overall odds drop to around 25%, although in men who saw their PSA go all the way down to less than 0.1, the odds are a little better---about 35%. So it's a gamble. It always is. The upside to the gamble is a second chance at a cure. The downside to the gamble is that it might not work at all, and your husband could suffer in terms of his quality of life. *Usually* the side effects from salvage radiation are mild, and go away within a few months. But not always. There is a chance your husband could suffer from long term irritation to his rectum or bladder. He could even be injured by the radiation if there is a mistake, but this is not common. Radiation also increases a man's chance of a different cancer years later. For me the second chance of a cure was enough. I wish the best for you and your husband.",

      "Content": "As Fairwind wrote, it does take time--assuming the radiation is successful at eradicating the remaining cancer--for PSA to fall. I had surgery, then radiation when my PSA rose. The day before I started radiation, my PSA was 0.7. I was not tested until 3 months elapsed after the radiation treatments. At that point, my PSA was still detectable on the standard test, at 0.1. My doctor said he would have been pleased even if had been higher, say 0.3. At the next test, at the 6 month post-radiation mark, my PSA was less than 0.1. It has remained there since. Maybe I'm cured, maybe I'm just enjoying a long term remission. Maybe a piece of plaque in my arteries will slough off as I reach for the morning paper tomorrow and drop me in the driveway! It hasn't been long since your radiation ended. The tumor cells that were irradiated should die now, without replicating, since the radiation damages their DNA, making replication impossible. As they die off, your PSA should come down. With luck, it should come down to less than 0.1, and for the best outlook, that should happen in less than 12 months from the end of radiation. So wait, and see what the next test brings. As Fairwind wrote, in the medium term, the odds are about 50/50. In the very short term, most men do see their PSA go down (about 3/4). Within a few years, about half of them will have a PSA recurrence. At the 10 year mark, that rises to 75%. (However, men who see a total response to radiation tend to be better off, with 1/3 of them making it to the decade mark without recurrence.) My blog has links to studies backing the above stats. But in the end, you're a man, not a number, as the 60's tv show \"The Prisoner\" used to say. You've rolled the salvage radiation dice, and now the only thing to do is wait for them to come to rest and see what the results are. If it's any encouragement, I've followed the stories of quite a few guys here, and on HealingWell.com, who have had salvage radiation. There have been a few failures, but there are more successes, at least a few years out. Best wishes!",

      "Content": "Tim, it's hard to predict. I had surgery at 43. I have some ED from the surgery, but can recover to 100% with a pill. Some guys come out better, some worse. I know you will find this difficult to believe, but the side effect that would be more devastating to your quality of life is incontinence. Luckily, I'm okay in that regard too, 99.9% dry. If you have surgery, your risk of impotence will depend on the skill of the surgeon--you need absolutely the best you can find--and whether or not they are able to spare one or both nerve bundles. At your age, if the surgeon can leave the nerves, you'll probably recover enough sexual function that it won't be a big deal. Your youth will also help with the risk of incontinence. With a Gleason 6, you have multiple options--seeds, external radiation, surgery, proton beam, and so forth. There's no need to rush to a decision. I recommend getting the latest edition of Patrick Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". And take some time to read up on all of your options. If you choose surgery, you should not automatically go with your urologist, but rather pick the best doctor you can from a center of excellence near you (in the states, that would be places like UCLA, Memorial Sloan Kettering, MD Anderson, Dana Farber, Johns Hopkins, etc.) If you get a great surgeon, at a great hospital, at age 43 the odds are you'll have a pretty normal sex life afterwards AND not be wetting your pants every time you sneeze. If you go with a mediocre surgeon at a community hospital...well, it's anyone's guess. Surgery has some things going for it. It seems to have a slight statistical edge in long term cancer-free survival for younger (<50) patients. The pathologist gets to look at the removed tissue and tell you what's really going on. And there's a psychological boost many men get from knowing \"it's out.\" But impotence and incontinence (the second, especially) need to be carefully considered. You don't have to have surgery. Radiation is comparable (according to surgeon Walsh) to surgery in cancer control overall, the part about young men notwithstanding. The risk of incontinence from radiation is almost nil, although the opposite risk--developing a stricture that blocks urine--is more present in radiation than surgery. You can still have sexual dysfunction after radiation, but it tends to be more gradual when it occurs. The biggest advantage to radiation is that it ain't surgery. I was pretty miserable for the first few days after surgery. Hated the catheter. I later had radiation, and found that to be a cakewalk in comparison. (However, my radiation was salvage in nature, not a primary treatment, so I may not be painting an accurate picture). Don't panic, don't rush. Get Walsh's book, visit the Prostate Cancer Research Foundation website http://www.pcf.org and click on \"Newly Diagnosed\". Relax, read widely, think things through, sketch out the pros and cons of the various treatments in terms of your priorities. This is your big chance to get this right. You're young, you can beat this, and come out the same person on the other side. Wishing you well--",

      "Content": "Hi-- When you write about the two options, you fail to mention salvage radiation. It is mentioned on the Phoenix5 website, and in the JAMA article \"Risk of Prostate Cancer\u0096Specific Mortality Following Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy\". (Assuming that's the article to which you refer). In the JAMA article, men who had complete responses to salvage radiation were considered--for the purpose of the study--cured and were then excluded from the study. So the two choices of wait or start ADT come AFTER the participants had the chance to try radiation. Somewhere around 50% of men will get at least a durable response of several years--and may potentially be cured--by salvage radiotherapy after having PSA rise after prostatectomy. These days the side effects, though still present, are much milder with the advent of IMRT, image-guided IMRT, and protons. Dr. Andrew Stephenson is a lead researcher in this field. He recently, along with these estimable co-authors: Scardino, Kattan, Slawin, and Pollak, et al., did a very large study of 1,600+ patients from 1985 to 2005. They did a multivariate study of all the factors that might affect the success of salvage therapy. The article, \"Predicting the Outcome of Salvage Radiation Therapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy\" (Journal of Clinical Oncology, May 2007), provides a nomogram for patients and doctors faced with a rising PSA after prostatectomy. I had salvage IMRT done, and as I was considering it, became acquainted with a patient at Loma Linda UMC having proton beam salvage. He had negative margins, I had positive. Both of us had short (3 mos. or so) PSA doubling times. Both of us have seen our PSAs fall back to undetectable levels after radiation. I'm quite relieved that I was able--at age 44--to have a second chance. I wasn't ready to sit back and wait for metastasis or go on ADT. On my blog at http://pcabefore50.blogspot.com , I chronicle what it's like to be young and have prostate cancer, and what IMRT salvage was like. I also summarize and link to research on predicting the outcome of salvage. Thanks for running a great board---I mean this to be informative and not an attack.",

      "Content": "Hi-- When you write about the two options, you fail to mention salvage radiation. It is mentioned on the Phoenix5 website, and in the JAMA article \"Risk of Prostate Cancer\u0096Specific Mortality Following Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy\". (Assuming that's the article to which you refer). In the JAMA article, men who had complete responses to salvage radiation were considered--for the purpose of the study--cured and were then excluded from the study. So the two choices of wait or start ADT come AFTER the participants had the chance to try radiation. Somewhere around 50% of men will get at least a durable response of several years--and may potentially be cured--by salvage radiotherapy after having PSA rise after prostatectomy. These days the side effects, though still present, are much milder with the advent of IMRT, image-guided IMRT, and protons. Dr. Andrew Stephenson is a lead researcher in this field.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Hammer2016 Hello all, I had my RALP in July 2016. I've had 3 post surgery PSA tests done. They were as follows; 8/26 .04psa 9/23 .06psa 11/17 .12psa I am already working with a radiation oncologist and will be receiving salvage radiation. He has gone over many of the possible side effects, but it's hard to know which, if any, of them I will experience. I do hope someone out there can put me at ease. I was speaking with another patient at the doctor today who said his radiation therapy burned and was painful during the procedure. I hope that is a rare issue. Any comments will be appreciated. Thanks! Hammer I had salvage radiation (IMRT, Varian machine) in 2007. There was absolutely no sensation other than a little boredom during the treatments. 38 sessions. Towards the end of the treatments, say, with about 2 weeks to go, I started to have some discomfort during bowel movements. It was radiation proctitis. No huge deal--I got a prescription for something called Proctofoam that cooled things down, and within a few weeks after SRT, the discomfort was gone. I did not experience fatigue, and didn't miss any work. In fact, the week after I finished, we took a family trip to Disneyland and I was full steam ahead. Best of all, the treatment worked.",

      "Content": "I used the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center calculator and got 17.5 months. I was guessing at exact dates, but that shouldn't make a big difference. I used 1 Sept 2013, 15 Dec 2013, 15 Jan 2014, 15 Feb 2014, 30 March 2014. However, if I used just the last two readings, I get a doubling time of 4 months. Probably what the oncologist is doing. PSA doubling time is not straightforward because the kinetics come out to a curve, not a straight line. The formula is td = (ln 2 x t) / {ln [PSAt] \u0096 ln [PSAinitial]} which is a pain, so it's easier to use an online calculator. Of course I'm not a doctor, but I have read articles by specialists that say you need multiple data points to accurately gauge doubling time---two is not enough. So I would go with the results obtained from 5 data points, which yields a more reassuring figure.",

      "Content": "I had a quick recurrence (at 9 months) after surgery and rapid doubling time (less than 3 months) and positive margins. I also had the same Gleason as your husband, and like your husband, fairly young (44 in my case at the time) I did not have hormone therapy. It was not really a choice laid out to me. I just had the radiation. The advantage to NOT having HT with SRT is that you get a clearer picture sooner afterwards. If I had had HT along with it, I would have suspected HT was masking the effect of radiation for some time afterwards. On the other hand, there are studies that show HT along with radiation is better than just radiation. Early recurrence and rapid doubling does not always indicate distant metastases, and your husband's positive margins provide a local explanation for the PSA rise. Hopefully, those margins indicate some tumor was left behind at the prostate bed and now radiation can mop it up. I'm doing fine several years out now. Here's to your husband having a similar outcome. R. Originally Posted by Iamthewife Hi everyone, My H was diagnosed at age 50 with prostate cancer in April 2014. Don't recall his exact numbers, but he went from ~3.6 to ~5.3 at his next check. Had Davinci RP in late May 2014, PSA after was undetectible. Pathology report indicates G7 (3+4), 3 positive margins, grade T2c. PSA rechecks every 3 months. His cancer recurred in less than a year. PSA of .06, a retest two weeks later was .07, and 3 months later it's .15. That means his doubling time is less than 3 months. He started salvage radiation last week. His oncologist said he was on the fence about hormone therapy with the radiation, so my H has opted for no hormones. Wanting to know if others have had early recurrence and rapid doubling time. Did your doctor tell you hormone treatment was 50/50? I've read that early recurrence and PSADT <3 months could indicate distant mestastices, and that hormone therapy with radiation could knock out both. Thoughts on where he is in treatment and the advice he's been given?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Iamthewife As I've said before here, my H doesn't want to talk about his cancer, at least not the important things. I asked him if he is having his PSA checked during radiation and he said he's not. He then went on to tell me that you don't start hormone therapy during radiation, only before. I hadn't mentioned hormones, so I know he was being defensive and wanting to shut me down. Here's my concern - I don't think his doctors are being honest with him. His cancer has recurred in less than 1 year and his psadt is less than 3 months. Based on this chart from Johns Hopkins, he can't be cured. His chances of surviving 15 years are about 1%. How can they suggest to him that radiation could cure him in this case? http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer829.php The way I read the chart, he has a 74% chance of prostate cancer-specific survival at 5 years. Not so great longer out, but that data was based on men being treated back when salvage radiation was much cruder, and it no doubt includes men who didn't even try radiation after surgery. I would encourage you to look at a nomogram which has been validated and re-validated, predicting the outcome of salvage radiation. https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/pros...iation-therapy I put in some numbers (not knowing all the details of your husband's pathology) and it looks like he should be around the 44% probability of being free of PSA progression 6 years later--that was about where my probability was. (I assumed negative lymph and seminal vesicle invasion--if he had either one of those it will downgrade his odds a little). If you can get your hands on his records, you can get a clearer picture, but it's far from doomsday. A lot of cancer patients would give their left...arm for a 40% chance of a cure. Again, I was in almost exactly the same position: rapidly doubling PSA, positive margins, Gleason 7, no hormone therapy, etc. and things have worked out very well for me. There is good reason for the two of you to be optimistic. One last thought: a study by Trock in 2008 showed that men with rapidly doubling PSA have the most to gain from salvage radiation: \"Feb. 12, 2008 -- For the first time, researchers have shown that radiation can increase the odds of survival for men whose PSA levels rapidly rise after surgery for prostate cancer...[t]he greatest benefits of so-called salvage radiotherapy were observed in men with rapidly rising PSA levels, says researcher Bruce Trock, MD, associate professor of urology, epidemiology, oncology, and environmental health sciences at Johns Hopkins University.\" http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer...-for-radiation",

      "Content": "Walsh, on p. 164 of \"Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", says: \"If you have a low PSA level (between 1 and 4 ng/ml), any increase is alarming. In a study using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Carter and colleagues found that PSA increases greater than 0.2-0.4 ng/ml per year were predictors of death from prostate cancer. Currently, change in PSA over time is the most valuable tool we have for interpreting PSA and for predicting prostate cancer, including whether it is life threatening.\" In my LAYPERSON'S opinion, you should be seeing the urologist about this. I wouldn't put a lot of confidence in what the family doctor says. I bet the urologist will want to see another PSA much sooner than 12 months from now.",

      "Content": "The individual lab company should have that information. I got a nice email in reply to my voicemail to a chief chemist with a local lab. My concern at the time, as I recall, was a PSA of 0.2 after prostatectomy. That was my second test result after surgery, the first being less than 0.1. After prostatectomy, PSA should fall below 0.1 and stay there. In the email response, the chemist told me that the lab experienced variation of up to 0.1 ng/mL between machines. That is, if the same sample were tested on two different pieces of equipment, it might be different by as much as 0.1 ng/mL. Well, that wasn't extremely comforting, because it meant that I was still probably no lower than 0.1, and maybe as high as 0.3. At the time I was trying to assess my odds of progressing further, and I had some studies at hand that showed the odds, depending on your present PSA. Being 0.2 or 0.3 was not a good sign. The chemist suggested getting an ultrasensitive PSA assay done for greater accuracy. My doctors aren't fans of ultrasensitive testing, and I don't really want the anxiety that goes along with watching numbers bounce around from 0.03 to .05 and so forth, so I haven't pressed for it. Walsh (p. 380) says that Daniel Chan of Johns Hopkins \"trusts the sensitivity of assays down to 0.1 ng/mL, or slightly less than that.\" I assume he's talking about the standard (non-ultrasensitive) test. That sounds in line with what the lab person told me. John is right--you really need to look at a trend of PSA over time. bb is asking about PSA in the pre-treatment stage. Since he has a prostate, PSA can be affected by several things. Variation in the lab is certainly a possibility, and so is inflammation, infection, prostate stimulation through DRE or sex, etc. bb asked about doubling time...PSA doubling time is calculated by dividing the natural log of 2 by the slope of the relation between the log of PSA and the time of PSA measurement. (whew--thank goodness for computers!) PSADT calculators do this using all of the available dates and measurements. In my uneducated opinion, it would seem like you would need quite a few measurements over many months to accurately graph the curve. But that's just my amateur's view. IMHO, in the post-surgical setting, PSA is a more useful tool than it is before surgery takes place. If my PSA goes up, I know it's not because of prostatitis, BPH, sex, or exam. There's nothing left there to irritate. (I know the surgeon didn't leave a glob of prostate behind because of high resolution CT scans and the old \"finger wave\" exam). It would almost certainly be because of cancer, once lab variation was ruled out by subsequent or repeat tests.",

My concern at the time, as I recall, was a PSA of 0.2 after prostatectomy. That was my second test result after surgery, the first being less than 0.1. After prostatectomy, PSA should fall below 0.1 and stay there. In the email response, the chemist told me that the lab experienced variation of up to 0.1 ng/mL between machines. That is, if the same sample were tested on two different pieces of equipment, it might be different by as much as 0.1 ng/mL. Well, that wasn't extremely comforting, because it meant that I was still probably no lower than 0.1, and maybe as high as 0.3. At the time I was trying to assess my odds of progressing further, and I had some studies at hand that showed the odds, depending on your present PSA. Being 0.2 or 0.3 was not a good sign. The chemist suggested getting an ultrasensitive PSA assay done for greater accuracy.

In my uneducated opinion, it would seem like you would need quite a few measurements over many months to accurately graph the curve. But that's just my amateur's view.

There's nothing left there to irritate. (I know the surgeon didn't leave a glob of prostate behind because of high resolution CT scans and the old \"finger wave\" exam). It would almost certainly be because of cancer, once lab variation was ruled out by subsequent or repeat tests.",

      "Content": "Walsh, on p. 164 of \"Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", says: \"If you have a low PSA level (between 1 and 4 ng/ml), any increase is alarming. In a study using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Carter and colleagues found that PSA increases greater than 0.2-0.4 ng/ml per year were predictors of death from prostate cancer. Currently, change in PSA over time is the most valuable tool we have for interpreting PSA and for predicting prostate cancer, including whether it is life threatening.\" In my LAYPERSON'S opinion, you should be seeing the urologist about this. I wouldn't put a lot of confidence in what the family doctor says. I bet the urologist will want to see another PSA much sooner than 12 months from now.",

      "Content": "Fairwind is right. No need to panic over 0.1, but stay vigilant. If you show consecutive rises, you will have to consider salvage radiation (SRT for short). The hard part will be the waiting. Most doctors would not initiate SRT at 0.1, until there is a pattern. The reason is that there is a subset of men who rise to 0.1, but no further. To radiate those men would unnecessarily subject them to possible side effects. In the long run, salvage radiation appears to cure, or at least give a durable response, to 25-30% of patients. That's the long run. In the shorter run (3 years) it seems to be effective about half the time. In the short run, it causes PSA to fall to undetectable levels in about 3/4 of men. So the farther you look out, the more dismal it gets, but it's still something. Lots of cancer patients would jump for a 1 in 3 second chance at a cure. Usually, the only way to know if it's going to work is to try it. Imaging is not helpful, usually, with PSA at that low level. There is a nomogram on the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center website that can help you estimate your odds of success with SRT, but it's only a rough estimate, and you have to keep in mind that it is most accurate for large statistical groups and is not a crystal ball for an individual. You will need your medical record to complete the nomogram. If you and your doctor decide on SRT, you won't know for sure if it's going to help. The good news is that for most men, the side effects of SRT--if you experience any--are likely to be mild and transitory. Some men do experience increased sexual dysfunction, some don't. A lot of us get some mild bowel/rectal problems that go away. For a few men, side effects are worse, and a tiny percentage of men are injured by radiation. The downside of the gamble is pretty limited, and the upside is tremendous--a second chance at a cure. If you visit HealingWell.com's prostate cancer forum, there are several guys who were successfully treated with SRT, and a few that were not helped. There was a recent thread about SRT here: http://www.healingwell.com/community...f=35&m=2583429 In my case, SRT seems to have worked. My PSA quickly fell to undetectable after treatment, and has stayed there since. I have no side effects at this point that I can tie to the radiation treatments. My ED did not get worse after SRT and in fact has improved over the past few years. I get tested again this month. It's been 6 years since I started SRT, nearly 7 years since my diagnosis. My full story is in my blog at http://pcabefore50.blogspot.com .

      "Content": "Gimmy, the controversy about PSA screening does not extend to RetiredGuy's case. He is being tested, not screened, and even PSA screening critics like Ablin say that PSA is useful in the post-treatment setting. Here is Ablin in the NYT op-ed piece you cited: \"Prostate-specific antigen testing does have a place. After treatment for prostate cancer, for instance, a rapidly rising score indicates a return of the disease. And men with a family history of prostate cancer should probably get tested regularly. If their score starts skyrocketing, it could mean cancer.\" http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/opinion/10Ablin.html Originally Posted by Gimmy Retired guy, in a march 11, 2010 op- ed piece in the new York times written by ricard ablin the inventor of the psa test , he calls the psa \" a profit driven public health disaster\" and recommends not doing psa test because it cannot detect prostate cancer,etc.....the American medical association recommended no more testing on may 25, 2012.... The AAFP and the uspstf also recommended not doing psa test on may 22, 2012.... Hope this info helps you. Having already been through all this ,I wish i'd never heard of the psa test......I hope you stop taking the test, don' t even think about it you'll almost for sure going to die of something else many years down the road...enjoy your retirement ....

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Iamthewife As I've said before here, my H doesn't want to talk about his cancer, at least not the important things. I asked him if he is having his PSA checked during radiation and he said he's not. He then went on to tell me that you don't start hormone therapy during radiation, only before. I hadn't mentioned hormones, so I know he was being defensive and wanting to shut me down. Here's my concern - I don't think his doctors are being honest with him. His cancer has recurred in less than 1 year and his psadt is less than 3 months. Based on this chart from Johns Hopkins, he can't be cured. His chances of surviving 15 years are about 1%. How can they suggest to him that radiation could cure him in this case? http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer829.php The way I read the chart, he has a 74% chance of prostate cancer-specific survival at 5 years. Not so great longer out, but that data was based on men being treated back when salvage radiation was much cruder, and it no doubt includes men who didn't even try radiation after surgery. I would encourage you to look at a nomogram which has been validated and re-validated, predicting the outcome of salvage radiation. https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/pros...iation-therapy I put in some numbers (not knowing all the details of your husband's pathology) and it looks like he should be around the 44% probability of being free of PSA progression 6 years later--that was about where my probability was. (I assumed negative lymph and seminal vesicle invasion--if he had either one of those it will downgrade his odds a little). If you can get your hands on his records, you can get a clearer picture, but it's far from doomsday. A lot of cancer patients would give their left...arm for a 40% chance of a cure. Again, I was in almost exactly the same position: rapidly doubling PSA, positive margins, Gleason 7, no hormone therapy, etc. and things have worked out very well for me. There is good reason for the two of you to be optimistic. One last thought: a study by Trock in 2008 showed that men with rapidly doubling PSA have the most to gain from salvage radiation: \"Feb. 12, 2008 -- For the first time, researchers have shown that radiation can increase the odds of survival for men whose PSA levels rapidly rise after surgery for prostate cancer...[t]he greatest benefits of so-called salvage radiotherapy were observed in men with rapidly rising PSA levels, says researcher Bruce Trock, MD, associate professor of urology, epidemiology, oncology, and environmental health sciences at Johns Hopkins University.\" http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer...-for-radiation",

But if your dad is looking at MDV3100 (now Xtandi) isn't he already on/has been on hormone therapy? Dr. Scholz, a major medical oncologist specializing in prostate cancer, addresses this question here: http://prostatesnatchers.blogspot.co...1_archive.html and the answer would seem to be that it's unclear what \"extra\" sexual side effects Xtandi brings to the table, since trial participants were already on Lupron, which suppresses sexual function. I'm just an outside observer in the world of advanced prostate cancer. You might want to ask this question on HealingWell.com, where you are more likely to find MDV3100 (Xtandi) users who can give you a better \"inside picture\". Or have your dad ask his oncologist.

      "Content": "Good post, Putt, and my condolences on the loss of your wife. Personally, I don't think of myself as being cured, but edging closer to it every year, like an asymtote--a curve that continues to move closer to a line without ever touching. As time goes by I think I'm possibly cured, and after a number of years I'll say I'm probably cured. But remission is still a better word. I don't know if I'll ever state flatly that I'm cured. I don't think my doctors ever used the word. My dad was treated decades ago, and his PSA never rose above 0.1 afterwards. He's in his early 80's now and facing other health issues. I feel like he's cured--or at the very least, as good as cured, since it's so unlikely that prostate cancer will ever again bother him. (He had cryo, by the way). He has been vigilant all the way.",

(I wish they'd computerize it as promised at nomograms.org, but it hasn't appeared yet). A lot of cancer patients would jump through hoops for a 50% chance of a cure--and it sounds like your dad has made an informed decision to go for it. I wish him well. He has everything to gain, and not much to lose, from trying salvage radiation. Today's radiation techniques are much more precise than just a few years ago. IMRT, which I had, is a big leap over 3D conformal, which was a huge leap over the crude blocks used before. And now there's IGRT which goes a step further in precision. As you probably know, there is no sensation (except for boredom) during the treatment itself. If side effects appear, it probably won't be for a couple of weeks at least. In my case, I had some rectal irritation that really didn't get too annoying until the very end of treatment. My doctor prescribed Proctofoam, which worked wonderfully at relieving the symptoms, and in the year or so that has passed, the bowel symptoms have largely gone away on their own. Compared to surgery it was a piece of cake. Good luck to your dad.",

      "Content": "Don't panic. Your doctor is suggesting that you may be a candidate for salvage radiation. That's a second chance at a cure. I think getting re-tested is fine. If your PSA shows any further rise, I would move forward with consultations in regards to radiation. If your PSA holds steady, it probably won't hurt to wait. You would want to get started before your PSA hits 1.0, as research shows men who start before 1.0 do better than those who are on the other side of the mark. Whether or not salvage radiation does indeed cure someone of PCa depends on whether or not the cancer is still localized to the area where the prostate was. If it is still localized, chances of a durable response to radiation are excellent. If it is not localized, but systemic, radiation won't cure. Overall, the odds of success are generally thought of as 50/50. But if you have your complete history at hand, you can use the salvage nomogram at nomograms.org to get a better idea of the odds. I had a prostatectomy in 2006, and my PSA started rising soon afterward. I had radiation last year. In my case, I was ready to go for salvage radiation even if my chances were 1 in 10, maybe lower. My odds were better, but far from a sure bet. It seems to have worked. Only time, lots of time, will tell. You needn't fear the treatments themselves. They are completely painless, devoid of any sensation except perhaps boredom for a few minutes each day. Side effects are possible, but for most men they are mild and temporary. My blog at http://pcabefore50.blogspot.com details my experiences with salvage radiation, and links to research I found useful. There are others on this board, besides me, who have found themselves in your situation. Sometimes I go to Catholic Mass with my wife, in spite of my agnosticism. I find something the priest says at the end reassuring. I'm not sure if it's part of the standard \"script\" followed by priests, but in his benediction, he asks for freedom from undue anxiety. That is what I wish for you. Freedom from undue anxiety. Hope. There's plenty of reason to be hopeful.

      "Content": "I see that I do have enough info for the flow chart. * Pre-RT PSA less than 2.0 (assumed) * Gleason 4-7 * negative margins (I assume this is what you mean by no margins--this is a critical piece of information. Negative margins means there was no cancer at the cut edge of the tissue removed). * No node or vesicle invasion * Doubling time less than 10 months ( it came out to .69 years, or 8.28 months, calculated on http://kevin.phys.unm.edu/psa/6formg.html ) Going through the flow chart, the odds of salvage radiation resulting in progression-free status 4 years out is 48%. If the margins were POSITIVE, on the other hand, the 4 year outlook is 57% chance of being progression free. The reason is that positive margins provide a logical explanation for a local recurrence (cancer left behind in the prostate bed). A caution: I don't have the exact dates of the PSA tests. I ran the PSADT by putting in each score 3 months after the previous, starting with a random date. The issues of margins caused me CONSIDERABLE angst in my own personal case, because the uro told me I had negative margins, and even wrote that on the cover sheet he sent to the radiation oncologist. But when the oncologist read the actual surgical report, he found that I had positive margins, which increased my odds of success. Keep in mind that statistics are just statistics, and that all these studies are backward looking by necessity. The patients involved were sometimes undergoing radiation at lower doses than is delivered safely today, with equipment that is outmoded by today's standards--so these studies are most likely overly pessimistic.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by johnT As Replicant pointed out seminal vessicle involvement and a rapid doubling time in PSA are both indicative of a systemic disease rather than a local reoccurrance, all making SRT less effective. Three consecutive rises in psa after SRT is an indication of failure. At this point I would be consulting with a medical oncologist that specializes in Prostate cancer for his recommendations. There are late studies that show that by adding a short course (6 months of HT) along with radiation added a significant benefit to G7 patients. I agree with JohnT. The PSA is almost certainly coming from prostate cancer, and it's likely that the cancer is systemic. It would not be thought of as curable at this point, but hopefully manageable for a long time with hormone therapy. I also agree that your father should be in the care of a medical oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer. That will optimize his chances for keeping the cancer at bay. The strategy now shifts from defeating the cancer to stalling it. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "It seems like you DO have a high baseline BUT you are so far above normal now for your age, as Skippy wrote, that it looks ominous, especially when you consider the trend over time and the fact that Cipro only slightly affected it. Perhaps this is caused by a benign condition such as BPH or prostatitis. But maybe you have prostate cancer. I'm surprised you haven't been re-biopsied at this point. A \"free PSA\" test, which measures to the ratio of free to total PSA, could also shed some light on things. Like Skippy says, I would not mess around with this. If you don't have access to a top-notch (world class) urologist, you should travel to one, and get to the bottom of this. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "I took 3 weeks off (as I remember) probably a little more than I needed for my desk job. I could have gone back as soon as the catheter was out. My catheter stayed in a full two weeks. I started to recover rapidly at home, even with the catheter, and started puttering around (against medical advice, I suppose, at times). Cooking a little, pruning some bushes, even drove myself to a restaurant one day. The incisions weren't much of an issue, neither was pain. The catheter was just a major annoyance the last several days. I was pretty young at the time (43) which was probably in my favor, and I didn't have any complications. I would try to follow the doctor's advice, and take a few unpaid days if necessary. Maybe your husband will heal rapidly and the doctor will update the advice. Best wishes.",

My concern at the time, as I recall, was a PSA of 0.2 after prostatectomy. That was my second test result after surgery, the first being less than 0.1. After prostatectomy, PSA should fall below 0.1 and stay there. In the email response, the chemist told me that the lab experienced variation of up to 0.1 ng/mL between machines. That is, if the same sample were tested on two different pieces of equipment, it might be different by as much as 0.1 ng/mL. Well, that wasn't extremely comforting, because it meant that I was still probably no lower than 0.1, and maybe as high as 0.3. At the time I was trying to assess my odds of progressing further, and I had some studies at hand that showed the odds, depending on your present PSA. Being 0.2 or 0.3 was not a good sign. The chemist suggested getting an ultrasensitive PSA assay done for greater accuracy. My doctors aren't fans of ultrasensitive testing, and I don't really want the anxiety that goes along with watching numbers bounce around from 0.03 to .05 and so forth, so I haven't pressed for it. Walsh (p. 380) says that Daniel Chan of Johns Hopkins \"trusts the sensitivity of assays down to 0.1 ng/mL, or slightly less than that.\" I assume he's talking about the standard (non-ultrasensitive) test. That sounds in line with what the lab person told me. John is right--you really need to look at a trend of PSA over time. bb is asking about PSA in the pre-treatment stage. Since he has a prostate, PSA can be affected by several things. Variation in the lab is certainly a possibility, and so is inflammation, infection, prostate stimulation through DRE or sex, etc. bb asked about doubling time...PSA doubling time is calculated by dividing the natural log of 2 by the slope of the relation between the log of PSA and the time of PSA measurement. (whew--thank goodness for computers!) PSADT calculators do this using all of the available dates and measurements. In my uneducated opinion, it would seem like you would need quite a few measurements over many months to accurately graph the curve. But that's just my amateur's view. IMHO, in the post-surgical setting, PSA is a more useful tool than it is before surgery takes place. If my PSA goes up, I know it's not because of prostatitis, BPH, sex, or exam. There's nothing left there to irritate. (I know the surgeon didn't leave a glob of prostate behind because of high resolution CT scans and the old \"finger wave\" exam). It would almost certainly be because of cancer, once lab variation was ruled out by subsequent or repeat tests.",

      "Content": "Walsh, on p. 164 of \"Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\", says: \"If you have a low PSA level (between 1 and 4 ng/ml), any increase is alarming. In a study using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, Carter and colleagues found that PSA increases greater than 0.2-0.4 ng/ml per year were predictors of death from prostate cancer. Currently, change in PSA over time is the most valuable tool we have for interpreting PSA and for predicting prostate cancer, including whether it is life threatening.\" In my LAYPERSON'S opinion, you should be seeing the urologist about this. I wouldn't put a lot of confidence in what the family doctor says. I bet the urologist will want to see another PSA much sooner than 12 months from now.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by arabelladuffy Hi, I started a thread earlier in regards to my fathers situation with stage 4 aggressive pc. I don't want to ramble on about it again, so I will try to make this very short. He is at stage 4, mets to his bones, his cancer type is aggressive, he has refused chemo, radiation and surgery. He is receiving hormone therapy, and some type of bone rebuilding stuff, also he is on an alternative medication called Cesium Chloride. He had a CT scan in January... which is when he was diagnosed, and another one last week to see where he is at now. Today, he spoke to his nurse, who informed him that she saw improvement. Is this even possible? I thought hormone therapy slowed things down, not improved? Either way it is good news. Hormone therapy can cause tumors to shrink and PSA to fall. It can even (I think) make tumors disappear from CT scans. Patients often get relief from symptoms and can have their lives extended. But the cancer is still there. So hormone therapy can \"improve\" things in the sense that it can, at least for a while, beat the cancer back *and* slow the progression. Eventually though, given enough time, the patient becomes hormone refractory, where the cancer doesn't need androgens like it did before. At that point most men would move on to treatments like ketoconozale, taxotere, Provenge, Zytiga, MDV3100, and the other therapies coming along. My guess--only a guess--would be that the improvement reported comes from the hormone therapy, and is similar to what most men experience on HT--a significant palliative effect.",

      "Content": "I had a quick recurrence (at 9 months) after surgery and rapid doubling time (less than 3 months) and positive margins. I also had the same Gleason as your husband, and like your husband, fairly young (44 in my case at the time) I did not have hormone therapy. It was not really a choice laid out to me. I just had the radiation. The advantage to NOT having HT with SRT is that you get a clearer picture sooner afterwards. If I had had HT along with it, I would have suspected HT was masking the effect of radiation for some time afterwards. On the other hand, there are studies that show HT along with radiation is better than just radiation. Early recurrence and rapid doubling does not always indicate distant metastases, and your husband's positive margins provide a local explanation for the PSA rise. Hopefully, those margins indicate some tumor was left behind at the prostate bed and now radiation can mop it up. I'm doing fine several years out now. Here's to your husband having a similar outcome. R. Originally Posted by Iamthewife Hi everyone, My H was diagnosed at age 50 with prostate cancer in April 2014. Don't recall his exact numbers, but he went from ~3.6 to ~5.3 at his next check. Had Davinci RP in late May 2014, PSA after was undetectible. Pathology report indicates G7 (3+4), 3 positive margins, grade T2c. PSA rechecks every 3 months. His cancer recurred in less than a year. PSA of .06, a retest two weeks later was .07, and 3 months later it's .15. That means his doubling time is less than 3 months. He started salvage radiation last week. His oncologist said he was on the fence about hormone therapy with the radiation, so my H has opted for no hormones. Wanting to know if others have had early recurrence and rapid doubling time. Did your doctor tell you hormone treatment was 50/50? I've read that early recurrence and PSADT <3 months could indicate distant mestastices, and that hormone therapy with radiation could knock out both. Thoughts on where he is in treatment and the advice he's been given?",

Personally, I don't think of myself as being cured, but edging closer to it every year, like an asymtote--a curve that continues to move closer to a line without ever touching. As time goes by I think I'm possibly cured, and after a number of years I'll say I'm probably cured. But remission is still a better word. I don't know if I'll ever state flatly that I'm cured. I don't think my doctors ever used the word. My dad was treated decades ago, and his PSA never rose above 0.1 afterwards. He's in his early 80's now and facing other health issues. I feel like he's cured--or at the very least, as good as cured, since it's so unlikely that prostate cancer will ever again bother him. (He had cryo, by the way). He has been vigilant all the way.",

Like the others said, there's a balloon with saline keeping the catheter from coming out. In my case, the nurse pushed saline up the cath into my bladder (this is painless, but odd) and when I told her I felt full, she stopped. She did something to empty the balloon, said \"ready?\" and then swiftly slid it out. I exhaled the whole time, mainly so I'd have something to focus on. It was uncomfortable, but not painful, and it was over in a few seconds, followed by a rush of my bladder contents (she had prepared for this with a pan at my feet). It was glorious to be free of the catheter, and the first urination on my own after the removal was equally glorious.",

      "Content": "The six year tool yields more encouraging results. I made some assumptions--you can tell me later if they were correct, but those items where I made assumptions don't have a huge bearing on the result. Prostatectomy PSA 10: 20 points Gleason 7: 20 points Seminal = no: 0 points extracapsular extension = no: 0 points (assumed, but this factor only would add 2 points at the most if the answer was yes) Margins: Negative: 20 points (would be zero for positive margins) persistently elevated PSA = no: 0 points Pre-rad PSA 0.5 (assumed): 15 points PSADT 8 months: 65 points ADT=no: 0 points Radiation dose 70 Gy (assumed--this is what I had and is fairly standard): 10 points Total points: 150 6 year progression free probability (PFP)= 60% Now, bear in mind I made plenty of assumptions, and this nomogram is a ruler and paper affair--you might get a slightly different answer and that is why I would suggest getting the article. The sooner the person starts also affects the total points and the PFP. If, instead of starting at 0.5, he started at 1.0, there would be a net gain of 15 points and the PFP would drop to about 45%. Being progression free 6 years later is not the same thing as being cured, but since most men who fail do so within the first two years, 6 years is a pretty good milestone, I think. Hope that helps!",

      "Content": "whether tis nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous cancer, or to take up radiation and end them.. Sorry! Just following the theme! The overall odds are actually much better, especially in the short run (5 years). They drop down to something like 25-35% in the long run (look on the web for studies by Catalona and others by Andrew Stephenson, or check out my blog where I have summaries and links). However, for certain groups the odds are much better. There are several important factors. If you have access to a medical library, I suggest getting a copy of \"Predicting the Outcome of Salvage Radiation Therapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy\" by Andrew Stephenson, Peter Scardino, Michael Kattan, and several other big guns in prostate cancer. It was published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol. 25, Number 15, May 20, 2007, pp. 2035-2041. I can help you obtain a copy if you cannot otherwise do so. Contact me on my blog if you wish. Or, if you provide the following, I will run the numbers through the 4 year flow chart: current PSA, Gleason score from surgery, surgical margins (pos or neg), and at least a rough idea of his PSA doubling time (I can calculate this if you provide his post-surgery PSA scores). And if you have additional information, I can run it through the predicted 6 year progression free probability nomogram. What's needed besides the above items: seminal vesicle invasion (yes or no), lymph node invasion (yes or no), persistently elevated PSA after surgery (yes or no), and whether or not hormone therapy (ADT) was done in conjunction with surgery. I ran my own stats through this as I decided what to do. I have about a 58% chance of being progression free at 6 years. Those are pretty good odds, considering the ease of treatments (couldn't be any easier), and low rate of relatively mild and temporary side effects. This is not the radiation therapy of the past! So I underwent radiation, and it knocked my PSA into the basement. Bottom line: many men can benefit from salvage radiation. I certainly did. Stephenson, the leading researcher in salvage radiation, says \"Nearly half of all patients with recurrent prostatectomy have a long-term PSA response to SRT (salvage radiotherapy) when treatment is administered at the earliest sign of recurrence. The nomogram we developed predicts the outcome of SRT and should prove valuable for decision making for patients with a rising PSA level.\" Sometimes with prostate cancer, there is no rush. But with salvage radiation, time is of the essence (assuming the patient is a candidate). Some men have a considerably better than 50-50 chance. For example, a man with a pre-radiation PSA of less than 2.0, positive margins, and a PSA doubling time of more than 10 months has a 69% chance of being free from PSA progression at 4 years. Optimally, Stephenson says, you want to start before PSA hits 0.5, but if you start before it gets to 1.0 you're still in pretty good shape. A very recent study, just released, is also optimistic about salvage radiation, showing that men who get radiation are about 60% less to die from prostate cancer: http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer...-for-radiation Hope that helps--let me know if I can run the numbers for you. When I was getting radiation, I often thought of a Shakespearean line: \"Out, damn'd spot! out, I say!\u0097One; two: why, then 'tis time to do't.\" --Shakespeare, Macbeth (Act V, Scene 1)",

      "Content": "I see that I do have enough info for the flow chart. * Pre-RT PSA less than 2.0 (assumed) * Gleason 4-7 * negative margins (I assume this is what you mean by no margins--this is a critical piece of information. Negative margins means there was no cancer at the cut edge of the tissue removed). * No node or vesicle invasion * Doubling time less than 10 months ( it came out to .69 years, or 8.28 months, calculated on http://kevin.phys.unm.edu/psa/6formg.html ) Going through the flow chart, the odds of salvage radiation resulting in progression-free status 4 years out is 48%. If the margins were POSITIVE, on the other hand, the 4 year outlook is 57% chance of being progression free. The reason is that positive margins provide a logical explanation for a local recurrence (cancer left behind in the prostate bed). A caution: I don't have the exact dates of the PSA tests. I ran the PSADT by putting in each score 3 months after the previous, starting with a random date. The issues of margins caused me CONSIDERABLE angst in my own personal case, because the uro told me I had negative margins, and even wrote that on the cover sheet he sent to the radiation oncologist. But when the oncologist read the actual surgical report, he found that I had positive margins, which increased my odds of success. Keep in mind that statistics are just statistics, and that all these studies are backward looking by necessity. The patients involved were sometimes undergoing radiation at lower doses than is delivered safely today, with equipment that is outmoded by today's standards--so these studies are most likely overly pessimistic.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by johnT As Replicant pointed out seminal vessicle involvement and a rapid doubling time in PSA are both indicative of a systemic disease rather than a local reoccurrance, all making SRT less effective. Three consecutive rises in psa after SRT is an indication of failure. At this point I would be consulting with a medical oncologist that specializes in Prostate cancer for his recommendations. There are late studies that show that by adding a short course (6 months of HT) along with radiation added a significant benefit to G7 patients. I agree with JohnT. The PSA is almost certainly coming from prostate cancer, and it's likely that the cancer is systemic. It would not be thought of as curable at this point, but hopefully manageable for a long time with hormone therapy. I also agree that your father should be in the care of a medical oncologist who specializes in prostate cancer. That will optimize his chances for keeping the cancer at bay. The strategy now shifts from defeating the cancer to stalling it. Best wishes.",

The sooner the person starts also affects the total points and the PFP. If, instead of starting at 0.5, he started at 1.0, there would be a net gain of 15 points and the PFP would drop to about 45%. Being progression free 6 years later is not the same thing as being cured, but since most men who fail do so within the first two years, 6 years is a pretty good milestone, I think.

(I wish they'd computerize it as promised at nomograms.org, but it hasn't appeared yet). A lot of cancer patients would jump through hoops for a 50% chance of a cure--and it sounds like your dad has made an informed decision to go for it. I wish him well. He has everything to gain, and not much to lose, from trying salvage radiation. Today's radiation techniques are much more precise than just a few years ago. IMRT, which I had, is a big leap over 3D conformal, which was a huge leap over the crude blocks used before. And now there's IGRT which goes a step further in precision. As you probably know, there is no sensation (except for boredom) during the treatment itself. If side effects appear, it probably won't be for a couple of weeks at least. In my case, I had some rectal irritation that really didn't get too annoying until the very end of treatment. My doctor prescribed Proctofoam, which worked wonderfully at relieving the symptoms, and in the year or so that has passed, the bowel symptoms have largely gone away on their own. Compared to surgery it was a piece of cake. Good luck to your dad.",

      "Content": "whether tis nobler to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous cancer, or to take up radiation and end them.. Sorry! Just following the theme! The overall odds are actually much better, especially in the short run (5 years). They drop down to something like 25-35% in the long run (look on the web for studies by Catalona and others by Andrew Stephenson, or check out my blog where I have summaries and links). However, for certain groups the odds are much better. There are several important factors. If you have access to a medical library, I suggest getting a copy of \"Predicting the Outcome of Salvage Radiation Therapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy\" by Andrew Stephenson, Peter Scardino, Michael Kattan, and several other big guns in prostate cancer. It was published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, Vol. 25, Number 15, May 20, 2007, pp. 2035-2041. I can help you obtain a copy if you cannot otherwise do so. Contact me on my blog if you wish. Or, if you provide the following, I will run the numbers through the 4 year flow chart: current PSA, Gleason score from surgery, surgical margins (pos or neg), and at least a rough idea of his PSA doubling time (I can calculate this if you provide his post-surgery PSA scores). And if you have additional information, I can run it through the predicted 6 year progression free probability nomogram. What's needed besides the above items: seminal vesicle invasion (yes or no), lymph node invasion (yes or no), persistently elevated PSA after surgery (yes or no), and whether or not hormone therapy (ADT) was done in conjunction with surgery. I ran my own stats through this as I decided what to do. I have about a 58% chance of being progression free at 6 years. Those are pretty good odds, considering the ease of treatments (couldn't be any easier), and low rate of relatively mild and temporary side effects. This is not the radiation therapy of the past! So I underwent radiation, and it knocked my PSA into the basement. Bottom line: many men can benefit from salvage radiation. I certainly did. Stephenson, the leading researcher in salvage radiation, says \"Nearly half of all patients with recurrent prostatectomy have a long-term PSA response to SRT (salvage radiotherapy) when treatment is administered at the earliest sign of recurrence. The nomogram we developed predicts the outcome of SRT and should prove valuable for decision making for patients with a rising PSA level.\" Sometimes with prostate cancer, there is no rush. But with salvage radiation, time is of the essence (assuming the patient is a candidate). Some men have a considerably better than 50-50 chance. For example, a man with a pre-radiation PSA of less than 2.0, positive margins, and a PSA doubling time of more than 10 months has a 69% chance of being free from PSA progression at 4 years. Optimally, Stephenson says, you want to start before PSA hits 0.5, but if you start before it gets to 1.0 you're still in pretty good shape. A very recent study, just released, is also optimistic about salvage radiation, showing that men who get radiation are about 60% less to die from prostate cancer: http://www.webmd.com/prostate-cancer...-for-radiation Hope that helps--let me know if I can run the numbers for you. When I was getting radiation, I often thought of a Shakespearean line: \"Out, damn'd spot! out, I say!\u0097One; two: why, then 'tis time to do't.\" --Shakespeare, Macbeth (Act V, Scene 1)",

      "Content": "Similar to what the others wrote, I can tell you that I experienced some bowel irritation (more frequent bowel movements, verging on diarrhea) that became painful. My doctor prescribed over-the-counter treatment for the diarrhea (Loperamide, sold as Imodium in the U.S.), and a topical foam that I applied...well, internally (but itw was easy and totally relieved the pain). Once treatments were over, the bowel issues subsided quickly and I have no problems there now. I didn't have any urinary problems from radiation, nor did it increase the sexual dysfunction I had from surgery. In fact, I've gotten better in that regard over the past few years. I did not notice any fatigue, but then again, I had radiation at a much younger age than most. I think my experience is fairly common, and in line with those of the guys above. Some people do better, some worse, but in general the side effects from external radiation for prostate cancer are mild and temporary. The treatments themselves are very easy, and involve just lying still for a few minutes. No sensation at all other than mild boredom. I agree that what he's gone through from the hormone therapy is probably much worse than anything the radiation will bring on. With kind regards,",

      "Content": "I have a couple of thoughts--first, I don't think I would stick with a non-communicative doctor. You've got a lot riding on this. Second, SRT might be worth a shot. The negative margin status doesn't help your odds of success, but it's just one of several factors. Another crucial factor is your PSA before you start SRT. Statistically, men who start at 0.5 or below do much better. You might want to try the nomogram (a predictive tool) for salvage radiation at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center: http://nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/...onTherapy.aspx You'll want to have your pathology report in hand, and know your PSA history. From your posting, I would guess you have all that. SRT is always a gamble, but for most men the downside to the gamble is greatly outweighed by the upside of a potential cure.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dunbar Hi all and thanks so much for your responses. Just two questions Replicant - hope you dont mind: 1. Why did you select the treatment you had - any specific reason? 2. Did your (our) age limit the sideeffects? I will definitely research as much as I can regarding surgens for my selected treatment. Great advise about the number of procedures ThatBiopsyHurt - thanks! I am quite comfortable with my hospital - St Vincents, Sydney - however really need to find the best surgeon there. Are they happy to give me the numbers, statistics etc? Really don't want to upset the guy who is cutting me open.... Thanks again Dunbar Hi Dunbar. In response to your questions to me: 1.) I have to admit, I'm a bit of a geek and I was attracted to the technology of the Da Vinci robot, which was pretty new at the time--and not even installed at my hospital yet. It sounded like it would be a lot easier to undergo than traditional surgery. My urologist was enthusiastic about it. Unfortunately, he was very low on the learning curve, and that might (I can never know for sure) account for my positive surgical margin, post-surgery rising PSA, and need for radiation. As for why surgery...being 43, I wanted something that had a very well-known, established track record, and the prostatectomy certainly fit that bill. I was also influenced by the idea that if it failed, salvage radiation probably wouldn't be a huge deal. On the other hand, if I went with radiation first, a salvage prostatectomy would be a very tricky prospect with high rates of serious side effects. With the passage of time, I'm not sure that's such a compelling reason. For example, in my case, if I had done radiation first, maybe it would have wiped out all the cancer and I would not have had to deal with the (possible) surgeon's error and positive margin. Maybe the argument about being able to do radiation after surgery but not vice versa only *seems* to hold water because so many surgeons fail to get it all, leaving a need for radiation to mop up the remnants. There's no way to know for sure. And in hindsight, the external radiation was far, far easier than the surgery. I *hated* the foley catheter, and was depressed the whole time I was in the hospital. The surgery took 7 or 8 hours (normally a Da Vinci takes half that) because my surgeon was being proctored by a Mayo surgeon, and advised by a company rep from the Da Vinci manufacturer. So they were moving very cautiously. As a result, I was under general for a long time, and when I woke up, I felt terrible and for a minute didn't remember what had happened. I thought I might be dying, in fact. (\"You're not dying, you're in recovery\", said a nurse. \"He's a glass half-empty type\", said my wife.) I had never had major surgery before, and make no mistake--this is major surgery, even when done laparoscopically and with a robot. 2.) I think my relative youth helped. Being young with prostate cancer is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, being young can help you recover sexual function faster and to a greater degree, if you have surgery and the surgeon can spare the nerves. It probably also helps with urinary continence. On the other hand, you have a lot of time for a recurrence, and a lot of time for the cancer to kill you if you do have a recurrence. The median age at diagnosis is 67, according to SEER data. The average lifespan for a man in the U.S. is 75. So take a guy who's 67. He has surgery, and three years later, his PSA starts to rise. It usually takes several years for a biochemical recurrence to develop into detectable mets. And then a few years after that to cause death, assuming he doesn't do hormone therapy. But he probably would. And taxotere, provenge, etc after that. So the odds that he's going to die from prostate cancer rather than with it are pretty slim. Now take a guy who's 43--like you and me (at diagnosis). If our PSA rises within a few years, and let's say salvage radiation fails to cure--time is not on our side. If we don't do anything else, PCa will probably kill us before a heart attack or stroke, the usual way men die in the US. Even if we do start hormone therapy, and even if it does work, it's not likely to work long enough (in our young states) to be \"as good as\" a cure, like it is for a lot of older patients. So in a nutshell, yes, I think my youth helped. I'm doing very well in terms of continence and pretty well in the bedroom. But I always have in the back of my mind that if my PSA starts to rise anytime soon, I will be in serious trouble. My dad, on the other hand was treated successfully with cryo about 20 years ago. At his age (80) now, he can forget about PSA testing. Believe it or not, up until just now he's been getting an annual PSA *and* DRE. Ugh. If it starts to rise now, it's very, very unlikely to get him before his heart does.",

      "Content": "notme, from the website you linked to, I went into the diagnosis section. Indeed, this site is NOT claiming that MRI can diagnose prostate cancer. As I wrote in the other response, the site is talking about using MRI to avoid blind biopsies, to target where the needle goes. Quote from site (emphasis supplied by me) Diagnosis Prostate cancer is most often discovered by physical examination or by screening blood tests, such as the PSA (prostate specific antigen) test. Suspected prostate cancer is typically confirmed by removing a piece of the prostate (biopsy) and examining it under a microscope. However, blind needle biopsies spread cancer cells and only yield a 25 % success rate in finding cancer. Recent advancements in imaging technology such as prostate 3.0 Tesla MRI with Spectroscopy allow physicians to locate suspicious areas of disease and then performed targeted biopsies improving diagnostic outcomes by up to 40%. In addition to locating suspicious lesions, 3.0 Tesla with Spectroscopy can determine whether prostate cancer has spread beyond the capsule. http://www.mrisusa.com/Prostate%20Cancer.html",

      "Content": "Walsh is also a believer in radiation over surgery for patients 70 and over, according to his book. On page 240 he says the ideal radical prostatectomy patient is under 70, and the ideal radiation therapy patient is over 60 (but later he says that radiation is a valid choice for men of any age). On page 243, he says surgery \"is not ideal for older patients.\" He likes radiation for all stages, while he recommends surgery for T1b, T1c, T2, and some T1a patients. (p. 240). He goes on to say (p. 243) that age is a factor because men over 70 often have cancer that is more advanced than the biopsy would lead the doctor to believe initially, and less likely to be curable, because it's been growing longer. He also doesn't like the fact that surgical side effects get worse the older the patient is at the time of surgery. Finally, and remember who's talking here (the best known prostate surgeon) on page 244 he says \"because men over age 70 aren't likely to live as long as men twenty years younger, it's difficult to show that radical prostatectomy actually does more than radiation therapy to lengthen life expectancy in these men.\" I highly recommend Walsh's book, \"Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" (2007 ed.)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dunbar Hi all and thanks so much for your responses. Just two questions Replicant - hope you dont mind: 1. Why did you select the treatment you had - any specific reason? 2. Did your (our) age limit the sideeffects? I will definitely research as much as I can regarding surgens for my selected treatment. Great advise about the number of procedures ThatBiopsyHurt - thanks! I am quite comfortable with my hospital - St Vincents, Sydney - however really need to find the best surgeon there. Are they happy to give me the numbers, statistics etc? Really don't want to upset the guy who is cutting me open.... Thanks again Dunbar Hi Dunbar. In response to your questions to me: 1.) I have to admit, I'm a bit of a geek and I was attracted to the technology of the Da Vinci robot, which was pretty new at the time--and not even installed at my hospital yet. It sounded like it would be a lot easier to undergo than traditional surgery. My urologist was enthusiastic about it. Unfortunately, he was very low on the learning curve, and that might (I can never know for sure) account for my positive surgical margin, post-surgery rising PSA, and need for radiation. As for why surgery...being 43, I wanted something that had a very well-known, established track record, and the prostatectomy certainly fit that bill. I was also influenced by the idea that if it failed, salvage radiation probably wouldn't be a huge deal. On the other hand, if I went with radiation first, a salvage prostatectomy would be a very tricky prospect with high rates of serious side effects. With the passage of time, I'm not sure that's such a compelling reason. For example, in my case, if I had done radiation first, maybe it would have wiped out all the cancer and I would not have had to deal with the (possible) surgeon's error and positive margin. Maybe the argument about being able to do radiation after surgery but not vice versa only *seems* to hold water because so many surgeons fail to get it all, leaving a need for radiation to mop up the remnants. There's no way to know for sure. And in hindsight, the external radiation was far, far easier than the surgery. I *hated* the foley catheter, and was depressed the whole time I was in the hospital. The surgery took 7 or 8 hours (normally a Da Vinci takes half that) because my surgeon was being proctored by a Mayo surgeon, and advised by a company rep from the Da Vinci manufacturer. So they were moving very cautiously. As a result, I was under general for a long time, and when I woke up, I felt terrible and for a minute didn't remember what had happened. I thought I might be dying, in fact. (\"You're not dying, you're in recovery\", said a nurse. \"He's a glass half-empty type\", said my wife.) I had never had major surgery before, and make no mistake--this is major surgery, even when done laparoscopically and with a robot. 2.) I think my relative youth helped. Being young with prostate cancer is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, being young can help you recover sexual function faster and to a greater degree, if you have surgery and the surgeon can spare the nerves. It probably also helps with urinary continence. On the other hand, you have a lot of time for a recurrence, and a lot of time for the cancer to kill you if you do have a recurrence. The median age at diagnosis is 67, according to SEER data. The average lifespan for a man in the U.S. is 75. So take a guy who's 67. He has surgery, and three years later, his PSA starts to rise. It usually takes several years for a biochemical recurrence to develop into detectable mets. And then a few years after that to cause death, assuming he doesn't do hormone therapy. But he probably would. And taxotere, provenge, etc after that. So the odds that he's going to die from prostate cancer rather than with it are pretty slim. Now take a guy who's 43--like you and me (at diagnosis). If our PSA rises within a few years, and let's say salvage radiation fails to cure--time is not on our side. If we don't do anything else, PCa will probably kill us before a heart attack or stroke, the usual way men die in the US. Even if we do start hormone therapy, and even if it does work, it's not likely to work long enough (in our young states) to be \"as good as\" a cure, like it is for a lot of older patients. So in a nutshell, yes, I think my youth helped. I'm doing very well in terms of continence and pretty well in the bedroom. But I always have in the back of my mind that if my PSA starts to rise anytime soon, I will be in serious trouble. My dad, on the other hand was treated successfully with cryo about 20 years ago. At his age (80) now, he can forget about PSA testing. Believe it or not, up until just now he's been getting an annual PSA *and* DRE. Ugh. If it starts to rise now, it's very, very unlikely to get him before his heart does.",

My understanding is that overall, radiation including brachytherapy and exernal beam, are comparable to surgery in terms of long term control or cure.

I think Walsh's book is excellent, and although he's a surgeon, he doesn't advocate surgery across the board. The new patient's guide on the Prostate Cancer Foundation website is very helpful. If you're interested in seeds, you should get a second opinion from the best brachy guy in your area. Same with external beam. If you are confident in your robotic guy, and he's at a top hospital, and he has done lots (hundreds) of Da Vinci procedures and is getting good results in terms of surgical margins, I wouldn't be overly anxious about it. That route sounds fine to me. Just make sure you understand the pros and cons of all your options before committing. There's no need to rush. Best wishes.

      "Content": "notme, from the website you linked to, I went into the diagnosis section. Indeed, this site is NOT claiming that MRI can diagnose prostate cancer. As I wrote in the other response, the site is talking about using MRI to avoid blind biopsies, to target where the needle goes. Quote from site (emphasis supplied by me) Diagnosis Prostate cancer is most often discovered by physical examination or by screening blood tests, such as the PSA (prostate specific antigen) test. Suspected prostate cancer is typically confirmed by removing a piece of the prostate (biopsy) and examining it under a microscope. However, blind needle biopsies spread cancer cells and only yield a 25 % success rate in finding cancer. Recent advancements in imaging technology such as prostate 3.0 Tesla MRI with Spectroscopy allow physicians to locate suspicious areas of disease and then performed targeted biopsies improving diagnostic outcomes by up to 40%. In addition to locating suspicious lesions, 3.0 Tesla with Spectroscopy can determine whether prostate cancer has spread beyond the capsule. http://www.mrisusa.com/Prostate%20Cancer.html",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Dunbar Hi all and thanks so much for your responses. Just two questions Replicant - hope you dont mind: 1. Why did you select the treatment you had - any specific reason? 2. Did your (our) age limit the sideeffects? I will definitely research as much as I can regarding surgens for my selected treatment. Great advise about the number of procedures ThatBiopsyHurt - thanks! I am quite comfortable with my hospital - St Vincents, Sydney - however really need to find the best surgeon there. Are they happy to give me the numbers, statistics etc? Really don't want to upset the guy who is cutting me open.... Thanks again Dunbar Hi Dunbar. In response to your questions to me: 1.) I have to admit, I'm a bit of a geek and I was attracted to the technology of the Da Vinci robot, which was pretty new at the time--and not even installed at my hospital yet. It sounded like it would be a lot easier to undergo than traditional surgery. My urologist was enthusiastic about it. Unfortunately, he was very low on the learning curve, and that might (I can never know for sure) account for my positive surgical margin, post-surgery rising PSA, and need for radiation. As for why surgery...being 43, I wanted something that had a very well-known, established track record, and the prostatectomy certainly fit that bill. I was also influenced by the idea that if it failed, salvage radiation probably wouldn't be a huge deal. On the other hand, if I went with radiation first, a salvage prostatectomy would be a very tricky prospect with high rates of serious side effects. With the passage of time, I'm not sure that's such a compelling reason. For example, in my case, if I had done radiation first, maybe it would have wiped out all the cancer and I would not have had to deal with the (possible) surgeon's error and positive margin. Maybe the argument about being able to do radiation after surgery but not vice versa only *seems* to hold water because so many surgeons fail to get it all, leaving a need for radiation to mop up the remnants. There's no way to know for sure. And in hindsight, the external radiation was far, far easier than the surgery. I *hated* the foley catheter, and was depressed the whole time I was in the hospital. The surgery took 7 or 8 hours (normally a Da Vinci takes half that) because my surgeon was being proctored by a Mayo surgeon, and advised by a company rep from the Da Vinci manufacturer. So they were moving very cautiously. As a result, I was under general for a long time, and when I woke up, I felt terrible and for a minute didn't remember what had happened. I thought I might be dying, in fact. (\"You're not dying, you're in recovery\", said a nurse. \"He's a glass half-empty type\", said my wife.) I had never had major surgery before, and make no mistake--this is major surgery, even when done laparoscopically and with a robot. 2.) I think my relative youth helped. Being young with prostate cancer is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, being young can help you recover sexual function faster and to a greater degree, if you have surgery and the surgeon can spare the nerves. It probably also helps with urinary continence. On the other hand, you have a lot of time for a recurrence, and a lot of time for the cancer to kill you if you do have a recurrence. The median age at diagnosis is 67, according to SEER data. The average lifespan for a man in the U.S. is 75. So take a guy who's 67. He has surgery, and three years later, his PSA starts to rise. It usually takes several years for a biochemical recurrence to develop into detectable mets. And then a few years after that to cause death, assuming he doesn't do hormone therapy. But he probably would. And taxotere, provenge, etc after that. So the odds that he's going to die from prostate cancer rather than with it are pretty slim. Now take a guy who's 43--like you and me (at diagnosis). If our PSA rises within a few years, and let's say salvage radiation fails to cure--time is not on our side. If we don't do anything else, PCa will probably kill us before a heart attack or stroke, the usual way men die in the US. Even if we do start hormone therapy, and even if it does work, it's not likely to work long enough (in our young states) to be \"as good as\" a cure, like it is for a lot of older patients. So in a nutshell, yes, I think my youth helped. I'm doing very well in terms of continence and pretty well in the bedroom. But I always have in the back of my mind that if my PSA starts to rise anytime soon, I will be in serious trouble. My dad, on the other hand was treated successfully with cryo about 20 years ago. At his age (80) now, he can forget about PSA testing. Believe it or not, up until just now he's been getting an annual PSA *and* DRE. Ugh. If it starts to rise now, it's very, very unlikely to get him before his heart does.",

I'm not nervous when urinating, but sometimes I just cant go or I get a few drips out even though I really need to go. Anyways, I felt that could just be mild prostate issues because I'm getting older. Also, once in a while I have intense burning after I go. The reason why I'm posting though today is because a few weeks ago I ejaculated pure blood after having sex with my wife. It wasn't a cut or anything. What does this mean? I don't know what step to take next. I'm pretty concerned after what happened, any advice would be amazing and I appreciate everyone here...",

Finally, and remember who's talking here (the best known prostate surgeon) on page 244 he says \"because men over age 70 aren't likely to live as long as men twenty years younger, it's difficult to show that radical prostatectomy actually does more than radiation therapy to lengthen life expectancy in these men.\" I highly recommend Walsh's book, \"Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" (2007 ed.)",

      "Content": "Walsh, in his book on pages 178-179, addresses the question of needle tracking of tumor cells. He says \"This is an excellent question and a very common fear\", but basically if it were a serious risk, then \"the whole concept of early diagnosis and treatment wouldn't work. But many thousands of people--all of whom had initial biopsies to confirm what they had--have been cured of cancer.\" He goes on to say that sometimes cancer cells may escape into the bloodstream, and that the \"circulation of cancer cells in the blood is probably a common event, even in cancers that are curable. And it's not unreasonable to assume that a few more cells may find their way into the bloodstream when the tumor is manipulated, as it is during a biopsy. The key is the stage of your cancer. When cancer is confined to the prostate, even if a few cells escape into the blood, they won't survive. This is because they haven't yet got the hang of living outside the area where they developed.\" A few sentences later: \"So there are two different issues. One is the presence of cancer cells in the blood.; the other is the survival of these cells in distant locations. Prostate cancer cells are simply unable to live outside their normal environment until they develop this ability, called metastatic capability.\"",

      "Content": "notme, from the website you linked to, I went into the diagnosis section. Indeed, this site is NOT claiming that MRI can diagnose prostate cancer. As I wrote in the other response, the site is talking about using MRI to avoid blind biopsies, to target where the needle goes. Quote from site (emphasis supplied by me) Diagnosis Prostate cancer is most often discovered by physical examination or by screening blood tests, such as the PSA (prostate specific antigen) test. Suspected prostate cancer is typically confirmed by removing a piece of the prostate (biopsy) and examining it under a microscope. However, blind needle biopsies spread cancer cells and only yield a 25 % success rate in finding cancer. Recent advancements in imaging technology such as prostate 3.0 Tesla MRI with Spectroscopy allow physicians to locate suspicious areas of disease and then performed targeted biopsies improving diagnostic outcomes by up to 40%. In addition to locating suspicious lesions, 3.0 Tesla with Spectroscopy can determine whether prostate cancer has spread beyond the capsule. http://www.mrisusa.com/Prostate%20Cancer.html",

      "Content": "1. I've never seen a drawing like that, but maybe the oval is your bladder? Just a guess. 2. Negative, or clear margins, refer to surgery pathology. The pathologist looks at the removed tissue in slices. If he sees cancer right up to the cut edge of the removed tissue, that's a positive margin. If tumor cells go up to the very edge of the removed tissue, that increases the chances that some cancer was left behind. But it's not a guarantee that happened. For example, Dr. Walsh explains, the clear margin could have been very thin, and it it got sort of rubbed off after the prostate was removed. Damaged during handling, in other words. The significance of this is, if your PSA starts going up after surgery, and you had positive margins, then you have a logical, *local* explanation for the PSA--and if it's only in that area where your prostate was, you may still be cured by salvage radiation. That's apparently what happened in my situation. On the other hand, if you have clear, or negative margins after surgery, that's a good sign that the surgeon did \"get it all\", although it's not bombproof by any means. Some cells could have escaped. As to your bigger question about active surveillance-it is an option for some men. My uncle, for example, has been doing it for years now, and is doing fine. He'll most likely die with prostate cancer, not from it, and he won't have to put up with any treatments or side effects. Of course he's having to put up with periodic PSA tests, DREs, and biopsies. It's not an option for everyone, of course. I was at the other end of the spectrum--Gleason 7, rapidly increasing PSA, and only 43 years old. If I hadn't acted, I'm pretty sure I would be dying a painful death right about now. I would echo the advice: take your time, do your research, and make a carefully considered decision. I personally like Walsh's book, although it's getting a little dated. Also, the Prostate Cancer Foundation has a lot of good info on their website. Here's what they say about active surveillance: \"Today, the man who is ideal for active surveillance has a low grade (Gleason 6 or under), low-risk prostate cancer (low PSA and stage), that appears to be low in volume (small amount of cancer found on biopsy, for example), and who is not eager to undergo therapy right away due to concerns about potency preservation or urinary symptoms. Active surveillance might also be a good choice for older men with limited life expectancy. In addition, if a man is currently battling other serious disorders or diseases, such as heart disease, long-standing high blood pressure, or poorly controlled diabetes, his doctors might feel it is in his best interest to hold off on therapy and avoid its potential complications. That\u2019s because many of the treatment options for prostate cancer can be difficult to endure, and better outcomes are seen in men who are otherwise healthy.\" http://www.pcf.org/site/c.leJRIROrEp...rveillance.htm Best wishes!

      "Content": "Ha! I'm a lurker these days. I was wondering how you're doing! It looks like very, very well. Good to see! I'll have another PSA in a couple of months, but at last check I was still less than 0.1. My radiation oncologist released me from his care, since it had been 5 years, and I'll just get a PSA along with my other blood work (cholesterol) every 6 months or annually. Originally Posted by Hawk Hope from salvage radiation I thought I would post a quick note just to document that there is hope for those with Gleason 8 and a pre-surgical PSA of 16 even when the cancer returns after having clean surgical margins. I had SRT 3 ½ years ago and just got a PSA of 0.02 It took 24 months to bottom out at that reading and has been steady there for 18 months. I have to say I am a bit pleasantly surprised. I went 18 months between my last 2 PSA tests because I lived from test to test every 3 to 6 months for 6 years and just got tired of it. I figured at this stage there is no rush for hormone therapy if the PSA started back up anyway so why not just focus on other stuff for a while. Pre-surgery 16.6 and 8.7 Pre SRT .16 Post SRT .10 3 month .09 6 month .06 9 month .04 12 month .04 18 month .03 24 month .02 42 month .02 Hawk PS: I see my old friend and mentor Replicant has not been on for a few weeks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by chasgrips45 So step 2 in my little journey. I hate the term Salvage radiation ,but i guess that`s what it was. During the treatment ,I had minimal side effects . Pooper a little sore, continence about the same. The worst was the urge to get up 7 times a night to pee. So today is Friday, & I`m as weak as a kitten,& have a hell of a headache. The doc gave me a little better than a 50% chance of a cure. Bad #8 Gleason . I lasted for a year before a rise in psa. I hope I`m wrong ,but here`s the way this thing plays out IMHO . I probably go for a while with a zero psa ,after the initial bump. It`s then the 3 mo waiting game for the psa test . How long before it returns,maybe 5 yrs, tops. I then hope that the doubling time is slow. No hormones. I sure as hell don`t need my mood to get any lower! I had no idea that AFTER the radiation ,I would feel so tired . Maybe I`ll go back for more to get my strength back! I`m not sitting on the pity pot it`s just that I hope this process is for naught. I feel like i`m in a fog ,I`ve got to rest. The side effects should resolve on their own within several weeks of finishing treatment. I hope your results are as good as mine. Salvage radiation really paid off for me.",

      "Content": "Rich, I agree with the others that it's pretty unlikely you have prostate cancer (especially advanced prostate cancer) at age 29, and it's much more likely that you have something else or multiple something elses that are causing your discomforts. Some of the things you describe sound a lot like prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate, often caused by infection). If you do have prostatitis, if it's caused by a bacterial infection then antibiotics should take care of it, although the doc might have to try more than one type. If it's more chronic, and not bacterial, I think the doctor would go after the symptom of inflammation by treating you with some powerful anti-inflammatory medication, like high dosage Motrin. Insomnia can actually cause night time urination, or at least it does in my case. I'm a light sleeper, and easily disturbed, which triggers the urge to go to the loo in the middle of the night. If I take a simple sleep aid, like doxylamine succinate (Unisom) I'll sleep all night. Cheap, too, at WalMart in the Equate version. Lately I've used melatonin, which seems to help me sleep more naturally (and it helps with the getting up to pee thing, too.) And like someone else wrote, the back pain definitely sounds like a regular old back problem, not metastatic cancer. If you want to scratch prostate cancer off your worry list, get a PSA test and DRE (not fun, but it only takes a few moments). If I were you, I'd concentrate on trying to improve your quality of sleep, and see how the rest of your health improves after that. The moderator on another board used this as her signature: \"Worry is like a rocking chair. It gives you something to do, but gets you nowhere.\" I wish you health and peace of mind.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Does chemo have a better record? Until recently, chemo had a very poor record against prostate cancer. In 1997 Johns Hopkins University said \"So far, standard chemotherapy hasn't worked in prostate cancer. Not only does it fail to cure cancer, it doesn't prolong survival to any significant degree, and it sometimes harsh side effects can make an unpleasant situation even worse.\" (http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer419.php) Since then, there have been many developments on the chemo front, with the first significant development being taxotere. Then there is Provenge, which is an immune-based therapy. Zytiga is a drug that can come after standard hormone therapy and before chemo. But as far as I know, hormone therapy is normally the first line of defense after curative attempts have failed, because it can be extremely effective in many cases. (A friend of my father's had the surgical equivalent of hormone therapy, and it completely stalled his prostate cancer and eliminated symptoms for about 8 years.) Chemo seems to be reserved for hormone-refractory (sometimes called hormone-resistant or castration independent) metastatic prostate cancer. The drugs can extend survival, but not as dramatically as hormone therapy. My understanding is that traditional chemo is most effective against fast-dividing cells. Compared to other cancers, prostate cancer cells are slow-dividers, so chemo is not as effective against PCa. The American Cancer Society says: \"In most cases, the first chemo drug given is docetaxel, combined with the steroid drug prednisone. If this drug does not work (or stops working), a newer drug called cabazitaxel is often the next chemo drug tried (although there may be other treatment options as well). Both of these drugs have been shown to help men live several months longer, on average, than older chemotherapy drugs. They may slow the cancer's growth and also reduce symptoms, resulting in a better quality of life. Still, chemotherapy for prostate cancer is very unlikely to result in a cure.\" So in a nutshell (and maybe Az4peaks or someone else can elaborate or correct me) my understanding is that there have been improvements in chemo for prostate cancer, but the survival gains are modest so the first line of treatment in metastatic PCa is hormone therapy, followed by chemo.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace There is quite a bit of controversy about when it get hormone therapy after recurrence. Walsh and some others suggest there is no hurry to start hormone therapy which works on androgen dependent cancer. Lupron shots for example do not seem to work on androgen independent cancer. I have heard of hormone therapy working for as long as 10 years and as few as 3 months so it varies a lot. That's my understanding as well. I have read Walsh and his argument seems sound. However, I have also seen a study that showed early hormone therapy was better than late in men with fast PSA doubling times. My own doubling time was rapid, so I have decided to pursue HT pretty quickly if my PSA rises. I have my medical oncologist picked out and have checked to make sure he takes my insurance.",
