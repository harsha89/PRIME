      "Content": "Ok. Thought i owed everyone an update, specially after all the help and support you have all given us. It's been 4 days since my husband surgery, and as unreal as it might sound it has really been easier then what we expected. Thursday (surgery day) was a little scary cause it took him a lot to regulate his breathing after anesthesia, so he went to the room late and did not get to walk until around 8pm. By friday 10am they were kicking us out from the room!!! We have walked a little every day, we were even able to go for a stroll around town for a couple of hours this afternoon!!! Tomorrow afternoon they are removing the catheter and giving us the pathology... The catheter is uncomfortable but he has gotten used to it and the changing of the bags is now a snap... It's funny... We were soooo afraid of the catheter and we are no afraid of not having it and not having control of his bladder... Best recommendations I can give: * Go in with a positive attitude, there is no GOOD way around it, so stay positive and go positive into your surgery. * If possible have a \"support network\" the company, even if they can not help, they can distract you. * Basitracin-neosporim-ycream, any of them... Have lots available. * Don't be afraid of the catheter or the bags changes *If having surgery out of town, instead of staying at a hotel, try renting an apartment. We were able to find a time share kind of hotel with a separate living room and a full kitchen, so we have been able to rest and eat home cook meals that are easy on the stomach. *I know it may sound cliche but chicken soup, more even, a good matzeball soup, makes a very good, easy on the tommy, and easy on the soul, meal! *ask for extras of everything at the hospital, we have 2 big bags, 2 leg bags and 2 pairs of compression socks!!! Thanks again for all your support Esther",
