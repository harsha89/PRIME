      "Content": "Hi, Matt, This is just my 2 cents, and it means nothing, but at your age, radiation would be an issue for _me_. My doc, while a surgeon (which I get), answered me when I asked the question regarding radiation treatments with, \"you're awfully young (51). I'd be concerned about the potential for side effects from the radiation, since you have a long time to live.\" While he's not a radiologist, he's a PCa researcher and well renowned at Johns Hopkins. When I first mentioned this to my uncle, who had PCa in the mid '90s (and is fine after perineural surgery-YIKES!), he said \"I've known lots of guys that had seeds. They're all gone now.\" Now, I realize things have improved since then, but the main issue remains: What to do if it comes back? And the docs don't really know what's in you until it's in front of the microscope at pathology. I'm more wired for seeing an immediate PSA of ZERO, where some guys are OK with the potential fluctuations radiation normally brings. BTW, there are posts regarding the gel in this forum somewhere. I know it's a tough decision, but hey!! Now I've run out of excuses for putting that overdue colonoscopy off! Good luck, Ron P.S., I started off as a G6, too, and less than 5% in each of only 2 cores. Pathology said differently.",

I only received one large bag also, which I was wearing of course, and a spare to take home, which I never used. I attended a seminar for upcoming PC surgery patients about 2 month prior to surgery and was told we would go home with a large bag only, so no surprises there. Honestly, it seemed more trouble than it was worth to change bags anyways. When I went for walks, I wore oversized sweatpants and simply wrapped the tube loosely around my leg a couple of times and let the bag lie at the bottom of the leg sleeve. The elastic at the leg bottom kept it from going anywhere. I was also told to use petroleum jelly. There was a reason about not using neosporin-type gels, but I don't remember why now. Were you sent home with a large 'goodie bag' of supplies like I was? There should be plenty of small packages of petroleum jelly in there as well as applicator sticks. I still had plenty of stuff leftover. The underwear they gave me with the replaceable pads was nice, but I found it easier to just use Depends for 'post-catheter' times as they are disposable, thus no washing. Hopkins was great. It's a great hospital.....but I wouldn't wander too far down the street in the dark, LOL! Good luck! Ron",

At exactly the 4 weeks mark today, I can feel a pretty good 'tingle' down there and some 'movement' when my wife and I share a real kiss, so I'm hopeful. I just wish the jealous dog would quit the incessant barking at us when we do, LOL! And here I was happy that, after 4 weeks to the day, I woke up with a dry pad for the first time. This even after having a lot of fluids yesterday as well as a couple Cap'n & Cokes! Where o' where have my dribbles gone?! Well, I'm not naive, but it was a nice way to start the day, just the same! I did get up 3 or 4 times to use the toilet, which was probably alcohol related, but I'll take that over a wet pad anyday! Hopefully, I'll be sharing a story similar to yours soon! Ron",

As Chuck has already alluded to, we really don't know what we've got until it's under the pathologist's microscope, which is a benefit of taking the surgical route--closer examination. Your '3+4' could end up being anything, even downgraded, but with your PSA where it is, I wouldn't count on that. If you'd like, you can create a 'history' and include it in your 'signature' line. You can also put your location in your profile. This way, as the posts become extended, we don't have to keep bugging you about it, lol! P.S., my wife is trying to convince us to take a visit next door to New Zealand this year or next. Is she nuts or what?! Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Welcome Winter. Man, looking at your screen name almost makes me envious as I go through yet another day of baking in the East Coast heat and humidity! Tough luck on the divorce. Feel free to \"bounce things off\" of us, as I also believe having support is important. We're not doctors, but everyone here has dealt with this disease in one way or another and the experiences are vast and varied. You may get the impression that this forum seems to lean more towards surgery for treatment--especially in younger men. I can't personally comment on other options as I went (kicking and screaming, lol) the surgery route. I was only 51 at Dx and I'm sure I already had it at 50--or even in my late 40s--but it wasn't until that first screening PSA test just after my 50th birthday that started this thing rolling. My post-surgery path report upped my Gleason a bit, and that's one of the benefits to surgery--it's 'out' and be thoroughly examined under the 'scope for a complete examination. I just passed the 11 month post-op mark and I'm doing well. I'll still only be 53 next month, so doing well is still important to me, too! Chuck pretty much covered what you're looking at, but I just wanted to say \"hell\" and welcome aboard! I'd also be a little suspect with only one core of PCa found, but with your PSA numbers being where they are. Blind biopsies aren't perfect by any means, and they can certainly miss other tumors, so the 3T is sound advice if you can get it. Best of luck-- Ron P.S., adding your location to your profile would be helpful. Then we don't have to keep bugging you about it!",

The 8th edition no longer delineates the different pathology results for stage 2. It states 'pathologically organ-confined disease is now considered pT2 and is no longer sub-classified by extent of involvement or laterality,' I see these sub-classifications still being used, and am wondering why.. Keep the faith! Ron",

      "Content": "Welcome Winter. Man, looking at your screen name almost makes me envious as I go through yet another day of baking in the East Coast heat and humidity! Tough luck on the divorce. Feel free to \"bounce things off\" of us, as I also believe having support is important. We're not doctors, but everyone here has dealt with this disease in one way or another and the experiences are vast and varied. You may get the impression that this forum seems to lean more towards surgery for treatment--especially in younger men. I can't personally comment on other options as I went (kicking and screaming, lol) the surgery route. I was only 51 at Dx and I'm sure I already had it at 50--or even in my late 40s--but it wasn't until that first screening PSA test just after my 50th birthday that started this thing rolling. My post-surgery path report upped my Gleason a bit, and that's one of the benefits to surgery--it's 'out' and be thoroughly examined under the 'scope for a complete examination. I just passed the 11 month post-op mark and I'm doing well. I'll still only be 53 next month, so doing well is still important to me, too! Chuck pretty much covered what you're looking at, but I just wanted to say \"hell\" and welcome aboard! I'd also be a little suspect with only one core of PCa found, but with your PSA numbers being where they are. Blind biopsies aren't perfect by any means, and they can certainly miss other tumors, so the 3T is sound advice if you can get it. Best of luck-- Ron P.S., adding your location to your profile would be helpful. Then we don't have to keep bugging you about it!",

Seriously though, if you have to have a G7 score, you'd want the 3+4 variety, which, under the newer scoring system is considered 'Grade 2' (on a 1-5 scale) whereas a 4+3 would be a 'Grade 3.'

As Chuck has already alluded to, we really don't know what we've got until it's under the pathologist's microscope, which is a benefit of taking the surgical route--closer examination. Your '3+4' could end up being anything, even downgraded, but with your PSA where it is, I wouldn't count on that. If you'd like, you can create a 'history' and include it in your 'signature' line. You can also put your location in your profile. This way, as the posts become extended, we don't have to keep bugging you about it, lol! P.S., my wife is trying to convince us to take a visit next door to New Zealand this year or next. Is she nuts or what?! Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, Matt, This is just my 2 cents, and it means nothing, but at your age, radiation would be an issue for _me_. My doc, while a surgeon (which I get), answered me when I asked the question regarding radiation treatments with, \"you're awfully young (51). I'd be concerned about the potential for side effects from the radiation, since you have a long time to live.\" While he's not a radiologist, he's a PCa researcher and well renowned at Johns Hopkins. When I first mentioned this to my uncle, who had PCa in the mid '90s (and is fine after perineural surgery-YIKES!), he said \"I've known lots of guys that had seeds. They're all gone now.\" Now, I realize things have improved since then, but the main issue remains: What to do if it comes back? And the docs don't really know what's in you until it's in front of the microscope at pathology. I'm more wired for seeing an immediate PSA of ZERO, where some guys are OK with the potential fluctuations radiation normally brings. BTW, there are posts regarding the gel in this forum somewhere. I know it's a tough decision, but hey!! Now I've run out of excuses for putting that overdue colonoscopy off! Good luck, Ron P.S., I started off as a G6, too, and less than 5% in each of only 2 cores. Pathology said differently.",

      "Content": "Mike, just my humble thoughts. You're going to a top center. I wouldn't worry about the doc's 'social skills' as much as his skills with the knife. You won't be life-long friends. Michael F has very good points--as usual. I was a bit worried when I saw my doc for the first time at Johns Hopkins. I was concerned a bit because he didn't do 'robotic' and that was what we are all so used to hearing about now a days. But, he turned out to be a nice enough guy, seemed empathetic, and offered me lots of reassurances. I have no regrets in letting him filet me, lol! I also had some of Michael's similar 'wife thoughts' but mine went more like this after our post-biopsy meeting with Dr. Carter: Wife: \"Well, that's a relief.\" Me: \"What is?\" Wife: \"The decision we have to make.\" Me: \"But I was hoping I'd have the option to at least watch it for a while.\" Wife: (odd look) \"We're not doing that.\" Me: \"But if...\" Wife: \"We're not doing that.\" Me: \"If I can...\" Wife: \"We're NOT DOING THAT!\" A couple of months later---- Wife: \"Hi honey. Have you made the call to schedule your surgery yet?\" Me: No, but I was just thinking about it. Wife: \"Hmmph. You're a PAIN IN THE ASS! I'm coming home. We're going to sit down and call this in together and make this happen. I'm not losing you over this BS!\" Me: \" Umm...it's OK honey. I'll call right now.\" Tough love! But she' knows me too well by now! At least I can laugh about it now.",

You can add that stuff to your profile if you like so you don't get asked for it over and over again. Some tough numbers for sure. If your scans and tests are indicating that the cancer still hasn't escaped your prostate, you may still be a candidate for surgery. If it's gotten out, surgery probably isn't the best option. I have no knowledge of your doc. but if you are able to go the surgery route, you want a doc with lots of experience. I don't think you want to be someone's 'learning curve' with those Gleason 7s and 8s in there. By the same token, the same applies if you end up going the radiation route. You want experience. Williamsport is central-ish PA. right? Might be worth it to look into some of the major centers surrounding you. Philly, New York, Pittsburgh, maybe even Cleveland or Baltimore.

At exactly the 4 weeks mark today, I can feel a pretty good 'tingle' down there and some 'movement' when my wife and I share a real kiss, so I'm hopeful. I just wish the jealous dog would quit the incessant barking at us when we do, LOL! And here I was happy that, after 4 weeks to the day, I woke up with a dry pad for the first time. This even after having a lot of fluids yesterday as well as a couple Cap'n & Cokes! Where o' where have my dribbles gone?! Well, I'm not naive, but it was a nice way to start the day, just the same! I did get up 3 or 4 times to use the toilet, which was probably alcohol related, but I'll take that over a wet pad anyday! Hopefully, I'll be sharing a story similar to yours soon! Ron",

You can add that stuff to your profile if you like so you don't get asked for it over and over again. Some tough numbers for sure. If your scans and tests are indicating that the cancer still hasn't escaped your prostate, you may still be a candidate for surgery. If it's gotten out, surgery probably isn't the best option. I have no knowledge of your doc. but if you are able to go the surgery route, you want a doc with lots of experience. I don't think you want to be someone's 'learning curve' with those Gleason 7s and 8s in there. By the same token, the same applies if you end up going the radiation route. You want experience.

I only received one large bag also, which I was wearing of course, and a spare to take home, which I never used. I attended a seminar for upcoming PC surgery patients about 2 month prior to surgery and was told we would go home with a large bag only, so no surprises there. Honestly, it seemed more trouble than it was worth to change bags anyways. When I went for walks, I wore oversized sweatpants and simply wrapped the tube loosely around my leg a couple of times and let the bag lie at the bottom of the leg sleeve. The elastic at the leg bottom kept it from going anywhere. I was also told to use petroleum jelly. There was a reason about not using neosporin-type gels, but I don't remember why now. Were you sent home with a large 'goodie bag' of supplies like I was? There should be plenty of small packages of petroleum jelly in there as well as applicator sticks. I still had plenty of stuff leftover. The underwear they gave me with the replaceable pads was nice, but I found it easier to just use Depends for 'post-catheter' times as they are disposable, thus no washing. Hopkins was great.

      "Content": "Welcome Winter. Man, looking at your screen name almost makes me envious as I go through yet another day of baking in the East Coast heat and humidity! Tough luck on the divorce. Feel free to \"bounce things off\" of us, as I also believe having support is important. We're not doctors, but everyone here has dealt with this disease in one way or another and the experiences are vast and varied. You may get the impression that this forum seems to lean more towards surgery for treatment--especially in younger men. I can't personally comment on other options as I went (kicking and screaming, lol) the surgery route. I was only 51 at Dx and I'm sure I already had it at 50--or even in my late 40s--but it wasn't until that first screening PSA test just after my 50th birthday that started this thing rolling. My post-surgery path report upped my Gleason a bit, and that's one of the benefits to surgery--it's 'out' and be thoroughly examined under the 'scope for a complete examination. I just passed the 11 month post-op mark and I'm doing well. I'll still only be 53 next month, so doing well is still important to me, too! Chuck pretty much covered what you're looking at, but I just wanted to say \"hell\" and welcome aboard! I'd also be a little suspect with only one core of PCa found, but with your PSA numbers being where they are. Blind biopsies aren't perfect by any means, and they can certainly miss other tumors, so the 3T is sound advice if you can get it. Best of luck-- Ron P.S., adding your location to your profile would be helpful. Then we don't have to keep bugging you about it!",

      "Content": "Welcome Winter. Man, looking at your screen name almost makes me envious as I go through yet another day of baking in the East Coast heat and humidity! Tough luck on the divorce. Feel free to \"bounce things off\" of us, as I also believe having support is important. We're not doctors, but everyone here has dealt with this disease in one way or another and the experiences are vast and varied. You may get the impression that this forum seems to lean more towards surgery for treatment--especially in younger men. I can't personally comment on other options as I went (kicking and screaming, lol) the surgery route. I was only 51 at Dx and I'm sure I already had it at 50--or even in my late 40s--but it wasn't until that first screening PSA test just after my 50th birthday that started this thing rolling. My post-surgery path report upped my Gleason a bit, and that's one of the benefits to surgery--it's 'out' and be thoroughly examined under the 'scope for a complete examination. I just passed the 11 month post-op mark and I'm doing well. I'll still only be 53 next month, so doing well is still important to me, too! Chuck pretty much covered what you're looking at, but I just wanted to say \"hell\" and welcome aboard! I'd also be a little suspect with only one core of PCa found, but with your PSA numbers being where they are. Blind biopsies aren't perfect by any means, and they can certainly miss other tumors, so the 3T is sound advice if you can get it. Best of luck-- Ron P.S., adding your location to your profile would be helpful. Then we don't have to keep bugging you about it!",

The 8th edition no longer delineates the different pathology results for stage 2. It states 'pathologically organ-confined disease is now considered pT2 and is no longer sub-classified by extent of involvement or laterality,' I see these sub-classifications still being used, and am wondering why..

A robot doesn't make a surgeon better--experience does. I had 'open' with an experienced doc, and I'm doing well thus far. Where are you located? Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Mike, just my humble thoughts. You're going to a top center. I wouldn't worry about the doc's 'social skills' as much as his skills with the knife. You won't be life-long friends. Michael F has very good points--as usual. I was a bit worried when I saw my doc for the first time at Johns Hopkins. I was concerned a bit because he didn't do 'robotic' and that was what we are all so used to hearing about now a days. But, he turned out to be a nice enough guy, seemed empathetic, and offered me lots of reassurances. I have no regrets in letting him filet me, lol! I also had some of Michael's similar 'wife thoughts' but mine went more like this after our post-biopsy meeting with Dr. Carter: Wife: \"Well, that's a relief.\" Me: \"What is?\" Wife: \"The decision we have to make.\" Me: \"But I was hoping I'd have the option to at least watch it for a while.\" Wife: (odd look) \"We're not doing that.\" Me: \"But if...\" Wife: \"We're not doing that.\" Me: \"If I can...\" Wife: \"We're NOT DOING THAT!\" A couple of months later---- Wife: \"Hi honey. Have you made the call to schedule your surgery yet?\" Me: No, but I was just thinking about it. Wife: \"Hmmph. You're a PAIN IN THE ASS! I'm coming home. We're going to sit down and call this in together and make this happen. I'm not losing you over this BS!\" Me: \" Umm...it's OK honey. I'll call right now.\" Tough love! But she' knows me too well by now! At least I can laugh about it now.",

      "Content": "Hi Houndly. And unfortunately, welcome. I have to echo the other posters and say, if I was in NoVa, I'm going to Hopkins. I had to make a similar decision recently since, while I was happy with my doctor for the initial stuff, Hopkins is just over 30 minutes from me, and I thought it unwise to not take advantage of the facility (It didn't hurt that the initial doc missed my PCa at biopsy and recommended a saturation biopsy, afterwards). While you're probably about 1.5 hours away, most NoVa-ers spend that in traffic each way to work! If you don't want to do the round trip, maybe spend the night in a local hotel, pick up an O's game, and/or have some crabs at the Inner Harbor. My samples were reviewed by Dr. Epstein at Hopkins. Why risk a biopsy and have second thoughts about the results, and consider sending them off for a second opinion--which Hopkins charges for and Epstein is often the reviewer? Think about this: Men come from around the world to the Brady Urological Clinic for treatment, and you're only in NoVa. Besides, Hopkins has the latest equipment. The 3T MRI found the suspicious area that my initial biopsy didn't. While I had to have a second biopsy, it wasn't \"saturation\" and the doc knew where he was aiming. Remember, some of the choices you may be about to face in the future are potentially big ones. No point in fooling around! It would be helpful though, if you posted what your \"stats\" are. You can add them to your signature line. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hi Houndly. And unfortunately, welcome. I have to echo the other posters and say, if I was in NoVa, I'm going to Hopkins. I had to make a similar decision recently since, while I was happy with my doctor for the initial stuff, Hopkins is just over 30 minutes from me, and I thought it unwise to not take advantage of the facility (It didn't hurt that the initial doc missed my PCa at biopsy and recommended a saturation biopsy, afterwards). While you're probably about 1.5 hours away, most NoVa-ers spend that in traffic each way to work! If you don't want to do the round trip, maybe spend the night in a local hotel, pick up an O's game, and/or have some crabs at the Inner Harbor. My samples were reviewed by Dr. Epstein at Hopkins. Why risk a biopsy and have second thoughts about the results, and consider sending them off for a second opinion--which Hopkins charges for and Epstein is often the reviewer? Think about this: Men come from around the world to the Brady Urological Clinic for treatment, and you're only in NoVa. Besides, Hopkins has the latest equipment. The 3T MRI found the suspicious area that my initial biopsy didn't. While I had to have a second biopsy, it wasn't \"saturation\" and the doc knew where he was aiming. Remember, some of the choices you may be about to face in the future are potentially big ones. No point in fooling around! It would be helpful though, if you posted what your \"stats\" are. You can add them to your signature line. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Welcome fella. Yeah, most of us have been through the ringer with these various tests. Ask your doc if it makes sense to test you for Free PSA and/or PHI. My understanding is that they are both more beneficial for PSA readings in the 4-10 range (as are prostate density calculations). I don't believe the PCA3 test has such a PSA range preference. The PCA3 won't tell you if you have cancer either, but it is intended to indicate the probability of finding prostate cancer in a biopsy. Of those that I had, other than the PSA, the PCA3 seemed to be of some value with a score of 38, which showed an 'increased probability' of finding PC on biopsy, of course the irony is that I had already had a biopsy--which was negative! Go figure!!! My PHI and FPSA both indicated a less than 20% probability of PC, but that wasn't to be. PCA3 is urine based. Doc will perform a little more rigorous DRE than normal, and then you'll give a urine sample. No big deal. Good luck. Ron",

While I didn't have this same experience, when my doc told us that I should be OK after my surgery, my wife lost it and began crying uncontrollably. While I wasn't glad to see that she was upset, it made me feel good myself after enduring this that she cared so much. After over 20 years of marriage, a bit of reassurance rocks!

      "Content": "Welcome fella. Yeah, most of us have been through the ringer with these various tests. Ask your doc if it makes sense to test you for Free PSA and/or PHI. My understanding is that they are both more beneficial for PSA readings in the 4-10 range (as are prostate density calculations). I don't believe the PCA3 test has such a PSA range preference. The PCA3 won't tell you if you have cancer either, but it is intended to indicate the probability of finding prostate cancer in a biopsy. Of those that I had, other than the PSA, the PCA3 seemed to be of some value with a score of 38, which showed an 'increased probability' of finding PC on biopsy, of course the irony is that I had already had a biopsy--which was negative! Go figure!!! My PHI and FPSA both indicated a less than 20% probability of PC, but that wasn't to be. PCA3 is urine based. Doc will perform a little more rigorous DRE than normal, and then you'll give a urine sample. No big deal. Good luck. Ron",

I've been leery of this moment due to concern over the 'same lab' issue, but the drive into Baltimore to have Hopkins do the blood draw was a royal PITA at times. I came back at <.02, so I'm obviously relieved. I didn't ask, but do you guys know what testing method would've been used to get this number? I think if it was an uPSA it would have 3 number places right, or am I wrong? I believe the lab used was Solstas, which I also believe Quest is acquiring. #2: A long lost 2nd cousin of mine contacted me a couple of months ago regarding her 68 year old husband's recently diagnosed PC. We've been talking, and he just went through RALP in August at Mercy Hospital in Baltimore (he worked there and was comfy with some of the docs, otherwise I was suggesting Johns Hopkins). He's recovered well, but apparently the path report found 'microscopic cells' at a margin. His PSA at 3 weeks post-op was .09, which is too early to really tell IMO (maybe the doc wanted a 'nadir' baseline) and he will get another PSA this upcoming week. The doc said he couldn't even see the margin cells under the magnification, and he was surprised by the report but still seemed confident of a good outcome. Path Gleason was 3+4=7. But, what I really wanted to ask was this: He had NO lymph nodes removed. Is this even normal anymore? I'm sure that's sitting in the backs of their minds, knowing PC was found at the margin, and no lymph nodes were dissected, has to be making them uncomfortable. Their doc said, based on the pre-surgery info, he didn't feel removal of lymph nodes was necessary, but I had 11 removed, and I didn't seem to be at risk of anything out of the capsule (after imaging) pre-surgery either. They hadn't even thought of anything beyond the surgery as they were relying on the confidence of their doc, and now he's mentioning potential radiation. I sure wish they would've gone to Hopkins, about 15 minutes away from this hospital..... Thanks guys. The lymph node thing has me thinking..... Ron",

      "Content": "Thanks, Chuck. Yeah, I believe I've read of guys on this board that didn't have lymph node dissection--though it seems to be rare. I was suspected of only G6 too when I went under the knife, and the doc still took 11 LNs. But as MM said, after discovering that PM, I would certainly feel more comfortable knowing my LNs were checked. But, hindsight is 20/20, right? I'm not sure if he was Dx'ed with G6 or G7 prior to surgery. I do know he didn't have a MRI or any imaging done prior to the surgery, only the TRUS biopsy. Again, I wish my hint that they go to Hopkins was heeded, but there's that 'hindsight' again, lol. I'll find out more later this week. I don't want to overload them with information as I think this path report has caused some stress already. Thanks, again Ron",

The anesthesia bill was separate for about another $6.5K, and the surgeon was a 'bargain.' He billed only about $6K! Note that I had 'open' RP though. I don't know what kind of premium the use of those fancy gadgets adds to the bill as the hospitals recoup their purchasing of the equipment. Also, I took redbelly7's comment as a joke/sarcasm.

      "Content": "#1: I recently had my primary care doc take over with my PSA tests as Dr. Carter told me he didn't think I needed follow up at this time. nor did we have to have our 'phone conferences' anymore as he felt I was doing well--unless I have concerns. I've been leery of this moment due to concern over the 'same lab' issue, but the drive into Baltimore to have Hopkins do the blood draw was a royal PITA at times. I came back at <.02, so I'm obviously relieved. I didn't ask, but do you guys know what testing method would've been used to get this number? I think if it was an uPSA it would have 3 number places right, or am I wrong? I believe the lab used was Solstas, which I also believe Quest is acquiring. #2: A long lost 2nd cousin of mine contacted me a couple of months ago regarding her 68 year old husband's recently diagnosed PC. We've been talking, and he just went through RALP in August at Mercy Hospital in Baltimore (he worked there and was comfy with some of the docs, otherwise I was suggesting Johns Hopkins). He's recovered well, but apparently the path report found 'microscopic cells' at a margin. His PSA at 3 weeks post-op was .09, which is too early to really tell IMO (maybe the doc wanted a 'nadir' baseline) and he will get another PSA this upcoming week. The doc said he couldn't even see the margin cells under the magnification, and he was surprised by the report but still seemed confident of a good outcome. Path Gleason was 3+4=7. But, what I really wanted to ask was this: He had NO lymph nodes removed. Is this even normal anymore? I'm sure that's sitting in the backs of their minds, knowing PC was found at the margin, and no lymph nodes were dissected, has to be making them uncomfortable. Their doc said, based on the pre-surgery info, he didn't feel removal of lymph nodes was necessary, but I had 11 removed, and I didn't seem to be at risk of anything out of the capsule (after imaging) pre-surgery either. They hadn't even thought of anything beyond the surgery as they were relying on the confidence of their doc, and now he's mentioning potential radiation. I sure wish they would've gone to Hopkins, about 15 minutes away from this hospital..... Thanks guys. The lymph node thing has me thinking..... Ron",

      "Content": "Thanks, Chuck. Yeah, I believe I've read of guys on this board that didn't have lymph node dissection--though it seems to be rare. I was suspected of only G6 too when I went under the knife, and the doc still took 11 LNs. But as MM said, after discovering that PM, I would certainly feel more comfortable knowing my LNs were checked. But, hindsight is 20/20, right? I'm not sure if he was Dx'ed with G6 or G7 prior to surgery. I do know he didn't have a MRI or any imaging done prior to the surgery, only the TRUS biopsy. Again, I wish my hint that they go to Hopkins was heeded, but there's that 'hindsight' again, lol. I'll find out more later this week. I don't want to overload them with information as I think this path report has caused some stress already. Thanks, again Ron",

I don't have the EOBs in front of me, but if I recall correctly, my one night in Johns Hopkins cost my private, employer-sponsored BC/BS plan a bit over $20K for 'hospital services.' The anesthesia bill was separate for about another $6.5K, and the surgeon was a 'bargain.' He billed only about $6K! Note that I had 'open' RP though. I don't know what kind of premium the use of those fancy gadgets adds to the bill as the hospitals recoup their purchasing of the equipment. Also, I took redbelly7's comment as a joke/sarcasm.

      "Content": "Thanks, Chuck. Yeah, I believe I've read of guys on this board that didn't have lymph node dissection--though it seems to be rare. I was suspected of only G6 too when I went under the knife, and the doc still took 11 LNs. But as MM said, after discovering that PM, I would certainly feel more comfortable knowing my LNs were checked. But, hindsight is 20/20, right? I'm not sure if he was Dx'ed with G6 or G7 prior to surgery. I do know he didn't have a MRI or any imaging done prior to the surgery, only the TRUS biopsy. Again, I wish my hint that they go to Hopkins was heeded, but there's that 'hindsight' again, lol. I'll find out more later this week. I don't want to overload them with information as I think this path report has caused some stress already. Thanks, again Ron",

      "Content": "Welcome, Badda.....If you'd like 'help to decide on a treatment' you probably shouldn't rule out surgery posting here as many of us have chosen that option as our preferred treatment. I think we can all relate to the apprehension, but it's not the end of the world. Do you have specific concerns regarding surgery over your 'already chosen' other options? As Chuck has asked already, can you tell us your age--and location as well? Your PSA doesn't seem to indicate aggressive cancer, and at a G6, you've got time to decide. One thing regarding surgery: Once it's out it can be assessed by pathology. Often times the Gleasons are upstaged after pathology, as a biopsy can only stage what the needle hits. Often---there's more, and more serious cancer lurking in there. Not saying this is your situation, and hopefully it isn't, but you should understand that it happens. Interesting, current read:http://www.cancernetwork.com/news/ra...=1&ts=23122015 Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Thanks Doctor K. I, for one, appreciate having a medical professional chime in from time to time, as we're all laymen here. We certainly try to help those facing this disease through our own experience, but we can't give the 'physician's side' of the treatment. So, thank you for that. Obviously, I'm far past those 'newer treatment' options and personally, I don't think I was wired for keeping that thing in me! But, it's nice to see more options become available for the next generation. I would certainly agree that yearly screening via imaging would be beneficial to men. My wife recently had her 2nd mammogram @ 50 years old and something 'suspicious' was found, which resulted in a second mammogram which, thankfully, was deemed to be negative. She knows she's going to be pretty much getting her boobs squished on a yearly basis, especially considering her mother passed last year from breast cancer related disease (her aggressive treatment apparently resulted in fast onset leukemia). Why shouldn't this imaging be the norm for men, too.? Maybe at 50 years old, or 40 if there's a family history of the disease? I know women have complained about their feeling shorted on the screening and preventive side of medicine in years past, so maybe it's about time more men get involved, too?!

      "Content": "Hi, Spostre. As you can see in my signature, I've had a couple of biopsies as well as a 3T, so the second was fusion-guided and much more accurate. I understand your other health concerns, but the only way you, and your docs, will know what the suspicious area is, is if the Bx is performed. Thankfully, you seem to have a good Uro in that he suggested the 3T prior to a biopsy. While this will hopefully become the 'standard' all too often a 'blind' biopsy is done and, since the docs are 'shooting blind' the cancer is frequently missed (as was my case). Hopefully you are wrong about your life expectancy as you're only 47. While your PSA numbers aren't really suggestive of cancer in themselves (though it happens)--particularly an aggressive cancer, a lot of bad things can happen if untreated within 10 years. The Bx isn't too bad. Ask your doc for numbing gel prior to the numbing needle. That made a much more comfortable Bx #2. If something is found you may even be able to participate in an active surveillance program. Also, do you have a family history of PCa? Father, grandfather, great-grandfather, maybe? BTW, can you advice us what area you live in? Good luck, Ron And PDV: I didn't get the bennie of a 'hot nurse' during either of mine--it was a dude, but when I had a vasectomy a couple of years ago, I had 2 of them in there with me & the doc.

      "Content": "Gulfcoaster.....first of all, welcome. I can't really comment regarding your initial question regarding treatment. I guess I never paid attention to that. A lot of times treatment is based on age, as well as the PCa being confined to the capsule. Other times it comes down to the 'what ifs' if secondary treatment may be needed down the road, and other times, it comes down with guys that just aren't comfortable knowing they have something cancerous growing inside them, and they just want it OUT! Now I'll ask: What was your Gleason Score of the 2 positive samples after your first biopsy? Were they both found on the same side of your prostate, or on both sides (bilateral)? As far as the second biopsy goes, blind biopsies are far from perfect and yours wouldn't be the first time cancer that was missed during the procedure (my first one was negative). And it's also a possibility that more serious cancer was missed during both biopsies. Have you had any imaging done, other than the ultrasound during the biopsy? Your PSA of 10 isn't anywhere near normal and you already know you have cancer from your first bx. Many of the guys on this forums had quite low PSA numbers, but when cancer was found, it was very aggressive. Mine was in the mid-5s when I was dxed. This is from your only other post: Several years ago my PSA started to raise above 4. My urologist suggested I have a biopsy performed and found 2 of the 12 cores with 10-20% cancer. Over the last 3 years My PSA has raisin from 4 to 6 to 10. The cancer was slow moving ( thank goodness ). The second year followed about what the first year results showed. Now the mystery begins. This week I received a call from my urologist and he informed me the current results did not show any cancer. This should be great news but in the back of my mind someone must have screwed up. My PSA is at 10. Any idea as to what's going on? I am scheduled for another PSA in 4 months. Your PSA isn't going in any direction but 'up.' That isn't normal, and you've already had a positive finding. We're not doctors here, but most have 'been through the ringer' so to speak, in one way or another. I would seriously ask about some imaging and then a follow-up biopsy. Do you know if a 3T Multiparametric MRI is available near you? The doc can then use those images if a suspicious area is found and perform a more accurate biopsy. If not that route, I'd consider asking for a 'saturation biopsy' via the perineum which uses many more needles (and you tend to be knocked out for that one--thank God, right?!). BTW, it would be helpful to know where you are located. You can include that with your profile. You can also include a brief history about your situation, as well as your age or DOB, in the 'signature' section of your profile page. Then we don't have to keep bugging you about it! Good luck. With a PSA of 10 and 2 positive cores (that you know of), I don't think I'd want to do a lot of 'waiting around.' Best wishes, Ron",

The Bx isn't too bad. Ask your doc for numbing gel prior to the numbing needle. That made a much more comfortable Bx #2. If something is found you may even be able to participate in an active surveillance program. Also, do you have a family history of PCa? Father, grandfather, great-grandfather, maybe? BTW, can you advice us what area you live in? Good luck, Ron And PDV: I didn't get the bennie of a 'hot nurse' during either of mine--it was a dude, but when I had a vasectomy a couple of years ago, I had 2 of them in there with me & the doc. Talk about pressure!",

      "Content": "Welcome VW. Sorry you find yourself here. I'm a little thrown off by your 'stats.' Your 'Left base PZ - 4+3 Gleason 7' seems to contradict your 'Primary Gleason at Biopsy = Pattern 3 Secondary Gleason at Biopsy = Pattern 4' that you noted. Maybe I'm missing something? Should you decide on the surgery route, I wouldn't fret over the 'open' vs. 'robotic' thing. A robot doesn't make a surgeon better. Experience does--and hopefully the doc you're seeing has plenty! I see the comment frequently made that the recovery is shorter with robotic, but I've yet to figure that out, since I went through 'open' myself. I was under the knife for about an hour and anesthesia not much longer. I was in the hospital the same amount of time with my surgery--one night in and out the following day. I barely had any fluid in my JP drain, I had virtually no pain, I had none of the gas pains that are frequently a complaint of the robot crowd here, and no constipation. I think I took a Percocet or two at the hospital because they insisted, and one or two more at home because I was worried about what may come, but I really only needed an occasional ibuprofen. From what I gathered, the way the incision is made doesn't cut much muscle, thus less pain. I did have a reaction to the metal abdominal stables. Not pain really, but itchy! That's not common though. I find it interesting that a normal stay for you would be 3 days, extended to 4 for the 'open' method. Is that a Canadian thing, maybe? In the USA, one night is standard, and out the door you go by the following evening! At 68, you should do well no matter the method---well, other than doing \"nothing.\" That's likely not going to be recommended here! That 4+3, along with 9/12 cores positive, is calling you for treatment. Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi again, Cathy. If you haven't already, scan the 'sticky' threads at the top of this forum page and look particularly at the 'expectations' after DaVinci thread, as well as the others. As far as recovery, unfortunately everyone's experience is different. As far as working goes, keep in mind that he won't be able to lift anything heavier than a milk gallon for a few weeks. He'll have the catheter for about 10 days, so that will come into play also. So, it depends on his line of work, obviously, but I'd expect at least a couple of weeks--or more--off work. He can probably get by with wearing pads until his continence returns--which again, depends on the individual. I think for most, it's more of 'stress dribbles' when lifting, sitting, sneezing, coughing, laughing. etc. He'll want to stay up on his kegels to help. He's basically converting to having to pee like you gals do, lol! No more prostate to help him control his flow, so he has to learn to do it like the ladies do. As you will hear frequently, an experienced surgeon is an important key to good results, from continence to ED. Good luck. Ron",

Your pathology upgrade seems to be a common one, and pretty much what happened with me, including the 'bilateral' aspect, though I knew before surgery that a positive core was found on both lobes (even if I didn't quite understand what that meant at the time, other than AS wasn't an option).

Positive DRE? Family history? Or just routine blood work? I suggest relaxing a bit. A G6 with your low PSA isn't likely to have gone anywhere. Good luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi marysm, and welcome. 48 is on the young side to have PCa (not saying he does) but with his father having had the disease, that gives him a 1st degree relative who had it which increases his chances. I'm assuming this risk was known already since your hubby was having his PSA tested at <50 years old, which is the normal beginning testing age unless there's a family history--which there is in his case. Did he begin getting tested at 45, or were these his first tests? But yes, a PSA level of 6.9 is high, particularly for his age. However, there are other things that can affect PSA levels besides cancer. Did his doc prescribe any antibiotic to rule out any prostatitis? Any prostate enlargement noticed on the ultrasound? I would encourage you to read around this forum. Lots of useful info is sure to be found and feel free to ask away. Can you provide us your location? It may be helpful as you begin to have more questions. You can go into 'settings' and edit your profile and your location will display with your user name if you'd like.",

You noted in a post a bit back regarding Vanderbilt now able to perform a MRI targeted biopsy. Did you have that done? There has to be something causing your PSA to elevate. However, depending on your age, maybe you can just do nothing. ***I also see that you post in the 'Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Forum' so imagine you have a lot of stressors in your life.*** Sorry, bro. For the vast majority here, though, the PSA is what got the ball rolling. My first Uro told me up front that it is by no means perfect and I could get 2 different readings even with back-to-back PSAs. Have you asked about a 'PCA3' and/or 'PHI' test? Do you know your 'free psa' number? Best of luck to you, Ron",

I'm assuming this risk was known already since your hubby was having his PSA tested at <50 years old, which is the normal beginning testing age unless there's a family history--which there is in his case. Did he begin getting tested at 45, or were these his first tests? But yes, a PSA level of 6.9 is high, particularly for his age.

      "Content": "Hi Coupe. Sounds like you're frustrated. I was, too, after my first biopsy was negative (missed my cancer) yet my PSA levels were still too high/rising. You noted in a post a bit back regarding Vanderbilt now able to perform a MRI targeted biopsy. Did you have that done? There has to be something causing your PSA to elevate. However, depending on your age, maybe you can just do nothing. ***I also see that you post in the 'Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Forum' so imagine you have a lot of stressors in your life.*** Sorry, bro. For the vast majority here, though, the PSA is what got the ball rolling. My first Uro told me up front that it is by no means perfect and I could get 2 different readings even with back-to-back PSAs. Have you asked about a 'PCA3' and/or 'PHI' test? Do you know your 'free psa' number? Best of luck to you, Ron",

I'm certainly glad it was picked up before the situation got worse. As I've mentioned before, my stepfather's wasn't caught until it had escaped his prostate and was a Gleason 8 and he fought that battle for 6 years until he passed in April. No family history on his part, but Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam likely wasn't helpful. I'm certainly grateful I'm not in that situation. And while I'm a bit nervous about the surgery, I also look forward to getting it behind me. Damn you catheter bag!!!",

      "Content": "Welcome aboard Thom. In my very humble opinion, your PSA is kind of on the high side for a 3+3=6 Gleason, and it seems to be going in only one direction (not the good one) and approaching double digits, plus you already know you have cancer. I can't help but wonder if that initial biopsy missed something more serious in there (it happens, of course). Was your MRI of the 3T MP variety? Maybe ask your doc about a saturation biopsy in May? Good luck, Ron",

In my very humble opinion, your PSA is kind of on the high side for a 3+3=6 Gleason, and it seems to be going in only one direction (not the good one) and approaching double digits, plus you already know you have cancer. I can't help but wonder if that initial biopsy missed something more serious in there (it happens, of course). Was your MRI of the 3T MP variety? Maybe ask your doc about a saturation biopsy in May? Good luck, Ron",

Or they'll do it for me.....Hope so! We'll see. I may be so sick of it by then that I'll give it 'The ol' college try!\" I spoke to a friend that had one after a TURP and did it himself. It didn't hurt, it just felt like he was pulling a snake outta there, lol! I hope they put that thing in me after I'm out. I don't wanna know what they're doing to me! Anyways, my final meet prior to this adventure beginning is tomorrow with the anesthesia department for their pre-op check, and I guess any final thoughts/instructions. All this drama, and I can't even find a decent pair of going home pants! What's a guy to do?! dshinnick/Dave: You make it out to Asheville yet?

Sunday (9/11) is the anniversary of my wife losing her mom to breast cancer treatment after effects. I have 2 great aunts that may not make it through the year (one is a definite--lung to brain cancer--and doesn't have much time left), and my grandmother will be 92 in December. I'm not so sure this will be a good year---for the 2nd in a row. Suggestion, but you should be physically OK by the time of your LV meet, but if nothing else, just wear Depends guards for the time there. They work, and it's not like anyone will know. Well, my wife told me my 'package' looked bigger while I was was wearing them, lol. And you will be in Vegas..... What happens in Vegas.....",

      "Content": "I haven't posted in a bit, though I lurk (sorry, but my wife had spinal surgery in December and that has been a treat!). This question may have already been asked, but does anyone know off hand how long before life insurance is more likely to be available after RP? I bought a 'no questions asked' policy when I was retiring from law enforcement as a stopgap until I could get a normal policy (before diagnosis). Leaving my wife part of my retirement pension didn't make sense financially, so we figured out after I retired, I could cancel it and get a standard policy. Well, then this crap all happened..... I've been all undetectable since then (8/2015), and this August will be 3 years hopefully (THANK YOU DR. CARTER!!!). I know I won't get the best rates, but I'm hoping for better than the nearly $200 a month I'm paying now! I'll be 55 in August. Thanks, Ron",

I have 2 great aunts that may not make it through the year (one is a definite--lung to brain cancer--and doesn't have much time left), and my grandmother will be 92 in December. I'm not so sure this will be a good year---for the 2nd in a row. Suggestion, but you should be physically OK by the time of your LV meet, but if nothing else, just wear Depends guards for the time there. They work, and it's not like anyone will know. Well, my wife told me my 'package' looked bigger while I was was wearing them, lol. And you will be in Vegas..... What happens in Vegas.....",

      "Content": "Sorry. I obviously meant AJCC. Not sure my thread title edit is working. My apologies if this has been posted already. Effective January, 2018 the new 8th Edition staging manual takes effect. There are a few changes from the 7th edition. It looks like us pathologic pT2 guys are losing our alphabets! From what I've read elsewhere, there was controversy over the sub-categories under pT2, as hardly anyone had pT2b anyways, and by the time the tumor grew to the size to qualify for it, it almost always had invaded the other lobe, making it a T2c. Supposedly the subcategories didn't really seem to substantially alter outcomes either. Recent studies have failed to demonstrate the prognostic value of this distinction, so without evidence of clinical relevance for a subcategorized system, the eighth edition just uses a single pT2 category, for all organ-confined disease. The major changes are: T stage based on DRE only. Imaging is never used. (Nor is biopsy) Dropped the term \u0093extracapsular\u0094 in favor of \u0093extraprostatic.\u0094 No pathological T2 subcategories. The new 1-5 grouping system is being taken into consideration also. I don't want to risk violating a copyright in those pages' small print by posting a link or copying from the articles, but I'm sure Dr. Google will be of great assistance if anyone would like to read up on it.

Has he had prior PSA tests, and could you give us a history of those if he has? If this was a sudden upswing, it's probably from something other than cancer. Cancer normally takes awhile to progress and produce those high numbers. By \"goes in this week to find out if it's cancer\" what do you mean exactly? Is he just going to see a urologist or has he seen one and is getting a biopsy? Any family history of PC for your dad's family? He'll probably be fine, but we get the concerns. If you'd provide your location in your profile, as well as your dad's history in your signature, that would be helpful. Best wishes. Ron",

I was pretty surprised when he never even mentioned it during our post-Bx meeting---while my wife was relieved! She wanted nothing to do with AS. It was shortly thereafter I realized what having my tumor(s) 'bilateral' meant regarding the AS program. I'm not sure I was wired for it anyways, but if I could've bought a bit more times without the side effects, it would've been nice! But my overall experience with Dr. Carter, as well as the hospital, were definitely positive--all things considered.",

I can't speak as to a 'pump' as the only pump I had was in my hospital room post-op when I could self administer my pain meds via a drip in my IV. Little green button every 10 minutes....might have been a placebo for all I know! I was prescribed some hydrocodone meds, but I only took them the first day or two home--out of precaution, and I doubt that I needed them. My doc had told me that most patients only need an Advil or two. My understanding is that since the incision runs 'North to South' that there is little muscle damage, which may cause more pain. I think my biggest aggravation, other than my catheter tube being determined to find cabinet knobs, was my sweat pants rubbing on the incision site. Were you not offered simply an option for regular pain pills? Good luck, Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, func.... Your doc seems to be on par for the course. Have you had imaging that indicates your tumor is pushing out? With a G8, I wouldn't mess around. While radiation techniques are always improving, you kinda have to go with your gut, and it seems you've decided on surgery. Go for it and don't look back, IMO! IDK about the being 80 remark, but I'd personally feel better about it as a primary treatment if I were at least older than 57! I had 'open' surgery, and spent 1 night in the hospital (though I wouldn't have minded a second....it was quiet and relaxing, lol!) and cath time seems to run from 7-10 days as a norm. BTW, where are you located, and does your doc have a lot of experience with robotic surgery?",

      "Content": "Pervert.....LOL! Good for you!!!!! I believe the skill of the surgeon is important--obviously--no matter what the method used is. My stepfather had robotic surgery and never got his full continence back until the day he passed from this disease--nearly 6 years later. My mom sort of wishes she would've insisted on his doing the 'open' surgery for him for more 'feedback' when dealing with the nerves down there. I have no idea how experienced his surgeon was, so I can't say, in his case, if it would've mattered. My doc does the traditional 'open' procedure, but with nearly 4000 of them under his belt, and as director of adult urology at Hopkins, I figured he knew what he was cuttin' at this point! 16 days post surgery, and I can 'make it work' and my continence is very good. The 'no fluid' orgasm thing is a bit weird though. Supposedly RRP has a bit longer total recovery time than RALP, but the time under anesthesia is shorter for 'open.' There's trade-offs for most things, I guess. 16 days later, and I feel fine. My only real annoyance is the incision site. As it runs about 4 inches vertically under my navel, it's kind of hard to not rub against it--unless being in the buff is your thing!!! But that will go away in time. My wife & I believe we made the right call changing docs, from a local Uro practice, to Johns Hopkins. I didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings either, but after a negative initial biopsy, a still high PSA, and the suggestion of a saturation biopsy under general anesthesia, I decided it was time for a different perspective. So, yes. Skill and experience are important. No matter how one wishes to proceed. BTW, my sister-in-law and her family lives just outside Boston, in Arlington. Sounds like you're doing well. Good news!!!",

I'm running out the door to pick up my Viagra prescription (LOL!) but I'll mention that as far as checking your margins goes, and I assume you mean while you're still on the table having the surgeon running the prostate specimen over to pathology to examine the gland, I believe that to be surgeon-dependent. I don't think it's as common now (don't hold me to that!), maybe because surgical methods have gotten much more refined over the years. My doc did not do this, but I believe I've read on this forum of others that had this done. Have you had any imaging, like a MRI (3T) performed? As far as choosing goes, you'll probably get many responses to that. I was younger, at 51 when Dx'd and felt that I wanted it out and I didn't want to risk issues down the road with possible radiation side-effects (though these issues seem to be less of a problem as methods improve). While mine was 'only' a Gleason 6, it was on both sides/lobes and that made me a little uncomfortable. I also knew that until the gland was examined in pathology, I didn't really know what may be lurking in there. Turns out it was 3+4=7. There are more treatment options coming to bear now and they seem promising. I'll let others more knowledgeable than myself comment on them.

      "Content": "Hi, Tim.... I had 'open' rather than 'robotic' but here ya go: 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? Thankfully, I never had this occur. Or if I did, I didn't know it. Either way, I'm good with that! 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? The day of surgery, I was on a liquid diet that evening post-op. Broth and Jello, I believe. The next day I was allowed oatmeal. Once I got home, it was recommended to take it lightly for a couple of days, but no real dietary restrictions. Scrambled eggs were fine. 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. My surgery was around 7:15 a.m., but I had to be there to check in at 5:15 a.m. Ugh! And I had to do a Fleets enema before leaving the house. Nothing says \"good times\" like lying on the bathroom floor at 3:30 a.m. sticking a watery tube up your a......, well, you know! I was released to go home at around 4:30 p.m. the day after surgery. The CNP, who we met before the surgery, pulled my drain tube about an hour or so before discharge. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? I also recommend a recliner, though other guys make a bed work. For one thing, you don't have to worry so much about rolling over on your cath tube. You also want to keep the cath bag below your bladder level to decrease the chances of possibly toxic 'back flow.' I put the bag in a wire mesh basket on the floor at the side of my chair, so I could just carry the entire thing to the bathroom when it was time to empty it. This also worked well while showering, as it was easy enough to set it down and not worry about the water, though I usually just hooked the bag to my shower door bar. In my case, I'm not normally a back sleeper, and I wasn't willing to risk that I wouldn't roll over onto that contraption! I was kind of forced to stay on my back this way. 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. I was fine after I got home. And hungry! My wife checked on me, but I didn't really need any help. Hardly needed any pain meds, either. I was also given a respirator tube to blow in from time to time to be sure my lungs and all were working OK. I guess from the anesthesia. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? A large shirt and a pair of over sized sweat pants with elastic leg cuffs for discharge. I just wound the cath tube around my leg and dropped the bag down my pants leg. And my laptop/phone. Hopkins has wireless! I was also given a 'goodies bag' upon release with lubes, bandages, an extra cath bag, etc. but I didn't need that. Some guys got a small travel bag, but I didn't. Just more emptying, IMO. A nurse showed me some cleaning instructions, up close and personal, before discharge. Kind of embarrassing, and she looked to be about 70 years old! But, there's no dignity with this operation, so I just wanted to get out of there. And as I always say, be careful around cabinet and door knobs! I've read of many guys experiencing discomfort from the gas, but I didn't have that issue being an 'open' guy. Honestly, other than carrying that bag around and having a tube stuffed in my junk, I didn't have any real issues. Don't be surprised if your scrotum looks like a softball a few days out. I was! It eventually subsided though. Best of luck. You'll do fine. The worrying is the worst part. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, Tim.... I had 'open' rather than 'robotic' but here ya go: 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? Thankfully, I never had this occur. Or if I did, I didn't know it. Either way, I'm good with that! 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? The day of surgery, I was on a liquid diet that evening post-op. Broth and Jello, I believe. The next day I was allowed oatmeal. Once I got home, it was recommended to take it lightly for a couple of days, but no real dietary restrictions. Scrambled eggs were fine. 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. My surgery was around 7:15 a.m., but I had to be there to check in at 5:15 a.m. Ugh! And I had to do a Fleets enema before leaving the house. Nothing says \"good times\" like lying on the bathroom floor at 3:30 a.m. sticking a watery tube up your a......, well, you know! I was released to go home at around 4:30 p.m. the day after surgery. The CNP, who we met before the surgery, pulled my drain tube about an hour or so before discharge. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? I also recommend a recliner, though other guys make a bed work. For one thing, you don't have to worry so much about rolling over on your cath tube. You also want to keep the cath bag below your bladder level to decrease the chances of possibly toxic 'back flow.'

      "Content": "Hi Cubby. Just shouting out a big welcome to you as you've unfortunately found your way here! I'm running out the door to pick up my Viagra prescription (LOL!) but I'll mention that as far as checking your margins goes, and I assume you mean while you're still on the table having the surgeon running the prostate specimen over to pathology to examine the gland, I believe that to be surgeon-dependent. I don't think it's as common now (don't hold me to that!), maybe because surgical methods have gotten much more refined over the years. My doc did not do this, but I believe I've read on this forum of others that had this done. Have you had any imaging, like a MRI (3T) performed? As far as choosing goes, you'll probably get many responses to that. I was younger, at 51 when Dx'd and felt that I wanted it out and I didn't want to risk issues down the road with possible radiation side-effects (though these issues seem to be less of a problem as methods improve). While mine was 'only' a Gleason 6, it was on both sides/lobes and that made me a little uncomfortable. I also knew that until the gland was examined in pathology, I didn't really know what may be lurking in there. Turns out it was 3+4=7. There are more treatment options coming to bear now and they seem promising. I'll let others more knowledgeable than myself comment on them. I'm coming up on 9 months post-op and doing well, all things considered. If you'd like, you can post your 'history' over the years in your signature section, as well as your location in your profile. Then we don't have to keep pestering you with those questions. Best wishes, Ron",

      "Content": "Yep, Paul. Aging gracefully: The big lie, lol! I'm hitting my 2 year mark a few days after yours. My ortho wants to do a bursitis clean up on both hips and gluteus tear repair. I'm just so tired of the surgery stuff, I keep putting it off. I swear. I'll turn 54 later this month, and sometimes I feel like I'm going on 74! I think my law enforcement career is catching up with me! Trips, falls, take-downs, body armor and heavy equipment everyday....ugh. Good times! Thank God I made it to retirement. Apparently, my wife wasn't as keen as I was on doing a few extra years! CONGRATS ON THE PSA! Ron",

      "Content": "Welcome R2F. Hopefully this will just end up being a big bag of worrying for nothing for you and your husband. Curious though as to why you requested his getting a PSA at 48 (not that it's a bad thing as I think earlier should be the norm). Does your husband have a family history of PCa? The biopsy isn't that big of a deal, but if his doc is willing to give him a numbing gel prior to the numbing needle, I highly recommend that route. It's just a lubed finger up _there_ and it helps deaden the needle discomfort. The 12 core isn't perfect by any means. My first one missed. There are newer imaging methods coming about, but it seems many times that insurance won't cover their costs without a previous negative biopsy (though I find this logic skewed). If he could get a 3T MRI first that would be ideal, but then again, there's the insurance issue. Either way, only a biopsy can definitively rule out--or rule in--PCa, so he's going to likely have one no matter what. Again, not that big of a deal. My doc also prescribed a valium for the morning of the procedure, as well as an antibiotic. If your husband's hasn't done that, I'd ask....and if your husband's doc hasn't done that, and/or taken steps to rule out infection, frankly, I'd consider another doc! Could you place your location in your profile? It often helps the rest of us as we give suggestions. Edit: I now see that your husband doesn't know of his family history. Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, Tim.... I had 'open' rather than 'robotic' but here ya go: 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? Thankfully, I never had this occur. Or if I did, I didn't know it. Either way, I'm good with that! 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? The day of surgery, I was on a liquid diet that evening post-op. Broth and Jello, I believe. The next day I was allowed oatmeal. Once I got home, it was recommended to take it lightly for a couple of days, but no real dietary restrictions. Scrambled eggs were fine. 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. My surgery was around 7:15 a.m., but I had to be there to check in at 5:15 a.m. Ugh! And I had to do a Fleets enema before leaving the house. Nothing says \"good times\" like lying on the bathroom floor at 3:30 a.m. sticking a watery tube up your a......, well, you know! I was released to go home at around 4:30 p.m. the day after surgery. The CNP, who we met before the surgery, pulled my drain tube about an hour or so before discharge. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? I also recommend a recliner, though other guys make a bed work. For one thing, you don't have to worry so much about rolling over on your cath tube. You also want to keep the cath bag below your bladder level to decrease the chances of possibly toxic 'back flow.' I put the bag in a wire mesh basket on the floor at the side of my chair, so I could just carry the entire thing to the bathroom when it was time to empty it. This also worked well while showering, as it was easy enough to set it down and not worry about the water, though I usually just hooked the bag to my shower door bar. In my case, I'm not normally a back sleeper, and I wasn't willing to risk that I wouldn't roll over onto that contraption! I was kind of forced to stay on my back this way. 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. I was fine after I got home. And hungry! My wife checked on me, but I didn't really need any help. Hardly needed any pain meds, either. I was also given a respirator tube to blow in from time to time to be sure my lungs and all were working OK. I guess from the anesthesia. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? A large shirt and a pair of over sized sweat pants with elastic leg cuffs for discharge. I just wound the cath tube around my leg and dropped the bag down my pants leg. And my laptop/phone. Hopkins has wireless! I was also given a 'goodies bag' upon release with lubes, bandages, an extra cath bag, etc. but I didn't need that. Some guys got a small travel bag, but I didn't. Just more emptying, IMO. A nurse showed me some cleaning instructions, up close and personal, before discharge. Kind of embarrassing, and she looked to be about 70 years old! But, there's no dignity with this operation, so I just wanted to get out of there. And as I always say, be careful around cabinet and door knobs! I've read of many guys experiencing discomfort from the gas, but I didn't have that issue being an 'open' guy. Honestly, other than carrying that bag around and having a tube stuffed in my junk, I didn't have any real issues. Don't be surprised if your scrotum looks like a softball a few days out. I was! It eventually subsided though. Best of luck. You'll do fine. The worrying is the worst part. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, Tim.... I had 'open' rather than 'robotic' but here ya go: 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? Thankfully, I never had this occur. Or if I did, I didn't know it. Either way, I'm good with that! 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? The day of surgery, I was on a liquid diet that evening post-op. Broth and Jello, I believe. The next day I was allowed oatmeal. Once I got home, it was recommended to take it lightly for a couple of days, but no real dietary restrictions. Scrambled eggs were fine. 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. My surgery was around 7:15 a.m., but I had to be there to check in at 5:15 a.m. Ugh! And I had to do a Fleets enema before leaving the house. Nothing says \"good times\" like lying on the bathroom floor at 3:30 a.m. sticking a watery tube up your a......, well, you know! I was released to go home at around 4:30 p.m. the day after surgery. The CNP, who we met before the surgery, pulled my drain tube about an hour or so before discharge. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? I also recommend a recliner, though other guys make a bed work. For one thing, you don't have to worry so much about rolling over on your cath tube. You also want to keep the cath bag below your bladder level to decrease the chances of possibly toxic 'back flow.' I put the bag in a wire mesh basket on the floor at the side of my chair, so I could just carry the entire thing to the bathroom when it was time to empty it. This also worked well while showering, as it was easy enough to set it down and not worry about the water, though I usually just hooked the bag to my shower door bar. In my case, I'm not normally a back sleeper, and I wasn't willing to risk that I wouldn't roll over onto that contraption! I was kind of forced to stay on my back this way. 5.

      "Content": "So, I got my first issue of the 'Discovery' quarterly newsletter from Hopkins since my surgery. Pretty informative regarding PC and treatment developments. Aside from that, from what it's indicating, the new protocol regarding PC scores that were developed by Jonathan Epstein and presented at the American Urological Association meeting in New Orleans have been accepted by the World Health Organization and will be used in conjunction with the current Gleason system \"until it becomes widely accepted and practiced.\" It seems he's trying to simplify and categorize things better. Grade Group 1: Gleason 3+3=6 Grade Group 2: Gleason 3+4=7 Grade Group 3: Gleason 4+3=7 Grade Group 4: Gleason 8 Grade Group 5: Gleason 9 & 10 Some may have already heard of this proposal, but this is the first I've heard of its acceptance. Seems the G7 needed to be clarified, as well as the fact that nothing lower than a G6 would be diagnosed anyways.",

      "Content": "Hi Cubby. Just shouting out a big welcome to you as you've unfortunately found your way here! I'm running out the door to pick up my Viagra prescription (LOL!) but I'll mention that as far as checking your margins goes, and I assume you mean while you're still on the table having the surgeon running the prostate specimen over to pathology to examine the gland, I believe that to be surgeon-dependent. I don't think it's as common now (don't hold me to that!), maybe because surgical methods have gotten much more refined over the years. My doc did not do this, but I believe I've read on this forum of others that had this done. Have you had any imaging, like a MRI (3T) performed? As far as choosing goes, you'll probably get many responses to that. I was younger, at 51 when Dx'd and felt that I wanted it out and I didn't want to risk issues down the road with possible radiation side-effects (though these issues seem to be less of a problem as methods improve). While mine was 'only' a Gleason 6, it was on both sides/lobes and that made me a little uncomfortable. I also knew that until the gland was examined in pathology, I didn't really know what may be lurking in there. Turns out it was 3+4=7. There are more treatment options coming to bear now and they seem promising. I'll let others more knowledgeable than myself comment on them. I'm coming up on 9 months post-op and doing well, all things considered. If you'd like, you can post your 'history' over the years in your signature section, as well as your location in your profile. Then we don't have to keep pestering you with those questions. Best wishes, Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, Tim.... I had 'open' rather than 'robotic' but here ya go: 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? Thankfully, I never had this occur. Or if I did, I didn't know it. Either way, I'm good with that! 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? The day of surgery, I was on a liquid diet that evening post-op. Broth and Jello, I believe. The next day I was allowed oatmeal. Once I got home, it was recommended to take it lightly for a couple of days, but no real dietary restrictions. Scrambled eggs were fine. 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. My surgery was around 7:15 a.m., but I had to be there to check in at 5:15 a.m. Ugh! And I had to do a Fleets enema before leaving the house. Nothing says \"good times\" like lying on the bathroom floor at 3:30 a.m. sticking a watery tube up your a......, well, you know! I was released to go home at around 4:30 p.m. the day after surgery. The CNP, who we met before the surgery, pulled my drain tube about an hour or so before discharge. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? I also recommend a recliner, though other guys make a bed work. For one thing, you don't have to worry so much about rolling over on your cath tube. You also want to keep the cath bag below your bladder level to decrease the chances of possibly toxic 'back flow.' I put the bag in a wire mesh basket on the floor at the side of my chair, so I could just carry the entire thing to the bathroom when it was time to empty it. This also worked well while showering, as it was easy enough to set it down and not worry about the water, though I usually just hooked the bag to my shower door bar. In my case, I'm not normally a back sleeper, and I wasn't willing to risk that I wouldn't roll over onto that contraption! I was kind of forced to stay on my back this way. 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. I was fine after I got home. And hungry! My wife checked on me, but I didn't really need any help. Hardly needed any pain meds, either. I was also given a respirator tube to blow in from time to time to be sure my lungs and all were working OK. I guess from the anesthesia. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? A large shirt and a pair of over sized sweat pants with elastic leg cuffs for discharge. I just wound the cath tube around my leg and dropped the bag down my pants leg. And my laptop/phone. Hopkins has wireless! I was also given a 'goodies bag' upon release with lubes, bandages, an extra cath bag, etc. but I didn't need that. Some guys got a small travel bag, but I didn't. Just more emptying, IMO. A nurse showed me some cleaning instructions, up close and personal, before discharge. Kind of embarrassing, and she looked to be about 70 years old! But, there's no dignity with this operation, so I just wanted to get out of there. And as I always say, be careful around cabinet and door knobs! I've read of many guys experiencing discomfort from the gas, but I didn't have that issue being an 'open' guy. Honestly, other than carrying that bag around and having a tube stuffed in my junk, I didn't have any real issues. Don't be surprised if your scrotum looks like a softball a few days out. I was! It eventually subsided though. Best of luck. You'll do fine. The worrying is the worst part. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, Tim.... I had 'open' rather than 'robotic' but here ya go: 1. It seems as if a lot of men suffer from Bladder Spasm's due to having their catheter in. And some describe them as a constant urge to urinate and others describe it as an excruciating pain. I am curious how often this happens and how much of a problem this was for you? Be honest here. Also, if this did happen to you, did you find anything that brought them on and anything that minimized or eliminated them ? Thankfully, I never had this occur. Or if I did, I didn't know it. Either way, I'm good with that! 2. What will my diet be like following surgery and how long will it take to improve? I believe it is recommended to have a liquid diet following surgery but I am curious why this is, and how soon (days?) generally until I could have solid food ? The day of surgery, I was on a liquid diet that evening post-op. Broth and Jello, I believe. The next day I was allowed oatmeal. Once I got home, it was recommended to take it lightly for a couple of days, but no real dietary restrictions. Scrambled eggs were fine. 3. Am curious how long your hospital stay was and if there were any complications in your case ? I was told by a nurse 2-3 days but most everywhere I read seems to indicate only overnight. My surgery was around 7:15 a.m., but I had to be there to check in at 5:15 a.m. Ugh! And I had to do a Fleets enema before leaving the house. Nothing says \"good times\" like lying on the bathroom floor at 3:30 a.m. sticking a watery tube up your a......, well, you know! I was released to go home at around 4:30 p.m. the day after surgery. The CNP, who we met before the surgery, pulled my drain tube about an hour or so before discharge. 4. It seems the general advice is to sleep on a recliner rather than a bed following Robotic Prostatectomy. I am curious why this is and what is the actual thing that makes sleeping in a bed difficult ? Reason I ask is because I don't have a recliner. For those of you who didn't have a recliner, how did you manage sleeping ? Also, how long does it take (Days?) until you were able to sleep on a regular bed ? I also recommend a recliner, though other guys make a bed work. For one thing, you don't have to worry so much about rolling over on your cath tube. You also want to keep the cath bag below your bladder level to decrease the chances of possibly toxic 'back flow.' I put the bag in a wire mesh basket on the floor at the side of my chair, so I could just carry the entire thing to the bathroom when it was time to empty it. This also worked well while showering, as it was easy enough to set it down and not worry about the water, though I usually just hooked the bag to my shower door bar. In my case, I'm not normally a back sleeper, and I wasn't willing to risk that I wouldn't roll over onto that contraption! I was kind of forced to stay on my back this way. 5. When you returned home from the hospital, is there anything that you absolutely couldn't do by yourself and needed help with ? Reason I ask is because I live alone but can have a friend stop over once in a while. I was fine after I got home. And hungry! My wife checked on me, but I didn't really need any help. Hardly needed any pain meds, either. I was also given a respirator tube to blow in from time to time to be sure my lungs and all were working OK. I guess from the anesthesia. 6. What did you take to the hospital on your surgery day ? A large shirt and a pair of over sized sweat pants with elastic leg cuffs for discharge. I just wound the cath tube around my leg and dropped the bag down my pants leg. And my laptop/phone. Hopkins has wireless! I was also given a 'goodies bag' upon release with lubes, bandages, an extra cath bag, etc. but I didn't need that. Some guys got a small travel bag, but I didn't. Just more emptying, IMO. A nurse showed me some cleaning instructions, up close and personal, before discharge. Kind of embarrassing, and she looked to be about 70 years old! But, there's no dignity with this operation, so I just wanted to get out of there. And as I always say, be careful around cabinet and door knobs! I've read of many guys experiencing discomfort from the gas, but I didn't have that issue being an 'open' guy. Honestly, other than carrying that bag around and having a tube stuffed in my junk, I didn't have any real issues. Don't be surprised if your scrotum looks like a softball a few days out. I was! It eventually subsided though. Best of luck. You'll do fine. The worrying is the worst part. Ron",

I'm running out the door to pick up my Viagra prescription (LOL!) but I'll mention that as far as checking your margins goes, and I assume you mean while you're still on the table having the surgeon running the prostate specimen over to pathology to examine the gland, I believe that to be surgeon-dependent.

As far as choosing goes, you'll probably get many responses to that.

The biopsy isn't that big of a deal, but if his doc is willing to give him a numbing gel prior to the numbing needle, I highly recommend that route. It's just a lubed finger up _there_ and it helps deaden the needle discomfort. The 12 core isn't perfect by any means. My first one missed. There are newer imaging methods coming about, but it seems many times that insurance won't cover their costs without a previous negative biopsy (though I find this logic skewed). If he could get a 3T MRI first that would be ideal, but then again, there's the insurance issue. Either way, only a biopsy can definitively rule out--or rule in--PCa, so he's going to likely have one no matter what. Again, not that big of a deal. My doc also prescribed a valium for the morning of the procedure, as well as an antibiotic. If your husband's hasn't done that, I'd ask....and if your husband's doc hasn't done that, and/or taken steps to rule out infection, frankly, I'd consider another doc! Could you place your location in your profile? It often helps the rest of us as we give suggestions. Edit: I now see that your husband doesn't know of his family history. Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Experience with Spaceoar Gel Diagnosis: Gleason 4+3, several tissue samples with cancer cells. Therapy: Radiation About 3 weeks ago the gel was injected between prostate and colon as a shield to protect colon from radiation. Radiation is underway now. This gel is a new development ho help reduce radiation side efects. Problem: Spaceoar Gel apparently to low positioned and eventually some gel in the injection cannula holes. Situation: Permanent pain in the perineum area between scrotum and anus. Very uncomfortable. This gel gets hard right after the injection. Now it is pressing hard and rubbing permanently from the inside. No seating for lunch or dinner, no car driving. Pain is always there. Gel gets dissolved and disappears apparently after 2-3 months. I can't imagine waiting so long with that pain. Any experience with such a situation or any advice? Thank you Chuck, found his only other post from a couple years ago. Makes me wonder if it's the gel that was supposed to dissolve/disappear. I've never heard of this gel, not being a radiation guy (at least not yet!).",

      "Content": "Welcome R2F. Hopefully this will just end up being a big bag of worrying for nothing for you and your husband. Curious though as to why you requested his getting a PSA at 48 (not that it's a bad thing as I think earlier should be the norm). Does your husband have a family history of PCa? The biopsy isn't that big of a deal, but if his doc is willing to give him a numbing gel prior to the numbing needle, I highly recommend that route. It's just a lubed finger up _there_ and it helps deaden the needle discomfort. The 12 core isn't perfect by any means. My first one missed.

Curious though as to why you requested his getting a PSA at 48 (not that it's a bad thing as I think earlier should be the norm). Does your husband have a family history of PCa? The biopsy isn't that big of a deal, but if his doc is willing to give him a numbing gel prior to the numbing needle, I highly recommend that route. It's just a lubed finger up _there_ and it helps deaden the needle discomfort. The 12 core isn't perfect by any means. My first one missed. There are newer imaging methods coming about, but it seems many times that insurance won't cover their costs without a previous negative biopsy (though I find this logic skewed). If he could get a 3T MRI first that would be ideal, but then again, there's the insurance issue. Either way, only a biopsy can definitively rule out--or rule in--PCa, so he's going to likely have one no matter what. Again, not that big of a deal. My doc also prescribed a valium for the morning of the procedure, as well as an antibiotic. If your husband's hasn't done that, I'd ask....and if your husband's doc hasn't done that, and/or taken steps to rule out infection, frankly, I'd consider another doc! Could you place your location in your profile? It often helps the rest of us as we give suggestions. Edit: I now see that your husband doesn't know of his family history. Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. The PSA results were uploaded to 'MyChart' this morning. <0.1---whew! MM--thanks. I know I should be OK, especially with my path report, but then I'll see someone on one of these sites that should've been 'OK' also--and he's not. Everything being contained was a blessing, especially as I went into this blindsided, and what I blew off as a routine blood draw at the time changed my life. I believe my uncle has made it about 19 years now post-surgery w/o any type of recurrence issues. I realize that you've had a much tougher hand dealt to you and you're not that much older than me. I wish you, and all the forum brothers (and their significant others) well in their journeys. Jim--LOL! That whole thing with your lungs is just crazy. I hope you're as lucky at the poker table! Maybe I'll go out and buy a lottery ticket today. When I checked in at JH to have my blood drawn, I was given a number---13! I was like.....\"really?!\" Jimbow--My urine stream seems fine. I didn't have a significantly enlarged prostate prior to surgery, so I can't say that's it better than before, but I haven't had any issues--though sometimes the pattern seems a bit wider than I would like, LOL! My primary doc will likely take over the PSA testing at this point. Dr. Carter told me that barring any concerns, we don't have to have our every 3 month follow-up phone calls anymore. Because of this, my next PSA check will probably be in a little over 4 months rather than 6--the timing of the appointment and such. So, I'll try and relax until then. Best to all, Ron",

      "Content": "Hi Marve. Do I understand that this upcoming biopsy will be the 4th that your uncle is being subjected to? I wouldn't even wish that on someone I don't like! I agree with Chuck. IMO, your Uncle should be pursuing treatment options, not be scheduled for another biopsy. The cancer has already been located. What else are they hoping for? IMO, that there was no cancer on biopsy #3 simply means the doctor missed it with the needles because the cancer found the first 2 times didn't just go away! If your uncle's doctor missed cancer the last time, what if he is missing cancer that is more serious than Gleason 6? Frankly, with 5 total cores positive I believe he should've already had treatment recommended, unless, as Chuck said, the doctor is under some type of strict protocol that doesn't give him many treatment options at this point. Is this your father's brother?",

      "Content": "Hi Marve. Do I understand that this upcoming biopsy will be the 4th that your uncle is being subjected to? I wouldn't even wish that on someone I don't like! I agree with Chuck. IMO, your Uncle should be pursuing treatment options, not be scheduled for another biopsy. The cancer has already been located. What else are they hoping for? IMO, that there was no cancer on biopsy #3 simply means the doctor missed it with the needles because the cancer found the first 2 times didn't just go away! If your uncle's doctor missed cancer the last time, what if he is missing cancer that is more serious than Gleason 6? Frankly, with 5 total cores positive I believe he should've already had treatment recommended, unless, as Chuck said, the doctor is under some type of strict protocol that doesn't give him many treatment options at this point. Is this your father's brother?",

      "Content": "Brava, I had rotator cuff surgery back in 2012. I told myself that if I could survive that recovery, I could survive anything--and it was outpatient! Unfortunately, I had to test my theory with the RP surgery (also 51 yoa). Thinking about it now, I still think the rotator cuff was worse in the recovery aspect. Sometimes I'd get these really awful shooting pains in my upper arm and I slept in a recliner for 6 weeks with a big sling on. Then physical therapy..... The RP surgery is major stuff, don't get me wrong, but really the recovery wasn't so bad. The catheter is a PITA, but it's a temporary annoyance more than anything. And I actually enjoyed my first and only overnight hospital stay at Hopkins. Private room, TV, little green button I got to push every 10 minutes for my pain meds (probably didn't even need it, but why risk it?!), and I didn't have any barking dogs and crazy cats like I do at home. I wouldn't have minded an extra night! Have you posted your location? You can add that to your profile. Goof luck, Ron",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. The PSA results were uploaded to 'MyChart' this morning. <0.1---whew! MM--thanks. I know I should be OK, especially with my path report, but then I'll see someone on one of these sites that should've been 'OK' also--and he's not. Everything being contained was a blessing, especially as I went into this blindsided, and what I blew off as a routine blood draw at the time changed my life. I believe my uncle has made it about 19 years now post-surgery w/o any type of recurrence issues. I realize that you've had a much tougher hand dealt to you and you're not that much older than me. I wish you, and all the forum brothers (and their significant others) well in their journeys. Jim--LOL! That whole thing with your lungs is just crazy. I hope you're as lucky at the poker table! Maybe I'll go out and buy a lottery ticket today. When I checked in at JH to have my blood drawn, I was given a number---13! I was like.....\"really?!\" Jimbow--My urine stream seems fine. I didn't have a significantly enlarged prostate prior to surgery, so I can't say that's it better than before, but I haven't had any issues--though sometimes the pattern seems a bit wider than I would like, LOL! My primary doc will likely take over the PSA testing at this point. Dr. Carter told me that barring any concerns, we don't have to have our every 3 month follow-up phone calls anymore. Because of this, my next PSA check will probably be in a little over 4 months rather than 6--the timing of the appointment and such. So, I'll try and relax until then. Best to all, Ron",

Erections are pretty good, though I admit I miss the 'fluid' aspect more than I thought I would. I usually have a shield at night, or if I go out to something formal, just in case.

      "Content": "Anotherpc---sorry about you having to join us, and at only 39 (WTF?!). Please do get a 2nd opinion on your biopsy slides, and ask to have the slides sent to Dr. Epstein at Johns Hopkins. He's the expert. Those low PSAs with G9 suggest the need for quick action. I wish all the best for you. Maybe Epstein will (hopefully) have a different view and a downgrade. Please check your biopsy report when you get it for 'adenocarcinoma' vs. the 'intraductal' (IDC-P) variety. The latter seems to be more aggressive with a lower PSA while a higher Gleason score. If that's the case, you'll want to begin researching experts in that treatment field. Good (great) luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. The PSA results were uploaded to 'MyChart' this morning. <0.1---whew! MM--thanks. I know I should be OK, especially with my path report, but then I'll see someone on one of these sites that should've been 'OK' also--and he's not. Everything being contained was a blessing, especially as I went into this blindsided, and what I blew off as a routine blood draw at the time changed my life. I believe my uncle has made it about 19 years now post-surgery w/o any type of recurrence issues. I realize that you've had a much tougher hand dealt to you and you're not that much older than me. I wish you, and all the forum brothers (and their significant others) well in their journeys. Jim--LOL! That whole thing with your lungs is just crazy. I hope you're as lucky at the poker table! Maybe I'll go out and buy a lottery ticket today. When I checked in at JH to have my blood drawn, I was given a number---13! I was like.....\"really?!\" Jimbow--My urine stream seems fine. I didn't have a significantly enlarged prostate prior to surgery, so I can't say that's it better than before, but I haven't had any issues--though sometimes the pattern seems a bit wider than I would like, LOL! My primary doc will likely take over the PSA testing at this point. Dr. Carter told me that barring any concerns, we don't have to have our every 3 month follow-up phone calls anymore. Because of this, my next PSA check will probably be in a little over 4 months rather than 6--the timing of the appointment and such. So, I'll try and relax until then. Best to all, Ron",

Of course, it's your money and the $250 2nd opinion fee seems correct. I believe the fee you're looking at is for more services.

      "Content": "Brava, I had rotator cuff surgery back in 2012. I told myself that if I could survive that recovery, I could survive anything--and it was outpatient! Unfortunately, I had to test my theory with the RP surgery (also 51 yoa). Thinking about it now, I still think the rotator cuff was worse in the recovery aspect. Sometimes I'd get these really awful shooting pains in my upper arm and I slept in a recliner for 6 weeks with a big sling on. Then physical therapy..... The RP surgery is major stuff, don't get me wrong, but really the recovery wasn't so bad. The catheter is a PITA, but it's a temporary annoyance more than anything. And I actually enjoyed my first and only overnight hospital stay at Hopkins. Private room, TV, little green button I got to push every 10 minutes for my pain meds (probably didn't even need it, but why risk it?!), and I didn't have any barking dogs and crazy cats like I do at home. I wouldn't have minded an extra night! Have you posted your location? You can add that to your profile. Goof luck, Ron",

I believe that's pretty standard with robotic surgery. My surgery was of the 'open' type thus all I needed was a Fleets enema the morning of. I. too, decided a recliner was the way to go. Sleeping soundly is somewhat a problem and the catheter is a nuisance. The bag has to be below the bladder at all times to prevent potentially toxic 'backflow' so I just set it in a bucket on the floor beside me as I slept (or tried to sleep).",

While my numbers would seem to fit the bill, mine being bi-lateral disqualified me from the program at Hopkins. Davis' stats seem to indicate his is bilateral, too. I assume that having the disease on both sides, even while low grade, is more risky than if the 2 cores were on one side--unilateral--only. I'm not saying that it can't be done, only it seems facility dependent.",

      "Content": "Hi John. Welcome..... That's indeed a pretty sharp increase in 2 months. Any chance you may have done anything to your prostate just prior to the last PSA? Infection? Bike riding, sex, did the doc perform a DRE (finger wave) prior to the test? That's still a good jump, but just thinking out loud I guess...... Back to the question. I was biopsied the second time and Dx in March '14. I asked my surgeon what type of window should I be looking at regarding surgery dates, and he said I don't have to rush, but I might want to keep it to within 6 months. I had surgery in August, 5 months later. My Dx was a G6 also, and my pre-surgery PSA was lower at 5.7. Personally, I'd take the trip. She deserves it after putting up with you for 43 years, LOL! I kid, I kid..... If the chief urologist isn't concerned, I wouldn't be too much. Besides, nothing is going to get done before your next PSA in March anyways. Maybe just go with that and see what happens? I don't know if it's possible for you, but many here would recommend that you get a 3T mp-MRI. It can show if it looks like anything is involving your lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, or if anything appears to have escaped your prostate. It may help your piece of mind in the meantime. Maybe check with your doc about this and see what he thinks? Were your prior PSAs before the 4.7 elevated also? Good luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi John. Welcome..... That's indeed a pretty sharp increase in 2 months. Any chance you may have done anything to your prostate just prior to the last PSA? Infection? Bike riding, sex, did the doc perform a DRE (finger wave) prior to the test? That's still a good jump, but just thinking out loud I guess...... Back to the question. I was biopsied the second time and Dx in March '14. I asked my surgeon what type of window should I be looking at regarding surgery dates, and he said I don't have to rush, but I might want to keep it to within 6 months. I had surgery in August, 5 months later. My Dx was a G6 also, and my pre-surgery PSA was lower at 5.7. Personally, I'd take the trip. She deserves it after putting up with you for 43 years, LOL! I kid, I kid..... If the chief urologist isn't concerned, I wouldn't be too much. Besides, nothing is going to get done before your next PSA in March anyways. Maybe just go with that and see what happens? I don't know if it's possible for you, but many here would recommend that you get a 3T mp-MRI. It can show if it looks like anything is involving your lymph nodes, seminal vesicles, or if anything appears to have escaped your prostate. It may help your piece of mind in the meantime. Maybe check with your doc about this and see what he thinks? Were your prior PSAs before the 4.7 elevated also? Good luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Mav-- luckily, you really don't have to be in a rush. At your age, surgery has been the 'standard' for quite some time now, though I realize treatments evolve. When I asked my doc about radiation he didn't tell me I was crazy or anything, but he mentioned the possibility of other cancers as a result of radiation, like bladder, urethral, etc. It IS radiation after all! If I was a bit older, I'd likely outlive those risks. At my age of 51 at the time, hmmm......just don't know. Regarding surgery after radiation? Well, as you said, surgery may still be an option. But if not? And one big thing about surgery is that you don't really know how aggressive your cancer is until the pathologist has it under the 'scope, which surgery confirms. Tough decisions. We've been there. Good luck! Ron",

And be careful around cabinet knobs with that tube! As far as the bag, I just dropped it down inside my oversized sweatpants leg when I walked, though sometimes, when I went out for an evening stroll, I placed it inside a shopping bag. Maybe you could get a squeegee and carry it around with your bucket. If the neighbors ask, you clean car windows at intersections for extra money, lol! Good luck and hang in there! Ron",

As you're already aware, you'll get arguments for/against both, and it certainly doesn't hurt to speak to the radiation docs in additions to the surgeons, but you're a young guy, and the benefit of removal is that the final pathology will give you your true Gleason score, and removal may help clear up some other prostate-related issues you may have......just my 2 cents. Obviously AS isn't an option. Best of luck on your decision. Ron",

When I asked my doc about radiation he didn't tell me I was crazy or anything, but he mentioned the possibility of other cancers as a result of radiation, like bladder, urethral, etc. It IS radiation after all! If I was a bit older, I'd likely outlive those risks. At my age of 51 at the time, hmmm......just don't know. Regarding surgery after radiation? Well, as you said, surgery may still be an option. But if not? And one big thing about surgery is that you don't really know how aggressive your cancer is until the pathologist has it under the 'scope, which surgery confirms. Tough decisions. We've been there. Good luck! Ron",

      "Content": "Mav-- luckily, you really don't have to be in a rush. At your age, surgery has been the 'standard' for quite some time now, though I realize treatments evolve. When I asked my doc about radiation he didn't tell me I was crazy or anything, but he mentioned the possibility of other cancers as a result of radiation, like bladder, urethral, etc. It IS radiation after all! If I was a bit older, I'd likely outlive those risks. At my age of 51 at the time, hmmm......just don't know. Regarding surgery after radiation? Well, as you said, surgery may still be an option. But if not? And one big thing about surgery is that you don't really know how aggressive your cancer is until the pathologist has it under the 'scope, which surgery confirms. Tough decisions. We've been there. Good luck! Ron",

As you're already aware, you'll get arguments for/against both, and it certainly doesn't hurt to speak to the radiation docs in additions to the surgeons, but you're a young guy, and the benefit of removal is that the final pathology will give you your true Gleason score, and removal may help clear up some other prostate-related issues you may have......just my 2 cents. Obviously AS isn't an option. Best of luck on your decision. Ron",

      "Content": "Good luck, Gary. If your experience is close to mine at Johns Hopkins, you'll be discharged the day after your surgery sometime after 4:00 p.m. Your drain tube should be removed shortly before that. Also expect a lesson from a nurse who will show you the proper way to clean and lube the catheter tube. I think my nurse was about 70 years old, lol! But hey. You'll have no dignity left by that time anyways! I only received the large catheter drain bag. While I can't say if it's normal at JH, but when I asked the nurse she said something about them only sending you home with that one bag. You should also receive a 'goodie bag' before discharge containing an extra, large catheter bag (I never needed it), swabs, lubes, antibiotic ointments, creams, gauze, etc. Something else to think about as you're packing up to go back home on the plane, too. I had open surgery rather than robotic, and I was fine pain wise from the night I got home, really. Another thing that I found out after my surgery: Apparently I'm 'TSA-prone' now! The first time I flew post-surgery, and out of BWI at that, I got pulled to the side after going through the scanner and hand-wanded. That's never happened before. I couldn't figure out why until I had a hip xray a bit later and the tech asked \"have you ever had any surgery, like maybe around your prostate?\" What? Well, after getting a look, it's a bit odd in there now. IDK if it's the suturing or staples, but a bunch of white lines were clearly visible. Hope I'm not on the 'watch list' now! Not sure of your BWI experience, but just be aware that it can get busy. I never thought to ask before, but as I was taking my elderly father-in-law through the last time and staring at long lines at the TSA checkpoint, I mentioned his problems with standing a long time to the TSA agent and she let us through the rope and through the scanners. Awesome! I was also able to obtain a 'pass' that allowed me to assist him as far as the gate for his flight (in case you need extra assistance). All in all, I had a great experience at JH. I awoke in recovery and stayed until a room was available. It was a private room in the Sheikh Zayed Tower on the 11th floor. I didn't have any barking dogs or crazy cats to put up with for one night in my life, and I had a little green button to push every 10 minutes for pain if I needed it. I only remember being awakened once overnight by a nurse checking/replacing things. My own TV and wi-fi is available if you're up to it. Be sure to grab a crab cake before leaving town! Ron",

      "Content": "It's out! , mikeg. I'll take your word for it. This morning has come and gone and the catheter removal was AWESOME! I told my wife as we were leaving Hopkins that I felt like we were forgetting something...... It felt a bit strange upon removal, but nothing painful. I enjoyed a couple Cap'n Morgan & Cokes last night because I figured I'd have to be more mindful of alcohol consumption once I got rid of my 'bathroom buddy!\" Unfortunately, I had a bit of a monkey wrench tossed at me. The incision site in my lower abdomen has apparently developed a bit of an infection. It's been a bit red and sore, but I just wrote that off to irritation from the waistband of my pants/shorts rubbing against the area. So, no surgical staple removal today. I pulled on my man-diaper, was put on antibiotics, and off to home I went. We'll try again Friday. Side note: I got to try using a toilet for the first time in 12 days. I did it! LOL!!! I was a little damp--from dribbles no doubt--in my diaper after getting home. I felt like I had to 'go' and gave it a try. Hey, it still works! The nurse suggested that I try to hold my stream as I'm urinating to get into practice. I tried it and I was able to stop the flow, albeit not nearly as quickly as before the surgery, but it's a (hopeful) start. Now that I say this, just watch. Tomorrow I'll be peeing all over myself! Well, back to the Kegels!",

      "Content": "Awesome Dave. If you're near Columbia, you aren't far from me. I also had a great experience after open RP at JH. I remember being wheeled down the hallway towards surgery, and as the hallway was becoming colder as I neared my destination, thinking about making a break for it! Dr. H. Ballentine Carter was recommended to me there by a friend of my wife's friend who is a scientist there. I'm glad a switched from the local uro group. I liked the first doc and all, but as much as I complain about living in Maryland, having Johns Hopkins 30 minutes away isn't one of those reasons! Dr. Carter gave me the option of removing the catheter myself, but I figured I had to go back and have the abdominal staples removed anyways. I suppose if someone comes from a great distance it's a viable option. The only real issue I had was an apparent skin reaction to the staples, which delayed their removal a couple of days. Good luck on your pending entry into the 'Zero Club!' Ron",

      "Content": "I saw that my path report was uploaded to my Johns Hopkins online 'chart' but I knew I was going to be speaking with my surgeon, Dr. Carter, about the report this morning so I refused to look at it until after that discussion. No point in potentially getting myself worked up over things I may misinterpret, right? So, good news all in all. Disease was prostate confined. Nothing had spread to the lymph nodes or seminal vesicles--whew!!! I updated my signature with the results. I believe my decision to have surgery was reaffirmed with the upgrade to a Gleason 7, albeit the (3+4) variety and only 2% involvement, but anything above a GS 6 was going to cause me stress! So, the adage rings true: We really don't know what we have until it's out and under a microscope. Well, that was the climax of the weekend.....what do we do now??!! I'll see Dr. Carter next Wednesday when I get these staples out of my abdomen and get rid of this damn catheter! I guess my next sweat will be my next PSA, but Dr. Carter told me I'm over-worrying myself as I should be fine.....yeah, easy for him to say! I think I'll have a few drinks this weekend to celebrate. Catheter bag: Do your duty! Thanks for the positive vibes everybody. They were much appreciated!",

      "Content": "Good luck, Gary. If your experience is close to mine at Johns Hopkins, you'll be discharged the day after your surgery sometime after 4:00 p.m. Your drain tube should be removed shortly before that. Also expect a lesson from a nurse who will show you the proper way to clean and lube the catheter tube. I think my nurse was about 70 years old, lol! But hey. You'll have no dignity left by that time anyways! I only received the large catheter drain bag. While I can't say if it's normal at JH, but when I asked the nurse she said something about them only sending you home with that one bag. You should also receive a 'goodie bag' before discharge containing an extra, large catheter bag (I never needed it), swabs, lubes, antibiotic ointments, creams, gauze, etc. Something else to think about as you're packing up to go back home on the plane, too. I had open surgery rather than robotic, and I was fine pain wise from the night I got home, really. Another thing that I found out after my surgery: Apparently I'm 'TSA-prone' now! The first time I flew post-surgery, and out of BWI at that, I got pulled to the side after going through the scanner and hand-wanded. That's never happened before. I couldn't figure out why until I had a hip xray a bit later and the tech asked \"have you ever had any surgery, like maybe around your prostate?\" What? Well, after getting a look, it's a bit odd in there now. IDK if it's the suturing or staples, but a bunch of white lines were clearly visible. Hope I'm not on the 'watch list' now! Not sure of your BWI experience, but just be aware that it can get busy. I never thought to ask before, but as I was taking my elderly father-in-law through the last time and staring at long lines at the TSA checkpoint, I mentioned his problems with standing a long time to the TSA agent and she let us through the rope and through the scanners. Awesome! I was also able to obtain a 'pass' that allowed me to assist him as far as the gate for his flight (in case you need extra assistance). All in all, I had a great experience at JH. I awoke in recovery and stayed until a room was available. It was a private room in the Sheikh Zayed Tower on the 11th floor. I didn't have any barking dogs or crazy cats to put up with for one night in my life, and I had a little green button to push every 10 minutes for pain if I needed it. I only remember being awakened once overnight by a nurse checking/replacing things. My own TV and wi-fi is available if you're up to it. Be sure to grab a crab cake before leaving town! Ron",

      "Content": "I saw that my path report was uploaded to my Johns Hopkins online 'chart' but I knew I was going to be speaking with my surgeon, Dr. Carter, about the report this morning so I refused to look at it until after that discussion. No point in potentially getting myself worked up over things I may misinterpret, right? So, good news all in all. Disease was prostate confined. Nothing had spread to the lymph nodes or seminal vesicles--whew!!! I updated my signature with the results. I believe my decision to have surgery was reaffirmed with the upgrade to a Gleason 7, albeit the (3+4) variety and only 2% involvement, but anything above a GS 6 was going to cause me stress! So, the adage rings true: We really don't know what we have until it's out and under a microscope. Well, that was the climax of the weekend.....what do we do now??!! I'll see Dr. Carter next Wednesday when I get these staples out of my abdomen and get rid of this damn catheter! I guess my next sweat will be my next PSA, but Dr. Carter told me I'm over-worrying myself as I should be fine.....yeah, easy for him to say! I think I'll have a few drinks this weekend to celebrate. Catheter bag: Do your duty! Thanks for the positive vibes everybody. They were much appreciated!",

      "Content": "It's out! , mikeg. I'll take your word for it. This morning has come and gone and the catheter removal was AWESOME! I told my wife as we were leaving Hopkins that I felt like we were forgetting something...... It felt a bit strange upon removal, but nothing painful. I enjoyed a couple Cap'n Morgan & Cokes last night because I figured I'd have to be more mindful of alcohol consumption once I got rid of my 'bathroom buddy!\" Unfortunately, I had a bit of a monkey wrench tossed at me. The incision site in my lower abdomen has apparently developed a bit of an infection. It's been a bit red and sore, but I just wrote that off to irritation from the waistband of my pants/shorts rubbing against the area. So, no surgical staple removal today. I pulled on my man-diaper, was put on antibiotics, and off to home I went. We'll try again Friday. Side note: I got to try using a toilet for the first time in 12 days. I did it! LOL!!! I was a little damp--from dribbles no doubt--in my diaper after getting home. I felt like I had to 'go' and gave it a try. Hey, it still works! The nurse suggested that I try to hold my stream as I'm urinating to get into practice. I tried it and I was able to stop the flow, albeit not nearly as quickly as before the surgery, but it's a (hopeful) start. Now that I say this, just watch. Tomorrow I'll be peeing all over myself!

Just tossing this out there, but Johns Hopkins is what, about 90 minutes--or less--from Philly? It may be worth considering for a second look. I can't help with your treatment decision, but I chose surgery at JH and am doing well. Other forum brothers have had similar experiences there. As far as logistics, when I made my appointment with the surgeon for a consultation regarding my treatment options, he told me that it would be about 2 months out for scheduling. In the end it was closer to 3, but I procrastinated until my wife put her foot down, LOL! My doc is sort of 'in demand' too, so that may have mattered. Day of surgery you'll get there to check in (5:15 am, for me!) and they rolled me back about 7:30 or so. I met the doc while I was having my IV inserted and some blood drawn in pre-op. My wife was allowed to stay with me for all this, until I was rolled away. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the young fella rolling me down the hallway to stop neat the elevator so I could make a run for it , I entered the OR and met the doc again as well as the surgical staff----then I woke up in recovery! That was about 3 hours later (my surgery was 'open' rather than robotic, so my understanding is that the procedure is a little faster with an experienced surgeon, thus you're not 'out' as long---everyone's mileage varies!). Then I waited for a room (private room in the new tower at Hopkins. Very peaceful.) I was discharged late the next afternoon/early evening (around 4:00 pm I think). For most, it's a one night hospital stay. You can go home after release, though you'll need a driver. You'll have your 'dancing partner' with you, AKA, the catheter, for about 10 days total. I was given the option of removing it myself (Um, no!) but I'm not too far from the hospital so they can do it! Apparently since many folks come to JH from all over, it's an option for some. Doc said he'd send me home with a syringe for the saline. If you decided on a hotel room, you'd likely only need it the night before surgery. Or not at all, if you'd be willing to leave very early the morning of surgery. You'll have to have a 'pre-surgery' visit to get cleared by the anesthesiology department shortly prior to surgery. This took about 1.5-2 hours. You'll also have to have a 'pre-op' visit with your primary care doc to fill out the paperwork for that. My understanding is hospitals used to admit you a day early for that pre-check stuff, but insurance companies got involved, so no more! A Google for 'Johns Hopkins Accommodations' revealed info on hotel discounts near the hospital. Disclaimer: This was my experience specifically related to JH, not everyone's was the same obviously.

      "Content": "Hi Mj. I admire your 'just get it over with' frame of mind. A Gleason 6 isn't considered an aggressive cancer, so waiting shouldn't cause any physical risks. I was a bit more of the opposite. When I got my Dx back in March '15, I asked my doc how long I could wait?! He said I was at a low risk, but I may want to look inside a 6 month window. I lasted about a month after that appointment before my wife finally got aggravated with me about putting off making the surgery date and finally forced my hand! I still didn't have the surgery until August, but that was nearly 5 months I waited--and everything seems to have turned out well, surgically-wise. Good luck! PS. Can you provide your location?",

      "Content": "Unfortunately, Welcome Tom. Personally, my opinion with G6 cancer is you shouldn't be rushed into a decision, but with 4 cores @ 25%, you're gonna need some type of treatment in your semi-near future. Just tossing this out there, but Johns Hopkins is what, about 90 minutes--or less--from Philly? It may be worth considering for a second look. I can't help with your treatment decision, but I chose surgery at JH and am doing well. Other forum brothers have had similar experiences there. As far as logistics, when I made my appointment with the surgeon for a consultation regarding my treatment options, he told me that it would be about 2 months out for scheduling. In the end it was closer to 3, but I procrastinated until my wife put her foot down, LOL! My doc is sort of 'in demand' too, so that may have mattered. Day of surgery you'll get there to check in (5:15 am, for me!) and they rolled me back about 7:30 or so. I met the doc while I was having my IV inserted and some blood drawn in pre-op. My wife was allowed to stay with me for all this, until I was rolled away. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the young fella rolling me down the hallway to stop neat the elevator so I could make a run for it , I entered the OR and met the doc again as well as the surgical staff----then I woke up in recovery! That was about 3 hours later (my surgery was 'open' rather than robotic, so my understanding is that the procedure is a little faster with an experienced surgeon, thus you're not 'out' as long---everyone's mileage varies!). Then I waited for a room (private room in the new tower at Hopkins. Very peaceful.) I was discharged late the next afternoon/early evening (around 4:00 pm I think). For most, it's a one night hospital stay. You can go home after release, though you'll need a driver. You'll have your 'dancing partner' with you, AKA, the catheter, for about 10 days total. I was given the option of removing it myself (Um, no!) but I'm not too far from the hospital so they can do it! Apparently since many folks come to JH from all over, it's an option for some. Doc said he'd send me home with a syringe for the saline. If you decided on a hotel room, you'd likely only need it the night before surgery. Or not at all, if you'd be willing to leave very early the morning of surgery. You'll have to have a 'pre-surgery' visit to get cleared by the anesthesiology department shortly prior to surgery. This took about 1.5-2 hours. You'll also have to have a 'pre-op' visit with your primary care doc to fill out the paperwork for that. My understanding is hospitals used to admit you a day early for that pre-check stuff, but insurance companies got involved, so no more! A Google for 'Johns Hopkins Accommodations' revealed info on hotel discounts near the hospital. Disclaimer: This was my experience specifically related to JH, not everyone's was the same obviously.

I was a bit more of the opposite. When I got my Dx back in March '15, I asked my doc how long I could wait?! He said I was at a low risk, but I may want to look inside a 6 month window. I lasted about a month after that appointment before my wife finally got aggravated with me about putting off making the surgery date and finally forced my hand! I still didn't have the surgery until August, but that was nearly 5 months I waited--and everything seems to have turned out well, surgically-wise. Good luck! PS. Can you provide your location?",

Prostate volume calculated in DynaCAD Prostate Boundary 45 mL\"--and the doc said mine was a bit enlarged! And of course, just your enlarged prostate will cause your PSA to rise. You can check my sig line to see my numbers, and how things eventually turned out... And you're right about not really knowing how to proceed until you get the results. No point in worrying too much, though we tend to do. You may want to ask your Uro about the PSA3 test and the PSI test, also. Assuming you haven't already. Good luck.

      "Content": "Hi Mj. I admire your 'just get it over with' frame of mind. A Gleason 6 isn't considered an aggressive cancer, so waiting shouldn't cause any physical risks. I was a bit more of the opposite. When I got my Dx back in March '15, I asked my doc how long I could wait?! He said I was at a low risk, but I may want to look inside a 6 month window. I lasted about a month after that appointment before my wife finally got aggravated with me about putting off making the surgery date and finally forced my hand! I still didn't have the surgery until August, but that was nearly 5 months I waited--and everything seems to have turned out well, surgically-wise. Good luck! PS. Can you provide your location?",

      "Content": "SC, from what I've read, PC has been determined to be as much 'sporadic' as it is 'genetic.' Frankly, lots of guys are going to get it, no matter their family history. You just seem to have 'lucked out' like I did. A '1st degree' relative with PC, which your 2nd cousin wasn't on the degree scale, may make one more likely to develop it, but there are boatloads of instances where it didn't make any difference. In my case, my '1st degree' relatives would be my father (nothing yet!), grandfather (died of other issues, so who knows?), a great-grandfather (he had it in the 1960s, but died of other causes), and a brother that died @23 that we'll never know of. To my knowledge we are the only two in the entire family of men to have it! Roughly 18 men sons, grandsons and great-grandson of my grandfather and his siblings. 5 or 6 of them have already passed...only two from cancer...one of those were at my level in the family tree. Kind of speaks volumes right there regarding the sporadic nature of this disease, doesn't it? On a side note, my doc mentioned a possible connection between the PC and Breast Cancer genes. I have to worry here for my daughter, as I've had PC, and my wife's mother passed from BC. Glad you're doing well, Ron",

      "Content": "I attended a \"Prostate Surgery Pre-Surgical Workshop\" today that was actually their inaugural session. It seems they are planning to do these once a month for soon-to-be surgery patients at the hospital. I encourage anyone scheduling surgery at JH to go, and my understanding is that they are matching the upcoming surgeries with patients in order to invite patients to attend. Good slide show and a good question/answer session afterwards with a Urology Nurse Practitioner. It's also interesting to discuss our various situations among ourselves. As the build-up of anxiety until surgery starts, with no professionals to talk to, it was nice to get a chance to ask things that were on all of our minds. We went from pre-procedure, what to bring at admittance, catheter care/handling, incontinence, as well as ED issues--even penis shortening, LOL!. I hope more facilities will implement this type of program. Ron",

As far as post-surgical radiation, I would think that discussion (at least formally) would wait until after your surgery and your surgical pathology are completed (though your doc may certainly mention the possibility for the future). As far as 'type' of surgery, don't fret the method so much as having an experienced doc. I had 'open' and did just fine.

Prostate volume calculated in DynaCAD Prostate Boundary 45 mL\"--and the doc said mine was a bit enlarged! And of course, just your enlarged prostate will cause your PSA to rise. You can check my sig line to see my numbers, and how things eventually turned out... And you're right about not really knowing how to proceed until you get the results. No point in worrying too much, though we tend to do. You may want to ask your Uro about the PSA3 test and the PSI test, also. Assuming you haven't already. Good luck.

The 'upgrade' to a G7 is fairly common, and another case of 'you really don't know what you've got until it's under the 'scope' but better a 3/4 than a 4/3. I believe the radiation to be a preventative measure when the margins are positive. Don't get too worried over this as the radiation is a means to ensure that no cancer cells escaped.

      "Content": "\"...it may have always been there.\" Unfortunately, so goes biopsies all too often. And your case just shows once again that we really don't know what we have until it's out and under the 'scope. My understanding is that your Gleason is born with what you have. So, if that's the case a G6 doesn't 'jump' to a G7 or higher, but had already been 'born' and was just waiting to be discovered. Sorry about that, but you had good news on the -SV/-LN. I can't advise on your next steps, either, but I can certainly wish you the best! FWIW, my path results were uploaded to my 'patient portal' the day before I spoke to my doc. I didn't look at them before I spoke to him, as I didn't want to misinterpret anything and get too worked up over it. Not sure if you have signed up for that at JH, but if you have, the results may already, or soon will be, uploaded. Good luck to you. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi Steve. My stepfather was G8 and all I can tell you for sure is that it had 'escaped' after post surgery pathology and it was all through his spine when he died. I don't know much more because he didn't get great treatment in a somewhat rural area and he didn't know much about the disease himself. He battled it for about 6 years, going through all the standard treatments, from surgery to radiation to hormone treatment. I was told that the cancer has spread to my lymph nodes which is what's causing the swelling. Just curious, and maybe I missed it in a previous post, but what is this statement based on? Have you had imaging done, or is this a diagnosis based on something else? Best wishes, Ron",

      "Content": "Fred, my initial biopsy was negative. My PCA was 38, which I believed my then-uro stated meant a 57%-77% chance cancer would be found on biopsy--yet it wasn't. When I went to Hopkins, the doctor ordered another blood test, including the \"PHI\" test. My PSA at that visit was 5.8, my Free PSA was 17.4%, which indicates \"only\" a 20% probability of cancer, and my PHI was 28.4, which indicates the following, from my \"patient portal\": In men with total PSA concentrations between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a non-suspicious digital rectal examination, phi may be used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign conditions. phi Score Probability of Cancer 0-26.9 9.8% 27.0-35.9 16.8% 36.0-54.9 33.3% >54.9 50.1% The clinical utility of phi for total PSA concentrations outside the 4-10 ng/mL range has not been firmly established. For interpretation or questions, consult the following reference: Catalona WL, Partin AW, et al J Urol 2011;185:1650-5. UROLOGY So,while the \"numbers\" were working in my favor, relatively speaking, it took the 3T MRI to find the \"suspicious/indeterminate\" area which later was found to be \"SMALL FOCUS OF PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.\" So, my recommendation? Push for the MRI. Especially the 3T if available. It's painless (though a bit noisy in there!) and the doc can use the images for a \"fusion\" biopsy if needed.",

The 'upgrade' to a G7 is fairly common, and another case of 'you really don't know what you've got until it's under the 'scope' but better a 3/4 than a 4/3. I believe the radiation to be a preventative measure when the margins are positive. Don't get too worried over this as the radiation is a means to ensure that no cancer cells escaped. This JH article may shed some light: http://urology.jhu.edu/newsletter/pr..._cancer410.php And congrats on the <.01! That's always good news!!!",

      "Content": "You've already gotten good advice, PCW, but I don't see anything to be alarmed about in your post (though how your husband escaped is interesting. My wife had to wheel me in a wheelchair to the garage before I could escape!) *Retesting PSA--I've seen guys here get it done at 6 weeks. My doc told me 2-3 months. I'm going to stretch it closer to 3. *Staples--Can you clarify that this was 'robotic' vs. 'open' surgery via the lower abdomen, as I had? I wasn't aware of staples with robotic, but not sure. However, my staples were scheduled to be removed at catheter removal 9 days post-op, but I had an infection or inflammation at my incision site. A nurse was removing my catheter when she noticed this. I wasn't sure what was going on, other than the area was very red and a bit tender to the touch. My surgeon happened to be on the floor, so he took a look, prescribed me a hefty antibiotic to take for a couple of days, and then come back for the staples. He told me at the time that the inflammation may be a reaction of my skin with the metal staples. When I went back, they were removed. A bit tender when the nurse was pressing down on the inflamed skin to clip the staples, but they had to come out. She applied steri-strips to the incision. I probably didn't really need them, as I was healing nicely, but what the heck. They start falling off after a few days, and it's OK. 2 weeks seems a bit longer than most for an uneventful surgery, but it's not unheard of. *Blood in urine is normal and should clear up. Mine was a gross greenish-yellow at times, too, early on. I was told this was the anesthesia remnants clearing out. Blood at tip is normal, too, especially when straining. I had to re-tape my catheter tubing to my leg after a shower. I actually took a pic of the location where it was beforehand--just in case! I felt that supporting the tube as I sat on the toilet helped to keep it from 'pulling' too much. *Meds--I think I took oxys for a day or two when I got home, and then it was just ibuprofen when needed after that. I didn't have much pain, other than the tenderness and the fact that my bottoms just so happen to rub against the incision site. Due to its location, it's kind of hard to avoid. *Any other tips.....Tell him not to get too close to cabinet knobs when in the bathroom. Ya don't wan't to unexpectedly catch that tube on something! Can you advise as to your location?",

      "Content": "You'll be fine. I found the numbing gel made for a much better 2nd biopsy. I didn't get that during the first. You'll lay on your side, get the gel, then the 'probe' for an initial ultrasound. The doc will do some basics, like measuring your prostate and looking for anything suspicious. Then the numbing needle, followed by the biopsy needles. 12 samples is pretty much standard. You won't really be able to see what the doc's doing (not that you want to!), but you'll hear a 'snap' as the gun shoots off and maybe a little pinch-if that. It won't take long at all. Afterwards, I was told to sit in a small area until I could urinate in a cup. I believe they were checking for clots and anything unusual. You'll have some blood-tinged urine for a few days and likely some dried blood and small clots, as well as, frankly, gross semen! Think tar! But it'll go away soon enough. I found that the more you have a reason to ejaculate, the faster it clears up (don't judge me! ). You'll be fine to drive yourself since only a local is used. I had no pain afterwards. Heck, I hardly even had any blood from the tush--both times! Your doc seemed like a bit of a downer, but I'm sure he was just wishing he could've ruled out PC completely and no biopsy would be necessary. Even HE doesn't know what's going on at this point. P.S., I'm a believer in having a 3T MRI prior to biopsy if possible. It can help identify 'suspicious' areas and allow for a MRI-guided 'fusion biopsy.' Not all docs are onboard with this protocol as of yet though. P.S.S., When buying products like Fleet enemas, do what I do when I have to buy feminine products.....First, use a grocery store and not a local drug store. Be sure to buy lots of unnecessary things to mask what you have, and use SELF CHECKOUT!!! P.S.S.S., Can you advise if you have a family history of PC (you're on the young side for this), and your location?",

      "Content": "Prato, you just pop in every so often with your PSA conundrums to make my head clog up, don't you?! As you know, other than your PNI, our final numbers are very similar. When I had my last (first with my primary care doc) PSA with the whole '0.00' thing, rather than the regular test method that I was used to, I wasn't sure I liked it. As we are both considered 'low risk' (mostly) cases, have you considered asking for, if possible, or seeking out if not, a standard PSA test this time (I have thought about it for my next test)? Did your doc want the uPSA for some reason? I wonder if, on the standard test, you'd get that <.1 number back and eliminate some of your worries (and mine, lol!). If I remember correctly after my surgery, you told me your doc said there's something like a less than 5% chance of a return in your case. Hard to believe you'd fall into that '5%' with your path report. Especially this soon out from surgery. Good luck on Friday. Here's hoing you need to buy some Imodium AD afterwards! Ron",

      "Content": "LOL, Davis! I think we've all heard these stories and it did come up at the workshop that I just attended at Hopkins as someone asked the question that he felt was the \"elephant in the room\" so to speak. The nurse practitioner (specialized in urology) said basically that it doesn't really happen often enough to worry about it and if it does, it isn't really noticeable. It was funny watching my wife's facial reaction when the question was asked though! As the guy asked the question, and the woman was answering it, I just thought to myself: \"What other options do we have?\" Maybe a couple of millimeters knocked off the 'little guy' or metastasized cancer in our bodies?",

      "Content": "Welcome, Rob. Sorry you have to be here. My opinion only, but I'm not sure the data available that I've looked at regarding SBRT pertains very well to a man of your young age for the long term. I just haven't found too many young guys being recommended for it, by either surgeons or Rad Oncs. I'd ask about your options at that point if a recurrence happens should you seek that treatment option out. If you have surgery, I wouldn't fret the method so much as the doc's experience. I had 'open' and I'm fine over a year and a half later. No large blood loss or anything weird. I didn't even have the 'gas' issues some guys have since I didn't have to be 'inflated' lol! I was just shy of 52 at the time. My erection issues aren't perfect, but I can do the deed. Pills help if needed. And you're younger than me, so probably even better. Did you talk with the doc about sparing nerves? I drip occasionally when I do something stressful, but I'm mostly OK. But as my wife said, \"I'd rather have you with a dribble than not have you at all.\" Unfortunately, quite a few guys get upgraded from those Gleason 6 scores to something higher (as was I with low numbers on everything pre-surgery). I hope that's not the case with you, but it's an unknown until the pathologist looks at it once it's out. Radiation doesn't afford that, nor does it give you the backup plan that surgery does in case it comes back a few years later. One last thing. Be thankful your doc was on the ball and did the DRE and found something suspicious. Those aren't perfect, but many docs don't perform them on younger guys. Did you have a family history of some kind that required a closer look, or was it just your doc's protocol? Best wishes. Ron",

      "Content": "Of course. Still a top rated urological facility. Mine was with Dr. Herbert Ballentine Carter (Call me 'Bal'), director of adult urology with close to 4000 RPs under his belt, just this August 10. He does open via the lower abdomen, and I'm A-OK! Still a bit 'dribbly' but no complications. And I think I'm going to make it through the ED phase OK. dshinnick (Dave), another forum poster, had Allaf as his surgeon and appears to be doing fine, and Allaf recommended Carter if he preferred the 'open' route. For the most part, I don't think you'd go wrong with any. Dr. Carter had the first available appointment, so I took it. My urologist at the time was suggesting a saturation biopsy after the first one didn't find anything, but Carter sent me for the 3T before another one. I give kudos for that! Come on down, Steve. I'll buy you a crab cake....LOL!",

      "Content": "Yes. Many here have had it. Once I switched to Johns Hopkins it was the first thing the new doc recommended (well that and sticking a Q-tip up my tush, LOL!). The doc I was seeing before the switch (and who performed my first negative biopsy) wanted to proceed with a saturation biopsy as the next step. That's when I decided that there had to be a better way! The 3T found an undetermined 'suspicious' lesion that was targeted during the subsequent fusion biopsy. The MRI can't diagnose cancer, so you'll still need the biopsy, but I felt better knowing the doc wasn't 'shooting blind' during the second one. Only surprise I had was that in addition to the 'targeted' area, they still take the normal 12 samples too. Thus, my second biopsy was 14 needles. Another benefit to the 3T, IMO, is that it gave us a good indication that my lymph nodes and seminal vesicles looked normal, as well as that there didn't appear to be any prostate capsule escape (extraprostatic extension). That gave me at least some relief going into this. Ron",

I didn't have the scan you mentioned prior to catheter removal, but if it helps you relax any, they put the catheter in after they knock you out for surgery. So, at least you don't know to be embarrassed! My wife was like \"really? Have you ever had a OBGYN exam?\" Well, of course not, silly! I had, however, gone through a (wasted as it turned out) vasectomy about a year before my surgery, and the two cute assisting nurses didn't exactly help on the embarrassment front! Neither did it help when the young cutie pulled my catheter afterwards, but remember; a urologic nurse has seen a thousand of those things! Ron",

My very experienced surgeon didn't take one of the most popular providers in the country (Carefirst BC/BS), which amazed me. If out of network, you may have a co-insurance penalty to pay, but there are also usually out of pocket maximums per year. I (meaning my wife, lol) decided it was worth going out of network in my case. Good luck with your surgery! Ron",

      "Content": "...should i still request the 3T MRI? I don't see how the MRI could hurt. I still have a hard time believing you have PC at your age, but it does happen. The 3T can locate a lesion, which may/may not be cancerous, and also provide a glimpse of your SVs and LNs, as well as the prostate capsule itself. And as Michael said, those images can then be used to perform a 'fusion biopsy' if there's anything suspicious. Because of your PSA level, you may very well end up having a biopsy anyways. Limiting the number of biopsies you have is always a good thing, and the MRI guided route is certainly preferable, as blind biopsies often miss the target. And who wants to go through with that again?! Good Luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi Flags and welcome. A bit off topic to start, but my step-father was Vietnam era navy, mainly carriers, as an 'Aviation Electrician's Mate.' Retired as a an E-6 in '77 after doing 20 years. He says that he, too, had Agent Orange exposure, though being considered 'blue water' navy, it would've been a fight to get benefits and he didn't pursue them. No family history, so who knows if the AO was a contributor. Unfortunately, he could've received better care, both in his home state of Maryland, and after relocating to North Carolina. He was diagnosed at age 70 with PC and underwent surgery. At pathology, he was Gleason 8 and it was outside the capsule. He fought a tough 6 year battle with every available treatment, with many ups and downs, but he finally lost the battle just over a year ago at 77. I'm glad to see you are staying on top of your situation and wish you well. Hopefully, everything is contained. And who knows? A signalman is a carrier guy too, right? Maybe you guys even crossed paths at some point. And of course, thanks for your service! Ron",

      "Content": "Can't help you with the doc request, I'm sure you'll get several recommendations. Just wanted to say give a big welcome our club, which unfortunately no one wants to be a member of. Which part of Missouri? Sometimes it worth going out of state for treatment, especially if you're close to the state line. You can place that in your profile if you'd like. 46 is indeed on the young side, but as we all know, it happens. Do you have a family history of PCa? I ask because most screenings don't tend to begin until 50 (not wise, IMHO) unless there's a higher risk or some type of symptoms. If you are able to get your report, I'd recommend you update your signature with the results. That way we don't have to keep bugging you about stuff! Your doc's point makes perfect sense. I'd say this site tends to lean towards surgery over other treatments, especially in younger guys, so if that's the route you're set to take, you'll get plenty of support and advice here.

      "Content": "Hi jks. As already noted by Southsider's and MM's posts, you're awfully young to have PCa. I'd also believe another cause is elevating your PSA, such as an infection. By any chance soon before your PSA tests, did you do any activities that could elevate your PSA numbers? For instance, have sex within a couple days before the tests? Ride a bike for an extended time? These are thought to artificially inflate your PSA and it's normally recommended that one refrain from such activities before the test. How about the DRE? Was it performed before or after (hopefully) your blood draw? That, or any other stimulus to your prostate gland could give an artificial reading. What was your initial PSA number from your first doctor? That said, a MRI is painless though with your PSA of 2.5, even in the unlikely event you did have PCa, it's possible the tumor would be too small to show up. I give your doc some credit though. At least he's suggesting a MRI before trying to line you up for a biopsy. Most men don't get that offer first! Where are you located? You can include that info in your profile. God luck. Ron",

I'd never had a DRE before seeing my first urologist and I remember when he eventually mentioned he was going to have me submit to a PSA, and later a PCA3 test, probably because of a similar protocol, told me when I came back in for that to be sure that 1) I didn't urinate before the test--standard to check for infections I guess, and 2) inform the tech that I needed a blood draw before I saw him. However, my regular doc never gave me a DRE. He just did a regular blood draw and included the PSA because I'd just turned 50. When he referred me to a uro, I was drawn before the exam.",

Giving you half the story isn't helpful to YOU! Besides, when you first posted didn't you mention that after the biopsy your doctor was already talking about radiation after surgery? And he didn't even have a pathology report then, so it sounds like, based on what you're telling us, that the doctor already had his mind made up regarding radiation. I don't remember anything from your original post regarding the biopsy results that would suggest that course of treatment--at least in the USA. Hopefully 'Dr. Busy' will come around with more information as well as a written pathology report, but let's hope your meeting with the Radiation Oncologist will answer your questions.",

Your doc likely has your best interests in mind with those 4+3s looking at you in both lobes, so it may be wise to talk to him about any concerns regarding waiting if you haven't already. After my biopsy, my doc said there was no immediate rush, but I'd probably be wise to schedule surgery within 6 months. But, I was looking at G6 at the time. Best of luck.... P.S., it's probably a good idea to talk with your son at some point about this. He's going to want to keep up with his own screenings in the future.",

      "Content": "Hi jks. As already noted by Southsider's and MM's posts, you're awfully young to have PCa. I'd also believe another cause is elevating your PSA, such as an infection. By any chance soon before your PSA tests, did you do any activities that could elevate your PSA numbers? For instance, have sex within a couple days before the tests? Ride a bike for an extended time? These are thought to artificially inflate your PSA and it's normally recommended that one refrain from such activities before the test. How about the DRE? Was it performed before or after (hopefully) your blood draw? That, or any other stimulus to your prostate gland could give an artificial reading. What was your initial PSA number from your first doctor? That said, a MRI is painless though with your PSA of 2.5, even in the unlikely event you did have PCa, it's possible the tumor would be too small to show up. I give your doc some credit though. At least he's suggesting a MRI before trying to line you up for a biopsy. Most men don't get that offer first! Where are you located? You can include that info in your profile. God luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Doing the DRE *after* the blood draw would force a change in protocol. LOL. Well, we can't have that can we?! I'd never had a DRE before seeing my first urologist and I remember when he eventually mentioned he was going to have me submit to a PSA, and later a PCA3 test, probably because of a similar protocol, told me when I came back in for that to be sure that 1) I didn't urinate before the test--standard to check for infections I guess, and 2) inform the tech that I needed a blood draw before I saw him. However, my regular doc never gave me a DRE. He just did a regular blood draw and included the PSA because I'd just turned 50. When he referred me to a uro, I was drawn before the exam.",

      "Content": "Hi Jeremy. Sounds very much like when I tore my rotator cuff 5 years ago. It can happen over time with normal wear and tear, especially if your occupation caused lots of demand on the joint, or it could happen suddenly--like being a big dummy and slipping and falling while shoveling snow (guess who?!). I began getting these shooting pains down the outside of my arm, from about the shoulder to the elbow, after certain movements. Later, it became difficult to raise my coffee mug--that's when it got serious! An x-ray did me no good, but I was eventually sent for a MRI which showed the tear. You may want to consider seeing an orthopedist. You may just need physical therapy to loosen things up again. Good luck, Ron",

As that whole 'bilateral' issue kept me out of AS, I'd have to assume there are concerns with that. IMO, with all of those positive cores, you're going to need treatment. I agree with your uro, but the question is which treatment is best for you at 63? Active Surveillance is out, and if you're thinking RP or radiation, will that 2nd opinion change anything?

      "Content": "Man, Wayne. That's a tough one. Any way you could go to the doc without your wife?! I'm on the somewhat opposite end of the spectrum--I'm procrastinating over surgery, and my wife is pestering the crap out of me about scheduling it! Are your 4 cores uni or bi-lateral (on 1 or both sides of the prostate)? Some AS programs take this into consideration. While I'm not a particularly religious man, I've generally held the belief that God helps those that help themselves. I'd say if you're a \"believer\" then those people in the clean white coats, as well as all of that fancy equipment, are a product of God and are here at His will to help us--and you! Kind of like the joke: There was a preacher who fell in the ocean and he couldn't swim. When a boat came by, the captain yelled, \"Do you need help, sir?\" The preacher calmly said \"No, God will save me.\" A little later, another boat came by and a fisherman asked, \"Hey, do you need help?\" The preacher replied again, \"No God will save me.\" Eventually the preacher drowned & went to heaven. The preacher asked God, \"Why didn't you save me?\" God replied, \"Fool, I sent you two boats!\" I'm not going to criticize another guy's wife, but her line of thinking, frankly, astounds me. I just watched my stepfather die of this disease after a 6 year battle. It wasn't pretty. I had an aunt with breast cancer that refused most medical treatment and relied on\"holistic\" methods. She didn't make it past 49 years old. Personally, I think you have to get some kind of treatment, whether surgery or radiation. Also personally, I don't think that I can live comfortably knowing it's still inside of me, so I'm likely going the surgery route. Good luck, man.",

It might be more accurate to credit my wife's persistence, lol. Boy, what a PITA! But.....she knows I procrastinate. It was at her insistence that I departed my local uro group and headed up to JH. \"We're 25 minutes away!\" she said. Tough love.... Dr. Carter mentioned having the MRI/fusion. I was just starting to read about it -- on this forum -- before seeing him. Previous uro was looking at a saturation biopsy. Prato: Thanks. Sorry about your current PSA worries, but I remember after my post on my pathology how you were one of the first on here reassuring me. Djin: Thanks. I know I haven't had the toughest case by any stretch, but this whole thing caught me off-guard. I had almost forgotten it was my 'anniversary' as I guess my wife had. I mentioned it this morning and she cried. Just like she did when Dr. Carter explained to us my path report was a good one. I don't want her to be upset, but after being together for about 25 years, it's a bit reassuring in some aspects. I'll be 55 in a couple of weeks, but it's still good to be on this side of the grass.",

Normally, the exam is to determine if any lumps can be felt on your prostate, but since it's not there......? Maybe the docs still do the rectal exam after removal, but I wasn't aware of that. Well, that's just GREAT!!! Hence Ray's question. Good luck to you!",

      "Content": "Fred, my initial biopsy was negative. My PCA was 38, which I believed my then-uro stated meant a 57%-77% chance cancer would be found on biopsy--yet it wasn't. When I went to Hopkins, the doctor ordered another blood test, including the \"PHI\" test. My PSA at that visit was 5.8, my Free PSA was 17.4%, which indicates \"only\" a 20% probability of cancer, and my PHI was 28.4, which indicates the following, from my \"patient portal\": In men with total PSA concentrations between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a non-suspicious digital rectal examination, phi may be used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign conditions. phi Score Probability of Cancer 0-26.9 9.8% 27.0-35.9 16.8% 36.0-54.9 33.3% >54.9 50.1% The clinical utility of phi for total PSA concentrations outside the 4-10 ng/mL range has not been firmly established. For interpretation or questions, consult the following reference: Catalona WL, Partin AW, et al J Urol 2011;185:1650-5. UROLOGY So,while the \"numbers\" were working in my favor, relatively speaking, it took the 3T MRI to find the \"suspicious/indeterminate\" area which later was found to be \"SMALL FOCUS OF PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.\" So, my recommendation? Push for the MRI. Especially the 3T if available. It's painless (though a bit noisy in there!) and the doc can use the images for a \"fusion\" biopsy if needed.",

      "Content": "Welcome Geezer--unfortunately you're inquiring with us. I believe the 'DCE' refers to using contrast (Dynamic contrast-enhancement) with the MRI. Did you mean 'extraprostatic extension?' If so, unfortunately, that means evidence was seen on the images that the tumor is beyond the confines of the gland into the surrounding tissue (periprostatic tissue). Please don't freak yourself out though!!! Let's get the biopsy over with and then you and your docs can decide on a plan of action. The only definitive way for a diagnoses of cancer is a biopsy. You don't have that yet, you merely have unidentified 'lesions' at this point. Additionally, can you provide your location? Maybe put it in your profile? Good luck to you, sir! Ron",

      "Content": "Lil, just to clarify, did you actually receive a bill for $2500 from the doc, or was that charge submitted to BCBC and they denied it for some reason or other, like an 'incidental' charge and you see it on your Explanation of Benefits (EOB)? I think that code refers to robotic assisted surgery, but it's considered incidental to the surgery charge, as in 'the doc is getting paid for surgery, how he does it is up to him.' Found this: Robotic Surgical Systems: Surgical techniques requiring use of robotics surgical system (S2900) will be considered incidental to surgical services. Payment for new technology is based on the outcome of the treatment rather than the \u201ctechnology\u201d involved in the procedure. Separate reimbursement is not allowed for the robotic surgical technique. I remember my doc bill, anesthesia bill, and basic hospital charges/room bill were separate, but there was no charge for any second surgeon.",

With those cores and G7, you're likely looking at treatment sooner, rather than later. Best wishes, Ron",

      "Content": "Yes. Many here have had it. Once I switched to Johns Hopkins it was the first thing the new doc recommended (well that and sticking a Q-tip up my tush, LOL!). The doc I was seeing before the switch (and who performed my first negative biopsy) wanted to proceed with a saturation biopsy as the next step. That's when I decided that there had to be a better way! The 3T found an undetermined 'suspicious' lesion that was targeted during the subsequent fusion biopsy. The MRI can't diagnose cancer, so you'll still need the biopsy, but I felt better knowing the doc wasn't 'shooting blind' during the second one. Only surprise I had was that in addition to the 'targeted' area, they still take the normal 12 samples too. Thus, my second biopsy was 14 needles. Another benefit to the 3T, IMO, is that it gave us a good indication that my lymph nodes and seminal vesicles looked normal, as well as that there didn't appear to be any prostate capsule escape (extraprostatic extension). That gave me at least some relief going into this. Ron",

I haven't updated my PSAs to date. I'm not really crazy that, since I went ahead and just decided to let my primary care doc run the test along with my usual blood work every 6 month for the convenience, a different assay is used. The last 2 have been .02, but it's not the standard test that JH was doing. I figure '.02' is still '<.1'. If the one next month is any different I may call Dr. Carter's assistant and ask for a blood draw up there to, hopefully, see my '<' again. Other than that, I feel pretty good. I get an occasional stress squirt, but I blame myself, as well as coffee, and Captain Morgan and his raiding party. On the ED front, it's workable.

      "Content": "Welcome, Rob. Sorry you have to be here. My opinion only, but I'm not sure the data available that I've looked at regarding SBRT pertains very well to a man of your young age for the long term. I just haven't found too many young guys being recommended for it, by either surgeons or Rad Oncs. I'd ask about your options at that point if a recurrence happens should you seek that treatment option out. If you have surgery, I wouldn't fret the method so much as the doc's experience. I had 'open' and I'm fine over a year and a half later. No large blood loss or anything weird. I didn't even have the 'gas' issues some guys have since I didn't have to be 'inflated' lol! I was just shy of 52 at the time. My erection issues aren't perfect, but I can do the deed. Pills help if needed. And you're younger than me, so probably even better. Did you talk with the doc about sparing nerves? I drip occasionally when I do something stressful, but I'm mostly OK. But as my wife said, \"I'd rather have you with a dribble than not have you at all.\" Unfortunately, quite a few guys get upgraded from those Gleason 6 scores to something higher (as was I with low numbers on everything pre-surgery). I hope that's not the case with you, but it's an unknown until the pathologist looks at it once it's out. Radiation doesn't afford that, nor does it give you the backup plan that surgery does in case it comes back a few years later. One last thing. Be thankful your doc was on the ball and did the DRE and found something suspicious. Those aren't perfect, but many docs don't perform them on younger guys. Did you have a family history of some kind that required a closer look, or was it just your doc's protocol? Best wishes. Ron",

      "Content": "Fred, my initial biopsy was negative. My PCA was 38, which I believed my then-uro stated meant a 57%-77% chance cancer would be found on biopsy--yet it wasn't. When I went to Hopkins, the doctor ordered another blood test, including the \"PHI\" test. My PSA at that visit was 5.8, my Free PSA was 17.4%, which indicates \"only\" a 20% probability of cancer, and my PHI was 28.4, which indicates the following, from my \"patient portal\": In men with total PSA concentrations between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a non-suspicious digital rectal examination, phi may be used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign conditions. phi Score Probability of Cancer 0-26.9 9.8% 27.0-35.9 16.8% 36.0-54.9 33.3% >54.9 50.1% The clinical utility of phi for total PSA concentrations outside the 4-10 ng/mL range has not been firmly established. For interpretation or questions, consult the following reference: Catalona WL, Partin AW, et al J Urol 2011;185:1650-5. UROLOGY So,while the \"numbers\" were working in my favor, relatively speaking, it took the 3T MRI to find the \"suspicious/indeterminate\" area which later was found to be \"SMALL FOCUS OF PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.\" So, my recommendation? Push for the MRI. Especially the 3T if available. It's painless (though a bit noisy in there!) and the doc can use the images for a \"fusion\" biopsy if needed.",

      "Content": "Fred, my initial biopsy was negative. My PCA was 38, which I believed my then-uro stated meant a 57%-77% chance cancer would be found on biopsy--yet it wasn't. When I went to Hopkins, the doctor ordered another blood test, including the \"PHI\" test. My PSA at that visit was 5.8, my Free PSA was 17.4%, which indicates \"only\" a 20% probability of cancer, and my PHI was 28.4, which indicates the following, from my \"patient portal\": In men with total PSA concentrations between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/mL and a non-suspicious digital rectal examination, phi may be used as an aid in distinguishing prostate cancer from benign conditions. phi Score Probability of Cancer 0-26.9 9.8% 27.0-35.9 16.8% 36.0-54.9 33.3% >54.9 50.1% The clinical utility of phi for total PSA concentrations outside the 4-10 ng/mL range has not been firmly established. For interpretation or questions, consult the following reference: Catalona WL, Partin AW, et al J Urol 2011;185:1650-5. UROLOGY So,while the \"numbers\" were working in my favor, relatively speaking, it took the 3T MRI to find the \"suspicious/indeterminate\" area which later was found to be \"SMALL FOCUS OF PROSTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA.\" So, my recommendation? Push for the MRI. Especially the 3T if available. It's painless (though a bit noisy in there!) and the doc can use the images for a \"fusion\" biopsy if needed.",

      "Content": "You've already gotten good advice, PCW, but I don't see anything to be alarmed about in your post (though how your husband escaped is interesting. My wife had to wheel me in a wheelchair to the garage before I could escape!) *Retesting PSA--I've seen guys here get it done at 6 weeks. My doc told me 2-3 months. I'm going to stretch it closer to 3. *Staples--Can you clarify that this was 'robotic' vs. 'open' surgery via the lower abdomen, as I had? I wasn't aware of staples with robotic, but not sure. However, my staples were scheduled to be removed at catheter removal 9 days post-op, but I had an infection or inflammation at my incision site. A nurse was removing my catheter when she noticed this. I wasn't sure what was going on, other than the area was very red and a bit tender to the touch. My surgeon happened to be on the floor, so he took a look, prescribed me a hefty antibiotic to take for a couple of days, and then come back for the staples. He told me at the time that the inflammation may be a reaction of my skin with the metal staples. When I went back, they were removed. A bit tender when the nurse was pressing down on the inflamed skin to clip the staples, but they had to come out. She applied steri-strips to the incision. I probably didn't really need them, as I was healing nicely, but what the heck. They start falling off after a few days, and it's OK. 2 weeks seems a bit longer than most for an uneventful surgery, but it's not unheard of. *Blood in urine is normal and should clear up. Mine was a gross greenish-yellow at times, too, early on. I was told this was the anesthesia remnants clearing out. Blood at tip is normal, too, especially when straining. I had to re-tape my catheter tubing to my leg after a shower. I actually took a pic of the location where it was beforehand--just in case! I felt that supporting the tube as I sat on the toilet helped to keep it from 'pulling' too much. *Meds--I think I took oxys for a day or two when I got home, and then it was just ibuprofen when needed after that. I didn't have much pain, other than the tenderness and the fact that my bottoms just so happen to rub against the incision site. Due to its location, it's kind of hard to avoid. *Any other tips.....Tell him not to get too close to cabinet knobs when in the bathroom. Ya don't wan't to unexpectedly catch that tube on something! Can you advise as to your location?",

I think that code refers to robotic assisted surgery, but it's considered incidental to the surgery charge, as in 'the doc is getting paid for surgery, how he does it is up to him.' Found this: Robotic Surgical Systems: Surgical techniques requiring use of robotics surgical system (S2900) will be considered incidental to surgical services. Payment for new technology is based on the outcome of the treatment rather than the \u201ctechnology\u201d involved in the procedure. Separate reimbursement is not allowed for the robotic surgical technique. I remember my doc bill, anesthesia bill, and basic hospital charges/room bill were separate, but there was no charge for any second surgeon.",

When I had my last (first with my primary care doc) PSA with the whole '0.00' thing, rather than the regular test method that I was used to, I wasn't sure I liked it. As we are both considered 'low risk' (mostly) cases, have you considered asking for, if possible, or seeking out if not, a standard PSA test this time (I have thought about it for my next test)? Did your doc want the uPSA for some reason? I wonder if, on the standard test, you'd get that <.1 number back and eliminate some of your worries (and mine, lol!). If I remember correctly after my surgery, you told me your doc said there's something like a less than 5% chance of a return in your case. Hard to believe you'd fall into that '5%' with your path report. Especially this soon out from surgery. Good luck on Friday. Here's hoing you need to buy some Imodium AD afterwards! Ron",

      "Content": "Hi, gppr100rs. I had similar thoughts as you regarding the 24 core \"saturation\" biopsy. After my initial 12 core TRUS didn't find anything I was hopeful, but as my PSA scores were still high, I knew _something_ had to be going on. My Urologist then recommended the \"saturation\" biopsy. I kept putting it off because, frankly, I didn't want to do it! I wasn't crazy about the aftermath (bloody urine/semen) of the TRUS, so I certainly didn't think that 24 needles was going to be somehow better! And I had the same concerns also: This is shooting blindly and hoping to hit something. What if this missed, too? What next--a 48 needle biopsy??? Ouch!!! That's when I decided to get a different perspective and go see a Hopkins doctor. The first thing he told me regarding a saturation biopsy was \"I wouldn't do that.\" I thought--whew!!! I proceeded to get a recommended MRI, which showed a \"suspicious area.\" I followed that up with a MRI-guided fusion biopsy, which found the cancer. While I'm not at all happy anything was found, I'm happy it was found this time, and without 24--or more-- needles! I guess I was naive as I thought the second biopsy would only take samples from the suspicious are, but nope! It took samples from that area in addition to the standard 12 core standard TRUS biopsy, so 14 cores this time. Personally, I'd go the \"fusion\" route. Good luck.",

My very experienced surgeon didn't take one of the most popular providers in the country (Carefirst BC/BS), which amazed me. If out of network, you may have a co-insurance penalty to pay, but there are also usually out of pocket maximums per year. I (meaning my wife, lol) decided it was worth going out of network in my case. Good luck with your surgery! Ron",

Mine was with Dr. Herbert Ballentine Carter (Call me 'Bal'), director of adult urology with close to 4000 RPs under his belt, just this August 10. He does open via the lower abdomen, and I'm A-OK! Still a bit 'dribbly' but no complications. And I think I'm going to make it through the ED phase OK. dshinnick (Dave), another forum poster, had Allaf as his surgeon and appears to be doing fine, and Allaf recommended Carter if he preferred the 'open' route. For the most part, I don't think you'd go wrong with any. Dr. Carter had the first available appointment, so I took it. My urologist at the time was suggesting a saturation biopsy after the first one didn't find anything, but Carter sent me for the 3T before another one. I give kudos for that! Come on down, Steve. I'll buy you a crab cake....LOL!",

      "Content": "Marve, I don't know about the pathology being bad, but maybe if the doctor isn't going to give you ALL of the information that you need, he should just shut up until he isn't so \"busy\" and do so when he can talk to you freely! Giving you half the story isn't helpful to YOU! Besides, when you first posted didn't you mention that after the biopsy your doctor was already talking about radiation after surgery? And he didn't even have a pathology report then, so it sounds like, based on what you're telling us, that the doctor already had his mind made up regarding radiation. I don't remember anything from your original post regarding the biopsy results that would suggest that course of treatment--at least in the USA. Hopefully 'Dr. Busy' will come around with more information as well as a written pathology report, but let's hope your meeting with the Radiation Oncologist will answer your questions.",

      "Content": "Can't help you with the doc request, I'm sure you'll get several recommendations. Just wanted to say give a big welcome our club, which unfortunately no one wants to be a member of. Which part of Missouri? Sometimes it worth going out of state for treatment, especially if you're close to the state line. You can place that in your profile if you'd like. 46 is indeed on the young side, but as we all know, it happens. Do you have a family history of PCa? I ask because most screenings don't tend to begin until 50 (not wise, IMHO) unless there's a higher risk or some type of symptoms. If you are able to get your report, I'd recommend you update your signature with the results. That way we don't have to keep bugging you about stuff! Your doc's point makes perfect sense. I'd say this site tends to lean towards surgery over other treatments, especially in younger guys, so if that's the route you're set to take, you'll get plenty of support and advice here. Best of luck. Ron",

I'd never had a DRE before seeing my first urologist and I remember when he eventually mentioned he was going to have me submit to a PSA, and later a PCA3 test, probably because of a similar protocol, told me when I came back in for that to be sure that 1) I didn't urinate before the test--standard to check for infections I guess, and 2) inform the tech that I needed a blood draw before I saw him. However, my regular doc never gave me a DRE. He just did a regular blood draw and included the PSA because I'd just turned 50. When he referred me to a uro, I was drawn before the exam.",

      "Content": "Hi jks. As already noted by Southsider's and MM's posts, you're awfully young to have PCa. I'd also believe another cause is elevating your PSA, such as an infection. By any chance soon before your PSA tests, did you do any activities that could elevate your PSA numbers? For instance, have sex within a couple days before the tests? Ride a bike for an extended time? These are thought to artificially inflate your PSA and it's normally recommended that one refrain from such activities before the test. How about the DRE? Was it performed before or after (hopefully) your blood draw? That, or any other stimulus to your prostate gland could give an artificial reading. What was your initial PSA number from your first doctor? That said, a MRI is painless though with your PSA of 2.5, even in the unlikely event you did have PCa, it's possible the tumor would be too small to show up. I give your doc some credit though. At least he's suggesting a MRI before trying to line you up for a biopsy. Most men don't get that offer first! Where are you located? You can include that info in your profile. God luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Man, Wayne. That's a tough one. Any way you could go to the doc without your wife?! I'm on the somewhat opposite end of the spectrum--I'm procrastinating over surgery, and my wife is pestering the crap out of me about scheduling it! Are your 4 cores uni or bi-lateral (on 1 or both sides of the prostate)? Some AS programs take this into consideration. While I'm not a particularly religious man, I've generally held the belief that God helps those that help themselves. I'd say if you're a \"believer\" then those people in the clean white coats, as well as all of that fancy equipment, are a product of God and are here at His will to help us--and you! Kind of like the joke: There was a preacher who fell in the ocean and he couldn't swim. When a boat came by, the captain yelled, \"Do you need help, sir?\" The preacher calmly said \"No, God will save me.\" A little later, another boat came by and a fisherman asked, \"Hey, do you need help?\" The preacher replied again, \"No God will save me.\" Eventually the preacher drowned & went to heaven. The preacher asked God, \"Why didn't you save me?\" God replied, \"Fool, I sent you two boats!\" I'm not going to criticize another guy's wife, but her line of thinking, frankly, astounds me. I just watched my stepfather die of this disease after a 6 year battle. It wasn't pretty. I had an aunt with breast cancer that refused most medical treatment and relied on\"holistic\" methods. She didn't make it past 49 years old. Personally, I think you have to get some kind of treatment, whether surgery or radiation. Also personally, I don't think that I can live comfortably knowing it's still inside of me, so I'm likely going the surgery route. Good luck, man.",

Which part of Missouri? Sometimes it worth going out of state for treatment, especially if you're close to the state line. You can place that in your profile if you'd like. 46 is indeed on the young side, but as we all know, it happens. Do you have a family history of PCa? I ask because most screenings don't tend to begin until 50 (not wise, IMHO) unless there's a higher risk or some type of symptoms. If you are able to get your report, I'd recommend you update your signature with the results. That way we don't have to keep bugging you about stuff! Your doc's point makes perfect sense. I'd say this site tends to lean towards surgery over other treatments, especially in younger guys, so if that's the route you're set to take, you'll get plenty of support and advice here. Best of luck. Ron",

      "Content": "Man, Wayne. That's a tough one. Any way you could go to the doc without your wife?! I'm on the somewhat opposite end of the spectrum--I'm procrastinating over surgery, and my wife is pestering the crap out of me about scheduling it! Are your 4 cores uni or bi-lateral (on 1 or both sides of the prostate)? Some AS programs take this into consideration. While I'm not a particularly religious man, I've generally held the belief that God helps those that help themselves. I'd say if you're a \"believer\" then those people in the clean white coats, as well as all of that fancy equipment, are a product of God and are here at His will to help us--and you! Kind of like the joke: There was a preacher who fell in the ocean and he couldn't swim. When a boat came by, the captain yelled, \"Do you need help, sir?\" The preacher calmly said \"No, God will save me.\" A little later, another boat came by and a fisherman asked, \"Hey, do you need help?\" The preacher replied again, \"No God will save me.\" Eventually the preacher drowned & went to heaven. The preacher asked God, \"Why didn't you save me?\" God replied, \"Fool, I sent you two boats!\" I'm not going to criticize another guy's wife, but her line of thinking, frankly, astounds me. I just watched my stepfather die of this disease after a 6 year battle. It wasn't pretty. I had an aunt with breast cancer that refused most medical treatment and relied on\"holistic\" methods. She didn't make it past 49 years old. Personally, I think you have to get some kind of treatment, whether surgery or radiation. Also personally, I don't think that I can live comfortably knowing it's still inside of me, so I'm likely going the surgery route. Good luck, man.",

      "Content": "Question regarding sildenafil--does the prescription have to be written specifically for that drug rather than Viagra? Thinking out loud I guess for when I see my primary care doc in a few weeks. But you're right on regarding the Viagra retail pricing. The first time I bought 2 tablets out of my pocket they were about $45 per. In the meantime I got a letter from BC/BS informing me that Viagra was no longer in the 'preferred' tier (never saw that happen before), thus my co-pay would increase from $10 to $20. Ok..... Well, the second time I made the purchase for 2 out of pocket they were now over $50 per! So, I suspect there was a price increase from the manufacturer causing the pills to lose their 'favorable' rating with my health insurance.",

I had a few left over prior to surgery (if I'd have known what I was about to get into, I would've started stockpiling earlier!), so I could make it an entire month, but eventually the math stopped working and I had to buy 2 extra tablets out of pocket. Well, that's about $100 for 2 freekin' pills in addition to the $20 co-pay for the 6 that are covered (was $10, but that just changed)! The pharmacist suggested considering the 5 mg daily dose of Cialis--which BC/BS appears to cover. I figure I'll mention it to my primary care doc when I see him in early March.",

Did you mean 'extraprostatic extension?' If so, unfortunately, that means evidence was seen on the images that the tumor is beyond the confines of the gland into the surrounding tissue (periprostatic tissue). Please don't freak yourself out though!!! Let's get the biopsy over with and then you and your docs can decide on a plan of action. The only definitive way for a diagnoses of cancer is a biopsy. You don't have that yet, you merely have unidentified 'lesions' at this point. Additionally, can you provide your location? Maybe put it in your profile? Good luck to you, sir! Ron",

      "Content": "Welcome Geezer--unfortunately you're inquiring with us. I believe the 'DCE' refers to using contrast (Dynamic contrast-enhancement) with the MRI. Did you mean 'extraprostatic extension?' If so, unfortunately, that means evidence was seen on the images that the tumor is beyond the confines of the gland into the surrounding tissue (periprostatic tissue). Please don't freak yourself out though!!! Let's get the biopsy over with and then you and your docs can decide on a plan of action. The only definitive way for a diagnoses of cancer is a biopsy. You don't have that yet, you merely have unidentified 'lesions' at this point. Additionally, can you provide your location? Maybe put it in your profile? Good luck to you, sir! Ron",

      "Content": "Interesting. While it's too late for me at this point, now 11 days post-op, I noticed that the article, when referring to Johns Hopkins, doesn't mention that JH's program requires the disease to be 'unilateral.' I thought that I was a 'shoe-in' for AS, especially since I was about to see Dr. Carter, the program's head, but although I was well within all the criteria with low % of only 2 cores.....it was on both sides, thus bilateral. I'm not so sure I'm 'wired' for AS anyways, but I didn't even get to really think about it. A check of their website indicates that the requirement is still in place.",

Deep inside I know that I made the right call, but I can't help but wonder: If I can just hold out, maybe something better will come along......Of course, if we lose that bet, well, we LOSE! I realize that I was fortunate enough to have a fine surgeon available to me. For all that I loath about living in Maryland (politically), I'm certainly fortunate to have JH only 40 minutes away. Heck, I spent the night in the tower named for the UAE Prince that came here for PC treatment! And I have to say...it was a NICE night. No yapping dogs, private room, and on the 11th floor, and not likely to catch a stray round from the Baltimore streets below! Another point about doing AS and being wired for it: We really don't know what we have until it's out and under the 'scope.",

      "Content": "I see some stickies and all, but my head is spinning at times. I _think_ I've made the decision to go ahead and do the open removal surgery @ Hopkins, with a top doc, and then someone gives me the \"are you crazy, check out Cyberknife!\" routine. There are many more of you guys out here on this forum with waaaaaay more experience than I, so can some with a similar decision shine a light on this, and any discussions they've had with their medical professionals regarding this subject and the options? I'll be 52 in August. If I were several years older, I think this would be an easier decision. My worries are that 1) It's still in there, and I realize that the GS is often upgraded, and more PCa is found at pathology, 2) Radiation-related future issues (maybe even cancers? I've heard of bladder and urethral being a possibility), 3) Later treatment options if things go south, 4) Hormone Therapy seems to be a last resort if/after radiation treatment eventually fails, and IDK about that...., and 5!) To top it off, there's a guy telling me that after surgery I'll lose 1-2 inches off of my \"junk!\" What the hell??? Shoot me NOW!!!!! Is it still the *standard\" that a younger patient has the best outcome with removal? This is all starting to suck, and mostly mentally. And I can't help but feel at times that if I could do AS for a year or two, that another solution might appear. Sorry if I rant.....The Captain (Morgan) and I are having a disagreement. LOL!!! Ron",

      "Content": "My doc never mentioned a bone scan and my biopsy was also 2 cores of G6. Having said that though, I had a 3T MRI before the diagnosing biopsy, so not sure what would've been recommended if my PC was found on a standard biopsy w/o a MRI first. My PSA never was quite at your level either, though. As far as the MRI goes, it would seem to be ideal that this would be the test to go with prior to any biopsy, but it seems many/most insurance companies won't cover the expense unless the first blind biopsy is negative. Seems like their logic is reversed to me! My first uro was 'laid off' too. But because he wanted to do a saturation bippsy after my first negative biopsy, where as I wanted the MRI next.",

      "Content": "Otago, when I met Dr. Carter after the fusion biopsy, I really thought I'd be a \"shoe-in\" for AS. The problem is, and I forgot about this, is that one stipulation of the AS program at JH is \"unilateral disease.\" Unfortunately, mine is \"bilateral\" -- found on both sides. Lucky me! Dr. Carter mentioned a few risks of radiation, including those that I have mentioned as well as concerns about my age, but I also know the whole \"of course, he's a surgeon\" spiel, so that's what I expected. He also told me that on a 1-5 scale, I'm at a \"one\" right now (low risk), but I should seek treatment, preferably within 6 months (this was on 4/1). I didn't think to ask, but I believe the \"bilateral\" thing is a concern. And yes, he also told me an uncle wasn't so much a factor, but my great-grandfather is in my direct line.",

She was a non-smoker in a non-smoking household, too. A total shock to all how fast she went. I only mention this because you may want to advise your friend about it so he and his mom keep up on it as well as ask about it. I've read here on this forum that it _does_ happen. We didn't know, and she kind of kept us out of the loop on her treatment. The possibility was apparently never discussed with my in-laws. As far as the PC thing goes, I think about it in passing most days, but I don't dwell on it. Of course, with my 2nd post-op PSA coming up next week, all bets are off!",

      "Content": "Hi Ireland. Welcome! I realize this stuff is scary. I'm glad to see your dad is reading 'The Book.' Don't fret too much that if your dad has the 'open' surgery that he'll fare worse. Dr. Walsh was a big pioneer in helping to perfect (as well as can be expected) that technique--assuming it's 'retropubic'--via the lower abdomen. A robot doesn't make a mediocre surgeon better--experience does. I had 'open' surgery nearly 11 months ago, and I'm doing well. If his scans, etc., are clean and indicate confinement, and he's able to tolerate surgery, I certainly see that as a viable option. Best of luck to you guys! My wife's dad is like, 1 generation removed from 'getting off the boat' Irish. My wife occasionally mentions that she's the only one of her siblings to have _not_ visited the homeland. Maybe we'll do. that sometime. Ron",

      "Content": "I see some stickies and all, but my head is spinning at times. I _think_ I've made the decision to go ahead and do the open removal surgery @ Hopkins, with a top doc, and then someone gives me the \"are you crazy, check out Cyberknife!\" routine. There are many more of you guys out here on this forum with waaaaaay more experience than I, so can some with a similar decision shine a light on this, and any discussions they've had with their medical professionals regarding this subject and the options? I'll be 52 in August. If I were several years older, I think this would be an easier decision. My worries are that 1) It's still in there, and I realize that the GS is often upgraded, and more PCa is found at pathology, 2) Radiation-related future issues (maybe even cancers? I've heard of bladder and urethral being a possibility), 3) Later treatment options if things go south, 4) Hormone Therapy seems to be a last resort if/after radiation treatment eventually fails, and IDK about that...., and 5!) To top it off, there's a guy telling me that after surgery I'll lose 1-2 inches off of my \"junk!\" What the hell??? Shoot me NOW!!!!! Is it still the *standard\" that a younger patient has the best outcome with removal? This is all starting to suck, and mostly mentally. And I can't help but feel at times that if I could do AS for a year or two, that another solution might appear. Sorry if I rant.....The Captain (Morgan) and I are having a disagreement. LOL!!! Ron",

      "Content": "SC, my mother-in-law passed away from breast cancer related issues this past September after her aggressive treatment 3 years ago apparently caused leukemia, which came on fast and strong, and she was getting blood tests for this every 2 months. She was a non-smoker in a non-smoking household, too. A total shock to all how fast she went. I only mention this because you may want to advise your friend about it so he and his mom keep up on it as well as ask about it. I've read here on this forum that it _does_ happen. We didn't know, and she kind of kept us out of the loop on her treatment. The possibility was apparently never discussed with my in-laws. As far as the PC thing goes, I think about it in passing most days, but I don't dwell on it. Of course, with my 2nd post-op PSA coming up next week, all bets are off!",

      "Content": "Hi Ireland. Welcome! I realize this stuff is scary. I'm glad to see your dad is reading 'The Book.' Don't fret too much that if your dad has the 'open' surgery that he'll fare worse. Dr. Walsh was a big pioneer in helping to perfect (as well as can be expected) that technique--assuming it's 'retropubic'--via the lower abdomen. A robot doesn't make a mediocre surgeon better--experience does. I had 'open' surgery nearly 11 months ago, and I'm doing well. If his scans, etc., are clean and indicate confinement, and he's able to tolerate surgery, I certainly see that as a viable option. Best of luck to you guys! My wife's dad is like, 1 generation removed from 'getting off the boat' Irish. My wife occasionally mentions that she's the only one of her siblings to have _not_ visited the homeland. Maybe we'll do. that sometime. Ron",

      "Content": "Hi Michael. I'd suggest scouring through the 'sticky' regarding prostate biopsy if you haven't done so already. It's not a big deal though. Was your MRI of the '3T' multiparametric variety? They appear to be the latest models out there. Will your urologist be using your MRI images with the ultrasound images from your biopsy so as to perform a 'fusion guided' biopsy? Most TRUS biopsies seem to be the standard '12 core' variety, however a fusion biopsy may require a couple more needles, but you'll be numb, so don't sweat it! You'll get a valium or something similar for the morning of, as well as an antibiotic. You'll probably be instructed to use a Fleets enema a couple hours before hand to clean your lower colon out (helps prevent infection). At the facility you'll swap out your clothes for a gown (open in the back, LOL!), lie on the table on your side with your legs drawn up towards your rear end. The doc will likely insert the lubed wand/probe for an 'ultrasound-only' look first and take some measurements of your 'parts.' Then comes the numbing needle via the probe (some docs use a numbing gel prior to the needle. I recommend this if it's an option), and then the biopsy needles, which are spring-loaded into a gun of some type. It goes pretty quickly at this point and it didn't really hurt or anything. Afterwards I had to wait in the recovery area until I could pass urine so the nurse could check it for anything unusual before I was released. Hardly any blood back there to speak of! And that's pretty much it. You'll have a little red-tinged blood for a few days and may see a small clot or two pass, but that's normal. Warning! Your seminal fluid will be pretty gross for a little while afterwards, Think TAR! Unfortunately, it's normal too. It'll eventually pass out of your system, after a while. My MRI score was a '3' also and indeterminate. And mine also showed there was no evidence my lesion had escaped the capsule, which made me feel somewhat relieved heading up to my surgery date. Has your urologist had you do a PCA3 test? I ask because of the tests I had, that's actually the one that came back with the best chance that cancer would be found on biopsy. My 'Free PSA' as well as a 'PHI' test weren't particularly favorable for cancer, the PCA3 was. P.S., can you advise your location and/or where you're getting treatment?",

She was getting her blood checked every 2 months, so it came on fast. I'd better call that gastro doc!",

I know it exists, but I've never seen anyone have that Gleason reported in the recent past. You can add your location to your profile, and your 'stats' to your signature line. I don't blame you for choosing RP. Many of us have. Ron Edit: Oops! I _do_ see your age in your post!",

He told me that my situation isn't \"dire\" by any means. Pathology report (reviewed by Dr. Epstein) shows \"Small Focus of prostatic adenocarcinoma, GS 3+3=6 less than 5% involvement\" in 2 of 14 cores. Dr. Carter said on a 1-5 scale,with 5 being the highest, I'm a \"1\"-- But I certainly don't like thinking about a \"bad thing\" growing inside of me! Of course, I worry about missed stuff in the biopsy, but maybe I have an edge with 2 TRUS biopsies (the last MRI-guided) within 15 months and only finding 2 cores with those 26 needles! There area lot of things, mostly political, that I get aggravated about living in Maryland. Having Johns Hopkins 30 minutes away isn't one of them though!",

      "Content": "Hi Michael. I'd suggest scouring through the 'sticky' regarding prostate biopsy if you haven't done so already. It's not a big deal though. Was your MRI of the '3T' multiparametric variety? They appear to be the latest models out there. Will your urologist be using your MRI images with the ultrasound images from your biopsy so as to perform a 'fusion guided' biopsy? Most TRUS biopsies seem to be the standard '12 core' variety, however a fusion biopsy may require a couple more needles, but you'll be numb, so don't sweat it! You'll get a valium or something similar for the morning of, as well as an antibiotic. You'll probably be instructed to use a Fleets enema a couple hours before hand to clean your lower colon out (helps prevent infection). At the facility you'll swap out your clothes for a gown (open in the back, LOL!), lie on the table on your side with your legs drawn up towards your rear end. The doc will likely insert the lubed wand/probe for an 'ultrasound-only' look first and take some measurements of your 'parts.' Then comes the numbing needle via the probe (some docs use a numbing gel prior to the needle. I recommend this if it's an option), and then the biopsy needles, which are spring-loaded into a gun of some type. It goes pretty quickly at this point and it didn't really hurt or anything. Afterwards I had to wait in the recovery area until I could pass urine so the nurse could check it for anything unusual before I was released. Hardly any blood back there to speak of! And that's pretty much it. You'll have a little red-tinged blood for a few days and may see a small clot or two pass, but that's normal. Warning! Your seminal fluid will be pretty gross for a little while afterwards, Think TAR! Unfortunately, it's normal too. It'll eventually pass out of your system, after a while. My MRI score was a '3' also and indeterminate. And mine also showed there was no evidence my lesion had escaped the capsule, which made me feel somewhat relieved heading up to my surgery date. Has your urologist had you do a PCA3 test? I ask because of the tests I had, that's actually the one that came back with the best chance that cancer would be found on biopsy. My 'Free PSA' as well as a 'PHI' test weren't particularly favorable for cancer, the PCA3 was. P.S., can you advise your location and/or where you're getting treatment?",

I met up with a few fellow retirees of mine recently. I've made it sort of a mission to encourage guys to be sure they have their PSAs checked. I tell them my story as a case in point. All are over 50 and a few asked \"how did you find out?\" Mine was a routine blood test. I told them to be sure their docs are doing the same. I got the impression it hadn't occurred to them. I was guilty myself, I guess, but thankfully my regular doc was on the ball. If I hadn't forgotten about some past history, I probably would've asked for PSAs sooner.",

      "Content": "I never cease to be amazed at the number of guys -- most of whom don't see doctors on a regular basis -- who have never heard of the PSA test. Good point Jim. I met up with a few fellow retirees of mine recently. I've made it sort of a mission to encourage guys to be sure they have their PSAs checked. I tell them my story as a case in point. All are over 50 and a few asked \"how did you find out?\" Mine was a routine blood test. I told them to be sure their docs are doing the same. I got the impression it hadn't occurred to them. I was guilty myself, I guess, but thankfully my regular doc was on the ball. If I hadn't forgotten about some past history, I probably would've asked for PSAs sooner.",

I know it exists, but I've never seen anyone have that Gleason reported in the recent past. You can add your location to your profile, and your 'stats' to your signature line. I don't blame you for choosing RP. Many of us have. Ron Edit: Oops! I _do_ see your age in your post!",

So did my father's grandfather, but not HIS father, though he died of other things on the younger side, so who knows? I believe PC is considered 'sporadic' though, as many men get it with no family history. Most men probably get it and never even know, as they outlive it and die of other things.",

      "Content": "Welcome, MJ. Any chance you can get in on a 3T mpMRI prior to a biopsy? You make some valid points, so if you end up having one, I'd recommend the fusion biopsy after a MRI. As you've probably read here, blind biopsies are just that--blind! While PC does have a familial aspect to it, my understanding is that it's also considered a 'sporadic' disease--it's more or less the luck of the draw. With an 'area of firmness' on your prostate, I'd be inclined to do the biopsy. Besides, while it's true other things may get you at your age and as you get older, the biopsy can help identify the aggressiveness of cancer---if you have it. That knowledge can help you make a decision on treatments, if any, as you move forward. While an enlarged prostate can cause some of your problems, unfortunately, so can other things. Best of luck.

      "Content": "Just a quick welcome, unfortunately, before I have to run back outside into the heat and finish cutting the grass! I'm a surgery guy, so I can't really give you advice on other treatments, but you'll get some feedback soon. I believe you're the second poster within the last couple of days to list a relatively low PSA number,yet cancer was found, and of the 4+3=7 variety at that. Was there a reason for the biopsy to begin with, considering your husband's low PSA? A positive digital exam, or symptoms of some kind? Not that it matters at this point, but does his biopsy report mention 'adenocarcinoma' as his cancer type? Lately it seems there have been a few cases of the rarer, apparently more worrisome, 'intraductal' variety, which sometimes presents with a low PSA yet a higher Gleason score. As far as perineural invasion goes, my understanding is that means that cancer cells were seen tracking along the nerves that exit the prostate, but it doesn't necessarily mean the cells have escaped via those nerves. The nerve bundles surrounding the prostate are of your concern for 'nerve sparing' surgery. Which is why you want a top notch, experienced surgeon should you go that route. If the cancer is suspected of protruding into the adjacent nerve bundles, then nerve sparing would be more difficult, but since the surgeon is ready to operate, I doubt any kind of 'extension' beyond the prostate capsule is suspected. I've seen Fox Chase mentioned a few times in this forum, and I don't recall anything bad being said. As a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Cutlery myself, I had a good experience there, all things considered, should you wish to drive down for a second look. Speaking of Hopkins, as you've probably read here, and will probably have suggested to you, it may be worth your while to have the biopsy slides sent to Dr. Epstein's lab there for peace of mind that your pathology results are accurate. RE: ED? Depends. It takes some time as those nerves have suffered quite a shock. He'll probably be taking Viagra or another ED drug for a while. It may take up to a full year for total recovery. Practice helps. Even alone, lol! More folks will be along. Best wishes. I have to get back out there. It's not getting any cooler! Ron",

No barking dogs or crazy cats, and high enough from the street that I wasn't likely to catch a stray round from below! I wouldn't have minded a second night of peace and quiet, but after seeing what the insurance was billed, THAT wasn't going to happen! You know, in a way, be glad that nodule was found. With his low PSA readings, it may have very well gotten farther along before a biopsy was ordered. Yeah, I finished. Though I was gonna pass out there at the end! Hot, humid, Maryland summers! Ron P.S. Feel free to private message me should you have any more questions about my doc or JH. There are many things about living in this state that annoy me, but after losing a little faith after my first uro missed my PC during a biopsy, and my PSA still too high, I ran, not walked the 40 minutes to JH!",

      "Content": "Just a quick welcome, unfortunately, before I have to run back outside into the heat and finish cutting the grass! I'm a surgery guy, so I can't really give you advice on other treatments, but you'll get some feedback soon. I believe you're the second poster within the last couple of days to list a relatively low PSA number,yet cancer was found, and of the 4+3=7 variety at that. Was there a reason for the biopsy to begin with, considering your husband's low PSA? A positive digital exam, or symptoms of some kind? Not that it matters at this point, but does his biopsy report mention 'adenocarcinoma' as his cancer type? Lately it seems there have been a few cases of the rarer, apparently more worrisome, 'intraductal' variety, which sometimes presents with a low PSA yet a higher Gleason score. As far as perineural invasion goes, my understanding is that means that cancer cells were seen tracking along the nerves that exit the prostate, but it doesn't necessarily mean the cells have escaped via those nerves. The nerve bundles surrounding the prostate are of your concern for 'nerve sparing' surgery. Which is why you want a top notch, experienced surgeon should you go that route. If the cancer is suspected of protruding into the adjacent nerve bundles, then nerve sparing would be more difficult, but since the surgeon is ready to operate, I doubt any kind of 'extension' beyond the prostate capsule is suspected. I've seen Fox Chase mentioned a few times in this forum, and I don't recall anything bad being said. As a graduate of the Johns Hopkins School of Cutlery myself, I had a good experience there, all things considered, should you wish to drive down for a second look. Speaking of Hopkins, as you've probably read here, and will probably have suggested to you, it may be worth your while to have the biopsy slides sent to Dr. Epstein's lab there for peace of mind that your pathology results are accurate. RE: ED? Depends. It takes some time as those nerves have suffered quite a shock. He'll probably be taking Viagra or another ED drug for a while. It may take up to a full year for total recovery. Practice helps. Even alone, lol! More folks will be along. Best wishes. I have to get back out there. It's not getting any cooler! Ron",

      "Content": "Welcome, MJ. Any chance you can get in on a 3T mpMRI prior to a biopsy? You make some valid points, so if you end up having one, I'd recommend the fusion biopsy after a MRI. As you've probably read here, blind biopsies are just that--blind! While PC does have a familial aspect to it, my understanding is that it's also considered a 'sporadic' disease--it's more or less the luck of the draw. With an 'area of firmness' on your prostate, I'd be inclined to do the biopsy. Besides, while it's true other things may get you at your age and as you get older, the biopsy can help identify the aggressiveness of cancer---if you have it. That knowledge can help you make a decision on treatments, if any, as you move forward. While an enlarged prostate can cause some of your problems, unfortunately, so can other things. Best of luck.

I tried it and I was able to stop the flow, albeit not nearly as quickly as before the surgery, but it's a (hopeful) start....I encourage anyone scheduling surgery at JH to go, and my understanding is that they are matching the upcoming surgeries with patients in order to invite patients to attend. Good slide show and a good question/answer session afterwards with a Urology Nurse Practitioner....",
