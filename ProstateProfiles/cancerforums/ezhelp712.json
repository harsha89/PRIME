      "Content": "I am a 63 year old (soon to be 64) white male. In August 2012, after experiencing a difficult time urinating, I sought a urologist. My PSA result was 50.11 A biopsy confirmed 6 of 10 samples were positive. CT and bone scans were negative. A Gleason score of 8. The doctor claims I'm a candidate for either surgery (removal of the prostate) or seed/hormone therapy. Would someone please be so kind and share their experiences with the \"seed\" therapy? Advice would be greatly appreciated - I thank you in advance.",

This is exactly the topic the urologist and surgeon have concerns - cancer is not contained. Therefore, they suggested the seed therapy. Do you know if the seed therapy is ALWAYS accompanied with hormone therapy? Thank You.",
