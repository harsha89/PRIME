He has never shown any signs of having cancer and now has extremely aggressive liver mets. Based on his genotesting, the new PD-1 drug could work for my Father, but he needs to get into a clinical trial. It is his only option. Has anyone had the drug or know of any available trials. Thank you in advance!",

Hi Newporter, he is with an oncologist and has exhausted every available combination of the most recent advanced prostate cancer treatments, including Provenge. Since this post, I am now trying to get him into MD Anderson, where I agree, perhaps they will have trials/suggestions available to him. Thank you Fighterm, I had discovered that trial, but within the exclusion criteria the patient cannot have liver mets Take good care everyone and thanks again.",
