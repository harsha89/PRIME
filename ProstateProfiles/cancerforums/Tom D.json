      "Content": "Hi All, I have been reading the forums for a couple of weeks and the information shared has been very helpful for me. I am 43 and and was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier this month (stats in my signature). I have stage 2 or intermediate risk cancer Gleason 3+4 and my doctor recommended surgery. I thought about the pros and cons over the past couple of weeks and I don't really see any positive to waiting or doing active surveillance. Other than the cancer, I am in excellent health and very active (cycling, weights, running, swimming). My doctor thinks I should recover well. I am hoping the tumor is confined and that I can live a cancer free life post surgery. I really want to avoid radiation and/or hormone therapy and it seems to me that doing active surveillance would increase the chance that these treatments would be needed. I am married and my wife and I are worried about the potential life-long ED. He didn't recommend performing any CT or other scans pre-surgery. Is this typical? I ask because several on the forum indicate CT/MRI and/or bone scans being done before surgery. My surgery is not scheduled yet, but it will be with Dr. Patel in Celebration Florida who seems to be one of the best surgeons around. I guess I am looking for your thoughts about this decision. Even if I recover well now and live a mostly normal life in my 40s and 50s, does the surgery have negative implications later in life? Like increased chance of developing incontinence/impotence later in my 50s or 60s? Obviously, remaining cancer-free is the main objective, but I am curious if there are side effects that all surgery patients have to face later in life .. or are outcomes variable?",
