      "Content": "I submit that if his urologist thinks 2 months won't matter, he probably thinks your husband's fate has already been determined. If I were you, and were concerned about trying to save his life, I would demand they try for that biopsy every day until it gets done. Your husband is not a \"happy camper, chipper Kipper\"? Well, he's got every right to feel that way. You ask if 7 bones is really a lot of metastases, since we have over 200? Are you asking if he should or should not be in great pain? Pain that would make him very depressed and affect his life expectancy? The answer is yes....one (1) bone with metastasis is enough to change your outlook on life. I've got metastatic prostate cancer and two nights ago I had more pain than I've ever had in my 60 years. I was, and am, ready to take every pain pill in my house to never go through that again. It's simply horrible. I don't have the words to describe how bad that pain is. Does metastatic bone pain make you depressed, want to shorten your life: yes. Do NOT, at any time, underestimate how terrible is the pain that he may be feeling. I'm not exactly sure what you are asking with your entire post, but I know for certain what your husband is facing. mkane09",

      "Content": "I submit that if his urologist thinks 2 months won't matter, he probably thinks your husband's fate has already been determined. If I were you, and were concerned about trying to save his life, I would demand they try for that biopsy every day until it gets done. Your husband is not a \"happy camper, chipper Kipper\"? Well, he's got every right to feel that way. You ask if 7 bones is really a lot of metastases, since we have over 200? Are you asking if he should or should not be in great pain? Pain that would make him very depressed and affect his life expectancy? The answer is yes....one (1) bone with metastasis is enough to change your outlook on life. I've got metastatic prostate cancer and two nights ago I had more pain than I've ever had in my 60 years. I was, and am, ready to take every pain pill in my house to never go through that again. It's simply horrible. I don't have the words to describe how bad that pain is. Does metastatic bone pain make you depressed, want to shorten your life: yes. Do NOT, at any time, underestimate how terrible is the pain that he may be feeling. I'm not exactly sure what you are asking with your entire post, but I know for certain what your husband is facing. mkane09",

      "Content": "Well, actually, that was the only good news I got from my trip to Sand Lake Imaging last week: no bone mets. \"At least 10 or 11 lymph node tumors\", along my lumbar spine, just above the level of my previous salvage radiation. To the best of my knowledge, I have absolutely no symptoms from the mets....so far. SequoiaR, how fast is your PSA doubling? What is it currently? My last check about 2 weeks ago: 25.6. Ah, the joys of Gleason 9..... BTW, a fellow BoBer was in the PET scan just ahead of me. Gleason 7 PCa for 16 years, the last 5 under the care of Dr. Myers. He had failed HDT and had been on Ketoconazole for some time. He said it made him sick as a dog and very weak. He was hoping he was done with it. His PSA peak? 5.XX. mkane09",

      "Content": "Number 1: Yes, they can do those tests anytime, but John's point was that if they were done before surgery, they probably would indicate that according to NCI guidelines, surgery should not be done. Number 2: Sand Lake Imaging in Orlando performs MRIs enhanced with Fereheme and can image tumors down to 2 mm. They are part of a battery of tests including CT, both enhanced and non-enhanced, PET scans, and bone scans. All of the information is analyzed to confirm the findings. Normal CT or MRI cannot \"see\" tumors until they are about a centimeter in size....a Billion cancer cells. Number 3: I can't address this one, I haven't got there yet. SequioaRanger could address this one with first hand knowledge. I will say that it is extremely difficult for an individual suffering from \"aching\" type pain (anywhere) to differentiate whether it is of soft tissue or boney origin in their own body. Because most of us are 55+, we ALL will have some morning stiffness and pain from osteoarthritis. Number 4: In all likelihood, the first lymph nodes to be involved will be the iliac nodes, and you can't palpate them. But given his PSA, I wouldn't doubt that he has involvement of MANY lymph nodes, not just the iliacs. If I were you, or more precisely, him, I'd be more worried about being incontinent to some degree following surgery. Which, again, is why John was so adamant about the second opinion. There is no good reason to risk incontinence from the surgery if you are bound for ADT/radiation anyway. Just be as supportive as you can. He may make what many of us would consider are mistakes along the treatment path, but it is still HIS body, HIS life. Ah, I'll shut up now. mkane09",

Seriously embarassing always dribbling on myself every time. I even tried sitting down to go, but that doesnt help. It always seems to happen maybe 20 seconds or so after im done. So embarassing. I hate going out now, and I always have to wear either black or dark navy blue pants or else wet spots will randomly show up. Seems obvious to me that you need to wear a pad of some kind.....if it's just a drop or three, you can get by with a toilet paper pad. More than that and you probably want an incontinence pad. I'd like to say you'll get used to this....but you probably won't. AMHIK.... mkane09",

I was approved in about 2 weeks, but won't draw my first disability check until August 28th: 5 months. I don't know why it takes so long. I'll be eligible for Medicare in 2 years, or, most likely a year or so after I'm dead. Gotta love our government. I'm 60, but I don't think age has much to do with the disability approval. Several years ago, SSDI started fast tracking certain diseases/disabilities for approval. Most of them were cancers and metastatic prostate cancer is one of them.

      "Content": "johnT, I agree with you, with maybe a qualification. The Fereheme MRI can highlight lymph node tumors down to 2 mm in size, much smaller than a normal CT. Dr. Myers sent me to SLI back in April for an MRI, CT, and PET scans. His rationale was that if the cancer shows up in less than 5 lymph nodes, it can be radiated and (this is where we differ in opinion) the cancer can be \"knocked back\" for 2-3 more years. Theoretically, you could undergo followup scans then, and repeat the process. Dr. Myers did not use the term \"cure\" with this approach. The other interesting fact about Sand Lake is that you will be charged for the Fereheme used for the MRI because your insurance will not pay for it. 15 months ago that charge was $900; it is currently $1500, out of pocket. I have asked SLI why I was charged $1500 for a $400 vial of Fereheme, but got no response. If you google Fereheme, there are many manufacturers that sell it to physicians for $400 per vial. mkane09",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kazzie61 I wanted to ask but maybe I should start a new thread, what is the difference between salvage and aduvant radiotherapy? The difference is timing. Adjuvant radiation is started soon after surgery, not waiting to see if the patient's PSA is going to rise, assuming that all of the cancer was not removed or killed with the primary treatment. Salvage radiation is given some time after surgery (months, sometimes years later), in response to a PSA level which does not go to undetectable or is rising from undetectable. The actual radiation amounts are the same, IIRC. mkane09",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Appleseed It came in at 0.02 and that is a good start I might say. I am happy, but I know that it, the PSA can rise at any time in the near future having G9 aggressive PAc. Also, on paper I am stage 4 with the post operation pathology report of 1 positive lymph node out of 18 dissected. I say on paper because the cancer still needs to be metastasized proven cause it is so early post surgery. The Radiation Oncologist is ready to do Adjunctive IMRT with IGRT, I am still waiting to heal a bit more from incontinence and impotence. My Medical Oncologist would like to talk to his tumor review board for more opinions. My Surgeon suggests going for Adjunctive Therapy and using that window of time after surgery to go for Adjunctive.. I myself am confused.. ..Anyways a 0.02 is the great news I wanted to share with you all.. ............Appleseed.............Nick............ .................................. Nick, a first post-op PSA of .02 IS good, but don't fool yourself into thinking your treatment is over. You are very young, with a very aggressive disease. There is more cancer floating around inside of you. Let your doctors find it and kill it. If you have undetectable PSAs for the next 7-8 years, then I would consider using a word such as \"cured\". Now.....what are you confused about? mkane09",

I went to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and met with Dr. Louis Pisters, who performed a DRE, and reviewed the records, biopsy results, etc. from my first urologist. He staged the cancer as T1a, stating that I had had approximately 100 cores, and only one of the last thirty hit cancer. He said further, that the \"T\" staging system relied heavily on the DRE and nodule detection, and because the nodules are apparently cancer free, T2c is overstaging the cancer. He recommended active surveillance, another biopsy in twelve to twenty-four months, and no surgery at this time. He indicated that at this early stage, the risk of quality of life side effects of the surgery are not worth the risk. I am fifty-nine years old, married, healthy, active, work out with a trainer, have no high blood pressure, heart, or any other health issues. No potency or continence problems unusual for my age.

      "Content": "1. First visit: $1,600 out of pocket. 2. Dr. Myers is very intelligent, probably reads every research paper written about PCa, and clearly thinks outside the box in treating PCa. 3. Is a big believer in diet and supplements, tailored to your own PCa case. He believes that each PCa case is unique. He started me on Avodart, curcumin, Vitamin D3, metformin, resveratrol, pomegranate extract, magnesium after a thorough review of my blood work. He orders his own blood work which includes a few things I've never seen before. 4. Dr. Myers refers a lot of patients for Feraheme MRI, CT, bone scans, PET scans to Sand Lake Imaging in Orlando. The reason I mention this is because the Feraheme for the MRI is not covered by insurance and is (in April, 2012 anyway) $1,500 out of pocket. That same Feraheme from SLI was $900 one year previously and can be purchased online by physicians for $400. Someone is making big $$ on PCa patients. 5. Dr. Myers is the only medical oncologist I've seen so I can't make comparisons, although I tried to see a recommended MO here in Knoxville. The receptionist referred me back to my urologist because Dr. So and So \"only does chemotherapy\" Cha-Ching! 6. Dr. Myers certainly does not spend big bucks on a research facility of his own. The office of AIDP looks like a small family practice office in the middle of nowhere. A little disconcerting after an 8 hour drive and $1600 taking wings out of your wallet. Oddly, or perhaps not, my urologist here in Knoxville had never heard of Dr. Myers. Not sure who that says more about, though. mkane09",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cancer's Landlord I have had 5 prostate biopsies over the past four years, with 12, 24, 24 and 30+ cores in order. I went to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and met with Dr. Louis Pisters, who performed a DRE, and reviewed the records, biopsy results, etc. from my first urologist. He staged the cancer as T1a, stating that I had had approximately 100 cores, and only one of the last thirty hit cancer. He said further, that the \"T\" staging system relied heavily on the DRE and nodule detection, and because the nodules are apparently cancer free, T2c is overstaging the cancer. He recommended active surveillance, another biopsy in twelve to twenty-four months, and no surgery at this time. He indicated that at this early stage, the risk of quality of life side effects of the surgery are not worth the risk. I am fifty-nine years old, married, healthy, active, work out with a trainer, have no high blood pressure, heart, or any other health issues. No potency or continence problems unusual for my age.

      "Content": "gme, did you have negative surgical margins following your surgery? If so, then I'd say your chances of having distant micrometastases are very large. If you had positive margins, as I did, you at least have the HOPE of having local disease which could be zapped with radiation. Mind you, it is certainly possible to have both local and systemic micro metastases and the radiation alone would not help you in the long run. Following DaVinci and radiation, my PSA was essentially non-detectable for 18 months, but my cancer came roaring back last January. After seeing Dr. Charles Myers, I started the Mediterranean diet, along with resveratrol, Vitamin D, curcumin, fish oil, etc. etc. My PSA has continued to climb. Hormone deprivation therapy will make blood sugar control difficult if you are a diabetic. I know of two prostate cancer patients who are still alive (and by all accounts should NOT be) after drinking Cassie tea, but this is entirely anecdotal and I am not proposing this as a cure. Unfortunately I guess, I'm a \"scientist\" by nature (actually, I'm a physical therapist, too), so I want to see data supporting this treatment or that treatment, not anecdotal stories. And the best you're going to get with holistic medicine is anecdote. Good luck with whatever you decide to do. mkane09",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter In addition to what lancepeace said, here is what I would ask: When I visited a radiation oncologist for a second opinion, here were the questions I wanted his view on: 1. Radiation vs surgery vs AS. Since you already had surgery, there is no need to ask this question. 2. His view and recommendation regarding adjuvant radiation treatment vs salvage radiation treatment in your case, since you have fairly aggressive cancer: Clinical G7 and G9 post Op. 3. Should you do combination hormone + radiation in case you need to do radiation. 4. Radiation to prostate bed vs pelvic area + Lymph nodes.... 5. What about combining radiation vs hormone vs chemo.... 6. What type of machine is he using? Fairwind had a good recommendation of what type of machine is state of the art (Varian RapidArc?) and perhaps best. Good luck 7. What side effects am I likely to suffer as a result of your proposed treatments? mkane09",

However, soft tissue healing (scarring) will not be complete until you are 6-8 weeks out from surgery. They had to go thru some major abdominal muscle, which is probably why you are so uncomfortable right now. If you are in pain, take your pain medicine!!! There is no benefit from being in pain. Yes, you are being impatient. Please do not compare where you are with where someone with laparoscopic surgery might be in terms of recovery. There is a reason that laparoscopic surgeries have become so popular and that reason is post op pain/healing. You'll get there, it's just going to take longer.

I can certainly see where outcomes for chemotherapy for other types of cancers are often curative and the outcomes for chemotherapy for PCa are not, hence, I would agree that \"traditional chemo has not proven to be very effective against PC(a)...\". I guess the question is: how honest should we be with one another? I think I take more offense at the last sentence: \"Pomegranate juice or extract pills and even low-dose aspirin seen to slow down the progression too\" For PCa? You're gonna have to show me that double blind study before I swallow that one. Just remember, these are the opinions of a non-physician, non-urologist, non-oncologist and, as such, when combined with a $1.25 or so, can still be used to purchase a large coffee at McDonalds. mkane09",

While I might be cynical about the business side of treating cancer in general, I have no issues with Dr. Myers' skills and knowledge of the treatment of prostate cancer. I appreciate the fact that he is an outside-the-box thinker. I get the impression from him that he has read every research article ever published on prostate cancer with a critical researcher's eye. I doubt that he has ever forgotten a prostate cancer patient and has learned something from every single one. I found his blog to be very enlightening and wanted to share that blog with the rest of our PCa brothers. I'm confused about the comment \"I only wish he was available to the common folk.\" I self referred and had no trouble getting an appointment.

When my PSA continued to rise, Dr. Myers told me it was time for ADT and I told him I didn't want it. For reasons that I won't go into on the Internet, I've decided I've had all the treatment I want. I'm in God's hands now. I'm fully aware of where this is headed. Interestingly, Dr. Myers did not think that I was a Gleason 9, due to my doubling time. At my stage, he said my doubling time should be every 2 weeks. I have just started having symptoms that I can safely say are from my cancer. I had really bad low back pain yesterday, and I've got a lump on the left side of my throat which is probably a lymph node.

He has some very interesting views of prostate cancer treatment. I would encourage those of you who are interested, to watch several of his blogs. I think you will get a good flavor for him as a physician and prostate cancer survivor. I also think his ability to think outside the box is readily apparent.

      "Content": "According to Dr. Charles \"Snuffy\" Myers, and this is almost verbatim, PSA post treatment is THE marker for determining what is going on with your cancer. Because we don't have scans of any kind that will show tumors until they are at least 2 mm in size and those tumors represent hundreds of thousands of cancer cells, the fact that your prostate has been either removed or obliterated makes PSA very sensitive as a marker. What I didn't understand, and still don't, is that Dr. Myers discussed with me the care of several patients whose post treatment PSAs were very small, under say 1-2, who he thought were in grave danger. When I went to Sand Lake Imaging for scans, I met another patient of Dr. Myers whose PSA had never been above 5.0, but he had undergone primary and secondary treatment and had been given second line hormonal therapy, a LOT of treatment. mkane09",

      "Content": "Let me explain what happened to me and this is only meant to be illustrative. Following surgery, I had an initial PSA of 0.10 which rose to 0.18 three months later (Biochemical recurrence). I had salvage radiation following that and for 18 months my PSAs were undetectable. However, my cancer returned. After meeting with Dr. Myers, I said \"So, my cancer had already escaped the prostate bed before I had radiation?\" \"Yes\". \"So I had 6 weeks of radiation for nothing?\" \"Yes, but we didn't know that your cancer had metastasized outside the prostate bed AT THAT TIME.\" (My emphasis). Knowing now what I didn't know then, following surgical failure, I should have had systemic treatment. To be sure, you should have systemic treatment also, not just radiation. Especially given your high Gleason score. One more thing. The best scans available as we speak cannot detect our cancer until there are literally hundreds of thousands of cancer cells conglomerated together. Normal CT and MRI can't detect prostate CA tumors until they are a full centimeter in size, a BILLION cells. So to answer your question, yes, you get treated if your PSA goes up, regardless if your scans are negative. They are just not sensitive enough yet to find our cancer cells early. You may wonder why everyone is having all these MRI, CT, and bone scans. Well, they are money makers, and we live in a litigous society. mkane09",

At my stage, he said my doubling time should be every 2 weeks. I have just started having symptoms that I can safely say are from my cancer.

Dad's going to be fine. Focus your attension on your Mom....Best of luck to you and your family... Agree 100% with Fairwind. Your dad's last 2 PSAs could be off that far if done at different labs.

Maybe....but his DRE sounds entirely normal to me. And his PSAs are entirely normal for his age.

When my PSA continued to rise, Dr. Myers told me it was time for ADT and I told him I didn't want it. For reasons that I won't go into on the Internet, I've decided I've had all the treatment I want. I'm in God's hands now. I'm fully aware of where this is headed. Interestingly, Dr. Myers did not think that I was a Gleason 9, due to my doubling time. At my stage, he said my doubling time should be every 2 weeks. I have just started having symptoms that I can safely say are from my cancer. I had really bad low back pain yesterday, and I've got a lump on the left side of my throat which is probably a lymph node. But, it's supposed to be sunny and warm here tomorrow and I'm going for a ride on my horse. mkane09",

      "Content": "Let me explain what happened to me and this is only meant to be illustrative. Following surgery, I had an initial PSA of 0.10 which rose to 0.18 three months later (Biochemical recurrence). I had salvage radiation following that and for 18 months my PSAs were undetectable. However, my cancer returned. After meeting with Dr. Myers, I said \"So, my cancer had already escaped the prostate bed before I had radiation?\" \"Yes\". \"So I had 6 weeks of radiation for nothing?\" \"Yes, but we didn't know that your cancer had metastasized outside the prostate bed AT THAT TIME.\" (My emphasis). Knowing now what I didn't know then, following surgical failure, I should have had systemic treatment. To be sure, you should have systemic treatment also, not just radiation. Especially given your high Gleason score. One more thing. The best scans available as we speak cannot detect our cancer until there are literally hundreds of thousands of cancer cells conglomerated together. Normal CT and MRI can't detect prostate CA tumors until they are a full centimeter in size, a BILLION cells. So to answer your question, yes, you get treated if your PSA goes up, regardless if your scans are negative. They are just not sensitive enough yet to find our cancer cells early. You may wonder why everyone is having all these MRI, CT, and bone scans. Well, they are money makers, and we live in a litigous society. mkane09",

Because we don't have scans of any kind that will show tumors until they are at least 2 mm in size and those tumors represent hundreds of thousands of cancer cells, the fact that your prostate has been either removed or obliterated makes PSA very sensitive as a marker. What I didn't understand, and still don't, is that Dr. Myers discussed with me the care of several patients whose post treatment PSAs were very small, under say 1-2, who he thought were in grave danger. When I went to Sand Lake Imaging for scans, I met another patient of Dr. Myers whose PSA had never been above 5.0, but he had undergone primary and secondary treatment and had been given second line hormonal therapy, a LOT of treatment. mkane09",

So, don't be surprised or depressed if your post op PSA isn't zero. The good news is that you have a reason why it might not be zero and radiation has a chance to take care of that remaining cancer. It is also not unusual for your pre-op (biopsy) Gleason score to be upgraded when the pathologist has a chance to cut the entire prostate up to look at it. Regarding the incontinence and impotence, well, you just won't know for a while yet, but Marie, you've got the right attitude. Fred, I know we all want to be the same after surgery as we were before, but sometimes it doesn't work out that way. I believe it was Forrest, Forrest Gump that said his momma told him life was like a box of chocolates....you never know what you're gonna get. Truer words were never spoken.

Regarding radiation/surgery: if radiation treatment does not kill all of your cancer, surgery would not either. You would still need a second line therapy, most usually hormone deprivation. In my opinion, urologists/surgeons use the \"can't do surgery after radiation\" line as a scare tactic to get patients into surgery. Do your homework!!! You have plenty of time for multiple medical opinions from different specialists/clinics/hospitals before your cancer will have spread. mkane09",

Dad's going to be fine. Focus your attension on your Mom....Best of luck to you and your family... Agree 100% with Fairwind. Your dad's last 2 PSAs could be off that far if done at different labs. Even if he HAD PCa, the treatment could be worse than the disease. With surgery, he could end up incontinent, with hormone deprivation he could be so weak as to not be able to function. Radiation? Maybe....but his DRE sounds entirely normal to me. And his PSAs are entirely normal for his age. I guarantee that if you drag him off to enough 2nd opinions, you WILL find a urologist willing to give him a PCa diagnosis.....and plenty of treatment. You both do not want this. Let him enjoy old age. JMHO..... mkane09",

      "Content": "JimmyP, I'm in the same boat with you, next seat down. Surgery 9-08, leaky ever since. One question: are you married? S.O.? The reason I ask is I think those of us on the board who already have female companions, who are understanding of our condition, don't see the impotence and, worse, incontinence as being as big a deal as those of us who are single. Before surgery, I was enjoying sex 5-6 times a week with a girlfriend of 4-5 months. She left me exactly 2 weeks after surgery and since then I'm wondering what woman in their right mind wants to START a relationship with a guy who regularly pees in his pants and frequently wets the bed? So now I'm left with the idea that my surgery has pretty much doomed me to a life alone. I'm certain that if I had a spouse or S.O. that was understanding of everything we've gone through, my outlook on life would be different. Am I off base here? Can we get some discussion going on this, this, female companion issue? Has anyone experienced what I did, vis a vis, their loved one vanished at the first realization of what prostate surgery really affects? Or from those whose S.O.s DIDN'T bail on them? Or (really hoping here), anyone who was single before their surgery and isn't single now? mkane09",

      "Content": "What angers me about your story is the fact that the doctors kept telling you he would recover, be OK. He was obviously a very sick man and had so many objective signs that I cannot believe that his doctors mis-diagnosed him. I think they probably DID know he was terminally ill with (probably) prostate cancer and felt they were sparing the patient and family from the knowledge that he was going to die an uncomfortable death. I think sometimes doctors are not prepared for the death of their patients and they (the doctors) have a poor time coping with how to interact with the dying patient and their family. If I were you, I'd be severely P.O.ed at his doctors for not being honest with you about what was happening. I am currently near the spot where your father's story began. My PSA in January was 155 and, suddenly, after being virtually asymptomatic from my cancer for 4 plus years, I began having severe back and rib pain. CT, PET scans confirmed my cancer has invaded my spine, pelvis, ribs, and cranium. I just finished a 10 day course of radiation to T10-L3 to knock some of that pain back. Just this morning, I suspect I broke a rib on the left side of my ribcage by foolishly engaging in a dangerous activity: reaching behind me to wash my butt. I have had very frank discussions with my primary care doctor and rad onc doctor. We are on the same page. Pain relief until I pull the plug, that's it. I'm very appreciative of the fact they understand where I'm at and what I will and will not do. They have been very supportive of my decisions so far. I only hope they will also support my wish for euthanasia when I'm ready to go. Death is part of life, something we all will do. I firmly believe that we should have the means to die with dignity. That said, my heart goes out to you for the passing of your father. I don't know if YOU were prepared for him to go or not, but I hope you find some peace now. mkane09",

Surgeon 4 days later: \"It appears we missed a few cells on one margin. We will follow up with PSA tests and if it rises we will consider 1 dose of radiation.\" Today: I'm incontinent and impotent. Surgeon: \"Operation went smoothly.\" Patient: \"I'm incontinent and impotent\". It seems what we have here is a failure to communicate..... The surgeon goes home to his wife and kids, sleeps soundly throughout the night. Starts his new day with a healthy pee and maybe a quickie before the kids wake up. Patient goes home and pees all over himself 6 times in the night. Will never see REM sleep the rest of his life. His girlfriend, disgusted with the idea of maybe getting accidentally pissed on every night, packs her things and leaves, never looking back. For those of us contemplating surgery to \"get it out\", don't think this can't happen to you. It happened to me, too. mkane09",

I can tell you from experience that once you start leaking at night, it's psychologically difficult to stay asleep at night, because you have that fear that you're going to wake up in a sea of urine. I'm awake almost every hour at night now because of that. If I go two hours asleep, I'll almost certainly wet myself. It is very difficult to get enough quality sleep.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Putt mkane09 I'm curious. With a history of GS 4+5, why did you wait 18 months between 7/10/06 (PSA <0.06) and 1/10/12 (PSA 13.90) for a PSA test? Were you being treated with something during this time? Its a pretty established fact that someone with a GS9 should be tested frequently, (usually every 3 months) in order to catch a post treatment failure at its earliest point. Are you on any type of treatment at this time? I had decided after July, 2010 that even if my cancer came back, I did not want further treatment, so no PSA draws with my RO. I had a routine physical in January last year that included a PSA. I've posted this before, but will repeat: I've had more bad symptoms from the TREATMENT of my cancer than from the cancer itself. I haven't slept more than 2 hours at a time since I had surgery, because I'm only (mostly) continent when I'm awake. So, typically, I'm up 5-6 times every night. Last night, I was up 5 times between 4 and 5:30. There is much, much more to my decision to just ride this out until the end, but I won't go into those details on the Internet. I have no regrets with my decision. I have a great deal of empathy towards those here who have gone to hell and back trying to beat their cancer, only to suffer the side effects of every treatment they are given. SequioaRanger immediately comes to mind. God bless you, man. I have reached a point of peace with my decision to leave my life in God's hands. With that, I'm able to enjoy whatever time I have left. I know that we each have to decide what is best for ourselves. My way may not work for others and I wouldn't try to change anyone's decision regarding when to say enough is enough. I wish we ALL could be cured of this terrible disease and made whole, but that is not reality. mkane09",

Many years ago, I had a kidney biopsy, which was preceeded by a great deal of anxiety, followed by a great deal of muscle spasm and generally not a fun procedure. Went to my nephrologist for the report 3 weeks later and the danged radiologist who did the biopsy missed my kidney entirely. I mean, come on, it's only as big as your fist AND done under flouroscopy. I had to have a second biopsy. Not happy. I'm pretty certain that Stevie Wonder could perform a kidney biopsy on the first try. But, I digress. Yes, they biopsied your colon. mkane09",

      "Content": "I'm starting this thread in hopes of getting an exchange of ideas about how the noobie is supposed to pick a primary treatment. In the recent past, there has been a sometimes heated exchange about what primary care treatment should be chosen, and, naturally, (HA!), I want to get my 2 cents worth in. If you are a noobie, and are easily confused/disturbed about making this choice, maybe you should just skip this thread. OTOH, if you want to hopefully gain some insight into your disease, follow along. Here we go.... Should I have surgery or radiation of some kind? Both treatments offer very good outcomes if your cancer is organ confined. Now, there is NO WAY to know for sure if your cancer has already micrometastacized, because we don't have tests that are that specific. This is important, because if your cancer comes back, don't second guess your choice of primary treatment. Those favoring surgery will tell you that surgeons cannot perform surgery following a failed primary radiation treatment. In fact, if your radiation fails, your surgery would have also because your cancer was already outside your prostate. Those favoring surgery will also tell you that you run a risk of developing secondary cancers of the bladder or colon many years after radiation. Yes, the odds are greater, but still the odds are very small. Those favoring surgery will tell you that they want the cancer OUT, NOW! I can't argue this point either way, as I'm sure none of us wanted the dang cancer in the first place. But surgery, even with negative surgical margins, does NOT guarantee that all of your cancer is gone. I'm going off on a little tangent here, but bear with me. Cancer is not just about the physical effects of the disease, but also the psychological effects, which I believe are sometimes even greater than the physical. So, those of us that get post-op PSAs that are considered zero, put on a great big happy face and party hardy. Woooohooo....it's GONE. Except sometimes it's not gone. And the downer that crashes on you if you find out somewhere down the road that your undetectable PSA is now 0.5 and climbing, is greater than any joy you will have in thinking you are \"cured\". There (cured) is a word that is tossed around here way too often. Go 6-7 years with no PSA increase, and then I'll buy the first drink. Those favoring surgery will also tell you that only by having surgery will you KNOW the exact pathology of your disease, your exact Gleason score, and whether your cancer has OBVIOUSLY escaped your prostate. But, the reality of it is that your Gleason score won't matter if your primary treatment fails. You are looking at secondary treatment no matter what. Dr. Charles Myers told me that the only factor of importance post primary care is PSA level. You get that with a blood test, not with a prostatectomy. Those favoring surgery will state, hopefully, that they picked an experienced surgeon who did not leave them incontinent or impotent. If you didn't pick the right surgeon, you'll know fairly early. Radiation on the other hand, has a very low incidence of impotence or incontinence, however, you probably won't know the results of that for several years. Those of us who came out of surgery with impotence will rightly tell you that there is more than one way to have a satisfactory sex life. Those of us who came out of surgery with incontinence will tell you that their lives have changed forever and they have the sudden urge to kill a certain surgeon. Also, most honest surgery patients will tell you that the length of their favorite body part has shortened as a result of surgery. Those favoring DaVinci surgery will state that the procedure was more or less a breeze, the catheter was a pain in the...well, front...and recovery was an easy 6 weeks away. Those favoring brachytherapy will state their treatment took a few hours more or less and they were back on the golf course in a day or two. Those favoring an open prostatectomy will undergo a bit more discomfort from surgery, controlled with the finest narcotic pain medicine, and will take a little longer to feel like their old selves, but they do get there. Those favoring radiation will have to suffer with the absence of what may be a false knowledge that \"all\" of their cancer was killed. The nature of radiation is that cells radiated are not able to replicate over time, so PSAs of radiation patients may fall for a very long time. If you are a \"Nervous Pervis\", this may be hard on you, having to wait so long for gratification that you made the right choice. That psychology thing again. So, to summarize, each type of primary treatment has pros and cons. Don't jump to conclusions regarding \"cured\"...just be patient. Go where ever you have to in order to assure that the best people possible are responsible for your care. Make your decision and don't look back...you can't change what happened in the past anyway. And I hope none of you find out what bony metastases feels like. Peace.....out. mkane09",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind ADT or Hormone Therapy or HT is usually the preferred treatment for an 80 year old..In many men, it is very effective, controlling prostate cancer for 10 years and even longer. Per Dr. Charles \"Snuffy\" Myers: \"I would not put an 80 year old man on HDT. He'd be so weak he couldn't get out of a chair.\" HDT is NOT an age related treatment, it's a location related treatment. If the PCa is thought to be confined to one area, some sort of local treatment (surgery, HIFU, or radiation of some form for example) is used to treat it. If the PCa is more likely to be systemic, i.e., metastatic, there's no sense in using a local treatment that won't kill all the cancer floating around inside. Therefore, HDT. mkane09",

Those favoring surgery will also tell you that only by having surgery will you KNOW the exact pathology of your disease, your exact Gleason score, and whether your cancer has OBVIOUSLY escaped your prostate. But, the reality of it is that your Gleason score won't matter if your primary treatment fails. You are looking at secondary treatment no matter what. Dr. Charles Myers told me that the only factor of importance post primary care is PSA level. You get that with a blood test, not with a prostatectomy. Those favoring surgery will state, hopefully, that they picked an experienced surgeon who did not leave them incontinent or impotent. If you didn't pick the right surgeon, you'll know fairly early. Radiation on the other hand, has a very low incidence of impotence or incontinence, however, you probably won't know the results of that for several years. Those of us who came out of surgery with impotence will rightly tell you that there is more than one way to have a satisfactory sex life. Those of us who came out of surgery with incontinence will tell you that their lives have changed forever and they have the sudden urge to kill a certain surgeon. Also, most honest surgery patients will tell you that the length of their favorite body part has shortened as a result of surgery. Those favoring DaVinci surgery will state that the procedure was more or less a breeze, the catheter was a pain in the...well, front...and recovery was an easy 6 weeks away. Those favoring brachytherapy will state their treatment took a few hours more or less and they were back on the golf course in a day or two. Those favoring an open prostatectomy will undergo a bit more discomfort from surgery, controlled with the finest narcotic pain medicine, and will take a little longer to feel like their old selves, but they do get there. Those favoring radiation will have to suffer with the absence of what may be a false knowledge that \"all\" of their cancer was killed. The nature of radiation is that cells radiated are not able to replicate over time, so PSAs of radiation patients may fall for a very long time. If you are a \"Nervous Pervis\", this may be hard on you, having to wait so long for gratification that you made the right choice. That psychology thing again. So, to summarize, each type of primary treatment has pros and cons. Don't jump to conclusions regarding \"cured\"...just be patient. Go where ever you have to in order to assure that the best people possible are responsible for your care. Make your decision and don't look back...you can't change what happened in the past anyway. And I hope none of you find out what bony metastases feels like. Peace.....out. mkane09",
