My CT scans and Chest Xrays turned out to be clear. Ditigal rectal exam showed nothing. His advise was also surgery. He said that I am too young for most other options and that it was better to work for a cure. Not something I will still have to worry about later. I am going Thursday 9/13 for my pre op consolt.
