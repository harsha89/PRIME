      "Content": "Thanks Jim. While I have had two other cancers in the past, this one seems to have more options and more controversy about treatment. To your point, the Prostate is certainly the key focus, and either surgery or radiation is called for. As I understand it, if the surgeon were to find cancer in the lymph node, he would not proceed any further - as surgery has not been shown to be effective if the cancer is at that stage. While involvement of the lymph node is not a high probability, given my PSA and Gleason score, it is a distinct possibility (particularly since I also have a genetic condition that has been a factor in my various cancers). The oncologist would also want to know the status of the lymph node before proceeding as well. So...if I proceed with surgery, my question is mute. It is actually to see if anyone has had experience with having a separate surgical procedure to biopsy the node, as a precursor to radiation. Thanks again, Don",
