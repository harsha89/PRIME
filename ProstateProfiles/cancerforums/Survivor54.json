      "Content": "Hi, I was the 1st person to be prescribed Erleada in the great state of South Carolina. Quick background, I\u2019m 54 YO, I was diagnosed with Gleason 9 P.C., had RP surgery Sept. 2017 followed by Firmagon and salvage Rad, despite all that, PSA doubling rate was approximately 30 days, by mid-Feb 2018 the scans showed a hard tumor growing in my pubic bone. I was in pretty bad shape at the time and despite being metastatic, my doc prescribed Erleada (which is only approved for non-metastatic). Been taking it since mid-March, and today I\u2019m considered to be in \u201cnear complete remission\u201d. The side effects are many, in fact I threw up the first day, and I get a red rash on random areas of my body. My scalp is really dry and hair slowly falling out, fatigue and occasionally I get dizzy...but not bad. Other than the cancer, im in great shape and diet and exercise have really helped. I consider Erleada a miracle drug, well worth the side effects. I\u2019ve also been told that if I stop taking it, the cancer will come out of remission within 2 weeks... so I\u2019ll just keep taking it and deal with the unpleasant effects",

They usually refuse to cover drugs that are being used off-label...Especially $10,000 / month drugs....OOps, I forgot, maybe you are self-insured... Yes, my insurance is covering it 100%. It took about 3 weeks to get it approved though. Also, no local pharmacy has it...my Erleada comes by mail from CVS Specialty",
