      "Content": "Got it, that's what I thought. Ok, not freaked out anymore, I have it resolved in my head now. I have learned a couple of things about incontinence that may be helpful to some people, even though it's probably already common knowledge. #1 let the gas pass naturally, do not force for dramatic effect around your guy friends! #2 If you drink Coffee you will pay the price! I have not drank Alcohol yet but my guess is same as Coffee. #3 Try not to drink water after 7pm, it helps me stay dry all night and minimize waking up to go to the bathroom. #4 Sneezing and Hard coughing can cause some inadvertent dripping. #5 In my case trying to hold the pee in, if I have the urge to go, does not work very well. Thanks everyone!",

      "Content": "Consult1, just out of curiosity, as you are a full 2 days my Senior (Procedure Speaking) when are you doing your first PSA follow-up? Just an FYI, i just have a Little spurt during the day probably about 10 times and it is 80% when I make a sudden movement or force gas, stand up quickly. its literally only a drop or 2 at a time. As I really don't have anything to compare to at this point, I felt that it wasn't too bad, I literally take about 8 or so sheets of toilet paper and wrap it around my Johnson and then pull up my tighty whities and that keeps everything in place. I will replace it after I have felt a couple of little dribbles and my tighty whities have not gotten wet so far. I will try this for a few days and let you know if it is still working for me on the level of incontinence that I am currently experiencing. I am starting 2 mile a day walk this evening and my Kagels before bedtime. Yeah, I think I am going to wait a bit on the bio feedback as I do Yoga and I know how to center my core and have my breathing down fairly well. Plus oddly enough my blood pressure is about the same no matter what I am feeling like 120/80 90% of the time, it was even right around that at my pre-op. So I don't feel that any incontinence that I have is stress related, at least if it is I believe it to be minimal. I have pretty good insurance so money out of my pocket, so far has been extremely limited (Touch Wood )",

      "Content": "My Urologist has recommended that I take Bio-Feedback to help my Urinary Incontinence. One thing that concerns me is that I don't want to get on the Dr Merry-Go-Round system as my late Father had Alzheimer's and it was unbelievable what they kept doing for him that was totally not needed, so that tends to filter my thinking a lot. Has anyone done Bio-Feedback? If so did you have good results. My Urologist never even brought up anything about muscle exercises, I have only learned about it from this site and doing a little searching on Google. Any good websites to learn the proper exercises and the proper way to do them? I have stopped using the pads and depends today and just use a napkin around my genital area, working very well so far. I will continue to wear the Pads and depends at night just in case of an accident. Thanks, Al",

      "Content": "Had my Robotic Sugery 9-27-2017. 1st PSA test after surgery (about 2.5 months post surgery date) was 0 but due to the positive margin of less than 3mm, my Urologist wanted me to see a Radiologist, which I did today. He has given me the option of just waiting it out for the next PSA or starting the 7 week treatments asap. I understand the urgency of treatment if some of the cancer is left due to the positive margin but is it really wise to start that this early? I did have nerve sparing Robotic but the Radiologist told me that if I wasn't having any erections yet that I would probably never have a natural erection again if I do the Radiation Therapy. I mean if it was between a good long life or getting natural erections, I would go with the good long life scenario as sex does not mean as much to me anymore. I am confused at this point and would love to hear some feed back. Thanks, Al",

      "Content": "Had my Robotic Sugery 9-27-2017. 1st PSA test after surgery (about 2.5 months post surgery date) was 0 but due to the positive margin of less than 3mm, my Urologist wanted me to see a Radiologist, which I did today. He has given me the option of just waiting it out for the next PSA or starting the 7 week treatments asap. I understand the urgency of treatment if some of the cancer is left due to the positive margin but is it really wise to start that this early? I did have nerve sparing Robotic but the Radiologist told me that if I wasn't having any erections yet that I would probably never have a natural erection again if I do the Radiation Therapy. I mean if it was between a good long life or getting natural erections, I would go with the good long life scenario as sex does not mean as much to me anymore. I am confused at this point and would love to hear some feed back. Thanks, Al",

From what I am hearing if I get radiation then my incontinence will stay the same the rest of my life or potentially worsen.

      "Content": "Hi everyone, my name is Al, I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer about 10 days ago. I was told by my Urologist after a Biopsy that I had Prostate cancer but early stages and \"100%\" curable. So at first I was not super concerned but as I have now completed an appointment with a Radiation Dr, I realize it is not as simple as that and subsequently my anxiety has increased. More so because, my Urologist made it seem like it was just like having a tooth removed. The only difference was what method I was going to use. I don't have my file on my Biopsy until I pick it up in a few days so I can not give my exact numbers yet. I am really upset with my Urologist as when I talked to the Radiation Doctor he asked me if I had the post Biopsy talk with my Urologist and I said yes, it was about 4 minutes long, he never told me my Gleeson score, only my 2 options, Radiation and Prostate removal. He actually never even did a Digital Examination before the Biopsy and my Radiologist was shocked! Not only that but 2 days after my Biopsy I got an infection and had Sepsis. Hospital stay for 5 days, thought I was dying. Massive convulsive shaking to where I couldn't breath, bed soaking sweats, but I came out of it. The attending physician said if I would have waited to come to the emergency room an extra 24-36 hours I would be dead as my organs were starting to shut down. Blood pressure at admittance was about 59/ 39 from what I remember. Not good. Anyway, this looked like a good support forum so I will now be posting regularly for help...I know I need it. Al",

      "Content": "I haven't posted for quite awhile, I just had my 1 year Post-Op Ultra Sensitive PSA results back, they came in at less than .02 Its been an interesting year, I am fully continent except when I drink alcohol, its like the o-ring gets a little loose, so I just wear a pad during those infrequent times. I have wet the bed during sleep once, actually recently, but I was in such a deep sleep that I wrote it off as the brain not functioning at a level that would wake me up. Still peeing like a firehose! Erections not really there but kinda gets semi-firm occaisionally, will be working on that with my URO as I did have a nerve sparing procedure. I almost feel like I am bragging here, but that is not my intention. My original prognosis was good but not great. Gleason 4-3. And I did have a small positive margin which caused a little bit of worry. I just wanted to share that being diagnosed with PC is something that I never thought would happen to me and finding this board was instrumental in helping me understand and get the support that I needed. For all men that find themselves as a \"Newbie\", I would just like to say come here often. This Forum is absolutely fantastic. Thank you all for your kindness and advice, Al",

I haven't contributed much to this forum, so the least I can do is post now and then with my results and issues. If it even helps 1 person understand that being diagnosed with PC does not mean a death sentance and there are plenty of us out there that have gone through a lot of issues and have come out of it ok then I feel good about that. My best advice to anyone diagnosed with PC is stay on this forum, post questions, don't be shy as there are a lot of members here that know what they are talking about and are more than willing to help you as best they can.

      "Content": "Just wanted to up-date, after about 10 mind bending days on the internet trying to educate myself on my Prostate Cancer, I stopped. The endless mind chatter that was going on in my head was driving me nuts and was increasing my anxiety and bad mood. (Just Ask My Wife) on second thought don't! Anyway, my final appointment is with my Urologist this coming Monday and I have decided to go with removal at this point instead of radiation, and still not sure what type of removal he will be performing yet as I have not asked him. Will be discussing that at the appointment. Radiation kind of through me off due to the fact that once done if the cancer came back, my prostate could not be removed and more radiation could be needed. I do realize that also could be true with removal. Both my Radiologist and my Urologist have not been pressuring me at all and both have said either way will be effective in treating me. Even though I have done my research and this board has been helpful!!!!!!!!!!! I still kind of feel like after all of this I am still throwing a dart at a dartboard after all and hoping to hit a bulls-eye. I guess that is normal but you can only do so much before you have to make a decision and then you have to go for it. My Urologist has performed over 1200 procedures so all I can say is that I hope he hasn't become too complacent. I will follow-up here after my surgery. Thank you everyone! Al",

      "Content": "Just wanted to up-date, after about 10 mind bending days on the internet trying to educate myself on my Prostate Cancer, I stopped. The endless mind chatter that was going on in my head was driving me nuts and was increasing my anxiety and bad mood. (Just Ask My Wife) on second thought don't! Anyway, my final appointment is with my Urologist this coming Monday and I have decided to go with removal at this point instead of radiation, and still not sure what type of removal he will be performing yet as I have not asked him. Will be discussing that at the appointment. Radiation kind of through me off due to the fact that once done if the cancer came back, my prostate could not be removed and more radiation could be needed. I do realize that also could be true with removal. Both my Radiologist and my Urologist have not been pressuring me at all and both have said either way will be effective in treating me. Even though I have done my research and this board has been helpful!!!!!!!!!!! I still kind of feel like after all of this I am still throwing a dart at a dartboard after all and hoping to hit a bulls-eye. I guess that is normal but you can only do so much before you have to make a decision and then you have to go for it. My Urologist has performed over 1200 procedures so all I can say is that I hope he hasn't become too complacent. I will follow-up here after my surgery. Thank you everyone! Al",

In my Big Boy Diapers, have felt a couple of little dribbles over the last 4 hours but I have been doing a lot of stuff and drinking a lot of water. Everything came out negative on my pathology report except the Dr thought everything was contained with-in the Prostate but the report said there was a real small area on one of the tumors that had shown up under the section called \"Margins\", it said, Margins: Involved By Invasive Carcinoma Margin Limitations: Limited ( Less Than 3 mm ) Location Of Positive Margin: Right Posterior My Doctor kinda scrunched up his face a little, I noticed he does that when he is thinking. He said it is probably nothing to worry about (yeah right) but some time with-in the next couple of months I should see my Radiologist just to get his input. I told him give me the referral now, why wait! So, is this bad news or good news overall with a little issue that needs to be kept track of. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "Thanks DjinTonic, I felt pretty positive going into my Dr's appointment to discuss the Pathology Report, I was the pitcher in a play-off game, it was in the bottom of the 9th inning, I had 2 outs and that last guy before my No-Hitter, hits a single up the middle! That's the way it felt. I got a bad head cold on Friday, so I went to bed for 5 hours and woke up, no pee on the pad, hmmm? I slept 10 hours last night, up to pee twice, woke up this morning and no pee on the pad! I am hoping this is a good sign but not getting my hopes up to high. The only time I have had leakage is if I try and force passing gas. I have gathered myself back up this morning and have put my positive helmet back on. I am curious though, before I see my Radiologist, if there is a less than 3mm part of the tumor on the outside of my prostate how does that cause an issue, does it mean there may be Cancer cells in the area that my prostate was or was that part of the prostate touching something else that now may have the Cancer, this is the part that is confusing to me. Also, should I need radiation therapy in the future, how do they tell where to radiate, does it have to grow big enough for them to begin treatment? Any thoughts or answers would be appreciated.",

I had 11 lymph nodes removed all were negative. I am really exhausted and will add all the path report info to my signature tomorrow. Tonight should be interesting as I will stop drinking fluids at 8 pm and I am curious how my bladder holds up this evening. So far, everything has been very minor but I have been conscious throughout. Tomorrow I plan on looking at some porno pics and see if I can set the world record for shortest penis erection time after Mr Roboto. That's erection time, not shortest penis. (snicker)",

      "Content": "Thank you caddy2507 Great results for you!!!!! Congrats! I do have a couple more questions for the community. I have been doing my Kegals and I am a little over 2 months now since my surgery. I am still at about 1 pad per day but for the most part I am almost totally dry while I am asleep. It seems that when I am horizontal, I don't have much problem at all. Only 1 time that I was pretty soaked when I woke up. and only 2 times that I actually had leakage beyond what the pad could absorb during the day, wetting my shorts. I can't tell if I am doing good or not as it seems to be that there has not been much change in the last 2 months. I believe over time that I will be able to get full continence back, I just don't seem to see any difference in the last 2 months. I only have to wake up to pee at night maybe 1 time, occasionally twice. When I do pee in the toilet it isn't like a stream, its more like a gusher, I mean I empty totally in about 2 to 3 seconds. Is all this normal? In other words am I doing good or bad in this regard? Al",

Doctor said that I could try none intercourse sex with my wife, which I have done twice. Really wasn't that great but really had no expectations. I have noticed 2 things that have happened since and thought I would post here before calling the Dr. I am feeling a constant tingly feeling in my Penis, its really hard to explain what the feeling actually is, it doesn't hurt so much, just sort of irritating. The other thing that I noticed is that when I pee, the water in the toilet gets some sudsy bubbles on the top, its like there is a small amount of soap in the toilet but there really isn't. One last thing, I am feeling constantly like I have to pee, even if its only a dribble that comes out. Am I just being mental or is this normal? Al",

      "Content": "Consult1, I just noticed you are ahead of me by 2 days on your procedure. Pretty interesting stuff huh? When I was in pre-op, I met the Anesthesiologist, who I called Dr Feel Good. Just seconds before they wheeled me off to the surgery room he looked at me and said, I am just going to give you a little something to \"take the edge off\" I said, that sounds good not realizing he was actually starting to put me under, I guess they don't have you count backwards from 100 anymore, I remember thinking as they wheeled me into the actual surgery room that this seems odd, I felt like I was in a garage, with garage type tools and workbenches and boxed stuff. The funny thing is, I wasn't concerned, my last thought was I guess they know what they are doing. One thing I have learned from all this, that I would like to pass on to anyone that would like to know my thoughts. Don't overthink things, by all means, do your research, get the proper tests done, talk to other people that have already been there/done that. Talk to your family and friends and once you decide to go the direction that you have chosen, don't look back, don't let negative thoughts derail you, try and look at it as a card that you were dealt in the game of life and you can't put it back in the deck. Just look up at everyone and smile, everything will be OK. This whole experience has changed my outlook dramatically, I don't feel like I am afraid of anything anymore. I hope that lasts!",

Pretty chipper mood but ugghh, the dull pain, its not bad its just there and I want to go sparingly on the drugs as I dont want to get constipated as I also have Diverticulosis. Doing pretty decent with my pee bag after the first episode by myself which was not bad if I say so myself. Just a drip from the outer end of the catheter as I am looking at it wondering why it is dripping...oh yeah, my bladder. Quick question, is 2 days without a bowel movement in the normal range and. Back to the pain, it really isn't that bad when I am still, its just when I am moving from 1 position to another, I am assuming that is normal also. Boy what an experience huh? One last thing, my surgery was last Wednesday morning at 8 am and I am scheduled to meet with my Urologist this coming up Tuesday at 12 noon, the Office manager set up the appointment, is that a little too early to get it out or should I just go with the flow and keep that appointment, no pun intended! A big thanks to everybody here that took the time to support me, only forum I have ever been on that was so supportive. You all have helped me more than you will ever know. I am very thankful. Al",

Just seconds before they wheeled me off to the surgery room he looked at me and said, I am just going to give you a little something to \"take the edge off\" I said, that sounds good not realizing he was actually starting to put me under, I guess they don't have you count backwards from 100 anymore, I remember thinking as they wheeled me into the actual surgery room that this seems odd, I felt like I was in a garage, with garage type tools and workbenches and boxed stuff. The funny thing is, I wasn't concerned, my last thought was I guess they know what they are doing. One thing I have learned from all this, that I would like to pass on to anyone that would like to know my thoughts. Don't overthink things, by all means, do your research, get the proper tests done, talk to other people that have already been there/done that. Talk to your family and friends and once you decide to go the direction that you have chosen, don't look back, don't let negative thoughts derail you, try and look at it as a card that you were dealt in the game of life and you can't put it back in the deck. Just look up at everyone and smile, everything will be OK. This whole experience has changed my outlook dramatically, I don't feel like I am afraid of anything anymore. I hope that lasts!",

Pretty chipper mood but ugghh, the dull pain, its not bad its just there and I want to go sparingly on the drugs as I dont want to get constipated as I also have Diverticulosis. Doing pretty decent with my pee bag after the first episode by myself which was not bad if I say so myself. Just a drip from the outer end of the catheter as I am looking at it wondering why it is dripping...oh yeah, my bladder. Quick question, is 2 days without a bowel movement in the normal range and. Back to the pain, it really isn't that bad when I am still, its just when I am moving from 1 position to another, I am assuming that is normal also. Boy what an experience huh? One last thing, my surgery was last Wednesday morning at 8 am and I am scheduled to meet with my Urologist this coming up Tuesday at 12 noon, the Office manager set up the appointment, is that a little too early to get it out or should I just go with the flow and keep that appointment, no pun intended! A big thanks to everybody here that took the time to support me, only forum I have ever been on that was so supportive. You all have helped me more than you will ever know. I am very thankful. Al",

      "Content": "Thanks ASAdvocate, HighlanderCFH & MichiganMan16 . Still confusing, I have done the Sloan Kettering Nanogram. So I do understand where I stand as far as my survive-ability stats. According to my results I do have a pretty decent chance of Bio-Chemical Recurrence, but should I have to have SRT because I start getting a rising PSA, my chances of survive-ability at 15 years is 98%. Which is pretty good. In Vegas, I would bet a lot of money on those odds, plus that actually puts me in a position of out living the medium death age of males which I believe is about 78 to 79 years old. Maybe I am not understanding the technical aspects but how can there be any pertinent data on SRT that is done without any indications of a bio-chemical recurrence as the the wild card is that there is none, there-fore it worked. Plus, what if the SRT caused other issues that will be an issue that I would have to deal with like bowel incontinence. My father-in-law had that and it was pretty ugly. My gut is to slow down and keep monitoring my PSA every 2 months for the next 2 years and then take action as needed. I feel like being over analytical on my behalf may be worse than focusing on utilizing my current overall health and enjoying life as I want to. Here's a crazy thought that I have been dealing with lately, am I more afraid of dying or am I more afraid of not living my life to the potential that I set for myself, part of that potential is the negative aspect of over analyzing my current situation and dwelling on it, which seems likely to interfere with my mental state of mind and the ability to enjoy things that I am doing. In other words, my worrying is over-powering my enjoyment of the present moment. I think my answer to my friends and family will simply be, I don't know the answer to your questions, I am not worried, lets go have a beer! Sorry for the ramble, I am known for it! If you are expecting a cohesive statement from me, it never happens, I just react and blurt things out.",

That's good news of course, but I realize that it has not been that long since my post-op PSA and my Da Vinci surgery (9-27-2017). Considering that the Prostate is so small, there certainly is a lot of info out there pertaining to Cancer that I have a hard time digesting and really understanding how my current status is. I mean, the Prostate is small, so when they take it out, what is left behind? Is it a true empty space held open by who knows what or has all the other stuff that was surrounding my prostate now collapsed inward so that there is no space left? As I had a small margin on the Prostate pathology results, does that mean that should some cells have sloughed off and don't die off, where are they, do they attach to other organs. I am not obsessing about this, I just find it awkward trying to explain this to a friend or family member that asks, when I really don't know. Also, from what I have read it seems it is important to jump on a rise in PSA and its speed in rising so that Salvage Radiation has a better chance of getting the Cancer. I don't seem to get that part either. Can anyone explain this so a simpleton like me can understand or point me to an article that is made for someone that isn't a medical doctor. I do feel pretty good though, incontinence is improving greatly, the only thing is that I do tend to tire pretty quickly and am not certain if its old age catching up with me (just turned 66) or still a possible side effect of the surgery. Been following the forum but not posting much as there are others much more knowledgeable about Prostate Cancer on this forum. Thanks everyone! Al",

Also, from what I have read it seems it is important to jump on a rise in PSA and its speed in rising so that Salvage Radiation has a better chance of getting the Cancer. I don't seem to get that part either. Can anyone explain this so a simpleton like me can understand or point me to an article that is made for someone that isn't a medical doctor. I do feel pretty good though, incontinence is improving greatly, the only thing is that I do tend to tire pretty quickly and am not certain if its old age catching up with me (just turned 66) or still a possible side effect of the surgery. Been following the forum but not posting much as there are others much more knowledgeable about Prostate Cancer on this forum. Thanks everyone! Al",

      "Content": "Thanks ASAdvocate, HighlanderCFH & MichiganMan16 . Still confusing, I have done the Sloan Kettering Nanogram. So I do understand where I stand as far as my survive-ability stats. According to my results I do have a pretty decent chance of Bio-Chemical Recurrence, but should I have to have SRT because I start getting a rising PSA, my chances of survive-ability at 15 years is 98%. Which is pretty good. In Vegas, I would bet a lot of money on those odds, plus that actually puts me in a position of out living the medium death age of males which I believe is about 78 to 79 years old. Maybe I am not understanding the technical aspects but how can there be any pertinent data on SRT that is done without any indications of a bio-chemical recurrence as the the wild card is that there is none, there-fore it worked. Plus, what if the SRT caused other issues that will be an issue that I would have to deal with like bowel incontinence. My father-in-law had that and it was pretty ugly. My gut is to slow down and keep monitoring my PSA every 2 months for the next 2 years and then take action as needed. I feel like being over analytical on my behalf may be worse than focusing on utilizing my current overall health and enjoying life as I want to. Here's a crazy thought that I have been dealing with lately, am I more afraid of dying or am I more afraid of not living my life to the potential that I set for myself, part of that potential is the negative aspect of over analyzing my current situation and dwelling on it, which seems likely to interfere with my mental state of mind and the ability to enjoy things that I am doing. In other words, my worrying is over-powering my enjoyment of the present moment. I think my answer to my friends and family will simply be, I don't know the answer to your questions, I am not worried, lets go have a beer! Sorry for the ramble, I am known for it! If you are expecting a cohesive statement from me, it never happens, I just react and blurt things out.",

Will be discussing that at the appointment....Came in at 0-00, that's a big zero! Whew, because of my previous numbers, my Dr wants me to see my Radiation Dr, just to be sure that I get educated in case I have a Bio-Chemical re-occurrence down the line, I did the Sloan-Kettering Calcs and it is fairly likely that I may have to have some sort of radiation in my future but right now its one hurdle at a time....(Just Ask My Wife) on second thought don't! Anyway, my final appointment is with my Urologist this coming Monday and I have decided to go with removal at this point instead of radiation, and still not sure what type of removal he will be performing yet as I have not asked him....So at first I was not super concerned but as I have now completed an appointment with a Radiation Dr, I realize it is not as simple as that and subsequently my anxiety has increased. More so because, my Urologist made it seem like it was just like having a tooth removed....I understand the urgency of treatment if some of the cancer is left due to the positive margin but is it really wise to start that this early? I did have nerve sparing Robotic but the Radiologist told me that if I wasn't having any erections yet that I would probably never have a natural erection again if I do the Radiation Therapy....From what I am hearing if I get radiation then my incontinence will stay the same the rest of my life or potentially worsen. I understand that prompt treatment is preferred but am I putting my self in danger by waiting a few more months?...Radiation kind of through me off due to the fact that once done if the cancer came back, my prostate could not be removed and more radiation could be needed. I do realize that also could be true with removal....Will be discussing that at the appointment. Radiation kind of through me off due to the fact that once done if the cancer came back, my prostate could not be removed and more radiation could be needed....",
