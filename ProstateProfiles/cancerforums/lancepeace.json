You might consider other blood tests such as Free PSA (higher is better.) or PCA3. Also the Digital Rectal Exam may find nodules on prostate, if there are any. Another option to consider later is a biopsy where spring loaded needles are shot into the prostate through the rectum. (It stung a bit in my case.Outpatient test.) It is unlikely that headache is related. An important factor is your age. What is it? Anyway good luck on any further testing.",

      "Content": "Welcome. You have very informed questions to ask, but might be beyond the knowledge or interest of some urologists. Also many appointments are 15 minutes or less. If you are seeking the most sophisticated urologist, you might just skip the local uro and go to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore or some other major center. Most local urologists do 12 core biopsies after an ultrasound. A nice thing about the local uro was that I could hand carry my records and biopsy slides to another doctor for 2nd opinion. My urologist did not have anyone call to tell me I had cancer, I was told on a followup 2 weeks later. Good luck.",

I can't speak for Kaiser but urologists schedule biopsies as outpatient procedures and they are somewhat unpleasant. So you would not get a biopsy at the first urologist appointment. Nothing is likely to happen real fast to you. IF you did have prostate cancer, you are very likely to live for many years.",

Most local urologists do 12 core biopsies after an ultrasound. A nice thing about the local uro was that I could hand carry my records and biopsy slides to another doctor for 2nd opinion. My urologist did not have anyone call to tell me I had cancer, I was told on a followup 2 weeks later. Good luck.",

You might consider other blood tests such as Free PSA (higher is better.) or PCA3. Also the Digital Rectal Exam may find nodules on prostate, if there are any. Another option to consider later is a biopsy where spring loaded needles are shot into the prostate through the rectum. (It stung a bit in my case.Outpatient test.) It is unlikely that headache is related. An important factor is your age. What is it? Anyway good luck on any further testing.",

I can't speak for Kaiser but urologists schedule biopsies as outpatient procedures and they are somewhat unpleasant. So you would not get a biopsy at the first urologist appointment. Nothing is likely to happen real fast to you. IF you did have prostate cancer, you are very likely to live for many years.",

Another option is Focal Ablation where they try to ablate the tiny tumor and leave the rest of prostate alone. Focal Ablation is only done in a limited number of centers in the USA. Hormone Therapy, including estrogen DES, is not considered a cure. Adding ADT to Active Surveillance would be an unusual path. You might want to see the videos from Dr. Charles Meyers on Wordpress.

If he has more extensive Gleason 6 he may be facing treatment. Radiation and surgery are the main treatments. The urologist will probably offer treatment suggestions. Does this urologist do surgeries? Does he recommend a radiation oncologist? Is Active Surveillance possible? Can the patient obtain biopsy slides for 2nd opinion? Good luck with the pathology report that will clarify the options.",

And sometimes the PSA does not move in a straight line after radiation at first. If .2 is your nadir, than 2.2 might be recurrence.Sometimes it does require interpretation. For example, your nadir might have been influenced by the hormone injection. The doubling time is important if it continues since PSA will hit new heights in the future sooner. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I don't think you need to be too concerned. The doctor sounds reasonable. Low free PSA can be bad, if I remember, and yours is not low. Normal and Abnormal Percent-Free PSA Typically, men have a percent-free PSA above 25%. Between 10% and 25% is considered an intermediate range and below 10% is considered to be low. However, a low percent-free PSA, even coupled with a high absolute PSA level (the raw number that you were told is your PSA number), does not necessarily mean you have prostate cancer. Only a biopsy can definitively diagnose prostate cancer. The digital rectal exam, DRE, can feel nodules on the prostate. You could try an antibiotic to see how that affects PSA. I'm thinking your PSA is not that alarming. You might track it periodically to see how it progresses, like on a graph, over time. There is also a new prostate blood test just developed that is more conclusive: Prostate Health Index (phi) Prostate cancer is often slow growing and affects older men the most. Good luck.",

But I'm doing pretty well now so overall, it worked out. Aftercare might vary by doctor. I had to wait 6 weeks for treatment by the doctor I saw who went on vacation. I would also mention Johns Hopkins which is highly rated on the East Coast. You could do surgery or radiation . After treatment, the cancer prognosis likely would be good. Side effects vary. Best wishes.",

Early treatment will tend to keep PSA low in the short term. If it were me, I would take it sooner. Saw a recent link that Quinine may extend the period that HT is effective. I think I read 2 years is average effect but that varies a lot. Estrogen may minimize side effects of HT. Some patients have taken estrogen instead of Lupron or other injections. That's all I know.

Some experts diagnosis recurrence as nadir PSA +2 , the lowest PSA rising by 2. Some patients respond to hormone therapy such as Lupron for years. It varies a lot. Provenge is an excellent medicine. The sooner it is used, the more effective it will be in extending life. Medicare covers it I believe. The low extension of life in studies was due to the fact that the men in the studies were in later stages of the disease. Good luck to you and your father.",

Typically they would take Lupron or a similar treatment to lower testosterone. This is given by injection.

There are also some other treatments such as Provenge immunotherapy , Zytiga, Xtandi and chemo. Some of these are super expensive in USA. Good luck to you both.",

Typically they would take Lupron or a similar treatment to lower testosterone. This is given by injection. Life expectancy might depend on how the person responds to low testosterone environment from the injections. It varies. There are also some other treatments such as Provenge immunotherapy , Zytiga, Xtandi and chemo. Some of these are super expensive in USA. Good luck to you both.",

A wait of 6-10 weeks after biopsy is not unusual before treatment begins. Cancer sometimes escapes before treatment, scans can sometimes detect but not always. If you get a second opinion they will need his urological medical records and probably biopsy slides so that might be something you may have to collect. Long term survival is good after treatment and new treatments are coming. Good luck.",

The Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to the drug, to be sold under the brand name Zytiga, nearly two month earlier than expected. Zytiga, known chemically as abiraterone, extended the lives of patients with advanced prostate cancer by an average of four months in a pivotal clinical trial. \"Zytiga prolonged the lives of men with late-stage prostate cancer who had received prior treatments and had few available therapeutic options,\" Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Office of Oncology, said in a statement.

      "Content": "UPDATE 1-FDA approves J&J advanced prostate cancer drug * To be sold under brand name Zytiga * Prolonged survival by 4 months in pivotal trial - U.S. health regulators on Thursday approved a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) drug for advanced prostate cancer considered one of the most important medicines that the company had been developing. The Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to the drug, to be sold under the brand name Zytiga, nearly two month earlier than expected. Zytiga, known chemically as abiraterone, extended the lives of patients with advanced prostate cancer by an average of four months in a pivotal clinical trial. \"Zytiga prolonged the lives of men with late-stage prostate cancer who had received prior treatments and had few available therapeutic options,\" Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the FDA's Office of Oncology, said in a statement.

You might want to obtain a copy of his biopsy report , PSA and any scans completed just in case he receives treatment someplace out of town or in case a 2nd opinion is sought. A 2nd opinion would require his records. My 2nd opinion required the biopsy slides / core samples as well. MD Anderson is a huge cancer place in Texas and as mentioned might be considered. With bone mets he is likely to need hormone therapy / androgen deprivation therapy in the future. Good luck to both of you.",

Provenge is an expensive vaccine product the Medicare might pay for. Keto is a fungal med that some patients take and might help some . Enzalutamide / MDV3100 is pending approval and works on hormone receptors. Cabozantinib / XL184 is pending for thyroid cancer and helps with bone condition. Prostvac vaccine is in trials. There are a lot of medicines and therapies being tested and I hope one of them helps him. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Welcome. Are you from the USA? An enlarged prostate can raise PSA somewhat. Benign prostate tissue generates some PSA. And cancer can generate higher PSA. There is controversy about PSA tests. I think you should get one to have a base number. An extremely high PSA might be a marker for prostate cancer as well. There is another blood test called a Free PSA that can be informative (higher is better on the Free PSA test.) An enlarged prostate is not a sign of cancer and is often benign. Some people with enlarged prostates need TURP procedures to enlarge the channel to the bladder. Anyway good luck on your condition.",

There was a recent trial called Chaarted that showed the survival benefit of Hormone Therapy added to chemo in patients who were still hormone sensitive. Your father could try docetaxel and drop it if it was too unpleasant. Docetaxel chemo is not supposed to be bad for side effects. There are also clinical trials. Living 15+ years with high risk prostate cancer is an achievement. I hope you find a treatment that helps.

There are a lot of new medicines, approved and in the pipeline which can slow the cancer. Doctors vary on the use of early hormone therapy.

There is a good short introductory book by dr sheldon marks. A longer book by dr peter scardino and a real long book by dr. patrick walsh. The cancer you describe might take 15 years or more to cause death, so there is no rush to make a decision or decide. It does vary though. Assuming there was no nodule felt on prostate, you might be stage T1C. You want to know the size of the prostate and might obtain a copy of biopsy report. Good luck to you. P.S. The PSA doubling time and PSA density can be informative to a decison.",

      "Content": "Welcome. Sounds like a fairly mild diagnosis for cancer. Options are Active Surveilance (which can change later), surgery or radiation.. There is a good short introductory book by dr sheldon marks. A longer book by dr peter scardino and a real long book by dr. patrick walsh. The cancer you describe might take 15 years or more to cause death, so there is no rush to make a decision or decide. It does vary though. Assuming there was no nodule felt on prostate, you might be stage T1C. You want to know the size of the prostate and might obtain a copy of biopsy report. Good luck to you. P.S. The PSA doubling time and PSA density can be informative to a decison.",

Michael Milken is surviving a long time with the aid of a personal chef to cook a strict diet regimen. Some studies have shown a benefit to a vegan diet. Some trials are looking at the benefit of the medicine metformin which I take. You can look at diet, supplements and clinical trials in addition to the new super expensive meds.

      "Content": "In USA patients might get Casodex instead of Flutamide. The castration causes low testosterone and patients vary on that.Some respond for 6 months to low testosterone and some respond for years. Once the PSA starts rising after castration, then they are castration resistant and that is bad. I have read of cases where PSA rises with low testosterone and the patient responded to patches or pills containing estrogen plus a steroid dexamethasone. I hope your father's PSA is stable for a long time after the castration. Good luck.",

If HT fails, then he would qualify for newer medicines and clinical trials. So HT is usually a prerequisite for other treatments, if needed. Once PSA is high, the wholistic stuff might not help that much. I'm trying for vegan diet and take supplements, but my PSA is low so far. How old is he? Good luck to you both.",

The kind of cancer diagnosed might take 20 or more years to get you. If ever. There is also Targeted Focal Therapy available at a few sites using laser or freezing. There is a clincial trial called NX-1207 which uses an injection for early cancer. Active Surveilance could be dropped later. Besides testing , AS can include diet and a few supplements. Early clinical trials suggest that a strict diet might retard the cancer even more. Also to consider is that there might be more effective treatments 5 years from now. There is no rush to decide what to do. Good luck to you.",

The kind of cancer diagnosed might take 20 or more years to get you. If ever. There is also Targeted Focal Therapy available at a few sites using laser or freezing. There is a clincial trial called NX-1207 which uses an injection for early cancer. Active Surveilance could be dropped later. Besides testing , AS can include diet and a few supplements. Early clinical trials suggest that a strict diet might retard the cancer even more. Also to consider is that there might be more effective treatments 5 years from now. There is no rush to decide what to do. Good luck to you.",

If you do choose radiation, it should be from a major center using state of the art equipment. There is no rush to make a decision. You could get a second opinion on pathology slides. Or if you consult with Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic, they will want to see the slides anyway. A consult will require your medical records. Good luck.",

Yes, a free PSA test would be helpful. What was your PSA number? That is something you should know. Prostate cancer takes many years to develop and is often slow growing, but not always.

His sons should get the PSA blood test periodically as they grow older. There are clinical trials but they exclude many patients and often require travel.

Surgery might be most curative but might have more side effects involving continence and ED. It varies on these. Radiation includes beam radiation over maybe 40 days. Or seed radiation in a 1 day procedure. Less common treatments are HIFU and cryo. Active surveilance is used by some but your PSA might not be appropriate. The decision is quite difficult. You should live a long time if treated. The 10 year cure rate is high. Good luck.",

Sometimes works for months and sometimes for many years. Salvage radiation I believe you have declined. Keto and leukine are other options after ADT. Chemo (poisons) are sometimes tried after ADT has failed to work any longer. One vaccine approved (Provenge) for castration refractory PC. Two other expensive treatments approved for CRPC (maybe after chemo.) Some people are also using diet and supplements to augment treatment.

If you choose surgery, a very experienced surgeon is recommended. Surgery allows examination of the tissue by a pathologist which is an advantage over radiation. The more modern radiation procedures have good rates of cure or control at 10 years out. Seed, IGRT, LINAC, SBRT, IMRT and proton are options. You are likely to live 10 years without treatment I was told with similar or worse stats. So there is no rush to receive treatment. Good luck.",

It might have been better to have those blood tests instead. Many cancer patients find out about their cancer with biopsy's. My own biopsy was unpleasant but discovered my prostate cancer. Because of later treatment, I will live longer. So I would try to keep biopsy's in perspective. Hopefully some day soon there will be a better way. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hello. If you monitor your prostate health you are less likely to be diagnosed with any late-stage cancer. Diagnosis at an early stage has a good prognosis. Besides PSA there is a free PSA blood test. A newer test is the PHI test which is promising for detection. I would recommend reading the book \"Anticancer\". A vegan diet with a few supplements might delay or mitigate any cancer that might eventually develop. There was a clinical trial by Dr. Dean Ornish using a vegan diet plus some supplements. The program slowed the progress of the cancer. The diabetes med metformin is being studied for its effect of slowing or preventing some cancers including prostate cancer. Ten years from now they will very likely have much more effective treatments than they do now. Good luck.",

I had complications from treatment and another doctor did not return my email directly to him at major hospital. What you are experiencing is very common. If you can obtain the biopsy report, that probably will be sufficient to research. Non-emergency communications are usually through office appointments. Some major centers have a system that takes weeks to obtain medical records from a 3rd party. (The higher the expectations, the more llikely we are to be disappointed.) Good luck.",

Undetectable sometimes means less than .04 but the definition varies a little. You should be receiving a pretty sensitive PSA test. If the PSA is barely detectable but doesn't move than that might be OK for now. (I misread this and thought you were seeing a urologist.) Am thinking that tracking the PSA is often the main focus to gauge success of treatment. If PSA is significantly detectable then a treatment plan might be on the table.Good luck to you.",

Hopefully, his PSA would go down after castration. If his PSA is going up after castration, then he would have castration resistant prostate cancer. Which means the cancer cells would grow independent of male hormones. You should ask what kind of chemotherapy they have in mind. I hope the castration works for a long time. Good luck.",

I think I had a 10 day wait for my biopsy and then had to wait 13 days to find out that I had prostate cancer because they did not call me. Anyway, it might be worth calling around. They often make patients wait for a while after a biopsy to perform surgery if that is what is chosen. Good luck.",

I'm guessing that hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy) might be a main treatment. Radiation concurrent with the hormone therapy might be added. Patients often live for quite a few years with these treatments. Good luck finding the best treatment.",

I'm guessing that hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy) might be a main treatment. Radiation concurrent with the hormone therapy might be added. Patients often live for quite a few years with these treatments. Good luck finding the best treatment.",

      "Content": "Welcome Tim. Sorry for the diagnosis. With a PSA over 100, surgery would not cure and can cause a lot of side effects. I'm guessing that hormone therapy (androgen deprivation therapy) might be a main treatment. Radiation concurrent with the hormone therapy might be added. Patients often live for quite a few years with these treatments. Good luck finding the best treatment.",

You want to read or at least confirm the number. If the PSA is actually 0.3, then you would be looking at Salvage Radiation in the near future. They radiate the prostate bed. I hope it was a mistake.

      "Content": "Welcome. First bear in mind that you have normal PSA. There is such a thing as prostate calcification but I'm not a doctor. I think I had a prostate stone on a CT scan. DRE feels for nodules on the prostate but are only one diagnostic tool of many. Large centers have MRI guided biopsy 's , smaller places just do biopsies usually on an outpatient basis. Prostate cancers are often slow growing. My urologist told me my prostate cancer would take 10 years to kill me if I did not get treatment. So there is no short term danger whatever your diagnosis. Scans some times pick up anomolies that later turn out to be insignificant. Good luck with urologist.",

Patients typically have high PSA with bone spread. They might also have pain. Some don't do scans until PSA is high. Hormone therapy to lower testosterone is one option. Some places use castration for that, some injections. In USA there are options of Provenge, Zytiga, Xtandi, etc. which are expensive. Buena suerte",

      "Content": "Welcome. Gleason 7 comes in two varieties, (3+4) and (4+3). The 2nd one is more aggressive. But Gleason 7 is not always terrible. Sometimes is sort of medium grade. Many of us would like to know the patient's age, PSA number and history, and the number of cores found with cancer. More details can help. Proton therapy may not be better than other radiation treatments. It sometimes is more expensive. He should have good health insurance if this is the treatment of choice. My Gleason number was 7 (3+4) and the doctor told me I might live 10 years without treatment so it is not always super aggressive. It does vary. With treatment he is likely to live for quite a while. Good luck to you both.",

I think you wrote that the lymph nodes were clear. That is a definite plus. It is hard to say what the outcome will be after radiation. The radiation itself might cause temporary proctitis. If the cancer has not spread very far, the radiation might cure. If the cancer is systemic, then the cancer will continue to exist. Microscopic metastasis can occur and be undetectable so it is difficult to predict a permanent cure. After radiation, your husband is likely to live for years in the worst case. The best case scenario is that he would live for quite a long time. Good luck.",

You could get that first or go directly to a urologist, who should be an expert on prostate health.

The scans will not find micrometastases so it is possible there could be tiny metastasis that won't show on scans. With a PSA of 56, someone is going to have to make a determination on the likelihood of spread outside the prostate bed. Sometimes there is no certainty with prostate cancer. Nomograms , some of which are on the internet, compute some odds using PSA, Gleason score, etc. Factors to consider are the patient's age, the size of the prostate, whether there are any urinary problems now.Some institutions use PET scans or MRI to help with the decision.

Surgery sometimes creates temp or perm urinary side effects as well as ED. Sometimes these can be severe but often improve with recovery. There is no emergency to decide right now on the treatment. Without treatment he will likely live for more than a decade. At age 40 he does have a long time for any cancer to grow without treatment. You have time to get a 2nd opinion which might include a radiation oncologist. 2nd opinions often require the collection of medical records possibly including pathology slides. Making a decision is difficult. Good luck. P.S. He should not need another biopsy since the biopsy slides contain tissue samples that can be examined.",

Some patients who are Gleason 6 defer treatment. Surgery and radiation are other options. I was a Gleason (3+4) 7 and the doctor told me I was likely to live 10 years if I got no treatment. Discomfort that long after the biopsy is unusual, hope it is not an infection. Good luck to you both.",

Other treatments are surgery, radiation, cryo / freezing, targeted focal therapy in just a few locations in USA, HIFU. There are a couple of injections for prostate cancer in trials.

Another option is Targeted Focal Therapy or Ablation were they only target the small tumor. It is only done at a few places in the USA. You could study the situation for a long time. A couple of important factors we should know are Prostate size and PSA history. Could you provide them? Surgery might make your urination better but 1-2% of the time patients lose some urinary control. Take your time before making a decision. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Welcome. The lab report from a pathologist listed the prostate size as 8 grams, 32.5 cc's. I don't know if that is the actual weight of prostate or the weight of the tissue removed during the TURP. A lot of patients find the prostate size through ultrasound done at the time of a biopsy. Would ask for clarification on that. The only negative I see is that PSA went up between Dec. 2011 and summer of 2012. PSA velocity is a factor in decision. You have no need to rush to any decison since you might live 20 years or more with this cancer. And they will be coming up with more effective treatments in the future. Active Surveilance involves periodic testing of PSA and biopsy's. It usually involves very healthy diet and some supplements. Some take metformin by prescription. Active Surveilance can be ended at any time there is a change. Good luck with your condition.",

      "Content": "I guess you are from the UK. It would have been better if they had done the biopsy and treatment quickly. However, it might not have made much difference. Your partner has probably had some prostate cancer growing for 30 years in his body. Am not sure if the operation had a chance to cure him. If he had the biopsy years ago it might have made a difference. Hormone therapy / androgen deprivation can sometimes seem to control the cancer for a while. Radiation therapy sometimes can cure if done early. So I'm guessing he is looking at hormone therapy and or salvage radiation. What was his PSA that brought him to a biopsy? What is his age? Anyway, I hope he responds to treatment and lives a long time. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hello, You should know PSA density, PSA divided by prostate size. A density under .12 is unlikely to kill a patient. Also number of positive scores and percent of cores in biopsy. Newer tests are mpMRI, 4k score, MI prostate score, etc. that have come out since Walsh book. AS has become more popular since the Walsh book, which was written by a man who does surgery. Most 67 year old men have prostate cancer in their body. Many of these cancers do not harm the individuals.Gleason 6 is unlikely to spread. If he has a small prostate and considerable cancer you might consider radiation.There is also focal ablation as a possibility. The more info we know, the better we can offer an opinion. Good luck.",

Many of us would like to know the patient's age, PSA number and history, and the number of cores found with cancer. More details can help. Proton therapy may not be better than other radiation treatments. It sometimes is more expensive. He should have good health insurance if this is the treatment of choice. My Gleason number was 7 (3+4) and the doctor told me I might live 10 years without treatment so it is not always super aggressive. It does vary. With treatment he is likely to live for quite a while. Good luck to you both.",

Each trial lists the exclusion criteria and the trial's contact person/ telephone number at each location. A lot of research is often needed to find a qualifying trial. And some trials only offer the new treatment to half the patients, the other half might get a routine treatment plus a placebo at first.",

There are links on the internet that compute PSA doubling time. You enter psa and date into the site and it computes doubling time. It has been a long time since treatment and radiation often does not work. Maybe others will have an opinion about radiation after 5 years or so. You might consult with an oncologist. What are his age, original PSA before diagnosis, pathology stats, etc? He still should have quite a few years to live at the worst case. Good luck.",

I wonder if the PSA number might reflect a large prostate. Anyway, good luck deciding on an approach.",

      "Content": "Bone scans and CT scans often pick up anomalies that are ambiguous and often are benign. The scans will not find micrometastases so it is possible there could be tiny metastasis that won't show on scans. With a PSA of 56, someone is going to have to make a determination on the likelihood of spread outside the prostate bed. Sometimes there is no certainty with prostate cancer. Nomograms , some of which are on the internet, compute some odds using PSA, Gleason score, etc. Factors to consider are the patient's age, the size of the prostate, whether there are any urinary problems now.Some institutions use PET scans or MRI to help with the decision. Good luck.",

If the cancer has not spread to seminal vesicles then with radiation or surgery, he would likely live for many years. The majority of men in such situations have no recurrence at 10 years out. If it has spread to seminal vesicles the statistics are not quite so good. It is hard to comment in detail before you recieve the biopsy results.

Do you have a prior PSA result? Your cancer might take 15+ years to get you, so there is no rush to decide. Active Surveilance would be reasonable except for the PSA number. Other treatments are surgery, radiation, cryo / freezing, targeted focal therapy in just a few locations in USA, HIFU. There are a couple of injections for prostate cancer in trials. I wonder if the PSA number might reflect a large prostate. Anyway, good luck deciding on an approach.",

Some might argue that surgery would not be curative and that the radiation alone might be indicated. The stats go down some with seminal vesicle diagnosis. A lot of patients live for quite a number of years after primary treatment with such a biopsy. It does vary. Lymph node involvement would be a negative. After primary treatment, hormone therapy might be needed if there is recurrence. There are also a lot of new meds in the pipeline coming in future years. What size was the prostate?

Sounds like you have a fairly mild case from the biopsy stats mentioned except for the PSA. You might want to know the PSA density (PSA divided by prostate size.) Also the PSA doubling time before biopsy if you have that data. There is no real rush since you might live 15+ years without treatment. You could ask for 2nd opinion on biopsy slides. Your thinking sounds reasonable. Some might argue for Active Surveillance which takes a different pychology. Good luck with the decision and treatment.",

We would probably need some more facts to offer concrete advice. A biopsy can determine if a patient has prostate cancer. When I had a prostate biopsy I had to take a laxative first and an antibiotic. There was an enema if I remember. The biopsy involved spring loaded needles which entered the prostate through the rectum. There was a mild sting to it but not big pain. Some people drive themselves home afterward, but a relative drove me home. There was no bad side-effects from my biopsy. The tissue obtained revealed that I had an intermediate prostate cancer. Anyway if your PSA is very high or been going up over time, then a biopsy would be a reasonable idea. Good luck to you.",

There was one trial of using vegetarian diet plus pomegranate and relaxation by dr. Dean Ornish. It slowed the PSA rise somewhat but was certainly no cure. Metformin diabetes drug (cheap) is being tested as adjunctive therapy. As was mentioned Zytiga looks helpful (works on hormones).expensive. Provenge vaccine is available / expensive and has some survival benefit. enzalutamide (MDV3100) works on androgen receptors and should be approved this year. Cabozantinib (XL-184) is in trials and has helped with bone mets for many. Alpharadin is in trials and looks promsing for bone situations. Prostvac is in trials. Some patients have responded to Ketoconazole. I'm thinking the best treatments now would be hormone therapy / ADT and the treatments mentioned. There are many others in trials. Good luck.",

Then had \"Post-prostatectomy\" PSA test at Quest and it came out to .06 which was good enough for my purposes. Haven't seen itemized bill but it must have been cheap. The tests did require a doctor's written order and I annotated that to have a copy sent to me. It indicated Quest will send copy of results to patient. Getting the doctor's order for the test might be the expensive part. Good luck to you. P.S. I have Blue Cross Quests submits a higher bill and then Blue Cross has a max they will allow for the test.

      "Content": "The Gleason score is not very bad. However, the PSA number is not good. It is a possiblity that the patient might need radiation if surgery fails. So radiation might be another possibility for primary treatment instead of surgery. Radiation is delivered as a 1 shot seed insertion or through periodic radiation sessions (as many as 40). I think consulting with a radiation oncologist about radiation treatment might be in order considering the PSA number. What was the prior PSA reading and when was it taken? What is the size of the prostate as this can limit some treatments. Anyway, good luck deciding on a treatment plan.",

How big is your prostate? If you have a small prostate with that PSA then the cancer might be more significant. AS can include monitoring, diet, meds like metformin and supplements.

Sounds like you have a fairly mild case from the biopsy stats mentioned except for the PSA. You might want to know the PSA density (PSA divided by prostate size.) Also the PSA doubling time before biopsy if you have that data. There is no real rush since you might live 15+ years without treatment. You could ask for 2nd opinion on biopsy slides. Your thinking sounds reasonable. Some might argue for Active Surveillance which takes a different pychology. Good luck with the decision and treatment.",

When you go for a consult you will need medical records and possibly biopsy slides. As far as external beam radiation, you would want a major center with very modern equipment. Seed radiation is another option that is usually effective. As far as surgery, you would want a surgeon with a lot of experience. Hang in there.",

One type of radiation is SBRT and it sometimes can be given in 5 sessions I think. Brachytherapy radiation has 2 types, permanent seeds or High Dose Rate temporary implants. These also might not require a big time commitment. But as was mentioned, you want the most effective treatment first. Good luck.",

It might give a false PSA reading as it often lowers PSA, sometimes by half. What size was your prostate and what size is it now? Have you had a PSA test since the TURP? That might be informative. The cancer may not have been very extensive to have all the negative saturation biopsies. Am thinking that surgery might be overkill. Radiation seems more reasonable to me. Good luck with your treatment and decision.",

Dr. Charles snuffy Smith [should be Myers] wrote a book and has video's about diet. There is a trial, NX-1207 was the injection , which offered an injection into prostate tissue in lieu of other treatments. I am trying for a plant based diet after treatment. I take supplements and metformin. Since your condition is not real severe, you have plenty of time to research the topic. Good luck to you.",

Some of these procedures take prostate samples and some do not. e.g. laser When prostate cancer is extensive in the bones, then the prognosis is often not good. Did he get hormone therapy?

Your signature shows surgery in 2013, should it be 2014? Vaom8, Radiation after surgery might work in less than half patients, long term. It varies a lot. Sometimes cancer is just in prostate bed, sometimes it's systemic also. Concurrent hormone therapy might make it more likely to work long term. There are a lot of treatments available with more in the pipeline. Good luck to both of you.",

      "Content": "Welcome. Sorry you have to be here. Gleason 8 is classified as aggressive prostate cancer. Scores are typically reported as 6 to 10. The Gleason score is the sum of 2 numbers. Bone scan clear is good , looks like no metastisis to the bone. Your account mentions mestasis outside the pelvic area which if correct would not be good. If there is metastisis outside the pelvic area than surgery would not cure. He might be looking at radiation with Hormone Therapy ( androgen deprivation ) added. Hormone Therapy may control symptoms for some time, it varies how long. If he recieves hormone therapy, I hope it works for a long time. There are a lot of new treatments being developed. Good luck to you both. P.S. What is his age and PSA number?",

An outpatient biopsy taking tiny samples of the prostate would be the main test to diagnose. Do you know the size of the prostate? Was there a nodule on the prostate? Do you know your prior PSA test results? What is your age? If it is prostate cancer, many grow fairly slowly. Treatment is often helpful. Recomment you go ahead and see a urologist about a biopsy.

The radiation sometimes causes irritable bladder or irritable bowels. Temporary rectal bleeding is a possibility. It varies and can depend on the equipment used and skill of providers. I have no person experience with these treatments myself. Others might tell you more. Good luck.",
