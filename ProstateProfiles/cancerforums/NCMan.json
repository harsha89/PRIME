      "Content": "Thank you for the help, and I will try to answer a few of the questions. Father had prostate issues for over 30 years but do not know if he had PSA test or not as he passed with Lung Cancer in 2011. I have the medical records for the primary portal but they were supposed to supply the records to urologist on 8/8/17 and asked me to call to verify that they received them. I called each week and they had not received them, urologist nurse said see would call last week and get them as she seemed concerned with PSA values that I told her. I have never been asked to have a biopsy and guess I will if asked too? Thinking that TURP or Greenlight would be next for me, as the problem is getting worse instead of better. Antibiotics never did me much good as it was hardly ever bacterial infection. Just frustrated with all the problems but concerned as primary seemed to make a big deal out of the recent rise on PSA. Guess I will get records printed and call urologist this coming week. Being overweight is not helping at all, and trying to work on that as well. Wish you all good luck and Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Hello I have been reading a lot of posts here and have learned so much about Prostate Cancer. First a few things about confusion, 53 year old male, long time prostate issues from infections, inflammation and now BPH. Have had trace blood in urine for at least 8 years, been to a couple of primary cares and urologist over last 30 years. Urologist now has done surgery on a \"golf ball sized\" spermatocele 8/2015, and Cystoscopy 11/2016 and was negative. Urologist has not done DRE in several years due to my history and no PSA testing. My current primary is a nurse practitioner and has done PSA testing last 4 years during annual physicals. She referred me back to Urologist on 8/8/17 due to a PSA of 4.12 and no DRE done at the time. PSA 8/2014 2.79 - 8/2015 2.69 - 8/2016 3.59 and 8/2017 4.12. Have been taking Flomax for about 8 years and Urologist raised it to 2 pills about a year ago due to BPH symptoms. Been having issues with stopping and starting, having to go at night, having low back pain and groin pain. I have had trouble getting PSA tests to Urologist due to primary, and have not made an appointment with Urologist yet. Thinking my recent problem is just prostatitis and inflamed prostate with no infection in urine sample on 8/8/2017 so just trying to figure out what to do next. Right now just confused man in NC.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Did you read the study I posted? The use of Flomax can be a useful tool as an indicator of prostate cancer. Reduction of PSA indicates BHP. Steady or rising PSA while taking Flomax indicates a higher probability of cancer (67%). You do not yet meet the parameters of the study, but the trends are the same. It is obvious you have an angry prostate that is not playing nice. Your challenge is to find a team that can get to the bottom of this and stick with it. It may be BHP or inflamation, now it is also to rule out cancer. Glad you found your way here, and you have your work cut out for you. I'd suggest a major cancer center. A trail of different doctors, systems, and practioners is not serving you well. Thanks for the replies and I have not seen the article for Flomax? I will look for it tonight, I was out of town working today and did not get a reply from Urologist so I guess I will be calling tomorrow. Although I do not think it is cancer, I posted on here to learn from the ones who know what its like. The numbness I feel from time is also very frustrating as well as the going to the bathroom every 2 hrs. Sorry I sound so down but its been going on too long and I do need to get to the bottom of this. Thanks",

      "Content": "Short update, Urologist visit last week and he got the PSA's from primary. Did urine sample which showed moderate blood and ordered a PSA2 blood test. No DRE this time either, I told him I thought the pain and trouble was another round of prostatitis but he did not comment. He also found a cyst on my left kidney about 8 months ago. Waiting on results of PSA2 now? Which I assume is free and total PSA? Feeling somewhat better now as changing diet has helped some I believe. Thanks for the help. BTW I also have HBP and psoratic arthritis and taking methrotrexate for it. Fatigue is a large problem.",

      "Content": "Hello I have been reading a lot of posts here and have learned so much about Prostate Cancer. First a few things about confusion, 53 year old male, long time prostate issues from infections, inflammation and now BPH. Have had trace blood in urine for at least 8 years, been to a couple of primary cares and urologist over last 30 years. Urologist now has done surgery on a \"golf ball sized\" spermatocele 8/2015, and Cystoscopy 11/2016 and was negative. Urologist has not done DRE in several years due to my history and no PSA testing. My current primary is a nurse practitioner and has done PSA testing last 4 years during annual physicals. She referred me back to Urologist on 8/8/17 due to a PSA of 4.12 and no DRE done at the time. PSA 8/2014 2.79 - 8/2015 2.69 - 8/2016 3.59 and 8/2017 4.12. Have been taking Flomax for about 8 years and Urologist raised it to 2 pills about a year ago due to BPH symptoms. Been having issues with stopping and starting, having to go at night, having low back pain and groin pain. I have had trouble getting PSA tests to Urologist due to primary, and have not made an appointment with Urologist yet. Thinking my recent problem is just prostatitis and inflamed prostate with no infection in urine sample on 8/8/2017 so just trying to figure out what to do next. Right now just confused man in NC. Please advise and hope I do not have to join the club. Thank You",

Father had prostate issues for over 30 years but do not know if he had PSA test or not as he passed with Lung Cancer in 2011.

I called each week and they had not received them, urologist nurse said see would call last week and get them as she seemed concerned with PSA values that I told her. I have never been asked to have a biopsy and guess I will if asked too? Thinking that TURP or Greenlight would be next for me, as the problem is getting worse instead of better. Antibiotics never did me much good as it was hardly ever bacterial infection. Just frustrated with all the problems but concerned as primary seemed to make a big deal out of the recent rise on PSA.

No DRE this time either, I told him I thought the pain and trouble was another round of prostatitis but he did not comment. He also found a cyst on my left kidney about 8 months ago. Waiting on results of PSA2 now? Which I assume is free and total PSA? Feeling somewhat better now as changing diet has helped some I believe. Thanks for the help. BTW I also have HBP and psoratic arthritis and taking methrotrexate for it. Fatigue is a large problem.",

      "Content": "Hello I have been reading a lot of posts here and have learned so much about Prostate Cancer. First a few things about confusion, 53 year old male, long time prostate issues from infections, inflammation and now BPH. Have had trace blood in urine for at least 8 years, been to a couple of primary cares and urologist over last 30 years. Urologist now has done surgery on a \"golf ball sized\" spermatocele 8/2015, and Cystoscopy 11/2016 and was negative. Urologist has not done DRE in several years due to my history and no PSA testing. My current primary is a nurse practitioner and has done PSA testing last 4 years during annual physicals. She referred me back to Urologist on 8/8/17 due to a PSA of 4.12 and no DRE done at the time. PSA 8/2014 2.79 - 8/2015 2.69 - 8/2016 3.59 and 8/2017 4.12. Have been taking Flomax for about 8 years and Urologist raised it to 2 pills about a year ago due to BPH symptoms. Been having issues with stopping and starting, having to go at night, having low back pain and groin pain. I have had trouble getting PSA tests to Urologist due to primary, and have not made an appointment with Urologist yet. Thinking my recent problem is just prostatitis and inflamed prostate with no infection in urine sample on 8/8/2017 so just trying to figure out what to do next. Right now just confused man in NC. Please advise and hope I do not have to join the club. Thank You",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Did you read the study I posted? The use of Flomax can be a useful tool as an indicator of prostate cancer. Reduction of PSA indicates BHP. Steady or rising PSA while taking Flomax indicates a higher probability of cancer (67%). You do not yet meet the parameters of the study, but the trends are the same. It is obvious you have an angry prostate that is not playing nice. Your challenge is to find a team that can get to the bottom of this and stick with it. It may be BHP or inflamation, now it is also to rule out cancer. Glad you found your way here, and you have your work cut out for you. I'd suggest a major cancer center. A trail of different doctors, systems, and practioners is not serving you well. Thanks for the replies and I have not seen the article for Flomax? I will look for it tonight, I was out of town working today and did not get a reply from Urologist so I guess I will be calling tomorrow. Although I do not think it is cancer, I posted on here to learn from the ones who know what its like. The numbness I feel from time is also very frustrating as well as the going to the bathroom every 2 hrs. Sorry I sound so down but its been going on too long and I do need to get to the bottom of this. Thanks",

      "Content": "Thank you for the help, and I will try to answer a few of the questions. Father had prostate issues for over 30 years but do not know if he had PSA test or not as he passed with Lung Cancer in 2011. I have the medical records for the primary portal but they were supposed to supply the records to urologist on 8/8/17 and asked me to call to verify that they received them. I called each week and they had not received them, urologist nurse said see would call last week and get them as she seemed concerned with PSA values that I told her. I have never been asked to have a biopsy and guess I will if asked too? Thinking that TURP or Greenlight would be next for me, as the problem is getting worse instead of better. Antibiotics never did me much good as it was hardly ever bacterial infection. Just frustrated with all the problems but concerned as primary seemed to make a big deal out of the recent rise on PSA. Guess I will get records printed and call urologist this coming week. Being overweight is not helping at all, and trying to work on that as well. Wish you all good luck and Thanks again.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies, and I guess part of my frustration is that current urologist and myself just don't click? He hasn't done a DRE for at least 4 or 5 years. He is a nice guy and previous surgery went well, but it was a simple surgery. He seemed like he wanted me to commit right then. My wonderful wife was there with me for my last two visits, and she felt like his attitude was pretty bad on last visit. She does want me to get it out, but she knows I have done all the research and is comfortable with what I chose. We are at the beach this week getting a break from my work which is very stressful. Hoping that next visit goes better or I maybe forced to drive 4 hrs to Duke. Does anyone agree that I maybe over thinking this, or in denial that I need surgery?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies, and I guess part of my frustration is that current urologist and myself just don't click? He hasn't done a DRE for at least 4 or 5 years. He is a nice guy and previous surgery went well, but it was a simple surgery. He seemed like he wanted me to commit right then. My wonderful wife was there with me for my last two visits, and she felt like his attitude was pretty bad on last visit. She does want me to get it out, but she knows I have done all the research and is comfortable with what I chose. We are at the beach this week getting a break from my work which is very stressful. Hoping that next visit goes better or I maybe forced to drive 4 hrs to Duke. Does anyone agree that I maybe over thinking this, or in denial that I need surgery?",

He said i needed treatment and he wanted me to get a 2nd opinion from another Dr who does the robotic surgery. I have appointment to see him on 26th. Not sure I need treatment guys, Avodart has helped symptoms, but pain and numbness in my right groin has me concerned. As well as right thigh pain that I cannot get rid of. I know surgery will get rid of bph issue and hopefully pca. Just want to be sure guys. I know I am a point now that a choice needs to be made. With 3 cores only on right side with total of 34 % I do not see why I would not be a candidate for AS. Urologist stated that with a lifespan of 30 years left i needed it now before it got worse.

We didn't talk about pain, he said he had given me 4 months to decide on treatment and the Avodart was to reduce prostate size for treatment. I need to look into Duke center as I think I'm done with 1st urologist. I asked about Polaris testing and he said it wasn't needed. Just frustrating for me, he knew I had done my homework as I told him about Walsh's book and my research which he said was a good thing.

      "Content": "Thanks guys, yes I have made my mind up to get slides sent off next week. My Dad had prostate issues for years before lung cancer took his life in 2011. I spent a year living with Dad helping through the cancer treatments and all the catheters. He had the microwave treatment for his prostate but it failed. Mother had lung cancer and died with it in 2003. Another said taking medicine to pee at 54...that kinda hit home, and it's sad to say but it's life right now. I guess pca will have to be dealt with sooner or later if it continues to grow and no other 7's or worse is found. I see Dr's point on that, but not sure it's now. What would be a reasonable time period for 2nd BX? and is an mpmri necessary?",

He said i needed treatment and he wanted me to get a 2nd opinion from another Dr who does the robotic surgery. I have appointment to see him on 26th. Not sure I need treatment guys, Avodart has helped symptoms, but pain and numbness in my right groin has me concerned. As well as right thigh pain that I cannot get rid of. I know surgery will get rid of bph issue and hopefully pca. Just want to be sure guys. I know I am a point now that a choice needs to be made. With 3 cores only on right side with total of 34 % I do not see why I would not be a candidate for AS. Urologist stated that with a lifespan of 30 years left i needed it now before it got worse.

      "Content": "Well I asked about sending slides to Epstein at that visit, but he said I could if I wanted too, but cancer was cancer. 2nd opinion was to try and find another Dr. who would listen, talk about AS, and possible IMRT as well, plus he is close to my work if We decide on IMRT. We didn't talk about pain, he said he had given me 4 months to decide on treatment and the Avodart was to reduce prostate size for treatment. I need to look into Duke center as I think I'm done with 1st urologist. I asked about Polaris testing and he said it wasn't needed. Just frustrating for me, he knew I had done my homework as I told him about Walsh's book and my research which he said was a good thing. Just think I need to move on to new Dr and see if he has same answers. No need to rush right.",
