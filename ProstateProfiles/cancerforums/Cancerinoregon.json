    "Content": "Hi everyone, I am new to this forum, thank you for accepting me. My 70 year young dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer. The doctor offered surgery, radiation or chemo, but because it hasn't spread, active surveillance was also an option. Still, I worry about spreading. After the high PSA a biopsy confirmed the cancer. Below are his biopsy results. I had him drinking tomato juice for months but it wasn't until he began Saw Palmetto that his PSA decreased. The problem is, I read that SP can cause an artificial drop in the hormone but not the actual cancer. Regardless, in his mind this is the way to go, so he stopped the tomato juice with the lycopene that I read had helped in studies. Now he's taking the SP only. I am worried though. Can the SP actually kill cancer cells in time, not just reduce the hormone? They never gave him the option of hormone therapy because his hormones were fine I guess. I had read that the following are useful in killing cancer cells. Is this true? And if so, what potency and how often should they be taken? Any help very much appreciated. Thank you! Vit D - any particular kind, how much, how often? Not a lot of sun in Oregon.... Fresh Garlic cloves - How much how often? CQ10 - expensive, does it really work? How much? How often?

Risk of possible progression while on surveillance explained but reinforced that there have been no differences seen in prognosis or outcomes after receiving definitive treatment between men who had delayed treatment after being on surveillance than those men who went straight to treatment. Risks of loss of bone/muscle mass, decreased libido, and coronary event from hormonal therapy explained. Risk of permanent erectile dysfunction with all forms of treatment listed above except for active surveillance explained to pt and further time spent explaining nerve sparing technique with prostatectomy to try to preserve erectile function but still couldn&#39;t guarantee return of erectile function. Explained that there are treatments for erectile dysfunction if it persists after treatment. Risk of urinary incontinence with all forms of treatment listed above except surveillance explained to pt. Noted that about 80% of men will have no significant incontinence by one year after prostatectomy but there is risk of permanent urinary incontinence and that there are treatments for this if it persists. Risk of injury/fistula to rectum explained with prostatectomy or cryotherapy. Focused time discussing radical prostatectomy, specifically robotic assisted prostatectomy, including procedure, general hospital course, and recovery time. -will not refer to radiation oncology for further discussion of possible radiation therapy at pt&#39;s request -At this time pt would like to proceed with active surveillance. -PSA in 6-8 weeks and then Q3 months. -RTC 5 months.
