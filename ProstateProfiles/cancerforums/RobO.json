      "Content": "I am 33 years old, and I was diagnosed with BPH at age 26. There is family medical history on my mother's side of prostate cancer, which ultimately killed her father (age 71) and brother (age 50). Additionally, I have done genetic screening through the website 23andMe.com, and there is states I have a 11.2% higher risk of developing prostate cancer between the ages of 35 - 79 than the average male population. Basically, I have begun to look at prostate cancer as a mater of 'when', not 'if.' I have had my PSA levels tested 3 times in the last 3 years, with a rise of only 1 point (last level was 1.3); however, I do not have complete faith in PSA screening. I've read recent articles on the validity of PSA testing, showing they may not be as useful as once thought. I've talked with my doctor about these studies, and he agrees with them, but suggests that I continue screening because, \"at least it's something.\" My concern (and his as well) is that once someone shows outward signs and symptoms of prostate cancer it may have already began to spread to other parts of the body, decreasing survival rates. The alternative is periodic invasive biopsies, which I fear insurance companies will not support unless there is due cause. My question: Is there such a thing as preemptive prostate removal? I completely understand the risks of incontinence and impotence associated with this major surgery and do not take this lightly, but these concerns are not nearly as important to me as living a longer life. Knowing my chances of developing cancer, I feel like I'm playing with fire and, statistically speaking, I will eventually get burned. If I addressed my concerns to a doctor and laid out my case, would preemptive removal be something I could get a doctor to consider? Thanks for reading.",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response. I will definitely check out the good Doctor's site. Now, I wish I could preserve a healthy prostate, but unfortunately by age 26 I was already having urination issues due to my enlarged prostate, so it's already unhealthy. I guess I should add this to my case: I am an very healthy individual (marathon runner, great BMI, low dairy/fat diet) and not your target demographic when thinking of someone likely to get PC. Avodart comes with its own set of potential side effects, and with me being genetically predisposed to PC, why screw around with, \"Maybe try this...oh that didn't work, well how about this...\" type of treatment. I guess that's my point: Why not get the bugger out that causes all the problems.",
