      "Content": "Hello All, Hope you are doing well today. Wanted to let you know that my robotic surgery went well, without complication last week at UCLA. I have felt a little like a zombie lately from the ordeal, and I blended in well with the Halloween crowd. The fluids only diet Sat through Monday was pretty horrible. Hard to get comfortable while sitting or reclining due to the catheter, and I have some shoulder spasms that direct pressure has helped. I have taken only a few of the painkillers they gave me. I took my first walk the same day as surgery and have been walking my 3 yr old son every day, and steadily strengthening. Before putting me under, the anesthesiologist listened to my heart and detected a small heart murmur, so I guess it's time for a visit to the cardiologist soon as well. Will meet with the surgeon tomorrow for a bladder x-ray, remove the catheter, and discuss my pathology report, below. Trying to interpret the good and bad news, what do you think? FINAL DIAGNOSIS: PROSTATE (TOTAL PROSTATECTOMY): - Prostatic adenocarcinoma, single focus - Dominant tumor - Gleason grade: 3+4= 7/10 - Location: all four quadrants - Size: 2.8 cm (as measured on slide A14, comprising approximately 40% of tissue examined, estimated tumor volume of 10.8 cc (slides A11-A15) - Prostate apex is involved (slides A3-A6) - Base and seminal vesicles are uninvolved - Established extraprostatic extension is present, anterior midline (slide A15) - Perineural invasion is identified (slide A14) - Lymphovascular invasion is not identified - Surgical margins are focally involved in the right posterior apex (<1mm, slide A5) - Forty-two benign lymph nodes, negative for carcinoma (0/42) - Pathologic stage: pT3a N0 Mx According to this prediction tool (http://nomograms.mskcc.org/Prostate/...tatectomy.aspx) Progression-Free Probability After Surgery is: 2 Year 94% 5 Year 88% 7 Year 85% 10 Year 81% I am glad I put surgery off in July due to a trip to Europe my lovely wife and I had planned... it turns out we are now expecting #2! Will be challenging being a dad again at 50, especially with all this going on. Thank you for your support.",

Thank you for your contributions, to what looks like a great place for me to better understand and come to terms with my situation and what having cancer means. Unsure how dire this may be. Will keep reading about your experiences and will try to contribute. My details are below. Sorry that I do not have the abbreviated lingo down. I just turned 50. Due to elevated PSA, I had a biopsy. I was then was diagnosed with Gleason 3+4 = 7 clinical T2 prostate cancer. I am scheduled for robotic surgery in late October. So it appears that on the right side I have at least one tumor \"that is not low-risk.\" Part of what's confusing to me is the way the approach is described. The doc doesn't say I have a high risk tumor, but he does say that I don't have a low risk tumor. He says that given the biopsy of cancer on the right, and my MRI, that he should be less aggressive with nerve sparing on the right, approx 80-90% versus 100%. Non-aggressive nerve sparing is another term I would like to better understand. Anyhow, I guess I should feel fortunate that I caught this now. Best wishes to all you survivors.

      "Content": "Hello comrades, Today Dr. Epstein at Johns Hopkins faxed me a second opinion on my UCLA prostate biopsy. They received my 28 slides from UCLA on Tuesday, so they were very quick to handle it. Not sure what to make of it as regards my scheduled robotic surgery next month, given my suspicious MRI. Seems like good news, may not change anything though. What are your thoughts? Will share it with my surgeon and see what he says. Best regards. JOHNS HOPKINS PATHOLOGY: He graded my first tumor (right mid adenocarcinoma) the same as UCLA did, 3+3=6 with perineural invasion, but differed by saying \"discontinuously involving 70% of one core.\" The second tumor he \"upgraded\" to a 3+3=6 from a 3+4=7, involving 2 cores at 90% and 70%. (differing from UCLA again as regards the involvement percentages, below). Said this tumor has features \"pseudohyperplastic carcinoma\" (Reference Am J Surg Path 22: 1239-1246, 199. The report went on to say that a 6 score is classified as Prognostic Grade Group I (most favorable). UCLA PATHOLOGY: Right mid: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+3 = 6/10 involving 1 of 2 cores; measuring 6mm in length discontinuously; occupying 30% of the total biopsy tissue; perineural invasion is identified. White, 2 specimen lengths of 1cm and 1.5 cm Right Apex: Prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+4 = 7/10 involving 2 of 2 cores; measuring 5mm in length (90% of one core) and 4 mm in length (50% of second core); occupying 65% of the total biopsy tissue.No perineural invasion is identified; white, 2 specimen lengths of 0.9cm and 1.2 cm July Endorectal Coil MRI, UCLA. The radiology report stated: 1. Capsular margin: Irregularity - suspicious for involvement 2. Capsular involvement. High suspicion for aggressive disease. Very highly suspicious lesion in the right gland crosses midline anteriorly and has capsular irregularity. 3. Technical quality: extensive hemorrhage may limit characterization of the left peripheral gland",
