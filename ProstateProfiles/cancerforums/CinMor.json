      "Content": "Thank you all for your responses! We do remain very hopeful as we are aware many new treatments and meds are on the horizon. He took Pomi-T for 6 months, with no positive response as the PSA continued to rise. His treatment is at the Omaha VA and the oncologist there is actually from the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. So we believe his treatment is some of the best. I'm quite certain there are no restrictions as to what they will treat him with since it is the VA, not an insurance company making the decision. I will discuss Xtandi with our oncologist when he goes in for chemo on the 23rd of February. His bone pain at this point is just \"discomfort\" as he puts it. The man is tough as nails and pain is not a part of his language I hope he sells the business and lives to a ripe old age just fishing on the Missouri River!",

He is now castrate resistant hormone refractory with bone mets to lower spine and left sachrum. He will start chemo February 23rd. I am worried about our future and not sure what to do to help him through this. He is a hard working man and is selling his construction company this fall in preparation. Any advice?
