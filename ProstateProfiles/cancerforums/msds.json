      "Content": "Hello everyone.... My dad (79) was diagnosed stage 4 pc with mets to the brain 2 1/2 years ago. Psa 25 at the time. He immediately had the brain tumor removed and had radiation. He was started on Lupron and for two years psa was very very low. recently his psa started to climb....1.2 to 2.4 to 4.2 to today 5.4. He had a bone scan along with a brain scan and all the vital organs checked. All came back clear except for the bone which shows 2 \"spots\". Doctor said they are not cancer yet. Dad was put on Casodex together with continuing on Lupron. What exactly does \"spots\" mean??? They will turn into Cancer?? how long does it take to turn?? Casodex?? anyone have experience with this treatment? is it more of a very short term treatment or can it work for a couple of years?? Is chemo usually recommended once the cancer starts spreading?? If Casodex is a bust are there other treatments?? Thank You",

      "Content": "Hi everyone thank you for the responses... This is new to me and not sure about different treatments available. And like to hear what others are doing for treatment. My Dad never had a biopsy done. Don't know what the gleason is....He does have a hard time getting up from a sitting position also out of bed. He needs a wheel chair to get around. He does take afternoon naps however did that even before the cancer. He is not active at all because of the leg clots and has pain in his knees. His biggest problem has been blood clots. 2 years ago he had clots that travelled to the lungs almost did not make it through the night at the hospital however thank god he did and his clots are under control and he takes blood thinners. As for Chemo is that something they recommend once the cancer has spread to at least one other place? and if so does chemo really cure the cancer or just buys you some more time? I'm not sure if chemo would be too difficult for him. I guess we will cross that bridge when and if it comes. Anyone have any idea what the oncologist means by 2 spots on his bone scan but not cancer and not to worry about it right now. I assume spots turn into cancer?? His psa is being checked every 6 weeks now. I'm so depressed to see what my dad is going through....and fear it's only going to get worse just a matter of when. Thanks everyone....",
