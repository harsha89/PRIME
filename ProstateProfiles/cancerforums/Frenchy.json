      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I'm not a doctor and so I hesitate to give advice. As I'm sure you know, any grade 5 cells, are nasty. But it looks like you got a negative margin at the site of the grade 5, so it could be all out. You might need SRT. BUT THE LONGER YOU WAIT THE LESS CHANCE OF LASTING INCONTINENCE, and ED. So give yourself as much time To heal as possible. Any improvement of incontinence and erectile function, is frozen once you start radiation. For me, I'd want to see what my post op PSA is and if it's undetectable then I'd not be inclined to rush into salvage radiation. Yes... This ^^^. It's basically what I followed. They tested me closely every month after the initial three months. After nine months, I popped up detectable. So SRT i went. All good now. Get advice from your RO sooner than later. But do heal first.",

There is a school of thought to be proactive and preemptive, rather than wait for the PSA to begin rising. It was reported to me that it significantly increases the chances of NO RECURRENCE. Not sure why they would be already prescribing HT in this case; unless they were certain they had left some in during the surgery. In my case, my margins tested negative. I tested zero again today for now my second time, 3 months post op. MDA has a fancy $4,000 test (can't remember the name right now; but it uses the pathology of the prostate to perform their predictive analysis) which gives a better indication of possible recurrence than the Memorial Sloan Kettering tables. They tell me it's a better predictor than waiting for the PSA to rise above 0.1 . Personally, I am still waiting, even if their test shows I need Adjuvant Treatment sooner than later. So long as my PSA continues to show zero, I see no reason to do SRT since my margins were all clear.",

They test for Testosterone at the same time, btw. And it has been steadily increasing from the mid 200 to now the upper 400, all on its own. For those that understand, what is the significance? I am assuming SRT brings it down some and as your body recovers it goes back up? I will ask my doctor on my next appointment next week for a thorough explanation.",

Is there anything you are doing for it? Thanks, DD Having had 37 nodes ripped out, I've been doing lots of exercises... walking, cycling. Not sure it makes a difference. I still have a bit of discomfort/weakness at the crease of the left leg and abdomen region. A simple thing as putting pants on is harder for the left leg. Trying to strengthen the area. Not sure either if lymphedema is the cause.",

With a normal pH comes higher oxygen levels which also helps. One can easily find on the internet the list of foods with higher alkaline content, basically cruciferous and green veggies. All bottled waters are not created equal, some much more acidic (certainly not neutral) than one would think. I now drink nothing but higher alkaline bottled water.",

      "Content": "Hi Kamie, I tried an all of the above approach including dieting and touted anecdotal supplements when recently diagnosed. My PSA went up still. When I was referred to the number one cancer center in the country, MDA, they tested my PSA to gauge the doubling rate. As said previously, the horse has left the barn. The harm in waiting is that many lymph nodes may need to be taken out as was in my case. It is fortunate that it is very early for your husband. That means there is a strong chance no lymph nodes are taken out. And much better and quicker recovery options. Best wishes.",

Surgery is the gold standard because they can cut up the tissue and look at it under a microscope. The MRI is also good at looking for seminal vesicle invasion, although not quite as good. Not ejaculating for 3 days prior to the MRI helps the seminal vesicles fill with fluid and makes tumor invasion easier to identify. Lymph node involvement is possible to be seen, but if it is microscopic, will generally not be seen with MRI. A surgical lymph node dissection can pick up microscopic disease in the prostate, but again, this is because the pathologist can look at it under a microscope.

      "Content": "Good question, Pratoman. I've been wondering myself why they all of a sudden are testing me with the ultra test. The last score was 0.010. Before they were testing me with the regular PSA and I was less than 0.1 . So I still don't have a valid explanation of why the ultra sensitive test now. Your post maybe clarifies this for me in that they are looking for the next threshold, if it ever happens. I am not sure I would act on a score of something close to 0.05. I remember reading somewhere there is fluctuation from day in these scores. One does not see this if the test is simply resulting in less than 0.1 . But if an ultra test, it does tend to add to the stress level it the result begins to inch up a bit, or fluctuate a bit.",

      "Content": "Thanks for sharing. I brought Provenge up to my doctors at MDAnderson. They say they won't use it unless the cancer is metastatic, and usually in clinical trials. One doctor did cite its cost with respect to other treatments. This is likely an insurance driven answer as well. Most insurances will simply not cover it. It's about $600,000 or so according to one doctor at MDA. For us patients, if this does indeed work, and it appears to, why wait until the cancer is in advanced stages? The answers are not forthcoming yet from the medical community.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor Here is a copy of a post I made in another thread - it might explain why the interest in Ultrasensitive PSA tests. The 3-month Ultrasensitive number appears to provide a lot of prognostic information about Biochemical Recurrence: Walsh book (4th edition) page 326 \"ULTRASENSITIVE PSA TESTS\" references a study done by a Walsh colleague at Hopkins, Dr. Lori Sokoll (professor of pathology and assistant director of clinical chemistry): 750 men 3-months post RP with PSA <0.1 were given ULTRASENSITIVE PSA tests and then monitored for 10-years. 14% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA < 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years 78% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA > 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years There was no report about the clinical symptoms or actual PSA level at 10-years I found a source document for Dr. Sokoll (Journal of Urology Feb 2016), which discusses the same topic but has a little different conclusion than found in the Walsh book. I am not sure if this is the research Walsh was describing but pub date and number of subjects is very similar to what is in the book. Biochemical recurrence-free rates 11 years after surgery were 86.1% (95% CI 83.2\u201389.0) for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% (95% CI 37.5\u201360.3) for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater (p <0.0001). That says to me: An Ultrasensitive PSA < 0.01 had an 86% chance of no biochemical recurrence compared to only about 50% chance of no recurrence if the Ultrasensitive PSA =>.01. My 6-week test is October 9 and 3-months is just after Thanksgiving so I am particularly interested in this topic! Thanks for the info ... very useful.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I agree with all of you guys because of the certainty of the case after the removed prostate is examined. Probably, at some point in the future, there will be a StarTrekian type of scan that can show, with virtually no doubt, if there are any other tumors in a prostate aside from what was detected by biopsy. If/when this happens, AS will be less of a risk and the same might be said for focal treatment types. But, until that day arrives, surgery remains the gold standard for cure -- and the primary treatment type with the most post-treatment options, best information on the true status of the case, etc. Gold standard indeed!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH The urine problem hits about 50% of patients (from what I remember reading) and almost always goes away in the months to come. You'll probably be just fine. With me, Viagra costs $43 a pill. So I could only afford to buy one single pill -- and it's still sitting there because I want to save it for a \"meaningful\" occasion, like when the gf is visiting. But I don't even know if Viagra will work for me & I'm eager to give it a try. If anyone has any info on these Canadian pharmacies -- a place that is safe to deal with -- that would be very helpful. Looks like I'm not the only one with the urine issue during the fun times. I sure hope it goes away sooner than later. It sure blows. One doctor recommended a condom and some lube in the interim. Not a big fan of using a helmet with my lifelong partner.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by function2 If this is posted somewhere as a thread, just point me there, and thanks. I'm 57, I have PSA 7.1 and a Gleason of 8. I'm quite healthy and fit in every other way. My most aggressive tumor is pushing out towards one of the nerve bundles. My consultation today was a recommendation for robotic abdominal surgery, which I probably will do. I opted out of radiation because (1) you have no recourse if you're in the 20% and get the cancer again and (2) bad effects increase over time (more or less). He said if I were 80, radiation might make more sense. My doctor seemed to paint a rosier picture than most recovery descriptions I read online. What are men's real life experiences? He says one night in the hospital (not 2), catheter for one week (not 2-4), back at work in two weeks (I have a desk job), and urinary control most likely after a month. Sexual function may take a while or be compromised forever, I understand that. What say you? Originally Posted by ddayglo Find a good, experienced surgeon and schedule the surgery for the earliest possible time after your biopsy (5-6 weeks). THEN if you have second thoughts about radiation, you can research it knowing that your surgery appointment is already \"reserved\" and you are already scheduled for the earliest possible time and will never second-guess yourself about waiting. But if you decide to switch to radiation, you can simply cancel the surgery. Going back to work two weeks after the surgery is optimistic... I went back to work 3 1/2 weeks after my surgery, have a desk job, and the first week was rough. Read the DaVinci sticky for many first-person details on others who have had robotic surgery. Good Luck! Agreed... Two weeks is rough. Four is more like it. The better shape you're in, the easier it'll be in the recovery.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cubsfan I'm being treated at Loyola Hospital in Chicago, a teaching hospital with a good reputation in regards to cancer. I've met with both the surgical oncologist and the radiation guy. The surgeon uses robotics and has done over 1000 procedures. The RO advises high-energy brachytherapy, then 5 weeks of external beam radiation, with ADT for a total of 1 yr combined pre & post radiation. There is some comfort in the surgical option in that I will know that the bulk (hopefully all) of the PCa is out. The surgeon expects to take out approx. 20 lymph nodes, fingers crossed that they're clean. Both presented good cases, and I'm honestly confused. I'm not comfortable with some of the surgical risks and, of course, some of the possible post-surgery issues. I'm definitely not comfortable with a year of ADT and some of the radiation side-effects don't sound all that great either. My age - 66 in December, and my Gleason score - 8, are factors to consider as well. So, fellow club members, please share your thoughts. Sorry to hear on the diagnosis. Sound like you've done some decent due diligence. Based on the data you've shared, a doctor with over 1000 surgeries and counting may be a good option. In my case they removed 37 lymph nodes, all of which turned out negative. The consensus approach i gathered in my case is a a combination of surgery and radiation, the latter to get the microscopic laggards. And so it worked out so far for me. I am assuming they are recommending the ADT due to the Gleason. The physical shape you're in will be a factor; the better shape you are in, the easier the recovery, not that's it's easy, because it is not. If you're still on the fence, get a second opinion. Try to get the best hands, even if it means traveling out of your area, although Chicago should be properly equipped with great surgeons. Best wishes.",

Sound like you've done some decent due diligence. Based on the data you've shared, a doctor with over 1000 surgeries and counting may be a good option. In my case they removed 37 lymph nodes, all of which turned out negative. The consensus approach i gathered in my case is a a combination of surgery and radiation, the latter to get the microscopic laggards. And so it worked out so far for me. I am assuming they are recommending the ADT due to the Gleason. The physical shape you're in will be a factor; the better shape you are in, the easier the recovery, not that's it's easy, because it is not. If you're still on the fence, get a second opinion. Try to get the best hands, even if it means traveling out of your area, although Chicago should be properly equipped with great surgeons. Best wishes.",

The ones at MDA indicated that their studies show no dicernable advantage, so they don't prescribe it. So none prescribed in my case. None needed either, BTW. Although they did indicate the need to \"exercise\" it to prevent shrinkage; at least that's the way they put it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mike A Had Da Vinci on 17 April - almost 4 weeks ago. For month prior to surgery, I quit smoking (after 50 years) and walked 4-5 miles a day, building up to about 3.6 MPH. Got myself in pretty decent shape and I think it has paid off. Since surgery, I have begun walking again. Gradually building up to about 3-4 miles per day in the last week, but keeping pace at around 3.3 MPH. I feel I am getting some decent exercise, but not pushing it to point of any pain or tiredness. A day or so ago, at the end, I felt a little pull developing on right side of groin, so took yesterday off. Woke up today without the pull and did my normal 3 and a half mile walk. All this to ask how much is too much? Is 3-4 miles of walking a day too much after 4 weeks? Is the pace I'm walking too fast? Being a competitive person all my life, I have a tendency to push myself, but certainly don't want to do anything that may jeopardize recover. Will appreciate any advice. Mike Congrats... I worked my way back up from 2 blocks to over 5 miles a day. It was not easy in the beginning. At the 5 miles mark, it was time to get back on the bike. I worked my way from barely being able to do 10 miles to now capably handling longer outings such a 20 and 30 milers with no problems. Bottom line.. listen to your body and adjust accordingly.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Definitely ask your Uro MD for clearance before starting back! I started back with light exercise, no impact, in the gym about 4 weeks post op. Stationary recumbent bike riding, stair master, light free weights. Then graduated to calisthenics: Push ups, pull ups, dips, lunges, sit ups (with no twisting). Everything progressed quickly until..... I noticed a swollen lymph node in my inguinal area and later (5 - 6 months later) developed a strong discomfort in the same area that would flare up several times/ day when walking - especially uphill! I would have to stop for about 15 seconds to let it subside and then continue until the next flare. At my 6 month check up, the MD was not at all concerned about the lymph node or the \"inguinal discomfort.\" He checked me for a hernia. Both conditions eventually vanished. My suggestion is to start back slowly, easily and gradually! Start with low impact cardio workouts to regain your stamina and endurance. I'd avoid strenuous power lifting for at least 6 months and only then work back into it lightly and gradually. Definitely avoid or minimize actions that involve your lower abdominal region - especially twisting motions. Go easy and good luck! Good advice.... I just got the clearance myself on the weights. I have been walking 5 miles every outing for a while now.",

Just did the required tests, Colonoscopy (they removed 9 polyps (good decision this was)), and biopsy as a result of the elevated PSA, 21.7; 7 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7, one 3+4, and another 4+3, the rest not as high, all on the left side, prostate normal size at 25cc. Many thanks for all whom have posted heretofore. I have been a voracious reader, including The Book, so much so my Uro felt a bit challenged. She's all good. I have been referred to MD Anderson's very own department head, Dr. Davis, whom I hear is one of the great ones. Still assessing treatment plan; RALP, IMRT, Proton. I understand the team at MD Anderson has a committee approach. Right now I am teetering between Proton and RALP. Not much in the forum here on Proton, I noticed (not even a sticky). And not much also in the way of diets, certain foods, supplements, and alkalinities of the body. I think an all of the above approach can't be too faulty. My greatest challenge is my professional schedule; too much traveling all over South Texas. I am wondering if it's worth factoring my professional demands in leaning to Proton. This therapy seems to be the one with the least discomfort, maybe, and the least after-problems and most schedule flexible (no need to take much time off of work). I need to ferret out more data on reoccurrences after Proton therapy, if there is much there to be found. As most that came before me, I am concerned on the potential after-problems if the skilled hands of Dr. Davis fail him. So it's real good to hear/read of the success stories. Also, as I've never had a cavity in my teeth, I am concerned that these therapies will weaken my dental health somehow, not that it's of paramount concern right at the moment.

      "Content": "One of the lucky one percenters to be diagnosed early. Just turned fifty. No symptoms. Just did the required tests, Colonoscopy (they removed 9 polyps (good decision this was)), and biopsy as a result of the elevated PSA, 21.7; 7 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7, one 3+4, and another 4+3, the rest not as high, all on the left side, prostate normal size at 25cc. Many thanks for all whom have posted heretofore. I have been a voracious reader, including The Book, so much so my Uro felt a bit challenged. She's all good. I have been referred to MD Anderson's very own department head, Dr. Davis, whom I hear is one of the great ones. Still assessing treatment plan; RALP, IMRT, Proton. I understand the team at MD Anderson has a committee approach. Right now I am teetering between Proton and RALP. Not much in the forum here on Proton, I noticed (not even a sticky). And not much also in the way of diets, certain foods, supplements, and alkalinities of the body. I think an all of the above approach can't be too faulty. My greatest challenge is my professional schedule; too much traveling all over South Texas. I am wondering if it's worth factoring my professional demands in leaning to Proton. This therapy seems to be the one with the least discomfort, maybe, and the least after-problems and most schedule flexible (no need to take much time off of work). I need to ferret out more data on reoccurrences after Proton therapy, if there is much there to be found. As most that came before me, I am concerned on the potential after-problems if the skilled hands of Dr. Davis fail him. So it's real good to hear/read of the success stories. Also, as I've never had a cavity in my teeth, I am concerned that these therapies will weaken my dental health somehow, not that it's of paramount concern right at the moment. Anyway, a heartfelt MERCI to all of the contributors.",

Many have reported that the better shape you're in, the more likely the easier the recovery. I think this is generally true. However one may have to factor in the stage and severity of the PC in our recovery timelines. In my case, I am an avid cyclist. I prepared pre-RP. I had heard and read to wait about five months before hoping on two wheels. And I did. I had been doing pretty decently long walks, about five miles at a clip. But it simply isn't enough to get back into a shape with much less gut. I began cycling over the weekend and have successfully done a decent 20 miler, and a short 10 miler the day before. Some discomfort toward the end, but nothing insurmountable in terms of overdoing it. Alas the muscles near the crease of the abdomen and the leg on my left side exhibit some significant weakness with respect to the right. I can only surmise it to be from the surgery as it was not present pre-RP. A quick check with my surgeon and primary care revealed nada. Still, something was disturbed. I guess I will need to have a bit more patience in letting the muscles regain more strength. Anyone remember anything similar to report in your recovery?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi IS! Not sure why your updated \"Signature\" has not automatically updated across all of your posts?!?! Your Path Report places you an elevated intermediate risk status based on findings of: - Gleason (4+3) with 80% Pattern 4 - Tertiary Pattern 5 - Seminal Vesicle Involvement - PNI = \"extensive\" You can go to the GenomeDX website in plug in your post RP Path Report data and then receive a response http://deciphertest.com/patients/is-...-right-for-me/ I would schedule an appointment with the URO Surgeon to review his/her intraoperative surgical findings & the Path Report findings. Have the MD determine your risk for recurrence. Then ask \"What additional beneficial info or value can/will 'Decipher' provide?' Most importantly you will need to monitor your PSA at regular intervals. Since your risk status is elevated, discuss with your URO Surgeon the need to monitor with an Ultrasensitive PSA (uPSAMethodology. This can detect a clinically significant rising PSA early. In order to compare results, you must have the uPSA analyzed at The Same Lab using The Same uPSA Methodology each time. Please keep The Forum educated by providing your URO Surgeon's suggestions. Good luck! MF There is a good YouTube video here explaining this also I had the Decipher done. My insurance did pay for it. It is a very useful but also expensive test. It is IMHO worth it. Sounds like your URO is on board with it, likely sage advice.",

Just did the required tests, Colonoscopy (they removed 9 polyps (good decision this was)), and biopsy as a result of the elevated PSA, 21.7; 7 out of 12 cores, Gleason 7, one 3+4, and another 4+3, the rest not as high, all on the left side, prostate normal size at 25cc. Many thanks for all whom have posted heretofore. I have been a voracious reader, including The Book, so much so my Uro felt a bit challenged. She's all good. I have been referred to MD Anderson's very own department head, Dr. Davis, whom I hear is one of the great ones. Still assessing treatment plan; RALP, IMRT, Proton. I understand the team at MD Anderson has a committee approach. Right now I am teetering between Proton and RALP. Not much in the forum here on Proton, I noticed (not even a sticky). And not much also in the way of diets, certain foods, supplements, and alkalinities of the body. I think an all of the above approach can't be too faulty. My greatest challenge is my professional schedule; too much traveling all over South Texas. I am wondering if it's worth factoring my professional demands in leaning to Proton. This therapy seems to be the one with the least discomfort, maybe, and the least after-problems and most schedule flexible (no need to take much time off of work). I need to ferret out more data on reoccurrences after Proton therapy, if there is much there to be found. As most that came before me, I am concerned on the potential after-problems if the skilled hands of Dr. Davis fail him. So it's real good to hear/read of the success stories. Also, as I've never had a cavity in my teeth, I am concerned that these therapies will weaken my dental health somehow, not that it's of paramount concern right at the moment. Anyway, a heartfelt MERCI to all of the contributors.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 Are you reading the decimal placement correctly? At a PSA of 0.1 post-surgery, many ROs would be prepping a patient for salvage radiation. Assuming the most recent PSA result was not an error, another PSA of 0.1 or higher is currently considered to be a biochemical recurrence. As soon as I hit 0.11, I scheduled 40 sessions of SR after monitoring a clear-cut upward trend. This is exactly the reason why a single decimal point while monitoring PSA makes no sense IMHO because it lulls the patient into thinking <0.1 is just fine when, if fact, it could be climbing every 3 months (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.07) and the patient remains totally in the dark. In this case, a second PSA reading of 0.1 or higher is very likely time for action. Chuck, Pratoman, Michael F, MichiganMan16, am I missing something here? That was my very question at MDA. The consensus there is that in terms of results after the PSA begins to rise, the success rate of SRT is no different if the PSA trends from 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 using the ultra test, to <0.1, 0.1, 0.2 for the regular PSA test. It's the very challenge of balancing recovery from surgery with either adjuvant or salvage treatment. Each case is different, obviously. Nonetheless, their research and data from all treated patients suggest the regular PSA test is sufficient.",

As soon as I hit 0.11, I scheduled 40 sessions of SR after monitoring a clear-cut upward trend. This is exactly the reason why a single decimal point while monitoring PSA makes no sense IMHO because it lulls the patient into thinking <0.1 is just fine when, if fact, it could be climbing every 3 months (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.07) and the patient remains totally in the dark. In this case, a second PSA reading of 0.1 or higher is very likely time for action. Chuck, Pratoman, Michael F, MichiganMan16, am I missing something here? That was my very question at MDA. The consensus there is that in terms of results after the PSA begins to rise, the success rate of SRT is no different if the PSA trends from 0.02, 0.05, 0.08 using the ultra test, to <0.1, 0.1, 0.2 for the regular PSA test. It's the very challenge of balancing recovery from surgery with either adjuvant or salvage treatment. Each case is different, obviously.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Chi !!! Sorry that the \"bafflement\" continues. Everything that you have posted to date is not suggestive of PC. (Correction:Jim215 has since reminded me that you do in fact have prior biopsies with G6). However, your steadily rising PSA requires continued attention. You now have 3 consecutive PSA rises > 10 since last August. This is 1 metric that must be weighed to make the decision to continue AS. Is it possible that you are experiencing some type of as symptomatic BPH? This would contribute to your rising PSA. Simultaneously this would decrease your PSAD. Just food for thought! What measurement do you use for your prostate size? - TRUS measurement? If so, which date? - MRI measurement? What was the date? Lastly, since you are in/near CHI, have you considered getting a 2nd opinion? I'm not in any way challenging your current URO's position but another opinion provides a fresh perspective and may or may not shed light. Possibly they recommend a different type of imaging scan. Both michiganman16 & ReadyTo Fight went to UC for 2nd opinions and never looked back. For certain you & your MD(s) are monitoring this closely. Good job! Hoping the mystery is soon solved with a benign explanation! MF 20% jump in three months warrants a more aggressive investigation, for sure. It sure would not hurt to get a different set of eyes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Chi !!! Sorry that the \"bafflement\" continues. Everything that you have posted to date is not suggestive of PC. (Correction:Jim215 has since reminded me that you do in fact have prior biopsies with G6). However, your steadily rising PSA requires continued attention. You now have 3 consecutive PSA rises > 10 since last August. This is 1 metric that must be weighed to make the decision to continue AS. Is it possible that you are experiencing some type of as symptomatic BPH? This would contribute to your rising PSA. Simultaneously this would decrease your PSAD. Just food for thought! What measurement do you use for your prostate size? - TRUS measurement? If so, which date? - MRI measurement? What was the date? Lastly, since you are in/near CHI, have you considered getting a 2nd opinion? I'm not in any way challenging your current URO's position but another opinion provides a fresh perspective and may or may not shed light. Possibly they recommend a different type of imaging scan. Both michiganman16 & ReadyTo Fight went to UC for 2nd opinions and never looked back. For certain you & your MD(s) are monitoring this closely. Good job! Hoping the mystery is soon solved with a benign explanation! MF 20% jump in three months warrants a more aggressive investigation, for sure. It sure would not hurt to get a different set of eyes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dml I was on TRT when my PCa was discovered. I had surgery, a favorably pathology (I had a single small focus of Gleason Pattern 4, the rest was 3, clean margins, etc. Six months after my RALP, I resumed TRT and the QOL that goes with it (for me). 15 months later, my PSA remains undetectable. My doc told me that the earlier TRT did not cause my PCa. He also said that if I have a recurrence, it won't be due to the TRT. Trust me, I have read and researched extensively in this area, as have my surgeon and endo. I was the first person either allowed to resume TRT at 6 months post-op. For me, the QOL gained is worth any potential/perceived risks. Please remember that my body is considered to be completely clear of PCa at this point in time. If I have a recurrence, I imagine the TRT will end at that point in time. I will have my 21 month PSA today. Normally, my docs would have switched me to every 6 months by now, but they were a bit more cautious and I've been tested quarterly since my surgery. Everyone needs to decide what risk they think exists. And, what benefit does the TRT bring. Does one outweigh the other? Taking testosterone \"just because\" makes no sense, IMO. I have a deficiency and it is resolved and I feel so much better with the medication. This study in this link would tend to support your experience, and in fact appears to show a benefit. This interests me only in that there is no true consensus post prostatectomy. The current consensus appears to be a pre-prostatectomy medical opinion applied post prostatectomy.",

Dr. Davis told him 2 1/2 hour surgery but didn't mention recovery. Is it typical to be in the recovery room 4 hours? I can't see him during that time? Thank you all for your uplifting thoughts! It's about right... I went in at 9AM, was in the OR 1015'ish, and woke up 4PM'ish in my room. Dr. Davis will likely come out and talk to you during those 4 hours. He came back and talked to me after I had awoken... likely do the same with you. They'll want your husband to do get up later in the evening and take a walk. It's not easy, but an effort must be made. I was a bit dizzy at first as I sat up on the hospital bed. I hung on to the IV carrier as I walked around the nurses station a couple of times. Walking is important to help prevent blood clots, even though compression socks/tubes are worn. The walking also helps with bowel movements and passing gas.",
