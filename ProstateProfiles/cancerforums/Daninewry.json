      "Content": "My dad is 76, fit and healthy. He has suffered from nocturia and sometimes slow to start peeing. In 2015 it was discovered on ultrasound that he had an enlarged prostate. PSA was done and it was 6.9 then 6.7 then 6.5. The test wasn\u0092t repeated until 15th of feb this year when it was discovered that his PSA was 8.7 so the dr repeated the PSA three weeks later and it had risen to 9.3 which is a massive increase in such a short space of time. The thing is that the dr did a DRE just before the last blood test. The DRE found a large smooth prostate. He has now been referred to urology. I can\u0092t sleep thinking he must have an aggressive cancer with such an increase in PSA in a short space of time.",
