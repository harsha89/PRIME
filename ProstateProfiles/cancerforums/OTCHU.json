PC detected in October 2012 Gleason 7: < = 5% After 2 opinions just to be sure, I decided to have the prostate remove I am going to have a radical perineal prostatectomy (RPP) at the CTCA (Cancer treatment center of America) at Philly the 8th January. Doctor Sloane will do the surgery. The CTCA is wonderful and I recommend it to everybody. Hes going to try to do the nerves sparing but not sure at 100% that will be possible (depend if the cancer will be in this area or not). I am very very very nervous right now. Still can not believe that does happen to me at 41 years old. But will take the best of what will happen from now. I will keep you posted guys .... good luck to everybody",

      "Content": "ok its been 9 days since the surgery .... The surgeon said that everything did go well. He was able to save the nerves both sides. YEahhhhhhhhh The recovery is pretty hard specially because the surgery was a RPP. But that was my choice. I was very comfortable with the surgeon and preferred to have a hard time of recovery with good outcome than fast recovery with doubts of outcome. The hardest time is to sit down ... That 's going to take a while to feel better but I just need to be patience ... if u guys have some tips about recovery from RPP .... I am going to the hospital tomorrow to take out my catheter ... finally !!! this thing is annoying and painful sometime too. The surgeon told me that I should have the result of my prostate in about 2 weeks (surprise bc usually that take just 1 week). So, so far so good .... It's strange to say that but yes, I am living without prostate now and hopefully I will be able to say in few days, living without PC !",

      "Content": "Hello everybody. First sorry if I do English mistakes ... still need to improve that. I am 40 years old and after a high level PSA, I did a biopsy last week and yesterday I got the result. I do have prostate cancer I will have an appointment with a specialist in 10 days on the 13 samples, 3 are bad .... here the numbers, if somebody can explain me ... I dont understand : Core(cm) Gleason %PCA 1.5 3+3 5% 1.0 3+3 <5% 1.1 3+4 5% so the doctor told me that I will have to choose my options: - remove with a robot the prostate - freeze the prostate - radiation I really dont know right now and I am lost. I know removing prostate will have side effects (going to the bathroom and sex). Are my result are bad ? If i choose radiation, can I avoid the side effects that I said before ? Is it smart to do that ? Please guys, I need some advices .... I am so young for that",

Will be a last minute urge ? or will be like before, just will need to go in few minutes ? Is it going to burn or any pain for a while ? I forget to ask the doctor about that. So I should have the prostate result in 1 week from now (dont know why, this process take 3 weeks ... most of u guys, did take only 1 week). I going to order the pump ... I am on cialis since 3 days (5mg everyday). Going back to the doctor in 2 months for a PSA test and (if my penis did not move yet) begin to do injection. Any suggestions guys ???",

I am since 4 days on 5mg Cialis ... right now, nothing ... should I begin to exercise him right now or do I need to wait a little bit ? The hospital recommended me a pump from a manufacturer. It's about $300 and my assurance doesn't cover it. I did check on ebay and can found a lot of them for about $50. Are they ok to buy ? Looks like to me they are doing exactly the same job ... right ?
