      "Content": "Hi. I have done a bit of research on ascites because of my edema. Also my son has cirrhosis of the liver. The very limited things I have learned is that liver damage can cause ascites. It's a symptom of late stage liver failure. It also is a sign of late stage PC. That's about all I can tell you as my knowledge about this is limited. The fact that he is in hospice would suggest he won't be treated for this. I'm so sorry to hear that your father has to be going through this.",
