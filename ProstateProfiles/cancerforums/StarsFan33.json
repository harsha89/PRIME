      "Content": "Originally Posted by dowtar I am 61YOA. Yes, I have seen a urologist. As noted, my PSA went from 2.4 in April, 2013 to 4.8 in August 2014. My urologist performed a second PSA and it was 4.4 in September. I went to the urologist in September. He did a DRE and said the prostate was normal, although large (not enlarged, just large). He questioned whether the August PSA test was accurate. I had done everything you are not supposed to do before the August PSA (sex, extensive bike riding, etc.), so he did a second blood test. I also had no symptoms. The urologist told me to live a celibate, quiet life for a week and then he did another blood test, which resulted in a PSA of 4.4. His nurse then called and said that because my PSA went from 2.6 to 4.4 over a year, he wanted to do a biopsy. I'm scheduled for a biopsy on Monday. So, everything the urologist has done so far has been logical and reasonable. I was not referred to this doctor. I chose this urologist because (1) his office is in an affluent, older area of DFW, (2) he has been selected two years in a row as one of the \"Best Urology Doctors\" in the Dallas area by Dallas Magazine, (Dallas Magazine is \"the\" monthly magazine geared to the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex) and (3) he does DaVinci surgery. Unfortunately, I don't really have a feel for the guy. Hello! My father just had his surgery done by Doctor Scott Webster at Baylor of Dallas. He is the chief of urology and a member of Urology Clinics of North Texas. Unfortunately, I failed to ask a lot of questions such as how many surgeries he had done...BUT, according to my research of local surgeons...he was considered to be the best in DFW for that surgery so we went with it. I think as a surgeon, he was excellent and we have no complaints. I am not as comfortable with the idea of using him for care after the surgery but that is a personality thing more then anything else im sure. I wish you the very best and hope it turns out to be nothing. Steve",

      "Content": "Hello all. Sorry for the dramatic threat headline...but it is how we feel. We just recently learned that my father who is 62 years old, has PC. When we first learned, it was all glossed over as no big deal. We were told PC cancer is the one to have if you have to have one, and that it is very treatable, and very beatable and not really a big deal. Once we heard the word cancer....we were stunned! But after much of the \"it's very treatable\" and \"don't worry\"....we all felt safe in believing this was just something that would require some treatment, and everything would be \"OK\". Dad had to wait a couple of weeks for the biopsy...and then almost a week for the results. When he went for the results, the doctor told him that it was an aggressive form of cancer and that all 12 of the plugs/biopsies were positive. The doctor told him that 10 of the 12 biopsies had a gleason score of 9, while the other 2 had a gleason score of 8. He did not find out or remember if the 9's were 4+5 or 5+4....him and my mother both couldn't think of ANY questions at the time...they were too shell shocked. So this is essentially ALL that we know at this point. The doctor told him it was a very aggressive form of cancer and would have to be treated very aggressively as well. The doctor has ordered bone and CT scans that Dad will have on Monday...and he will go back to his diagnosing urologist on Tuesday to get the results. I have already taken the liberties to get dad an appointment with the Chief of urology at the Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor Hospital of Dallas on Wednesday to get second opinions and discuss treatment options. With the limited info we have, I am struggling to determin what are the \"MUST ASK\" questions that we will need to determin the best treatment options for him, and that will give us the fullest picture. Obviously, we want to deal with facts...but we want to be hopeful too because we believe a lot of battles are lost or won based on hope and positive attitudes of patients and treating doctors. Any advise from people who are in, or have been in the same boat as our family, would be greatly appreciated! Thank you, Steve",

When we first learned, it was all glossed over as no big deal. We were told PC cancer is the one to have if you have to have one, and that it is very treatable, and very beatable and not really a big deal. Once we heard the word cancer....we were stunned! But after much of the \"it's very treatable\" and \"don't worry\"....we all felt safe in believing this was just something that would require some treatment, and everything would be \"OK\". Dad had to wait a couple of weeks for the biopsy...and then almost a week for the results. When he went for the results, the doctor told him that it was an aggressive form of cancer and that all 12 of the plugs/biopsies were positive. The doctor told him that 10 of the 12 biopsies had a gleason score of 9, while the other 2 had a gleason score of 8. He did not find out or remember if the 9's were 4+5 or 5+4....him and my mother both couldn't think of ANY questions at the time...they were too shell shocked. So this is essentially ALL that we know at this point. The doctor told him it was a very aggressive form of cancer and would have to be treated very aggressively as well.

I have already taken the liberties to get dad an appointment with the Chief of urology at the Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor Hospital of Dallas on Wednesday to get second opinions and discuss treatment options. With the limited info we have, I am struggling to determin what are the \"MUST ASK\" questions that we will need to determin the best treatment options for him, and that will give us the fullest picture.

      "Content": "Dad had never had probate exam unfortunately. His PSA was 20 The only reason they even discovered it was because he was having trouble with urinating and so after a few weeks of struggling with a very strong urge to P but not much fluid coming out dad made an appointment and went to the doctor. In that appointment they discovered that he did in fact have a urinary track infection and that the prostate was in fact enlarged. From there they set dad. Based on that information and a PSA of 20, the doctor told dad that he believed he likely had prostate cancer and he wanted to do a biopsy. Fast forward a couple of weeks they did the biopsy and found the results I posted earlier. And that's where were at now. I appreciate so much everybody on the forum being willing to discuss share and inform new people like myself.",

      "Content": "Hey guys! It has been a while since I have posted but last I was here I had posted that my 62 year old father had been diagnosed with Gleason 9 disease and he had the da vinci surgery. While removing the prostate, they also took a sampling of 25 lymph node's and of the 25, 10 showed positive for prostate cancer in the nodes. He had already prior to surgery been given the 3 month hormone therapy injection. Once we found that the surgery was not going to provide a cure due to the lymph nodes testing positive, we chose to seek out a medical oncologist. This oncologist followed up by putting him on Casodex along with the injection. Of course he is experiencing all the typical side effects, but one of the worst (for him) is the inability to control his emotions. By this, what I am talking about is, he will tear up at the drop of a hat, and cry over things that may normaly make him feel sad, but nothing that would bring him to tears. For example...just missing his other son that is in the military. Before, he may miss him, and think about him, but it wouldn't bring him to tears. Now, when he thinks about it and misses him, he crys. and he can't control it. His Oncologist says he needs to go see a psycitrist, and that makes dad even more upset because he doesn't believe he needs one. He says he isn't depressed and he isn't feeling anything different then normal, it's just that he has no ability to prevent himself from tears over it. It's driving him absolutely insane, and it is the most frustraighting thing he is dealing with. does anyone know of any ways to manage this side effect??? Also, he is having major swelling in his thigh/leg/feet on one side and we believe it is lymphedema. Shortly after the surgery they discovered an abseced pocket of lymph fluid in his gut that they had to drain for almost a week. now, that appears to be normal but his leg is swelling. It is almost twice the size of his other leg. In other news, while I keep reading that the hormone therapy doesn't offer a cure, according to dad's oncologist, post surgery and after adding the casodex with the shot, dads PET and PSA has come back clean and his PSA in 0. The oncologist says he is currently cancer free, but that they must monitor it because it will most likely return in the future. thoughts, comments, suggestions??? Thank you, Steve",

Once we found that the surgery was not going to provide a cure due to the lymph nodes testing positive, we chose to seek out a medical oncologist....Once we found that the surgery was not going to provide a cure due to the lymph nodes testing positive, we chose to seek out a medical oncologist. This oncologist followed up by putting him on Casodex along with the injection....I was not referred to this doctor.
