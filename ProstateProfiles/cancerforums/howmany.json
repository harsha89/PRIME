Not sure if that affects PSA. I also take a daily 81 mg aspirin and saw palmetto on the advice of my primary. In October of 2016 I began exhibiting all the signs of BPH confirmed by DRE by both my primary and urologist. Put on Flomax which I've continued to take. During my followup visit to my urologist in 12/17 he expressed concern with PSA velocity and scheduled a biopsy in January. Said DRE was smooth and symmetrical. Both my father and his father suffered from BPH but were never diagnosed with PC. Dad made it to 85 and Gramps to 83. Both succumbed to heart issues. Nervous as hell over the biopsy. Interested in thoughts on my situation and also thoughts on the newer 3T MRI's now available for prostate scans and if suspicious areas found using the MRI for a guided biopsy. Seems like a better approach than a TRUS biopsy which seems somewhat random. I turned 59 in 10/17. Looking into getting a PHI test but neither my uro nor my primary care doc offer it. Thanks in advance to all you knowledgeable folks.",

      "Content": "Hello all, My PSA numbers - 12/13 - 1.6 12/14 - 1.7 12/15 - 1.6 12/16 - 1.9 12/17 - 3.24 The night prior to the 12/2017 blood test I went to the gym and lifted heavy, as is my habit. Not sure if that affects PSA. I also take a daily 81 mg aspirin and saw palmetto on the advice of my primary. In October of 2016 I began exhibiting all the signs of BPH confirmed by DRE by both my primary and urologist. Put on Flomax which I've continued to take. During my followup visit to my urologist in 12/17 he expressed concern with PSA velocity and scheduled a biopsy in January. Said DRE was smooth and symmetrical. Both my father and his father suffered from BPH but were never diagnosed with PC. Dad made it to 85 and Gramps to 83. Both succumbed to heart issues. Nervous as hell over the biopsy. Interested in thoughts on my situation and also thoughts on the newer 3T MRI's now available for prostate scans and if suspicious areas found using the MRI for a guided biopsy. Seems like a better approach than a TRUS biopsy which seems somewhat random. I turned 59 in 10/17. Looking into getting a PHI test but neither my uro nor my primary care doc offer it. Thanks in advance to all you knowledgeable folks.",
