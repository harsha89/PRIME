      "Content": "I am a 64 year old male who has had no significant jump in PSA's over the last 15 years - example PSA's from 2005 forward have been > 1.2, 1.2, 1.8, 2.1, 2.1, 2.8, 2.3, 2.7, 2.5. I went to a free Prostate Screening recently and the Urologist who did my DRE said one side of my prostate didn't feel smooth and kind of blended in with the rectal wall or whatever is down there? Not sure the verbage. Well, I scheduled an appointment 4 weeks later with another Uro who does more Prostate work. He agreed with the first Uro and said not to be alarmed but he suggests the only real alternative is a Biopsy to see if there is anything going on. My question is, has anyone had anything like this? What is the incidence of Cancer without any high PSA Levels? The physician said there are no bumps or anything but the Prostate perimeter is not defined on one side. I am sure it is enlarged. Any incite would be helpful!",

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, I appreciate your post for sure. Are you a health care professional? You sound like you know an awful lot! I will probably get a biopsy in the next couple of months. The Dr. was not overly concerned and he left it to me to either come back in 3 months or set up a Biopsy when I am ready. Thx again! Tom",
