      "Content": "I posted the following on the ProstateCancerUK forum (I am in the UK) to see what response I would get. It proved interesting as to how some managers support their staff and others either block it out or ignore it. Is it the word Cancer that causes a problem? I wondered how my brothers in the US felt they were treated. I was wondering of the word cancer has lost its meaning, tell anyone you have cancer and they seem to have preconceived ideas and prejudices. They often fail to recognise that this is a disease like any other with very variable outcomes. My experience is that I was diagnosed with PC and prior & post op not one of my managers at work have asked how I am, and want to really know the answer (you can sense they want to hear \"I'm OK now thanks\"), however three of my suppliers have called me and wanted to talk, ask questions and listen and 4 colleagues from work show interest. I do not blame my managers or the other work colleagues, as my wife says they probably don't know what to say. This is where we need to either educate people to really ask how we are or if the word cancer is stopping them, we come up with a new one. Interestingly I have put two posters up regarding PC and a note from me giving some statistics and saying that if anyone wants to talk then I am always available. There are over 100 men of all ages work in my company and not one person has approached to find out more. Are all men ostriches really? Sorry I am rambling a bit now. Maybe this is just my flight of fancy, but I wondered how your colleagues, managers and even friends reacted to the word and the disease. Tony",

      "Content": "Hi Guys I am in the UK and my local rep who supplies through our NHS penis pumps came to see me today to sort a pump out, 6 weeks post RP. Just as he was about to leave he showed us a new product, the Viberect, developed by Arthur L. Burnett, M.D. of Johns Hopkins University. I asked him if there were any clinical trials that have proven a benefit from this $300 unit. He said that it was difficult to run a clinical trial as all men post op have different nerve damage, etc although a trial is taking place. Now, our NHS will not supply this and I believe no insurance companies in the US supply it, so has anyone actually bought one and found it of real use. I can read all the testimonials on the companies website, but to be honest I don't believe them. Any advice welcome. Regards Tony",
