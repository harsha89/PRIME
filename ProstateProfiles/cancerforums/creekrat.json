I am taking softeners that do not seem to be helping much. My concern is that there is an upcoming marker procedure and straining is not good afterward. Wondering if I'm alone, or if not, what have others tried? I find myself relying on this site more and more. Thank you!",

      "Content": "Ever since the initial diagnosis I have been reading about long term side effects of RT and HT. It seems unrealistic to expect none after having forty five sessions of RT over a couple months, ending fourteen months ago. My next scheduled follow up and Urologist appointment is not til October but I'm noticing some changes recently and thought I'd throw them out here for possible comment as I've found this forum immensely helpful. Maybe someone on here has experienced something similar. First, the noise. There has been a marked increase in intestinal growling, I mean full on organ recitals that can be heard across a room by others. No discomfort. Second, gas. lately I can push a five or six second, two octave fart that would have made me a peep hero in grade school. Not so much now. Again, very little discomfort unless I'm forced to hold them so as not to embarrass my wife or me. Third, is some kind of sticky discharge. Best description I can provide is it seems like mucus. Very little fecal matter, pretty much clear. These are questions for the next Dr's visit, obviously, but wondering if there could be a more immediate need for attention. I feel good, and very relieved as to the outcome to date but want to stay on top of things. The side effects from the HT are mostly gone since the last shot was a year ago. Did not like them and so hope they are behind me for good. Thanks again in advance. This forum is the best!",

      "Content": "Ever since the initial diagnosis I have been reading about long term side effects of RT and HT. It seems unrealistic to expect none after having forty five sessions of RT over a couple months, ending fourteen months ago. My next scheduled follow up and Urologist appointment is not til October but I'm noticing some changes recently and thought I'd throw them out here for possible comment as I've found this forum immensely helpful. Maybe someone on here has experienced something similar. First, the noise. There has been a marked increase in intestinal growling, I mean full on organ recitals that can be heard across a room by others. No discomfort. Second, gas. lately I can push a five or six second, two octave fart that would have made me a peep hero in grade school. Not so much now. Again, very little discomfort unless I'm forced to hold them so as not to embarrass my wife or me. Third, is some kind of sticky discharge. Best description I can provide is it seems like mucus. Very little fecal matter, pretty much clear. These are questions for the next Dr's visit, obviously, but wondering if there could be a more immediate need for attention. I feel good, and very relieved as to the outcome to date but want to stay on top of things. The side effects from the HT are mostly gone since the last shot was a year ago. Did not like them and so hope they are behind me for good. Thanks again in advance. This forum is the best!",

He completed a colonoscopy nine months ago in November and after my visit today, his opinion is \" radiation proctolisys \" ( sp ). This is damage from the EBRT regimen completed fifteen months ago and it can be clearly seen. No huge surprise! Unrealistic to think there would be no effects.

At the same time, this could just be something basically harmless and not related to the treatments. Let's see what others have to say. In the meantime, good luck to you!

      "Content": "Morning; Love this site but wish I did not need to be here just like all of you. Had the first hormone injections 12/16, 30 day. Some soreness in the injection area but bearable, and a little irritability. Next is a six month dose set for 1/13, but prior to that I will have the markers implanted on 1/9. Similar procedure to a biopsy. They give the radiation techs a consistent target. The real protocol begins on 3/6 with a cat scan and dry run. Then 45 rad sessions, extra due to the agressiveness of my particular diagnosis. Gives us six weeks to get my head straight in Key Largo and treatments should be finished by Memorial Day. Can't say enough about the folks at Delaware Valley Urology, they make me feel like I'm the only patient they have. I should add that radiation is the only recommended course in my case due to age and other factors and every opinion agreed. I too, am confident and comfortable with the selected treatment. \"As far as anyone knows, we only get one shot at this life, but if we do it right, one is enough\". Wishing us all well!

I found it immensely helpful and come here every day, offer input when I feel it could be of use. I'm nine months post RT and HT, had RT only, no surgery, but met many having salvage and shared much. I'll take the side effects and find them manageable, it's better than any option. Of course each individual is different and will react differently. I'm pretty sure the HT causes a lot of the side effects. In addition to the hot flashes, weight gain, and sleep issues, much of my body hair is gone, bowel movements are much changed and I'm still up at night anywhere from two to six times, and it's urgent. Sexual activity is a distant memory too and as of yet shows no sign of returning. On the other hand, I'm much older, and do have those memories. Read and study all you can, you will make it through this!",

So I ended up learning how to build up the sensation right to the point of the pain starting, and the orgasm sensation kinda dies down, but I am learning how to just stay at the edge, and enjoy multiple orgasms...

Four weeks till another of these, then short waiting time before starting radiation. This urological center has an on line patient portal where I can go for any information any time and it is very detailed. Maybe that is common? I am a 4+5 Gleason and a T2c score. Have decided to stay right where I started close to home. Everything I've read, studied, and heard makes me feel comfortable with this decision. Even the surgeon I spoke with thought radiation was the right course in my case. Maybe his cars are paid off? (joke)!",

Currently on HT, complete eunuch, night and day sweats and trouble sleeping. Otherwise no other complaints worth mentioning. I want to add that I'm very comfortable with Delaware Valley Urology. They make one feel you are the only patient they are treating. In my situation and with my prognosis, the only course suggested was this radiation regimen. I'm buckled up for the ride and hoping and praying for the best possible outcome. I am blessed with a super supportive wife and a huge family. That fact has already made it so much easier.",

What parameters determine how many in each case? I won't see the doc till next Wednesday to ask him but it may give us another topic to discuss, as if we needed one.",

Those of you who had the procedure drop a quick note as to how long before control was recovered if you would be so kind. Well aware every situation is different. Surgery itself went well, recovery took longer than hoped but bladder remains the biggest issue after three and a half weeks. I have come to appreciate this forum and thank you all in advance!",
