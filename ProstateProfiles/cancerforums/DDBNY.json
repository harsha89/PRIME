      "Content": "Unfortunately as of this week. Luckily he finally listened to me and got checked as he had frequent movements which he just attributed to sugar. He is very stubborn/private so I am doing all homework needed to get a better idea. I believe (could be reversed as he didn't want someone with him at consulation) that his PSA is 6 and his Gleason is 4.2. However his DR. did say 2 tumors, one is larger and \"aggressive\" He is 59 and in good health/shape. He begins radiology on monday which is scary because from what Ive read here, most effected usually have more time to wait. Any thoughts/info appreciated.",
