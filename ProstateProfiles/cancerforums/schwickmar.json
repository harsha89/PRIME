      "Content": "Hello all. My father was first diagnosed with his aggressive form of prostate cancer in 1999; its severity and high gleason score likely the result of Agent Orange. He has always been as pro-active in his healthcare as possible, but it seems as though our options are growing fewer. He originally underwent surgery and radiation, and in the years since then he has participated in studies and clinical trials including, but not limited to, Lupron, Enzalutamide, and Abiraterone Acetate. He has had tremendous success with the Abiraterone, but was unable to secure a spot in a current study in which the drug is available and as many of you may know, the cost of procuring it privately are astronomical. At this point, his current treatment doesn't seem to be as effective as we would like; while his lymph nodes are staying the same size (or increasing only nominally), his PSA continues to rise - It was up over 300 last check. He is expecting his doctor to recommend Chemotherapy as his next step. I wanted to see if there was anyone who had undergone Chemo for prostate cancer, and if so, what your experiences were - We only know of one gentleman personally who received chemo treatments and he lost his battle with the disease in short order. Chemo has always seemed like a last resort to us, and one where we need to seriously consider quantity vs. quality of life. In addition, I would also be interested in any alternative treatment options you're aware of that have been successful for you personally, or people you may know. Other than the slightly enlarged lymph nodes, Dad's bone scans have been coming back clean and his cancer has not yet spread. As he was given a pretty grim outlook when he was first diagnosed, we know we are fortunate he's been with us for the past 15+ years, but as the mother of two children under the age of two, neither Grandpa nor any of the rest of us are ready to just concede defeat. In no uncertain terms, the prospect of Chemo scares the hell out of all of us. Thank you in advance for your input.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace You referred to Agent Orange exposure. I am receiving some money from the VA and could receive treatment from the VA if I wanted. Do you have a VA entitlement to treatments like Zytiga? My entitlement was approved fairly quickly, after providing good documentation. I would also mention that chemo for prostate cancer is usually not nearly as harsh as older chemo treatment used to be. I have not had chemo myself. Good luck pursuing further treatment. Thank you, lancepeace. Dad was declared 100% disabled through the VA not too long after he was diagnosed, but he also does not receive treatment through the VA directly. I just talked to him about your post and he said his doctor would do what was needed to get him the Zygita if he wanted it, but his doctor has advised him that because his cancer is so aggressive, Chemo would be the thing that would hit it hardest, so that's why he would recommend it even over the abiraterone acetate that has been successful for Dad in the past. Dad has been reading up on the Chemo himself as well, and it seems (as with any treatment, I know), the results are so varied. But much of what he's run across shows that Chemo has prolonged patient's life expectancy by 18 months or so. Even with the chemicals being less harsh than they used to be, if that's the likely outlook, it doesn't seem to buy us enough time to be worthwhile unless the side-effects are next to nothing... (I always learn a little more about what the doctor said each time I talk to him... The stubborn man still tries to protect his \"little\" girl as best he can; I guess it serves me well to have ended up as hard-headed as he is",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Have you tried Xtandi? Like Zytiga (Abiraterone Acetate) it's very expensive too but it's an approved treatment with an excellent success record. Push for it..Yes, the VA will push back, it's a never-ending battle.. It's another issue, but we need to change the way \"Cancer Drugs\" are developed and marketed.. Otherwise, pretty soon, only millionaires will be able to afford cancer treatment... I take a supplement called \"Pomi-T\" You can find it online, ebay even.. I don't know if it does anything but it's cheap and it can't hurt....My PSA is behaving nicely.. Best of luck to you... Thanks for your input, Fairwind. Dad has used the enzalutimide (Xtandi) and his doctor has suggested he use that again following chemo. Thanks for the Pomi-T suggestion - Dad went through a spell where he drank a lot of pomegrante juice, so I'll run the supplement idea past him. Thanks to you, too, lancepeace. I'd never really thought about him trying the Docetaxel and then stopping if he was having a more adverse reaction than he wanted. Most of what I've read up on as far as the docetaxel goes is the experience of breast cancer patients, and it seemed like a good many of them had awful side-effects. But, the other side of that coin, I suppose, is that people tend to chime in more when they've had a bad experience with something than when they've had a good experience...",
