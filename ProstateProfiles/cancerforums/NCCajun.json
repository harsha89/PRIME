      "Content": "My husband did chemo and hormone therapy prior to surgery. Before treatment, he had many many tumors throughout abdomen area and 3 positive lymph nodes. In fact, one tumor was so close to the rectum, that his surgery would have been cancelled if chemo didn't work. Thankfully, chemo worked. I will never forget the day when doctors told us surgery was a go because of the chemo and hormone therapy. The path report after surgery showed 2 nodes positive. Danny's cancer is ductual prostate cancer that is aggressive and rare. It's been 3 years since his surgery and still cancer free. There isn't much info on patients 5 years after diagnosis and our oncologist is pleasantly surprised that cancer hasn't come back yet. We went in with faith and hope but no promises.....Never give up!!!!!",

The cancer has spread to the bladder, urethra, and ureter. PET Scan in Jan didn't show any other advancement. Plan A is chemo then surgery to remove prostate, bladder, lymph nodes. Hopefully they will be able to get negative margins in the urethra and ureter. There is also concern that it's extremely close to the rectum as well; hasn't invaded yet, just close. We really didn't discuss what we would do if the tumors didn't shrink, guess we'll find out next month when we head back to Texas. The two chem meds are Cabazitaxel and Carboplatin. The first hormone shot was Degarelix and the last one was Lupron. It seems like his pain level is getting worse everyday instead of decreasing and there's nothing I can do to help....frustrating and infuriating.",

AND cancer has not spread to any other organs. Which meant they were able to take the ureter stents out without having to go the OR. He had a round of chemo while we were there, and scheduled for another in three weeks, here at home. We're going back next month, and hopefully they will be able to schedule his surgery. After 4 months of bad news, pain, and waiting, we finally got great news. Scary that the great news is that it's looking like he will still be able to have his prostate and bladder removed. He's scheduled for and endorectal MRI next month. We're praying that this will show that the tumor has moved away from the rectum as well. One day at a time...one day at a time.",

Unfortunately, the infections disease dr that's handling his case will be out of town.

      "Content": "Thanks Highlander for the links.... Micheal, he has urostomy bag, so no cath. They think the preventative antibiotics he was on for UTI is what caused the C Diff in the first place. He spend 11 days in hospital and they were able to get negative stool tests for the C Diff. And he was since tested positive as well as negative. The next time he tests positive, our doctor is going to get us into a doctor at Methodist Hospital(right next to MDA) who is doing fecal transplants with great results for people with C Diff. But without a positive test, he isn't eligible for the study...so we're waiting for the next positive test. Infectious Disease department was called in because of the nature of the problem as well as being able to regulate the antibiotics better. In fact the gastro dr at MDA is letting ID handle the case...the ID doctor is more knowledgeable about this than the gastro. I guess I'm worried that the cancer has spread and that's whats causing the problems. Apparently, ductual will metastasize to organs before it does bones, and he had a lot of tumors in and around the abdomen so the scare is always there. We'll find out next week, but still....can't help worrying.",
