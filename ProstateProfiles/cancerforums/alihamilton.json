      "Content": "I know I might be jumping ahead a little but am concerned about my husband's latest PSA level of 15. He is to be retested tomorrow but the levels have been going up over the past few months at am alarming rate. He will have a biopsy if the levels are indeed high. My first thought was that if he has pc, then surgery would be the best way to go, but now I am reading that high numbers suggest it might have spread and that radiation is more effective. My concern about this is that he had rectal cancer 6 1/2 years ago and had radiation at that time too. As the prostate and rectum are not that far apart, it is possible for him to get more radiotherapy in that area? He is still affected by the treatment for the rectal cancer. 10 years ago, he had a biopsy when his PSA was 12 and the result was that he had BPH, but he has since had a turp to reduce the size of the prostate, so I feel it is unlikely to be BPH again. He is 71 years old. Any input would be much appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the response. We live in a small country, on an even smaller island and there are only four oncologists in total, so none specialize in any particular cancer. The same oncologist who treated my husband's rectal cancer, treated my lymphoma. The urologist is the one who deals with prostate cancer here and has given us the options. External radiation can be done here, but the seed implantation would have to be done in the US. We are not sure what the actual Stage is because of the previous turp surgery which removed a good bit of the prostate. The urologist feels it is most likely a 2, rather than 1.

      "Content": "Thanks for the response. We live in a small country, on an even smaller island and there are only four oncologists in total, so none specialize in any particular cancer. The same oncologist who treated my husband's rectal cancer, treated my lymphoma. The urologist is the one who deals with prostate cancer here and has given us the options. External radiation can be done here, but the seed implantation would have to be done in the US. We are not sure what the actual Stage is because of the previous turp surgery which removed a good bit of the prostate. The urologist feels it is most likely a 2, rather than 1.
