After the frustration of finding that there really was no one proper, scientifically better than the others choice, we decided the one thing we could control was the quality of the treatment input into our personal formula. Since we have one of the worlds most experienced prostate surgeons within a couple hour drive, and since radiation requires a more complex team of folks who each have a role (mark the spots, calibrate the machine, issue the treatment), and therefore more variables, we decided on the surgery. We feel like it is the right choice for him even though every couple of days I still think about the options. As you all well know, there is no one answer, just a decision and plowing forward!",
