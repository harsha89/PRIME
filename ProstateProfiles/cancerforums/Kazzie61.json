      "Content": "Hi All, I have posted on here and received invaluable advice when it was suspected my husband had prostate cancer and later on when he was diagnosed. My husband is 51, he had Gleason 7 (3=4 and 4=3) with G4 patern. A PSA of 9, there was seminal vesicle involvement and he was T3. His lymph nodes and bone scan are clear. He was offered radiotherapy and prostatectomy, he opted for a prostatectomy which he had on May 14th. When the surgeon telephoned me to tell me the op was over. I can't remember exactly what he said but it was roughly the cancer was (very) aggressive,his whole prostate was cancer and he said it was tricky to remove as it was 'sticky'. Prior to the op Terry was told he may well need radiotherapy but the surgeon told me in that phone call he definitely will need radiotherapy. Left nerve bundle completely removed,right not touched. On Terry's post op appointment on June 14th what questions should we ask? I have written down...Were the margins negative? Is the Gleason score upgraded after tumour examined? Why were lymph nodes left when he was told they'd be removed? What was the extent of the 'involvement' of the seminal vesicle? When will the radiotherapy begin,how long/much radiotherapy is needed? They've not really given any information on the seminal vesicle involvement before the op and I'm sure the outcome of that is quite significant? Terry's urine continence is not too bad and improving. In the UK they don't seem to be put any concern on the erectile function as yet. Maybe they'll give advice on that as post op appointment. These seem quite basic questions I'm sure there is more information we should have and questions we should ask.Any advice or input as always would be much appreciated.",

After advice from here I aksed for Terry's pathology report after his biopsy in March and the consultant was surprised. I'm almost certain that in the UK patients aren't as proactive,although they should be. I will ask for path report at 4 week check up on June 14th. I wanted to ask but maybe I should start a new thread, what is the difference between salvage and aduvant radiotherapy? Thanks again for your help.",

I just thought that is BRAC1 and 2 are linked as are breast cancer and prostate cancer why family members can't have the test done that women can,maybe that is for the future. In the paper last week I was shocked to read about a man that had the world's first preventative prosatectomy, I think it was in the UK although not sure. The article said the Urologist was extremely reluctant to do it until the man involved proved through tests that what ever it was that was tiny and passive in his prostate would become prostate cancer. I wonder if preventative prostaectomy will ever become as widespread as preventative mastectomy.",

We didn't see a consulatant just a registrar who said my husband case had been discussed and she is passing on the information. They said the tumour is large 10mm and intermediately aggressive. His Gleason score was 7 (3+4) but when I looked at the pathology results it seems just as many were 4+3? His last PSA was 9 up from 8 point something 2 months before. Registrar said he is stage 3A? There is definite involvement of the seminal vehicles. They are reccomending a radical robotic prostatectomy because of his age (50) then adjunct radiotherapy. She wasn't able to tell us prognosis of the cancer being cleared or the likelihood of recurrence. He is being sent for an urgent bone scan and pet scan to check the lymph nodes- we don't know if this is normal procedure or they suspect cancer has spread?

      "Content": "Hi All, I've posted before but as I haven't done a signature thingy will give brief(!) details if Ok with you all. If anyone can stick with this I'd be so grateful I need someone to talk to. My husband is 50 and was diagosed with PC after having a gleason score of 9. He had a palpable tumour,the biopsy showed cores of 3+4 and 4+3. The MRI showed left side seminal vesicle invasion. Lymph nodes and bone scan clear. After being told he had middle to aggressive cancer and that biopsy's can underestimate a gleason score he decided on surgery. The surgeon said we are going to cure this. He has the DaVinci about 5 weeks ago. After the op (before i'd seen my husband) the surgeon calls you uo to say how the op went, he said Terry had a very nasty cancer (like there's a good one!!) it was 'sticky' and that he would defintely need radiotherapy. Previously we'd been told he only may need it so I knew he'd seen something to say that before he had the patholgy results. Left nerve bundle removed and right one left intact. When we went for the post op appointment 4/5 weeks later surgeon told us cancer had spread from the prostate in four places, three were negative margins and one was positive. He said this area was too close to the rectum so this is why he will need aduvant radiotherapy. We return on August 9th to see him again and to meet with the radiologist,he'll get his first PSA results then too. I asked for the pathpogy report and the attitide is more or less just leave that to us, I insisted. We didn't receive it for 3 weeks so i telephoned and asked for it. I was told,well if you think it's a good idea (ie they don't think it's a good idea). I have descirbed on here before how my husband doesn't ask any questions and just sits there hence I feel the surgeon is really not explaining things, extremely important life changing things to Terry. He glossed over the erecitle dysfunction and urinary incontinence to the point I pressed him to explain them. I've had much advice here and from reading Dr Walsh's book as advised. I know men here did explain to me that's my husbands way of coping but what this has lead to on that appointment was the nurse practitioner and surgeon taking me to one said and saying you two aren't together on this we're concerned about the way you're dealing with it. They said you are in a state and need to talk to someone. But that won't help me. I was then upset with Terry as yes i'd asked a list of questions while he'd just sat there but we had gone through them and it looks strange as this is his body and happening to him. Anyways I've digressed and am offloading now. I was concerned to see in the pathpogy report he had TWO not one postive margin. if I put the details below I really really need people to be thruthful with me as the doctors clearly aren't going to explain what these results mean for the future. Can this cancer be cured completely? On the table that you work all the info out, gleason score, was there seminal vesicle involvemet, PSA score etc. you can work out with some degree statistically what are the chances the cancer will return where it was or appear elsewhere, I don't know how to do it would someone do it for me please? Although we've been togther for 30 years maybe we won't be growing old togther, we need to know the probabilty of this. If we have to try to do in the next 10 years that we planned to do in 20 years if you know what I mean. The patholgy report says-- High Volume prostate cancer Gleason 4+3 with focal Gleason 5, T3b. All margins negative except one at the apex 1mm and one at the posterior limit 1mm. Overall tumour size 6.8 ml. Please help me understand in context how bad the outlook is,please be truthful to me. Thank you,Karen",

      "Content": "lancepeace thanks for posting My husband has an MRI about a month ago that indicated a problem with his prostate and the MRI showed shadow over seminal vescles so that's why they were biopsied too. They only did 5 biopsies as my husband had a heart attack exactly one year ago (hows you're f****** luck!) and had to stop blood thinners to have the biopsy so they did the minimum. The nurse prcatitioner called T today and said she would attend his appointment tomorrow with the surgeon to discuss possible treatments. But just yesterday the registrar said they were reccomending a radical prostectomy as if there was no choice in reccomended treatment options. I think she said yesterday his prostate is 30mm and tumour is 10mm. Apart from understanding the significance of the Gleason score all those other numbers on the pathology report don't mean anything to me in terms of seriousness of cancer/tumour?

      "Content": "I've been reading the posts for a few days and have taken the plunge to ask for advise on our particular situation. If I could give brief as possible details (that's not easy as I want to pour out so many feelings) My husband is 50. Last August I had to take him to emergency at the hospital because he was so ill, it transpires he had a water infection and he was very shocked when they did a rectal exam! Of course we know why now. They said his prostate felt hard and did a PSA test. Couple weeks later GP (we're in the UK BTW) recalled him as his PSA was 30 which she said was probably because they'd done it after the exam. She said he had to wait 4 weeks then have another,this eventually came back still at 30 so she referred him to specialist at the hospital. He had this appointment last October. He saw a locum not the consultant who did a rectal exam said his prostate was hard and enlarged and advised he probably did have a tumour and would need a biopsy and MRI. He couldn't work the computer system so the actual consultant popped into the room. Looked at the what the locum had written and said Oh I don't think you have cancer it's probably left over from the infection just come back in a few months and we';ll look again. We were in a terrible state as he'd been told you do have something then you don't. Unhappy with this he asked our GP to refer him to another hospital,this one is a new cancer specialist unit and a teaching hospital with an excellent reputation. This appointment was December 3rd. He was seen by nurse practitioner who did a rectal exam and said unequivocally I can 100% feel a tumour and referred us two days later to see the consultant. Two days later the consultant said I'm pretty sure you don't have cancer it's probably still an infection (though no rectal exam). My husbands PSA was 8 point something at this appointment (can't remember exactly). He gave him another course of anti biotics and in the meantime did another PSA test and arranged an MRI. We returned for the results of these on February 13th. His PSA is now 9 and the MRI shows shadow on the prostate and seminal vesicles. He was scheduled for a biopsy which he had 3 days ago. D Day is March 13th when we get all the results. We asked three times does the shadow show it has spread beyond the prostate and he said no but but mentioned twice the seminal vesicle. My husband didn't take in the seminal vesicle word but I did and looked it all up when I got home. I didn't tell my husband the difference that would be to the outlook of his cancer and have carried the burden of this extra knowledge alone. But when he had his biopsy Monday he was told they'd be taking a sample from seminal vesicles as 'shadow' was also there so he was devastated and shocked as consultant had said 'shadow' had not spread. I cannot tell you his Gleason score yet only that his PSA is 9. I have been with my husband for 30 years,a lifetime, and I am absolutely terrified and heart broken that he is going to die. He had a heart attack last year at 49,then did all that was asked of him, lost weight,cut down drastically on drinking and stress at work. And he is very angry and I would be too for a young man to have had a heart attack then uncontained prostate cancer in one year. The seminal vesicles indicate his cancer will be aggressive from what I've read. Can anyone help me. I guess I want to hear you can be cured of prostate cancer which I assume will be stage 3 as it's already spread. I want you to tell me he isn't going to die but I don't want false hope just some truthful advise please,I would really really appreciate it. I telephoned the prostate cancer UK helpline and they stay pretty vague about outcomes treatment etc. The only info they did give me was T might be offered a choice of treatments. This would be scary as how would we know what is the best choice to make. And also if we're not offered it on March 13th to ask to to meet with a clinical oncologist? Sorry this is so long if you're still reading!",

      "Content": "Hi All, My husband has just had a prostatectomy,he is 51 and has been told he has an aggressive prosatate cancer. Bearing that in mind in the US are you able to have children testing for any genetic link? We have two adult sons and a daughter. If woman can now be tested for the BRAC1 gene and if I understand rightly prostate cancer is linked to BRAC2, are male (and female?) children tested? I asked our GP and she said if the Urologist requests it they can be tested. I am undecided whther to ask the urologist at Hubbie's 4 week post op check up in two weeks whether he thinks my husbands cancer and age warrant that testing?",

      "Content": "Again thank you so much for your help and advice. T has pretty much decided to go for surgery mostly for pschological reasons I think (I want that cancer out of my body kind of thing). BUT he has a bone scan today (Monday) and will get the results on Friday. As I said before I hope the 'powers that be' cut him just one break and the bone scan is clear and if it isn't I think that will be catastrophic for him coping with that news in particular. He is also referred and waiting for a PET scan to check his lymph nodes,we've been told our hospital is one of only a couple in the whole of the UK that do a PET scan so that is an extra. Doc told T Friday if I do a prostatectomy I will also take out the seminal vehiscles and lymph nodes. But if your bone scan isn't clear you can't have the prostatectomy. When T said that's the treatment he would want to have Doc then said I'm doing a clinical trial at the moment which is when we'd normally not do a proatatectomy when cancer has gone to the bone we are doing the op with additioanal radiotherapy and having good results. So it sounds like T could have the surgery regardless of the result of the bone scan. Thanks again",

      "Content": "Thank you again. We were told lymph nodes would be taken out before the op, and told after the op there weren't taken out. At the post op check up a couple of weeks ago one of my questions was why weren't the lymph nodes taken out as you said you were going to. Surgeon seemed a bit confused and was looking at computer screen to remind himself. Oh we can have those covered when he has his radiotherapy. That concerns me, should we have been given an explanation rather than just fobbed off with why they were left? How do we know if they're clear now then? As much as my husband likes this surgeon he does not explain anything at all. It's like in the past when medical people didn't feel patients needed any explanations they just breezed over the fact they may be carrying out life changing treatment as if patient is the village idiot and wouldn't understand! I honestly can't thank the people on here that are listening to me enough",

      "Content": "I've been reading the posts for a few days and have taken the plunge to ask for advise on our particular situation. If I could give brief as possible details (that's not easy as I want to pour out so many feelings) My husband is 50. Last August I had to take him to emergency at the hospital because he was so ill, it transpires he had a water infection and he was very shocked when they did a rectal exam! Of course we know why now. They said his prostate felt hard and did a PSA test. Couple weeks later GP (we're in the UK BTW) recalled him as his PSA was 30 which she said was probably because they'd done it after the exam. She said he had to wait 4 weeks then have another,this eventually came back still at 30 so she referred him to specialist at the hospital. He had this appointment last October. He saw a locum not the consultant who did a rectal exam said his prostate was hard and enlarged and advised he probably did have a tumour and would need a biopsy and MRI. He couldn't work the computer system so the actual consultant popped into the room. Looked at the what the locum had written and said Oh I don't think you have cancer it's probably left over from the infection just come back in a few months and we';ll look again. We were in a terrible state as he'd been told you do have something then you don't. Unhappy with this he asked our GP to refer him to another hospital,this one is a new cancer specialist unit and a teaching hospital with an excellent reputation. This appointment was December 3rd. He was seen by nurse practitioner who did a rectal exam and said unequivocally I can 100% feel a tumour and referred us two days later to see the consultant. Two days later the consultant said I'm pretty sure you don't have cancer it's probably still an infection (though no rectal exam). My husbands PSA was 8 point something at this appointment (can't remember exactly). He gave him another course of anti biotics and in the meantime did another PSA test and arranged an MRI. We returned for the results of these on February 13th. His PSA is now 9 and the MRI shows shadow on the prostate and seminal vesicles. He was scheduled for a biopsy which he had 3 days ago. D Day is March 13th when we get all the results. We asked three times does the shadow show it has spread beyond the prostate and he said no but but mentioned twice the seminal vesicle. My husband didn't take in the seminal vesicle word but I did and looked it all up when I got home. I didn't tell my husband the difference that would be to the outlook of his cancer and have carried the burden of this extra knowledge alone. But when he had his biopsy Monday he was told they'd be taking a sample from seminal vesicles as 'shadow' was also there so he was devastated and shocked as consultant had said 'shadow' had not spread. I cannot tell you his Gleason score yet only that his PSA is 9. I have been with my husband for 30 years,a lifetime, and I am absolutely terrified and heart broken that he is going to die. He had a heart attack last year at 49,then did all that was asked of him, lost weight,cut down drastically on drinking and stress at work. And he is very angry and I would be too for a young man to have had a heart attack then uncontained prostate cancer in one year. The seminal vesicles indicate his cancer will be aggressive from what I've read. Can anyone help me. I guess I want to hear you can be cured of prostate cancer which I assume will be stage 3 as it's already spread. I want you to tell me he isn't going to die but I don't want false hope just some truthful advise please,I would really really appreciate it. I telephoned the prostate cancer UK helpline and they stay pretty vague about outcomes treatment etc. The only info they did give me was T might be offered a choice of treatments. This would be scary as how would we know what is the best choice to make. And also if we're not offered it on March 13th to ask to to meet with a clinical oncologist?

      "Content": "My husband is having a bone scan today and will get the results on Friday. Doc told T last Friday if I do a prostatectomy I will also take out the seminal vehiscles and lymph nodes. But if your bone scan isn't clear you can't have the prostatectomy. When T said that's the treatment he would want to have Doc then said I'm doing a clinical trial at the moment which is when we'd normally not do a proatatectomy when cancer has gone to the bone we are doing the op with additional spot radiotherapy and having good results. So it sounds like T could have the surgery regardless of the result of the bone scan. Does anyone have any knowledge of this being carried out when from what I understand bone involement would normally mean the surgery route is out and treatment would be hormones,radiotherapy etc? PS Apologies for swamping the board at the moment!",

      "Sample": "T has pretty much decided to go for surgery mostly for pschological reasons I think (I want that cancer out of my body kind of thing). BUT he has a bone scan today (Monday) and will get the results on Friday....He was offered radiotherapy and prostatectomy, he opted for a prostatectomy which he had on May 14th. When the surgeon telephoned me to tell me the op was over....When we went for the post op appointment 4/5 weeks later surgeon told us cancer had spread from the prostate in four places, three were negative margins and one was positive. He said this area was too close to the rectum so this is why he will need aduvant radiotherapy....Lymph nodes and bone scan clear. After being told he had middle to aggressive cancer and that biopsy's can underestimate a gleason score he decided on surgery....Left nerve bundle removed and right one left intact. When we went for the post op appointment 4/5 weeks later surgeon told us cancer had spread from the prostate in four places, three were negative margins and one was positive....His lymph nodes and bone scan are clear. He was offered radiotherapy and prostatectomy, he opted for a prostatectomy which he had on May 14th....There is definite involvement of the seminal vehicles. They are reccomending a radical robotic prostatectomy because of his age (50) then adjunct radiotherapy....They are reccomending a radical robotic prostatectomy because of his age (50) then adjunct radiotherapy. She wasn't able to tell us prognosis of the cancer being cleared or the likelihood of recurrence....After being told he had middle to aggressive cancer and that biopsy's can underestimate a gleason score he decided on surgery. The surgeon said we are going to cure this....Again thank you so much for your help and advice. T has pretty much decided to go for surgery mostly for pschological reasons I think (I want that cancer out of my body kind of thing)....",
