If you use the sticky strip on the pad, it will tear the inside of the briefs on removal. I will be 5 weeks out from surgery 5/03 While control is getting better, I still need pads and briefs. But like you said it does get cramped, so I thought about just wearing briefs at home and pads and briefs when we go out (easy just to change pads in public restroom).",
