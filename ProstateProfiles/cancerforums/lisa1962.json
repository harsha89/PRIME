With no disrespect, I edited and removed your link as it is against our policy here on Cancer Forums to ask members for money as I am sure you can understand. Cancer puts a tremendous burden on those left behind and especially with the snail pace in which the VA works to get benefits to the family members is truly disheartening. I am hoping that the benefits will be processed very soon and help you financially. Lisa",
