I think you are way to eager to resume your normal schedule which could set you back, and might even be dangerous.Let your body heal then slowly resume your sports activities, but not before you have 6 weeks behind you. Not sure about coffee, I started drinking 1 cup of black coffee in the morning and never had an issue (1 week after catheter was removed). If your term \"A LOT of coffee\" means 3 or more then I suggest you cut it back . I wish you continued success with your recovery. Allen",

It's a pretty good bet what ever he dies from as an old man will not be PC. His weight loss could be due to stress thinking about whether or not he might have pc before he was even diagnosed. As you gain more knowledge about PC from the members here I'm positive your stress level will drop dramatically. Allen",

It is shown not to be any more or less successful than open surgery. Open surgery has improved recovery time considerably, and you can usually get it done much sooner. The biggest decision is your choice of surgeons no matter which you go with. You want one with lots of experience. Allen",

      "Content": "LIBMRDUCKS welcome to the site. I had surgery for my prostate issue, however after a year my psa started climbing so I decided upon beam radiation. I had 33 rounds of treatment. In my case I had 1 target and they hit it twice from 2 different directions. The actual radiation beam was 6 sec each direction. How many tattoos (markings) do you have on your body? My treatment was at most inconvenient as my bladder had to be full, and my bowel had to be empty for each procedure. Other than a little fatigue on the last day of treatment that lasted about 10-15 min I was perfectly fine, and could go about my life as normal. You will experience nerve damage from the radiation and that will affect you with ED. So that's a quick overview, if you have a specific question I would be more than willing to tell you how it affected me. It would appear your wife's course of action is not causing you additional stress so that is works in your favor. Allen",

      "Content": "LIBMRDUCKS welcome to the site. I had surgery for my prostate issue, however after a year my psa started climbing so I decided upon beam radiation. I had 33 rounds of treatment. In my case I had 1 target and they hit it twice from 2 different directions. The actual radiation beam was 6 sec each direction. How many tattoos (markings) do you have on your body? My treatment was at most inconvenient as my bladder had to be full, and my bowel had to be empty for each procedure. Other than a little fatigue on the last day of treatment that lasted about 10-15 min I was perfectly fine, and could go about my life as normal. You will experience nerve damage from the radiation and that will affect you with ED. So that's a quick overview, if you have a specific question I would be more than willing to tell you how it affected me. It would appear your wife's course of action is not causing you additional stress so that is works in your favor. Allen",

The issue is if you procrastinate on getting treatment soon you may find you feel really bad in the near future. Lets assume your surgeon is a knowledgeable doctor who is giving you professional advice. I would wait for your oncology meeting but then I would decide on a treatment and get to it.

Royal Bank where I buy it have a bout 7-8 questions and cancer isn't one of them. A few weeks after surgery I developed a UTI went to a Florida hospital for blood tests and prescription. Called the bank to inform them and they said no problem. The hospital billed them directly for 2 visits ($1,600) and I paid for the prescription and mailed the bill to the bank . I had my money in 2 weeks. They seem to be more interested on whether you have major heart issues, diabetes, if you are on oxygen. You should give them a call. Allen",

Royal Bank where I buy it have a bout 7-8 questions and cancer isn't one of them. A few weeks after surgery I developed a UTI went to a Florida hospital for blood tests and prescription. Called the bank to inform them and they said no problem. The hospital billed them directly for 2 visits ($1,600) and I paid for the prescription and mailed the bill to the bank . I had my money in 2 weeks. They seem to be more interested on whether you have major heart issues, diabetes, if you are on oxygen. You should give them a call. Allen",

I had a prostate infection 4 years ago and both my GP and Urologist said to wait at least 6 weeks before retesting as the antibiotics artificially lower the PSA number and it takes at least 6 weeks before they are totally out of your blood stream. Or that was the case with the silver bullets they gave me , yours may be different. Good Luck Allen",

      "Content": "Scorpio, no worries my friend. Obviously you don't feel it when it's inserted and there is virtually no sensation when it is taken out. During the day you will wear a leg bag, at least when you go out. Make certain it is firmly secured and I recommend you empty it frequently. If it gets to full it can start to slide down your leg due to weight and when it reaches the end of its line you will feel a tug. But that's easily avoidable, I emptied mine when I thought it was a bit more than 1/2 full. Sleeping at night is not a major issue either.Just ensure there are no kinks in the line and the big bag is well below you for proper flow. I had mine in for 2 weeks and still enjoyed going out for lunch, movies, etc. The week will pass quickly. Ask your doctor what you should do in case of the catheter coming out (Highly unlikely). My surgeon did not want any RN or other person re-insurting it who wasn't part of his team and he gave me a 24/7 number to get hold of them. Good Luck B",

The doctor treating you is more important than the center, and it is important that you feel comfortable with them. You perhaps have friends who've had prostate cancer and you could ask them. However you are putting the cart way in front of the horse. What symptoms do you have? When was your last PSA and what was the number? Also, what makes you think you have prostate cancer? Take a breath and get checked out by your family doctor, starting with a DRE and a PSA test. If he/she feels there may be an issue, have her make an appointment with a urologist and an oncologist.

      "Content": "Scorpio, no worries my friend. Obviously you don't feel it when it's inserted and there is virtually no sensation when it is taken out. During the day you will wear a leg bag, at least when you go out. Make certain it is firmly secured and I recommend you empty it frequently. If it gets to full it can start to slide down your leg due to weight and when it reaches the end of its line you will feel a tug. But that's easily avoidable, I emptied mine when I thought it was a bit more than 1/2 full. Sleeping at night is not a major issue either.Just ensure there are no kinks in the line and the big bag is well below you for proper flow. I had mine in for 2 weeks and still enjoyed going out for lunch, movies, etc. The week will pass quickly. Ask your doctor what you should do in case of the catheter coming out (Highly unlikely). My surgeon did not want any RN or other person re-insurting it who wasn't part of his team and he gave me a 24/7 number to get hold of them. Good Luck B",

The doctor treating you is more important than the center, and it is important that you feel comfortable with them. You perhaps have friends who've had prostate cancer and you could ask them. However you are putting the cart way in front of the horse. What symptoms do you have? When was your last PSA and what was the number? Also, what makes you think you have prostate cancer? Take a breath and get checked out by your family doctor, starting with a DRE and a PSA test. If he/she feels there may be an issue, have her make an appointment with a urologist and an oncologist.

      "Content": "Thanks Sarg, I'm no physician but that seems like a high dosage. I was prescribed either 50mg of Viagra or 20mg of Cialis once/week. My doctor said this is part of the healing process and not intended to give you an erection at this point. I did read some time ago where a surgeon told his patient after about a year that the Viagra/Cialis had done all it was going to do as far as helping to heal damaged nerves and the person could begin taking it at his convenience for the purpose of erections if it worked. He also recommended the injections. My issue is if the pills have done all they can do in healing then why continue to purchase them for that purpose. I get great erections with injections and I could try a 100mg Viagra every couple of months to see if it worked . B",

I too was diagnosed with a Gleason of 7(3+4) and having the prostate removed was the smartest thing I've done. I met wit 2 very skilled surgeons and 1 very skilled oncologist at 2 different medical clinics. All three agreed that in their opinion AS was not a smart option for me. I do think about PSA a week before my testing, but I would far sooner have PSA in the back of my mind, then in my body steadily increasing. This is a serious choice you're making so get a few opinions from highly skilled surgeons and oncologists before deciding on AS. Good Luck Allen",

He is a brilliant surgeon, but when they roll you out of the operating room he thinks his job is over other than scheduled psa results. He did refer me to a great oncologist when I requested it, so now I alternate between them at 6 month intervals. You will need to take control of the situation and I suggest you ask the surgeon to refer you to an oncologist in your area. Good Luck Allen",

It appears you had some degree of ED prior to surgery, and unfortunately although PC surgery can save your life it can't improve your sexual performance. I think you are going to find that all men here lost some degree of performance after surgery. There are meds such as Viagra, Cialis, Trimix that should allow you to have an enjoyable sex life. Good luck and be happy you caught the cancer at an early stage. Allen",

I too was diagnosed with a Gleason of 7(3+4) and having the prostate removed was the smartest thing I've done. I met wit 2 very skilled surgeons and 1 very skilled oncologist at 2 different medical clinics. All three agreed that in their opinion AS was not a smart option for me. I do think about PSA a week before my testing, but I would far sooner have PSA in the back of my mind, then in my body steadily increasing. This is a serious choice you're making so get a few opinions from highly skilled surgeons and oncologists before deciding on AS. Good Luck Allen",

I know I am probably the odd man out but I prefer to make decisions myself and not spend much time discussing them. If I'm stressed I just like to be left alone to work through it. Your husband's psa is fairly low so all should go well. Good Luck B",

I would have no reason to second guess my doctor as he has spent years of time and tons of money getting an education. It may well be in 10 years they may have hard data that can show how proton beams is better overall than other options. Right now I just don't see it. B",

I do find the occasional run good but if I do it daily now my back gets really sore. I alternate running and power walking. I golf a few times a week, but then I use a cart. However I'm convinced people are better off with exercise whether they leak or not. A person can always use a pad when running, or some other exercise. I use one when I run and sometimes when going up hill I can feel a small squirt. But so what? Suck it up and keep going. Allen",

      "Content": "Chuck, I am impressed with your run schedule, obviously you stayed physically active from a young age. I do find the occasional run good but if I do it daily now my back gets really sore. I alternate running and power walking. I golf a few times a week, but then I use a cart. However I'm convinced people are better off with exercise whether they leak or not. A person can always use a pad when running, or some other exercise. I use one when I run and sometimes when going up hill I can feel a small squirt. But so what? Suck it up and keep going. Allen",

Drink plenty of water (ease off late in the afternoon), keep up the Kegels and keep in mind your plumbing has been rearranged and you need an adjustment period. Keep track of your progress with continence, after 2 weeks you should start seeing good improvements. B",

She will show you how to draw the Trimix from the bottle and where to insert it. It will be on the side away from a vein, and you will alternate sides with each time you inject. They will start you at the lowest dosage and if you need to increase it then you can do that. After you inject it, she will leave while you stimulate yourself and then your DR or his resident will come in and caution you NOT to inject again until the next day and give you a script.

It keeps it @ 100% strength for a couple of months if needed. Also it will defrost in your hand in about 3-5 minutes. Allen",

It is understandable that you are emotional after you received your diagnosis, but to echo the previous posters, your PSA and Gleason numbers are very good plus you have your age going for you. Given you are not rushed to make a decision I suggest you take the time to research for a top notch Urologist and Oncologist who both specialize in prostate cancer and have an excellent track record. Once you make your decision on how you plan to get rid of your cancer and have a doctor, you will calm down and life will be easier on you and your wife.

      "Content": "I wasn't prepared to wait until January for both ultrasound and Cysto so I went to my MD and got a requisition for an ultra sound and had it done on Friday. My doctor and urologist should get a copy of results on Mon or Tues. They did bladder, kidneys and whatever else. They did the 1st with bladder full and 2nd empty. As I was getting dressed the technician said (unsolicited) that the radiologist would review the pictures but he could see nothing \"interesting\" which made me feel significantly better. I did use all my initial antibiotics as directed and it did cure the UTI. The issue beyond occasional stabbing pain in the lower bladder/abdominal area is the trace amount (2%) of blood still being present. Today is my 4th day with zero \"visible blood\" in the urine and the stabbing pain is 60% less frequent and painful. Will let you know what comes from the ultra sound. Thank you all for taking the time to comment, it means a lot. Allen",

While on vacation 6 weeks ago I noticed blood in urine. I went to ER of Florida hospital where they took a urine sample and drew 5 vials of blood. They said my blood work was perfectly normal but I had a raging UTI. After starting antibiotic could no longer see blood but after 6 days started seeing it again. Used remaining antibiotics and went back to ER. The UTI was was cleared up and they thought it was irritation. Decided to come back to Canada. Going for ultra sound today and a Cysto in January. I sometimes go 3-4 days and not see blood and if my bladder gets full, I get a stabbing pain in lower region and for sure there will be a lot of bright blood. As long as I empty bladder at about 25% there will be I don't see blood but it does show presence in urine analysis. Also if I lift anything heavy. Fingers crossed it's a polyp or kidney stone. Don't think I can battle cancer again. Allen",

      "Content": "I wasn't prepared to wait until January for both ultrasound and Cysto so I went to my MD and got a requisition for an ultra sound and had it done on Friday. My doctor and urologist should get a copy of results on Mon or Tues. They did bladder, kidneys and whatever else. They did the 1st with bladder full and 2nd empty. As I was getting dressed the technician said (unsolicited) that the radiologist would review the pictures but he could see nothing \"interesting\" which made me feel significantly better. I did use all my initial antibiotics as directed and it did cure the UTI. The issue beyond occasional stabbing pain in the lower bladder/abdominal area is the trace amount (2%) of blood still being present. Today is my 4th day with zero \"visible blood\" in the urine and the stabbing pain is 60% less frequent and painful. Will let you know what comes from the ultra sound. Thank you all for taking the time to comment, it means a lot. Allen",

I tend to over think health issues and not necessarily in a positive way. I tend to run more, eat less and think of the negatives. Thank heavens my wife eventually gets me calmed down. Your PSA is a high number but it doesn't necessarily mean you have prostate cancer. My recommendation is that you keep as busy as possible , visit friends and relatives and in no time you will have a prognosis. If it turns out you do have PC then please return and let us know your Gleason score and as much other information as possible. This site is like a family for those of us with PC, you can get advice, empathy,and everything you'll need to help you get through this. Hoping you don't need to join us. Allen",

They said my blood work was perfectly normal but I had a raging UTI. After starting antibiotic could no longer see blood but after 6 days started seeing it again. Used remaining antibiotics and went back to ER. The UTI was was cleared up and they thought it was irritation. Decided to come back to Canada. Going for ultra sound today and a Cysto in January. I sometimes go 3-4 days and not see blood and if my bladder gets full, I get a stabbing pain in lower region and for sure there will be a lot of bright blood.

If it were large they could choose to drain it. The more serious is a hernia, as it could strangulate the blood supply around the area. I had the same thing in the same place and it was a hematoma and they elected to let it drain. It took about 3-4 weeks. It is important you contact your doctor or it being the weekend visit the ER and see a Urologist on duty. They will probably do a cat scan . B",

In my case once I found out I had the pc the decision was : *Do nothing and probably die in less than 5 years *Treat it with radiation *Treat it with surgery, The urologist recommended surgery I said fine. He recommended robotic and I said fine. *I had a Gleason of 7 *After 12 months my psa went from undetectable to 0.17. The urologist had me do another sample that day and it came back the same. He recommended radiation, I said fine and that's where we are at present. I was marked the end of last week, should start the 33 treatments this week. ** I have a Bachelors degree and an MBA. I do not have a medical degree. I am a Big believer in the person with the training and experience makes the calls. I do accept responsibility for their calls. B",

      "Content": "One of my best friends from Germany has his PHD in mechanical engineering and at one time was a prof at the university in Berlin before going to the private sector. He too requires every minute detail in his health care. He had a serious back operation a while back and actually told the surgeon he wanted to inspect the screws that would be used . The surgeon was not a happy camper but knew my friend and so he did. My friend said they would not work and insisted on heavier screws. He got the heavier screws. Not sure it made the difference but he has been in constant pain with his back ever since. I told him he is the smartest person I know of about motors but he doesn't know crap about fixing the body. In the same situation I would have told the surgeon that the screws was going to use looked just great. In fact I would never have asked to see them. B",

      "Content": "I had robotic surgery in 2012 and my psa remained at zero for 11 months. Then it went to 0.12 Although my surgeon wanted to watch it for some months , I wanted to start radiation asap. I had 33 rounds of radiation finishing at Christmas. My oncologist feels confident my psa will go to zero again. If it does that's fine, if it doesn't I assume HT is the next step. My Gleason score was 7 (3+4) Assuming my luck dealing with this PC has not been remarkable so far and that luck continues and I do have a psa higher than 0.0. Is HT the next logical step? How high does your psa need to reach before they start? How successful are they, and for how many years do they stay effective. What is the most effective Hormone Treatment? I realize some people have major side affects and others are only moderately bothered , given I had zero side effects from my radiation treatment, doubtful I would have a major issue with HT. I am still expecting/hoping that my radiation will have been successful. Brave",

Fourteen months later my psa is 0.0, I am fully continent, and can get an unaided erection. Allen",

He too requires every minute detail in his health care. He had a serious back operation a while back and actually told the surgeon he wanted to inspect the screws that would be used . The surgeon was not a happy camper but knew my friend and so he did. My friend said they would not work and insisted on heavier screws. He got the heavier screws. Not sure it made the difference but he has been in constant pain with his back ever since. I told him he is the smartest person I know of about motors but he doesn't know crap about fixing the body. In the same situation I would have told the surgeon that the screws was going to use looked just great. In fact I would never have asked to see them. B",

      "Content": "Hi MM, welcome to our site. I too had radiation 11 months after surgery, thankfully the radiation has worked these past 3 years. I find it strange that an oncologist is suggesting your husband should check his recommendation with his urologist. I would have thought the urologist's job was over and further decisions would be between your husband and his oncologist. From your report it appears your husband's PSA was detectable immediately, unless you meant to report .01 instead of 0.1. Although some oncologists like to jump on PSA immediately when it reoccurs after radiation, many, including mine prefer to wait until the PSA hits 15-20 in order to prolong quality of life as long as possible and he has found it made no difference long term on the effectiveness of HT. Not sure I would be comfortable with that but I'm not an oncologist . I would get a 2nd opinion from another oncologist before agreeing to the wait. I wish your husband success with his choice and please keep us updated. Allen",

      "Content": "Hello and welcome Tiger. I started using Trimix about 6 months post Da Vinci. Your euro will know doubt send you to his RN or a resident to show you how to draw the trimix, where to insert the needle, etc. The only thing you really need to watch is that you alternate injection sites (left one time and right side next time. Also don't inject into a vein. The drug works in less than 5 min and lasts from 20 min to 45 min. Good Luck Allen",

I had 33 rounds of salvage radiation with virtually zero side effects other than 15 minutes of fatigue an hour after the last few treatments.. It has been almost 2 years since my radiation and my PSA is still undectable. Tell your friend to relax and enjoy life as he will have a long, long time to enjoy it...unless he dies of needless stress. I was 65 when I had surgery, 66 when I had radiation. When I'm 96 I will reflect on the few days I had stress and think : Why did I waste that week. It did not interfere with my erections, or continence. Hopefully this helps with his peace of mind.

I find it strange that an oncologist is suggesting your husband should check his recommendation with his urologist.

From your report it appears your husband's PSA was detectable immediately, unless you meant to report .01 instead of 0.1. Although some oncologists like to jump on PSA immediately when it reoccurs after radiation, many, including mine prefer to wait until the PSA hits 15-20 in order to prolong quality of life as long as possible and he has found it made no difference long term on the effectiveness of HT.

My oncologist wanted me to take Milk of Magnesia in the evening. Also they will want your bladder quite full as it acts to hold the bowel out of the beams way. The worst part for me was keeping my body absolutely still for the few minutes the beam arcs over you twice. You are not strapped in, although they put a device on the metal table to help hold your legs quiet. However if you cough, sneeze or move any at all, you are off the table and the missed day will be rescheduled. For most men 70+ the worst was holding a full bladder for the duration of the test. They do a mini cat scan before starting the beam to ensure your bowel and bladder are as they should be. The marking to tattoo you for the radiation is no big deal. They do it a few days prior to start of radiation.",

I can only assume your bladder wasn't full when they did the markings and put the tattoos on you. It is critical the level of fluid in your bladder be consistent with the markings at each session, otherwise down the road you could have bladder/bowel issues because the beam could missed the mark due to the bladder not being exactly where it was during the marking. I guess that's also why they like it full, the individual knows he is ok once her starts squirming and sweating due to the fact he thinks he will pee himself. Allen",

It did turn out to be a prostate infection and antibiotics cleared it up, although it did take some weeks on them. My psa returned to normal levels and stayed there until 5 years later when I was diagnosed with pc. Keep an eye on your psa level and if it climbs even slightly I would suggest you may want to have a biopsy just for piece of mind. Good Luck B",

In most cases your body will let you know when you are pushing your limits. I recall reading where John Kerry did very strenuous mountain biking frequently, and started shortly after Robotic Surgery.

I elected to go with the surgery (DiVinci) based on the fact that should my cancer re-appear I could get radiation treatment.

Because blood is still flowing into the penis, and none is leaving, there is an extraordinary amount of pressure built up. ◾The pressure built up while clamping expands penis tissues beyond its normal erection state. By expanding the penis tissues multiple times, the expansion eventually becomes permanent",

After injecting it gives me a good erection in about 5 minutes, however I noticed the erection has gone from 60 min almost a year ago to 40 min a few months ago and has recently dropped to 20 min. I can get by with the 20 min but the injection won't be worth it if it falls below that. I keep the vial refrigerated and the formula is clear and within code. Has anyone experienced a similar issue.

      "Content": "Welcome Robert to the best PC site available. Most have the surgery over radiation, that will become clear to you when you read the posts. Having said that, my surgeon told me 18 months ago that radiation was also very effective but they hadn't been keeping records as long as they have for surgery. He said by 2020 when they have enough data on radiation it may be shown they are equal in curing or treating PC. He also said if you are considering radiation and it doesn't work you can't fall back on Robotic Surgery due to the damage radiation does. However if you go with Robotic Surgery and it doesn't work you can have radiation. I suggest you seek out and meet with a good surgeon, and a good oncologist, and have them go over your records and give you their opinion. After asking them numerous questions you can make a more knowledgeable decision. Good Luck Brave",

After injecting it gives me a good erection in about 5 minutes, however I noticed the erection has gone from 60 min almost a year ago to 40 min a few months ago and has recently dropped to 20 min. I can get by with the 20 min but the injection won't be worth it if it falls below that. I keep the vial refrigerated and the formula is clear and within code. Has anyone experienced a similar issue. I have another month or so of vacation so I can't just call my doctor back in Canada for a new script. Brave",

Because blood is still flowing into the penis, and none is leaving, there is an extraordinary amount of pressure built up. ◾The pressure built up while clamping expands penis tissues beyond its normal erection state. By expanding the penis tissues multiple times, the expansion eventually becomes permanent",

I'm not sure if open surgery could be done. Obviously radiation is less invasive than surgery but the side affects (ED, Incontinence) are still there. After consideration I chose surgery mostly as it left me a follow up procedure (radiation) if required... and it was. Allen",

      "Content": "An article from the internet that may be somewhat of interest: How does clamping work?\u201d Here is a plausible theory: ◾Clamping restricts blood from flowing out of the penis while still allowing limited inflow. Because blood is still flowing into the penis, and none is leaving, there is an extraordinary amount of pressure built up. ◾The pressure built up while clamping expands penis tissues beyond its normal erection state. By expanding the penis tissues multiple times, the expansion eventually becomes permanent",

      "Content": "Welcome Robert to the best PC site available. Most have the surgery over radiation, that will become clear to you when you read the posts. Having said that, my surgeon told me 18 months ago that radiation was also very effective but they hadn't been keeping records as long as they have for surgery. He said by 2020 when they have enough data on radiation it may be shown they are equal in curing or treating PC. He also said if you are considering radiation and it doesn't work you can't fall back on Robotic Surgery due to the damage radiation does. However if you go with Robotic Surgery and it doesn't work you can have radiation. I suggest you seek out and meet with a good surgeon, and a good oncologist, and have them go over your records and give you their opinion. After asking them numerous questions you can make a more knowledgeable decision. Good Luck Brave",

I never had that issue but thought someone here may have and could offer some advice. He was thinking of using a condom, or sex in the shower, I told him if he has that much urine a condom won't work. His wife isn't thrilled with shower sex.",

I previously had robotic surgery on Oct 31/12, and my psa remained at 0.0 for almost 11 months. Then it appeared at 0.15. My oncologist was very optimistic however my surgeon was as well after he did surgery. I am unfortunately thinking what my options are if it turns my psa is not 0.0. I know HT is an option but just wondering if brachytherapy could be an option or would it be to soon after my radiation beam treatment (4 mos). Not sure if anyone here ever used it after other treatments. Hopefully it won't be necessary. My Gleason was 7 (3+4) and the volume # was 15, I am T3A. Many thanks Allen",

      "Content": "I must confess I've been sweating bullets ever since reading the post \"lupron horror\" as I had to have my 6 month PSA test yesterday. Not certain how I could handle the level of discomfort some men go through on it. Thankfully I rec'd a call from my urologist's office 7 minutes ago telling me my PSA is Undetectable. What a wonderful weekend I am going to have. I wish good luck to all my friends here as their testing time comes due. It would have been very difficult for me to handle PC had I not found you all here. Allen",

      "Content": "Hello White. I was 65 when diagnosed with PC. I had zero symptoms but my psa had risen. I ended up with a cancer volume of 15% and a gleason of 7. After the robotic surgery , Oct, 2012 I was feeling great. My surgeon did say ED and incontinence would be short term. After 18 months I still have ED, however I was fully continent in 7 weeks. My psa remained at 0 for almost a year and then went to 0.15. Surgeon wanted to wait and see time frame for doubling, I told him no way and book me an appointment with the best oncologist he knew. I went ahead with 33 sessions of radiation . I finished treatment on Dec 24th and headed to our place in Florida at end of December. After being there for 3 + months came home and had my blood work done. Met with oncologist today and my psa is 0.0. Many will disagree, but I am a firm believer not all prostate cancers are slow growing , and they will not be easier to treat 3 or 6 months after a rise in psa. I personally do not feel I would have got a reading of 0.0 had I waited and observed doubling time. Just my opinion B",

      "Content": "I certainly sympathise with your situation. Personally I never found it useful counting pads as I used them and changed them long before I needed to simply because it played with my head having urine somewhere in my pads. Another person may wear them until they are full. So he may go through 4 pads a day while I leaked less but went through 10 pads. It is imperative that your husband faithfully do his kegel exercises. Also you need to have a frank discussion with his urologist and ask him for viable options. In the short term you need something to put over the depends like a baby used to wear over a diaper. I don't think it's uncommon for leakage @ 3 months post op so don't give up hope. I was fortunate to be continent at 7 weeks due entirely I think to kegel exercises which I performed an hour a day broken into 3- 20 minute segments. My thoughts are with you I am sure this is taking a heavy toll on you as well. I would not recommend you try clamps or anything similar until you run it all past his urologist, you do not want to make things worse. Good Luck & Hugs. B",

I am heading out for an 8 week vacation tomorrow but I called his office and told them if the psa stayed the same or went higher then get me into an oncologist asap.

      "Content": "I certainly sympathise with your situation. Personally I never found it useful counting pads as I used them and changed them long before I needed to simply because it played with my head having urine somewhere in my pads. Another person may wear them until they are full. So he may go through 4 pads a day while I leaked less but went through 10 pads. It is imperative that your husband faithfully do his kegel exercises. Also you need to have a frank discussion with his urologist and ask him for viable options. In the short term you need something to put over the depends like a baby used to wear over a diaper. I don't think it's uncommon for leakage @ 3 months post op so don't give up hope. I was fortunate to be continent at 7 weeks due entirely I think to kegel exercises which I performed an hour a day broken into 3- 20 minute segments. My thoughts are with you I am sure this is taking a heavy toll on you as well. I would not recommend you try clamps or anything similar until you run it all past his urologist, you do not want to make things worse. Good Luck & Hugs. B",

I would hope your 2nd appointment is with a urologist who is well experienced with PC. I'm not putting down radiation but I would consider surgery where you have a second kick at the cat with radiation if necessary. This is very seldom true in reverse. I know people who had radiation and they experienced the same degree of incontinence and ED as those who had surgery. You have time to meet with several doctors until you find one you have a good comfort level with. Good luck and best of health in 2015 Allen",

Like you, they hang in there in hope that a Hormone drug will be introduced soon with far less side affects. Unfortunately PC doesn't get a fraction of the research budget that breasts cancer does. I'm not looking for any $ to be taken from breast cancer but it would be nice if more research $ were spent on PC. B",

Many scientific/medical meds are started on animals only to find out later they do not repeat the same success in humans. I think if IP6 showed it helped men with prostate cancer, a major drug company would have refined it, got FDA approval, and started marketing it. We read about so many old beliefs about the benefits of things that people believed because some type of doctor wearing a white coat, and stethoscope said it was a cure for x, y z . I think before these links are even posted, the Gov't should make the institution behind them post at the beginning in BOLD print.

How high was it on your previous psa test? Brave",

I certainly didn't rush to tell friends that I had cancer, somehow just the word cancer seems to make you think people will treat you as suddenly breakable. However as time passes and you find a great site like this, you change your outlook on things. I would advise you not to push him, but gently nudge him into looking at our site and reading the posts and I'm convinced over time he will participate. Whatever his decision, I wish you both a healthy, happy future. Allen",

      "Content": "Hello caregiver, after 11 months post surgery, my psa went to 0.17. I decided on radiation and had 33 treatments. A year later my psa is 0.0. There will be two tattoos, one will be in his pubic hair on the left, the other on the right. They are so small as to be practically invisible. He needn't worry about anyone seeing them, they are the Size of an ink dot. He won't have any problem driving and there won't be any radiation burns. I am fully continent, and can now achieve an erection without Cialis or Viagra. Really no side affects. Towards the end , treatment 26-33 I was a bit fatigued but it lasted 15 minutes. After my last treatment I had a coffee and drove 3 hours to visit my kids and was fine. Hope this helps a bit. Allen",

It is imperative that your bowel be empty and your bladder be full during your time on the treatment table. They do a mini cat scan each time to ensure the above has been carried out. The full bladder pushes your bowel out of the way, eliminating radiation damage. I got to know a dozen guys taking treatment when I did. The only complaint was from the older men 70+ who had a hard time with a full bladder for the 10 minutes. None in my group mentioned any bladder, bowel issues during treatment. Not sure how they fared down the road but doubtful they had an issue post treatment. Allen",

      "Content": "Squiggle, I know exactly how your dad feels. I had a urologist tell me I could probably go 5-10 years before needing surgery. I said no and had surgery (with a different surgeon) a couple of months later. He told me I was lucky I didn't wait with a Gleason of 8 which was revised down to 7. After 1 year of psa at zero the test showed it had jumped (4 months) to 0.17. I told him I wanted radiation asap and am now finishing my treatment (3 left). I was totally enraged at several doctors starting with my GP who saw my psa rising and didn't send me to a urologist earlier, then the urologist telling me we could watch and wait, and thirdly the surgeon who did the surgery but didn't get all the cancer. When you are faced with cancer I think it is normal when treatments don't work to strike out at somebody. I wish your father all the best going forward and his radiation takes his psa to zero over time. B",

Usually I just get on the tread mill and walk it off. I know a few of the people I've met at treatment had diahrea but I would say only 5%. The worst part is having a FULL bladder at the time of treatment. If your bladder isn't full they take you off the table and wait 30 min while drinking more water. Also your bowel has to be as close to empty as possible. Your dad should get through it just fine, after a couple of treatments he will know exactly how much water to drink and when to start. The full bladder pushes the surrounding organs away from the radiation site. Hope this was somewhat helpful. B",

I elected to go with Robotic surgery and my psa started to reappear after 11 months. I then had beam radiation done and a year later my psa is 0.0. The side affects from 33 rounds of radiation were virtually none. Were I to be able to go back in time, my 1st choice would be radiation. Allen",

It is imperative that your bowel be empty and your bladder be full during your time on the treatment table. They do a mini cat scan each time to ensure the above has been carried out. The full bladder pushes your bowel out of the way, eliminating radiation damage. I got to know a dozen guys taking treatment when I did. The only complaint was from the older men 70+ who had a hard time with a full bladder for the 10 minutes. None in my group mentioned any bladder, bowel issues during treatment. Not sure how they fared down the road but doubtful they had an issue post treatment. Allen",

I must confess that I don't really control the stress well in the 5 days leading up to the test. Mostly due to my concern over the possibility of needing HT. My next test will be done in 6 1/2 months just a few weeks short of my 70th birthday. I now look forward to heading to our winter home and escaping the cold Canadian winter in Oct. Will now make dinner reservations for my wife and I at her favorite restaurant. Not sure I could survive the stress a week before testing without her support and calmness. It also helps she is an RN.

I remember after my biopsy my surgeon was surprised I never asked about dying as most of his patients did, I just asked about ED , Continence, and the chances of having to go on HT. My ED and Continence worked out well quickly so no worries, but I have a couple of friends who have little quality in their lives due to HT. One said if he had it to do over he'd rather skip treatment and enjoy a shortened life. BTW you have a great sense of humour which helps a lot. Allen",

I must confess that I don't really control the stress well in the 5 days leading up to the test. Mostly due to my concern over the possibility of needing HT. My next test will be done in 6 1/2 months just a few weeks short of my 70th birthday. I now look forward to heading to our winter home and escaping the cold Canadian winter in Oct. Will now make dinner reservations for my wife and I at her favorite restaurant. Not sure I could survive the stress a week before testing without her support and calmness. It also helps she is an RN.

My ED and Continence worked out well quickly so no worries, but I have a couple of friends who have little quality in their lives due to HT. One said if he had it to do over he'd rather skip treatment and enjoy a shortened life. BTW you have a great sense of humour which helps a lot. Allen",

He led a mostly normal life at home until a month before passing. He then went to a Hospice where all his requirements were looked after by great doctors, nurses, staff.

Some things that could cause it are: men's use of rings during sex, sitting for long periods of time, poor posture, and even the side affect of radiation treatment on the prostate. I am sure you will get a significant amount of answers/opinions on this topic. I've never experienced it first hand but perhaps some men here have and can shed more light on it for you. Good Luck B",

I do this because my hand will shake nervously and I will miss the target or jab to hard. You can't push the needle in to far. ALSO make certain you are using the smallest needle possible. I use a 30G. The syringe the pharmacy will give you is a 25G x5/8(0.5mm x 16mm) that size is required to go through the cork and withdraw the TriMix. Then once you have the desired amount in the syringe you switch the needle portion to a 30G. Needless to say the area where you do this should be very clean. We draw all the needles at the same time and freeze them. It takes only a minute to unthaw it while you hold it in your hand. I have never experienced any pain with injection. It does help that my wife is an RN. Good luck Allen",

I felt there was something wrong and insisted on a biopsy which confirmed my worst suspicion..I had PC and it was G7(3+4). I had DaVinci in 2012 followed by salvage radiation in 2013. Knock on wood to date I am cancer free. I too looked on the Internet and found some dark, scary places when I was looking for info on PC. Luckily a friend recommended this site and what I've learned here is priceless. As you've found us then you're already a step in the right direction. Waiting is hard on us all my friend but more often then not the news you get is good. Hang in there and keep us in the loop. Good luck Allen",

I use a 30G. The syringe the pharmacy will give you is a 25G x5/8(0.5mm x 16mm) that size is required to go through the cork and withdraw the TriMix. Then once you have the desired amount in the syringe you switch the needle portion to a 30G. Needless to say the area where you do this should be very clean. We draw all the needles at the same time and freeze them. It takes only a minute to unthaw it while you hold it in your hand. I have never experienced any pain with injection. It does help that my wife is an RN. Good luck Allen",

I felt there was something wrong and insisted on a biopsy which confirmed my worst suspicion..I had PC and it was G7(3+4). I had DaVinci in 2012 followed by salvage radiation in 2013. Knock on wood to date I am cancer free. I too looked on the Internet and found some dark, scary places when I was looking for info on PC. Luckily a friend recommended this site and what I've learned here is priceless. As you've found us then you're already a step in the right direction. Waiting is hard on us all my friend but more often then not the news you get is good. Hang in there and keep us in the loop. Good luck Allen",

I do think it's important the surgeon be in a major center and perform the MAJOR portion of the surgery. Keep in mind the surgeon has residents there who have to learn and so they do part of the surgery. I would be confident with a surgeon at a major hospital who has done 500+ surgeries and did most of it himself. Also he should have a good track record of success and they all know what their % is.

I do think it's important the surgeon be in a major center and perform the MAJOR portion of the surgery. Keep in mind the surgeon has residents there who have to learn and so they do part of the surgery. I would be confident with a surgeon at a major hospital who has done 500+ surgeries and did most of it himself. Also he should have a good track record of success and they all know what their % is.

There was a time many years ago that radiation did cause many people bad side effects especially with the bowel and bladder, but with the new equipment today radiation is mostly just an inconvenience. You might want to get your dad to update himself with the newest equipment and meet with an oncologist who works exclusively with prostate cancer. Best of luck to your dad and you. Allen",

Your dad seems to be keeping himself well informed on the disease and treatment options, so I am a bit confused as to what side effects he thinks he will experience with radiation ? There was a time many years ago that radiation did cause many people bad side effects especially with the bowel and bladder, but with the new equipment today radiation is mostly just an inconvenience. You might want to get your dad to update himself with the newest equipment and meet with an oncologist who works exclusively with prostate cancer. Best of luck to your dad and you. Allen",

I agree the natural next step is a biopsy to put the spotlight on what the situation really is. Once we learn what the biopsy reveals you will get excellent advice from people who have gone through this. Hopefully this is just a severe case of enlarged prostate but be prepared for a more serious outcome. You will hear, and it's true that no man wants cancer but if you have to get one, this is the best one to get. Please keep us informed and feel free to ask numerous questions on this journey. Allen",

I take injections 2-3 times a week and they work great. You should expect to get a good erection and hold it approx. an hour (some longer some a bit shorter time.

Many on here became continent quicker and for others it took longer than 7 weeks. You seem to be doing everything right, I assume you are avoiding lifting heavy issues and sitting for long periods. Make sure you go for a short walk every 90 minutes or less, just a walk around the house for 10 minutes will help. The main thing is have \"patience\". Your plumbing has experienced a major shock, and you need to give it time to heal.

I had 2 occasions with blood in the urine, and one resulted in a bladder infection. After 2 ultrasounds and 2 cystoscope, it was determined to be some scarring from the radiation on the bladder. Apparently this isn't uncommon and effects you only when you strain yourself, like lifting something heavy. The radiation scars weaken some of the arteries in the bladder , if it happens to often it could seriously impede the flow of urine. Or so I have been told. It could be I am the only one to have this issue. Allen",

In my case the first 2 weeks were much like you describe. By week 4 I could see the light at the end of the tunnel . By the end of week 7 I was fully continent. Many on here became continent quicker and for others it took longer than 7 weeks. You seem to be doing everything right, I assume you are avoiding lifting heavy issues and sitting for long periods. Make sure you go for a short walk every 90 minutes or less, just a walk around the house for 10 minutes will help. The main thing is have \"patience\". Your plumbing has experienced a major shock, and you need to give it time to heal. Feel free to bring questions here because there is nothing you are going through that numerous others haven't before you. Misery does like company at times. Good Luck Allen",

I decided on Robotic Surgery vs radiation as the surgeons told me if radiation didn't work they would not do robotic surgery after.

If three weeks is the earliest date your urologist can get you in, then as stressful as it will be, you may have to go with it. Perhaps a urologist in another city could get you in a few days earlier, but the difference of 2 or 3 days will make little change. In Canada 3 weeks is about average. Having said that you should make certain you are on a cancellation list. Good Luck B",

I realize PC is a slow mover however at some point in time it could escape the gland. The nurse no doubt must feel comfortable you are not in any risk of that happening, but I'd feel better hearing it directly from the surgeon. Good Luck Allen",

I assume when you refer to \"keyhole\" surgery you are talking DiVinci. If so it's an excellent choice in my opinion. Could you clarify if your Gleason is 3+4 or 4+3? As we get more information on your numbers we will be able to offer more advice. In the meantime relax, you have found a great home of support here. Allen",

From the time you go in the room, until you leave will be approximately 10-12 minutes. They start by getting you positioned on the table, then they do a mini cat scan to verify your bowel and bladder are as they should be. It is really nothing to sweat over, you can return to work, go shoot pool or whatever. Allen",

The vast majority have had to deal with Incontinence and ED some for a short time, some for many years. Personally it may be your husband is tired of people handling him delicately and would just like to hear straight talk. I think you need to be tactful but you should make him understand he is not the only person going through this and he should peruse this site and read some of the stories. Some are upbeat of guys in the zero club and at the opposite end are guys wondering how long they can expect to live. Obviously you are a loving, supportive wife but please don't give him a wheel chair, get him walking and running. Brave",

During the first 8 months I found myself having to move front .1 to .8 in order to maintain a good erection for 30-45 minutes.

Two months ago I woke up with an erection and was able to maintain it without injection or Cialis. My doctor said it is not uncommon for some men to go years without an erection and suddenly it appears. You could ask your Uro about combining Cialis and Tri Mix. I never did tell my Uro, but don't recommend it. I am now 67, how old are you? B",

      "Content": "Hi trinity. Both surgery and radiation are going to have similar side effects. At 59 I'm not sure that making the choice based on ED is the wisest course of action. I think you should set up an interview with a top surgeon and a top oncologist and make a decision based on your trust and comfort level with them. In the case of the surgeon you could ask him to guarantee you that he will be the one doing the surgery. Good Luck Allen",

That experience on it's own would raise your stress level. I think you have let yourself absorb only the tough side of the biopsy. Mine was noisier than I expected but 99% pain free. I had zero bleeding afterwards. There really is no substitute for it , so next time think positive and when you arrive at clinic ask if they expect delays, if they do then ask how long. Wouldn't hurt to take a book or magazine. Good luck Allen",

Many people I am sure will give you the benefit of their experience and recommendations, all will be worthwhile. I was diagnosed at 65 and also had controlled hypertension and high cholesterol. Obviously you see that some sort of action is required based on your dad's numbers. In my opinion you have two good options: Surgery or radiation. If you have concerns about surgery then you should get a 2nd opinion from an oncologist. Most posters here I believe went with and would still choose surgery. I would recommend you see a good surgeon and get his opinion on your dad's condition and what side affects he should expect. You and your dad then need to have the same type of conversation with an oncologist. Both types of surgery are equally successful in my opinion, but robotic is far less invasive, and healing time is dramatically shorter. I think you will find the side affects for surgery and radiation are quite similar. Good Luck, Please keep us in the loop. Allen",

If you were allergic to this chemical you could get a rash, in which case change to one that doesn't add chemicals.",

      "Content": "Welcome to the site montrob. Given your great success with continence for a fairly long period after post surgery, I would suggest you look first at your Kegel routine. It may be you have increased your K exercises or conversely you may have cut back to far on them. I suggest you ensure you are doing kegel exercises at the exact level (no more, no less) that you did day 1. If it still doesn't help, then you need to discuss next steps with your surgeon. I know how you feel about the ED situation, I had my surgery approx. 18 months ago and I still have ED although 2 urologists told me my ED should last up to 6 months. I am now using Trimix for erections. I agree with newporter in that life is precious and I wouldn't trade 10 weeks let alone 10 years of life for unassisted ERECTION. Life is more important than sex, to me anyway. Good Luck Allen",

No one wants cancer but if you are going to get it then this is the one to get because it moves slowly. As far as worry goes you will learn to push it to the back of your mind but it will always surface especially when testing time comes around. One of the best things you can do is dial into this site when you feel worried or stressed and let someone chat you through it. Keep a smile on your face.

I could see them telling you no call means all is ok..BUT for something this serious, you want to hear the words that all is clear. I too am in Canada, (London,ON) and I've never encountered a doctor who was less than 100% supportive, and sympathetic towards his/her patients. They call me with the results of every test even if it's a simple cholesterol test. I would call your doctors office and tell the nurse that you want a call back asap with the outcome of the tests.

Three days ago I noticed a drop or three of blood after urination when I got up. I started drinking a lot of water and just resting, resulting in zero blood in the urine for 1 1/2 days. This morning After getting up I went to washroom and zero blood. I then went on a 3 mile power walk and when I returned there was quite a bit of blood in urine. Does this sound like a tear or a prostate issue?There is no burning pain that accompanies the urination. Allen .",

My PSA climbed from 3.5 to 6.5 over 2 years and I biopsy did show I had PC. Your dad's could be due to other reasons . It would help to know his readings over past 3 or 4 years.

I refused to wait and watch further so went to an oncologist and had radiation. They usually don't look at the psa for at least 3 months after treatments stop but I was curious as I was heading to Florida for 4 months. The day I had my last treatment (Dec 24th) he did a psa and told me not to expect any change from the 0.12 but it had already dropped to 0.1. HE was happy, I was thrilled. I will get next psa done at the end of April and expecting to return back to zero.The tough part of the treatments was that you had to have a FULL bladder and an EMPTY bowel every day. I looked forward to weekends. But thankfully I had ZERO side affects from the treatments. B",

My bladder has enlarged veins due to the radiation which is no problem , however thereis a large bright pink section on the wall of my bladder and he's not sure about it. He could see no tumours but took another urine analysis and sent it to the lab along with the Cysto picture. I have to wait 2 weeks for the results.

Human nature says each one would tell their spouse along with others, and all of them would tell someone, and before you know it everyone you know will be asking daily how you are doing.

My ED still continues, at first I had no luck with Viagra or Cialis and used TriMix .It worked fantastic, after another 2 years I found 100mg Viagra worked well enough for penetration and ejaculation. I still use TriMix occasionally as I have never experienced any pain. I do get a headache, and flushing with Viagra. Just be patient, it will come. You are healthy, young, and fortunate to be a Gleason 6. I am a 7 (3+4) and was 65 when I had original surgery. Good Luck Allen",

      "Content": "Welcome to the site montrob. Given your great success with continence for a fairly long period after post surgery, I would suggest you look first at your Kegel routine. It may be you have increased your K exercises or conversely you may have cut back to far on them. I suggest you ensure you are doing kegel exercises at the exact level (no more, no less) that you did day 1. If it still doesn't help, then you need to discuss next steps with your surgeon. I know how you feel about the ED situation, I had my surgery approx. 18 months ago and I still have ED although 2 urologists told me my ED should last up to 6 months. I am now using Trimix for erections. I agree with newporter in that life is precious and I wouldn't trade 10 weeks let alone 10 years of life for unassisted ERECTION. Life is more important than sex, to me anyway. Good Luck Allen",

My surgeon told me upfront he was allowing 5 hours although he may finish a little sooner.As I said earlier I was 4:45 . If I wanted to be in and out quickly I would have gone for the standard surgery which takes 1/2 the time or less of Robotic, however I had 2 urologists recommend the robotic because it was significantly less invasive, I asked my GP and she said that 80% of her patients in the past 5 years who had pc went for the robotic. The difference is the standard surgery is like cutting a square around an onion and removing it. Robotic is like removing the onion by peeling and removing 1 layer at a time. B",

I assume your father's doctor will order another PSA in a few months and if it climbs he may want to do a biopsy, or, he may want to do a biopsy now. My PSA climbed from 3.5 to 6.5 over 2 years and I biopsy did show I had PC. Your dad's could be due to other reasons . It would help to know his readings over past 3 or 4 years. Get as much info as you can re past PSA tests and we can better give you suggestions. Good Luck, Keep us up to speed and know we are here for you and your dad. Allen",

The Inconvenience is they want your bowel empty and your bladder full for each treatment.

My bladder has enlarged veins due to the radiation which is no problem , however thereis a large bright pink section on the wall of my bladder and he's not sure about it.

You have time to meet several doctors(surgeons, oncologists, etc) and discuss their opinions, procedures, expected outcome and side affects. The cancer is not going away and the psa will climb. I would set up appointments and go with the doctor/procedure you feel most comfortable with. No rush, but start the action process. Allen",

Your cancer is low risk currently, but that doesn't mean you should procrastinate in making a decision, and getting rid of it. Cancer doesn't get better with time. Best of luck Allen",

It isn't a procedure you want done every morning before breakfast but there really is very little discomfort . The thought of it is far worse than the actual procedure. You will be relieved when you find out it was an infection. Keep in touch. Allen",

I met today with my urologist who performed my Di Vinci, he told me I had a small cyst in each kidney , nothing to worry about. He did a Cysto while I was there and now I'm stressed. My bladder has enlarged veins due to the radiation which is no problem , however thereis a large bright pink section on the wall of my bladder and he's not sure about it. He could see no tumours but took another urine analysis and sent it to the lab along with the Cysto picture. I have to wait 2 weeks for the results. I planned on leaving for Florida tomorrow but will postpone it. Allen",

Doubtful you will experience much pain after surgery that an over the counter pain pill can't control. For the first few weeks after the catheter is removed you will probably go through a lot of pads, don't get discouraged as this too will pass, just ensure you keep up with your Keegal exercises. Good luck and keep in touch Allen",

My ED still continues, at first I had no luck with Viagra or Cialis and used TriMix .It worked fantastic, after another 2 years I found 100mg Viagra worked well enough for penetration and ejaculation. I still use TriMix occasionally as I have never experienced any pain. I do get a headache, and flushing with Viagra. Just be patient, it will come. You are healthy, young, and fortunate to be a Gleason 6. I am a 7 (3+4) and was 65 when I had original surgery. Good Luck Allen",

After a few weeks she threw the bell in the garbage and told him to get off his butt and start moving. Neither of them were fun to be around for a while. Now he's back golfing and will be getting the other knee replaced in 2014. His wife plans to take a cruise while he recuperates. B",

From a distance I would suggest you may just have a prostate infection or another type of urinary infection. And I've never heard \"Leg Tingling\" being a symptom of PC. Your doctor seems to have sent you for numerous tests, so upon completion did he suggest what the cause could be? Or what the next step would be? Given all the tests you've had, and if you think a clear bone scan will make you feel better, then go for it. But please calm down or you could find your next issue is of the heart type.you didn't say how long the delay was between sex and PSA test, if it was within 48 hours it could cause a slight bump. Obviously you need to pursue this until you feel better, and I wish you good luck. Allen",

The only change I have made is to reduce my kegel exercises from 45 min/day to 12 min/day. I did this after reading several posts about members exercise times and thought I may be doing to much. Has anyone else experienced a return to leakage after a year or so of continence? Allen",

One of the reasons they do a mini cat scan prior to each treatment is so they know your bladder is full and your bowel empty. A full bladder keeps your bowel out of harms way. There is no 2 week honeymoon, I had all 33 done with virtually zero side affects except the last 3 or 4 treatments I experienced light fatigue for 15-30 minutes.

I never rec'd the exercise plan from my doctor but rather he physiotherapist, and I may go back and visit him. My wife (RN) thinks I need to cut the 10KM run to 5KM in the morning and 5KM at night and also drink 1 cup of coffee before the run versus 3. I thought the continence issue was gone forever. I have noticed some wear on the heels of my running shoes so will replace them as well. Allen",

My coffee consumption also the same. After about 30 min I feel a small squirt and a couple of occasional ones before reaching home. I have no further leakage during the day or night. The only change I have made is to reduce my kegel exercises from 45 min/day to 12 min/day. I did this after reading several posts about members exercise times and thought I may be doing to much.

I spent 10 minutes questioning him about advancements in HT. He said there really hadn't been any Vis a Vis side affects. He said people over weight, smokers, diabetics as well as those on blood thinners and lower back issues have by far the harshest side affects. Anyway I have 6 more months of trying to reduce weight, build muscle mass and party hearty before I go through it all again. Allen",

      "Content": "Welcome Rob, I can see why you could be concerned but you are building yourself into a full blown panic. Firstly I doubt you have PC especially since you were 28 when this started. From a distance I would suggest you may just have a prostate infection or another type of urinary infection. And I've never heard \"Leg Tingling\" being a symptom of PC. Your doctor seems to have sent you for numerous tests, so upon completion did he suggest what the cause could be? Or what the next step would be? Given all the tests you've had, and if you think a clear bone scan will make you feel better, then go for it. But please calm down or you could find your next issue is of the heart type.you didn't say how long the delay was between sex and PSA test, if it was within 48 hours it could cause a slight bump. Obviously you need to pursue this until you feel better, and I wish you good luck. Allen",

I had my surgery in October 2012, the surgery lasted a bit over 4 hours. When surgery was over and I returned to my room I was naturally foggy, although it improved dramatically over 2-3 weeks, I still find even today my ability to recall many things much slower (I do realize I'm 69 not 65). I asked my urologist and he said it had nothing to do with surgery. I do think it has something to do with the anaesthic. I am especially bothered with sudden changes in the barometric pressure. I never had any of these issues prior to surgery. Allen",

Firstly using ultra sensitive food scale I had to keep track of urine weight at the end of each day: * Three times a day perform kegel exercise as follows: 1) lift floor 25% and hold 5 seconds, lift floor to maximum and hold 10 seconds, lift floor 25% and hold 5 seconds., take a 60 second break and repeat a total of 10 times. Do exercise 3 times day (morning, afternoon,night). * Lift floor to maximum, drop quickly to base 20 times (repeat as above). * once per day walk for 30 minutes while raising bottom floor to 25% and holding for entire walk. The above worked well for me. Good luck Allen",

His PSA goes between 3.2 and 3.6 and he is 69 years old. He has been experiencing extreme frequency, sore testicles, and rectal pain for 12 weeks. His doctor thinks he has prostatitis plus an enlarged prostate. He was on an antibiotic (tera nor floxacin) for 8 weeks which helped but 2 weeks after he finished script, it returned. He can only stand to drive for 30 minutes before pain forces him to stop. His DR is sending him for a cysto in mid Nov. He of course is worried he has PC. His URO answers questions but unless he knows what to ask no info is forthcoming. Just wondering if anyone had similar symptoms, and could reco questions he should ask his URO. Should he ask for a biopsy? Allen",

      "Content": "I just talked to an old friend who lives in a very small town in Canada. He was looking for advice on his extreme rectal pain. His PSA goes between 3.2 and 3.6 and he is 69 years old. He has been experiencing extreme frequency, sore testicles, and rectal pain for 12 weeks. His doctor thinks he has prostatitis plus an enlarged prostate. He was on an antibiotic (tera nor floxacin) for 8 weeks which helped but 2 weeks after he finished script, it returned. He can only stand to drive for 30 minutes before pain forces him to stop. His DR is sending him for a cysto in mid Nov. He of course is worried he has PC. His URO answers questions but unless he knows what to ask no info is forthcoming. Just wondering if anyone had similar symptoms, and could reco questions he should ask his URO. Should he ask for a biopsy? Allen",

In addition to the great advice the other members have given, your husband should ask his doctor about taking Viagra or Cialis in advance of treatment. You should also prepare your husband for the incontinence that occurs especially in the days and week(s) following treatment. For me the first week was scary and I was changing pads several times a day, however, as time passes and the effects of doing kegel exercises start working he will see improvement. At the end of 7 weeks I was fully continent . Good luck, your husband will need your support, but in the end it will be ok. Please keep us informed of his progress, and don't hesitate to ask questions. Allen",

      "Content": "Hello hollienbilly, welcome to the site. One of the questions raised which I never thought about is : How long on average does HT last before patient builds up an immunity to it? For no good reason I thought you used hormone drugs indefinitely. After 18 months with PC I still have a Lot to learn. Currently I'm fortunate to be in the zero club but that could change one day. Good Luck and Best Wishes to you and your husband. I hope he gets to dance at his grandchildren's wedding. Allen",

I would think your first course of action is to discuss it with your GP and they will do a urine analysis, and a DRE, depending on those results they may order a PSA. But at this stage I would put the cancer notion out of your mind. One of my best friends had to urinate a half dozen times on a round of golf.

Hard to know what \"checked out\" really entails in your dad's case. Did he have just a DRE or a biopsy? I have read that prostate cancer is one of the major causes of death for men in England, not sure if it's due to the men ignoring the symptoms, or the medical system's approach to PSA testing. Again, sorry about your dad but I wish you all the best with your challenge. Please stay on top of it. Allen",

My psa had dropped significantly already. He had told me earlier that they usually wait 3-4 months to do the 1st psa after radiation treatment stops. My next app't is the end of April when I get back from Florida. I hope to get away on Dec 29th. Looking forward to sunny warm weather and lots of eating out and golfing. B",

If the lidocaine and KY don't improve things in 24 hours then I suggest you may want to touch bases with the surgeon's office. Some discomfort is understandable but not a lot of discomfort. It could be the doctor wants it removed, checked and replaced or reinserted. Good luck B",

I have very minute leakage with ejaculation, I would guesstimate it as 6-10 drops. I could be wrong but I attribute this to the success in surgery plus faithful kegel exercises that I perform 3 times/day (total of 1 hour). I am sure there are many others who achieve zero leakage but I'm not bothered with a few drops. B",
