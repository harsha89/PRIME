The other two told me that I would have my PSA's every three months for two years, then at six month intervals until five years, then every year. My new uro put me on annual PSA's now. The NCCM treatment guide for low risk stated that a PSA should be done every six to 12 months for five years, then annually. Were my first two doctors erring on the side of caution? My third uro did consult the guidelines prior to deciding on the annual PSA starting now. What do you guys think about this? I will have an annual physical at the end of the year with my GP. I think I will talk with him about my concerns and ask him for a PSA. That way I will get a PSA every six months, at least for another year or two.

      "Content": "I'm eight weeks post surgery, and like so many others that have stated, I can now pee like a racehorse. Some have stated that the flow of urine stops quite rapidly. I experience this rapid stoppage also. Within a second of the urine stopping, it feels like I am getting a bladder spasm or some sort of bladder discomfort. This discomfort around 5-10 seconds and then subsides. If anyone has ever experienced a bladder spasm, you feel a discomfort for a short time and then the spasm starts, which is usually painful. I am experiencing just the discomfort, not the painful spasm. Have any of you guys that have a forceful urination experienced anything like this?",

      "Content": "I've been somewhat irregular for a couple of weeks so I started on Colace last week. I was out today for a Dermatology appointment when I got the urge. Before I knew what was happening, I had severe pain in my rectum. Felt like King Kong gave me a DRE. I had to pull over to the side of the road it hurt so bad. Luckily, I was able to get to a restroom shortly thereafter, and the situation was eliminated, so to speak. That is the first time this has happened even though I have been slightly constipated since surgery. I guess things aren't as healed up as I thought. Hopefully, time does heal.",

      "Content": "Chuck, your colonoscopy story reminds me of my first one when I turned 50. In the military, I had a sigmoidoscopy performed by a doctor and a tech, both male. After I retired from the Navy, I stayed in the military health system, so I just assumed my colonoscopy team would be male. I was surprised when I showed up and they were both female. The female tech looked more on the line of Sgt. Rock from the comic books, but the doctor was a very attractive Asian. They got me in there on the table laying on my side with my knees up towards my chest with my most attractive feature facing them. The tech explained the procedure and told me I could watch the monitor to see what they were seeing. We all talked about the procedure and some other things. I could feel the doctor messing with my rear for what seemed like five or six minutes. I was watching the monitor all this time. I couldn't figure out what I was looking at. Finally, I asked how they could determine if any polyps existed with what I was observing on the monitor. The doctor said that she hasn't been able to get the probe in yet because sphincter was tight as a drum. We all got a laugh out of that. I relaxed a little and the procedure went full speed ahead with no further problems. I guess I was a little more uptight because of the female presence and didn't realize it. Five years later for my second one, I was out like a light as soon as the sedative hit my IV. Next one later this year, can't wait.",

This makes me think you are talking about blood in your urine. Could you please clarify? Chuck is right about the hemis. Dark red is old blood and brighter red is fresh blood. I would think that after three months, your surgical areas would be healed enough that bleeding would not occur. But straining during a BM could start encourage hemi formation. These guys are right about seeing your doctor. Better safe than sorry.",

      "Content": "Thanks, Chuck. Too bad there is not a test to prove that a G6 found through a biopsy is a true G6 without having to remove the prostate. Of course, even a G6 tumor can continue to grow or more could spread within the prostate that would require a prostatectomy to alleviate problems, i.e. urinary issues and ED. Would I be correct in stating that even though you have a cancer within the prostate, each one of those cancers (G6, G7, G8, G9, G10) is a different type of prostate cancer? Each cancer would remain the original G* and not progress to a different G*? I always thought that if left untreated a G6 would progress to a G7, then G8, and so on. Since G7 and above are known to metastasize, treatment of some sort is mandatory depending on the individual's age and other health issues. A person biopsied with a G6 falls into the gray area. You don't know if it's a true G6 without removing the prostate and getting a path report. And even if it is a true G6 and you don't have to worry about it metastasizing, further growth of the G6 tumors could cause you problems down the road that might require the removal of the prostate. I still feel that I made the correct decision for surgery. I am just lucky that I don't have any incontinence or ED issues. And I know that I am a true G6. A huge psychological relief.",

      "Content": "Thanks newporter. We posted about the same time. The first link was very interesting whereas the second link was over my head. Those guys seem to think that cells can mutate into a higher grade of cancer. I am quite sure that there are many different opinions in the medical research areas on how cancers evolve. For us lay people, we just remain confused when medical researchers can't agree on things. Hopefully one of these days, medical science will figure out how all of these cancers work and can come up with some sort of preventative or active treatment.",

      "Content": "Thanks newporter. We posted about the same time. The first link was very interesting whereas the second link was over my head. Those guys seem to think that cells can mutate into a higher grade of cancer. I am quite sure that there are many different opinions in the medical research areas on how cancers evolve. For us lay people, we just remain confused when medical researchers can't agree on things. Hopefully one of these days, medical science will figure out how all of these cancers work and can come up with some sort of preventative or active treatment.",

I also had been using stool softeners but they couldn't get that first good BM. Hydration is a key factor. Don't cut back to far or you will pay for it. Actually two liters per day seems about right. Just stop about 3-4 hours before bedtime. Only consume enough right before bedtime to prevent dry mouth.",

      "Content": "My robotic surgery was done in a military hospital. They work in a two person team. My actual surgeon had less than 25 procedures under his belt. The senior doctor, who was the first USAF doctor to perform a RALP in 2009, had less than 300. Military doctors don't have the luxury to only perform one type of surgery as do some civilian doctors. My point is, obviously more experience is good, but surgical skills, dedication to their profession, and two heads, and eyes, are better than one. I couldn't ask for better results as I have had minimal leakage and the nerve-sparing procedure was flawless as I had pre-surgical firmness within a month of surgery.",

      "Content": "My robotic surgery was done in a military hospital. They work in a two person team. My actual surgeon had less than 25 procedures under his belt. The senior doctor, who was the first USAF doctor to perform a RALP in 2009, had less than 300. Military doctors don't have the luxury to only perform one type of surgery as do some civilian doctors. My point is, obviously more experience is good, but surgical skills, dedication to their profession, and two heads, and eyes, are better than one. I couldn't ask for better results as I have had minimal leakage and the nerve-sparing procedure was flawless as I had pre-surgical firmness within a month of surgery.",

They did chemo and radiation, which burned him on the outside. I can only imagine what it did inside. It was a cruel death. I can only imagine what is going on in your dad's mind as he thinks about the fate of his dad and uncle. My dad's plight was in the early 1970's. There have been many advances in the all fields of oncology, both in understanding the disease processes and the treatment. I'm sure your dad recognizes that these medical advances exist. Talk with him and get him to acknowledge that all medical treatments have advanced in the last several years. Discuss that the treatment of his dad and uncle are outdated and that these recent advances are at least worth having an in depth discussion with an oncologist and that you would like to be present when that happens. After all, four ears are better than two. It can't hurt to talk and it could extend his life to see you married and hold his grandchildren in his arms.",

These are done anytime that I take a leak and throughout the day when I feel that I will do something that will more than likely cause me to leak a little. So far I haven't noticed any increase in leakage compared to when I was religiously doing the Mayo method. If I do, I'll just start the Mayo method for a while then stop again. I feel that the tighten and release method is keeping that little sphincter muscle in shape, at least for me.",

      "Content": "I stopped doing the Mayo method of Kegels a few months ago. But in the course of the day's activities, I perform several tighten and release Kegels. These are done anytime that I take a leak and throughout the day when I feel that I will do something that will more than likely cause me to leak a little. So far I haven't noticed any increase in leakage compared to when I was religiously doing the Mayo method. If I do, I'll just start the Mayo method for a while then stop again. I feel that the tighten and release method is keeping that little sphincter muscle in shape, at least for me.",

      "Content": "Did you have robotic or open surgery? That's too bad about the abscess. Like you didn't have enough troubles. Just doesn't seem fair sometimes. I had kidney cancer last year and had urine leakage about a week after surgery. Back in the hospital to remove the urine and put in a drain. That didn't work so two weeks later, back in the hospital again to put in a uretal stent and another Foley. Had that in for another month. Finally got all of that out and within another month, I ended up in the ER with colitis. So three and a half months after surgery I felt good. Two months later I found out I had prostate cancer. Luckily I have come out of that ordeal without any problems. Just hang in there. Hopefully all should be OK soon. I don't understand why the doctor's are excited about 0.04 PSA ten weeks out from surgery. Usually the PSA is done at 12 weeks. Where are you located? How much experience does you doctor have with prostate surgeries?",

      "Content": "I've been on atenolol for years, before and after surgery. I was lucky and was dry in about six weeks post-op. I know everyone's body reacts differently to medications, just saying. Look into Chuck's recommendation about doing Mayo Clinic method of Kegels. I had problems initially doing 50 or so kegels a day per my doctor. Started the Mayo method and it drastically reduced leakage almost immediately. Incontinence varies quite a bit, from person to person. Try the Mayo method for a couple of weeks and see if it helps. If not, then follow your doctors orders.",

      "Content": "My surgeon prescribed a penis pump for use as soon as the catheter came out. I have been using it almost daily since I had my surgery in July of 2014. Not only did I not lose any length, my girth has increased quite a bit. He prescribed it to increase the blood flow to the penis since there was quite a bit of trauma due to the surgery. He said the side effect was that it would increase the girth. Win-win.",

      "Content": "The problem on the second time up is normal, at least to me it is. I felt the same way on both my kidney surgery and RALP. First walk I seemed energized. Second time, I thought I did something wrong. Remember, the body is placed in some weird positions for the RALP. Takes a while to get the kinks out. Everything should be fine. Until all is healed, there could be minor setbacks, but nothing to worry about. Eat healthy and drink a lot of liquids. Take a stool softener. Constipation can be pretty painful. I ended up having to use suppositories to get things going. I'm still taking Colace two weeks post surgery.",

      "Content": "In July 2013, I had a robotic partial nephrectomy of my right kidney due to renal cell carcinoma. The incision location that they used to remove the excised portion of my kidney had considerable amount of scar tissue and was dark red for months. Finally around nine months post surgery, the area was back to normal skin color and the scar tissue could not be felt anymore. In April 2014, I had my RALP and as you surgical survivors know, the incision above the naval was pretty gnarly. Since this incision was at least 50% larger than the kidney extraction point, I wondered how long before I got back to normal. I'm a little past the 15 month post surgery mark. The color of the incision is just a little darker than the surrounding area. I can still feel scar tissue below the incision, but it is almost gone. I know everyone heals differently. This is just some info for some of the newer guys in case inquiring minds wanted to know. As you can see, I have a lot of time on my hands.",

      "Content": "I'm with you Fred concerning my post surgery results. My med team told me to perform five or so Kegels every time I took a piss. Problem was I was taking a leak eight to ten times a day. My leakage got worse instead of better. Then I started doing the Kegels using Chuck's method and within days I had minimal leakage, one pad every two days, and soon was pad free. Every once in a while I will have a minor leak but not bad enough to warrant a pad or even a shield. I am definitely a proponent of less is better.",

      "Content": "Good evening DD, I know this thing is very stressful for you. It has been for most of us. I'm a widower and empty nester. I dealt with this stuff all alone also. More than likely your scans will be negative. Your big decision is how are you going to treat this. I would guess you have read pros and cons about surgery and radiation, and all of their side effects. For me, I just wanted the cancer out of me. My mom, dad and granddad all died from cancer, not PC, but cancer none the less. The way that I interpret your first post, you are concerned with your alcohol consumption and usage of Xanax. I'm sure you know that you shouldn't mix the two. If you continue, be extremely careful. As a project manager, I'm sure that you are used to pressure situations. You look at whatever problem arises, analyse it, and then formulate one or more solutions to solve the problem. Attack this problem the same way. While PC is very scary, it is also curable. Be positive and proactive. Read Walsh's book. It provides a lot of info and explains the physiology of this disease very well. If you think that you are spinning out of control, PM me for my phone number. I will be happy to talk to you about this. At this point, it is not as bad as you imagination can conjure up. Pat",

      "Content": "First of all, I am four months post-op da Vinci surgery. Things have gone quite well for me. I started doing Kegel's the way Chuck has previously described around week three post-op and at six weeks I was pad free. I have been doing these Kegels religiously every night. That is up until August 8th when I went on an 11 day, 3900 mile road trip. I stayed with my daughter some nights and in hotels other nights. Quite frankly, I was so tired at night I just forgot to do my Kegels for these 11 days. It was as if I had left this whole prostrate cancer episode at home. I have not experienced any negative feedback concerning leakage. So I have decided to do a little experiment. I am only going to do Kegels on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. Chuck has stated that Mayo had told him he would have to do these everyday for the rest of his life. My doc told me to do Kegels, but never put a time line on it. Others have reported many different ways of doing their Kegels. Last night was the first night of this experiment. If anyone is interested, I will post periodic reports of how things are going.",

      "Content": "First of all, I am four months post-op da Vinci surgery. Things have gone quite well for me. I started doing Kegel's the way Chuck has previously described around week three post-op and at six weeks I was pad free. I have been doing these Kegels religiously every night. That is up until August 8th when I went on an 11 day, 3900 mile road trip. I stayed with my daughter some nights and in hotels other nights. Quite frankly, I was so tired at night I just forgot to do my Kegels for these 11 days. It was as if I had left this whole prostrate cancer episode at home. I have not experienced any negative feedback concerning leakage. So I have decided to do a little experiment. I am only going to do Kegels on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights. Chuck has stated that Mayo had told him he would have to do these everyday for the rest of his life. My doc told me to do Kegels, but never put a time line on it. Others have reported many different ways of doing their Kegels. Last night was the first night of this experiment. If anyone is interested, I will post periodic reports of how things are going.",

      "Content": "I'm with you Fred concerning my post surgery results. My med team told me to perform five or so Kegels every time I took a piss. Problem was I was taking a leak eight to ten times a day. My leakage got worse instead of better. Then I started doing the Kegels using Chuck's method and within days I had minimal leakage, one pad every two days, and soon was pad free. Every once in a while I will have a minor leak but not bad enough to warrant a pad or even a shield. I am definitely a proponent of less is better.",

      "Content": "Good evening DD, I know this thing is very stressful for you. It has been for most of us. I'm a widower and empty nester. I dealt with this stuff all alone also. More than likely your scans will be negative. Your big decision is how are you going to treat this. I would guess you have read pros and cons about surgery and radiation, and all of their side effects. For me, I just wanted the cancer out of me. My mom, dad and granddad all died from cancer, not PC, but cancer none the less. The way that I interpret your first post, you are concerned with your alcohol consumption and usage of Xanax. I'm sure you know that you shouldn't mix the two. If you continue, be extremely careful. As a project manager, I'm sure that you are used to pressure situations. You look at whatever problem arises, analyse it, and then formulate one or more solutions to solve the problem. Attack this problem the same way. While PC is very scary, it is also curable. Be positive and proactive. Read Walsh's book. It provides a lot of info and explains the physiology of this disease very well. If you think that you are spinning out of control, PM me for my phone number. I will be happy to talk to you about this. At this point, it is not as bad as you imagination can conjure up. Pat",

I found that when I only did seven Kegels at night, in bed, in three weeks, I went from two pads a day to none. Doing too many Kegels fatigues that little sphincter muscle and increases incontinence. Several people other than me have stated that reducing the number of kegels performed each day actually helped their incontinence. I am almost five months post surgery and I am doing my kegels only on M/W/F without any negative effect to my continence. Good luck.

      "Content": "Welcome to the club. Steve. I initially started doing about 50 kegels per day. I found that when I only did seven Kegels at night, in bed, in three weeks, I went from two pads a day to none. Doing too many Kegels fatigues that little sphincter muscle and increases incontinence. Several people other than me have stated that reducing the number of kegels performed each day actually helped their incontinence. I am almost five months post surgery and I am doing my kegels only on M/W/F without any negative effect to my continence. Good luck. Look at the signatures of others on this forum and create one for yourself. It helps in discussing problems with others.",

      "Content": "Welcome RB151. It's too bad that you have become a member of our little club. There's a lot of info here and others will answer your multitude of questions. I don't know about Kegels prior to treatment, but Chuck's one set per day helped me out considerably. I did around 50 per day and my leakage seemed to get worse. Within a week or so of starting the one set per day, my leakage was minimal. That little sphincter does not like fatigue. Read Walsh's book, it explains a lot of things. If you read the threads on here, you'll find a lot of us have had surgery, mostly robotic, but radiation, mostly brachytherapy, has been mentioned a lot lately. Pros and cons for each. The main thing is that you have to make the decision of which treatment seems right to you. You know your personal circumstances better than anyone, so let your common sense and your heart be your guide, plus the search function on here or Google. Talk to a surgeon and a radiation oncologist to get the lowdown on each treatment. The general rule is radiation after surgery is OK, but surgery after radiation is pretty iffy. Your BPH should enter into your decision process. Obviously surgery will take care of that immediately. Some have said radiation will also help in this area, but I would talk to a radiation oncologist about this issue. With surgery, the risks of side effects (incontinence and ED) are immediate, but usually improve over weeks or months, sometimes lasting years and require addition interventions for help. With radiation, the side effects take place later on. Again, talk to the respective doctors about side effects and treatments of them. Could you please explain your Gleason score to me? I have seen it expressed as 3+3=6 or 3+4=7 or 4+3=7, but not 3-6 & 2 - 7. Good luck with this chapter of your life. Feel free to ask questions and get opinions from us. Most of us are not medical professionals, so we can only offer personal opinions. Also, create a signature as others have done so that your history is on every one of your posts.

      "Content": "I had a RALP in April 2014. I had energy related problems that were finally resolved in late August. I started clearing some trees to build an addition onto my garage in early September. First day of work resulted in a very sore body. Rested my old body the next day. The next AM I awoke about 4AM with a pain in my right side. The pain continued on throughout the day and in the evening I started getting a fever. Got up to 101* plus so I got worried and went into the emergency room. Turned out that I had acute appendicitis and had to have an emergency appendectomy. Doctor said the appendix probably would have ruptured the next day. Bottom line is that if you have a pain in the lower right quadrant and you still have your appendix, you need to get some medical attention. It might save your life or prevent an enormous amount of medical problems. I also had robotic kidney surgery for a cancerous cyst in July 2013. Don't know if all of the rummaging around within my abdominal cavity caused the appendix problems or not.",
