I have tried to contact the doctor several times through his secretary and he was either in theatre or at a patient clinic which does make you think, far better that he is operating or treating a cancer patient if we have to wait then we have to wait !!

      "Content": "Had the biopsy and get the results on the 23rd Nov so it's an anxious wait !! One thing I can't get my head round is baseline PSA. My GP recorded a PSA of 61 in May. During a stay in hospital in June for something unconnected they recorded a 53 PSA Out of hospital and GP done another PSA and it was 40. Referred to Urologist recently and another PSA showed 47. Everyone(except me)seems fairly relaxed about this, could my baseline PSA be so high. I think not and I think I will be a full member of this forum soon and having Dr Walsh's book as a Christmas present. Can you have high PSA's like this that are not enlarged prostates or infections and do not develop into PC, there are people on the forum that know a lot more about this subject than me and any comments would be welcome. I don't mind the visits and tests(has to be done)but don't you think it's the waiting that drives you up the wall !!",

      "Content": "I am 58 years old and will add a signature when I have more info. I was searching the web for answers and came across an article by the American association for cancer research.They have info that supports the theory that Aspirin will lower your PSA scores. I have had high blood pressure for some years and take a Bendroflumethiazide tablet and an Aspirin daily. After my PSA of 61 I had my hospital stay and was treated with Ciprofloxacin(no Aspirin) and my next PSA was 53. On leaving hospital I continued with Ciprofloxacin and resumed the daily Aspirin, the next PSA was 40. I have now finished the Ciprofloxacin but still take the Aspirin now the PSA is 47. Could the tablets have influenced the PSA swings ? Not by that much, probably a coincidence but I will soon know what's going on,the worst outcome for me will be if they can't find any causes for the high PSA's Something is causing them, they are not normal scores !!!!!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigbrad2008 You can look at the data on recurrence (I had rads and hormones). The data I think shows that surgery is a bit better. HOWEVER, that data you see is based on old rad doses as the machines used when studies were started kina hit the other organs and the machines they use know are more targeted. So they have upped the rads doses. So take what you read with a grain of salt as we got higher doses and likely have better odds. what was your dre? any image evidence of outside of prostate? did you get imrt alone or brachiotherapy on top of imrt? Thanks for the reply Brad the dre showed a very hard left side with the right feeling normal. Non of the images showed evidence of spread and up till now I have only had IMRT.",

The radiation treatment (every day for just under 6 weeks) was not a problem for me although I was a little tired I carried on going to work and drove the car as usual. Some patients I spoke to were a bit sore but fortunately I didn't have this issue. One thing that I did find hard was keeping a full bladder. They get you to drink water before your treatment and if the treatment is delayed you still have to try and keep the water in the bladder. I had a few problems with the Hormone injections but hopefully you are not on these. If you have any more questions just ask.",

      "Content": "I have recently finished my Radiation & Hormone treatment ( my PC was too advanced for an operation ) and my PSA has dropped from 61 to 0.2 I am naturally pleased with this result but having had such a high PSA I would like to know what are the chances that the PC will return. I have read everything I can find and I think there is a high probability it will come back within 5 years. I am 60 next year and although I had planned to carry on until I am 65 I would not want to retire and have the PC suddenly come back, it may not be so easy to control next time( if there is a next time ! ) Has anyone been in my position and if so what was the outcome ? All opinions are as usual very welcome. I would also like to say thanks for all the advice given to me by everyone on the forum over the last few months and I do hope all your treatments go well.",

The one who dropped to zero is in his 4th year and the other about the same or a bit longer. One had 33 sessions, the other 40 sessions.

      "Content": "First post for me, I am 58 and I have had problems for months and turned to the forum for advice as I am getting anxious with all the waiting !! About 6 months ago I had discitis which is a blood infection that attacks the discs of the spine. I had trouble walking and a lot of back pain but after 3 weeks in hospital with IV antibiotics I am now a lot better. During the investigations to find a cause I had a PSA test and the score was 61. Since leaving the hospital and finishing the medication I have had more PSA tests as the first was considered to be very high. My scores were 53, 40 and the latest was 47 !!! Could the discitis have any connection with the prostate issue has anyone experienced this ? Do the PSA scores mean PC or could it be an enlarged prostate ? I am going to have an ultrasound and prostate biopsy next and would be interested in peoples comments so I am better placed to ask the right questions when I go to the hospital. Any comments or advice would be most welcome...................thankyou.",

I will give you a bit more information and as before I would be pleased to receive any replies and info that you think may be useful. I had the spinal infection and it was treated successfully with Ciprofloxacin via intravenus drip, after leaving hospital I continued with Ciprofloxacin tablet(750mg)twice a day for another month and then the hospital informed me that there was no trace of the infection and my blood was completely clear. I was then referred by my doctor to a Urologist because of the raised PSA of 61. I have had a DRE and the Urologist said it was smooth and not lumpy and slightly enlarged but to a size he would expect for someone of my age. He asked me to go another six weeks without any medication to make sure the my hospital stay had nothing to do with the high PSA result. I have been out of hospital for 3 months now and the medication was stopped 8 weeks ago. I had another PSA test and it has gone from 40 to 47. The Urologist is arranging for me to have an Ultrasound and biopsy now and as you can see the wait was not an insurance issue but just to confirm my infection had nothing to do with my prostate issue(we think !!). Having read a lot on the subject I think it may be cancer so I am prepared for a bit of a journey and welcome comments from my Cancer Forum friends.",

I had no pain at all during the DRE, a clear urine sample and they seem to rule out an infection. My PSA's are 61, 53, 40 & 47 are we definately talking cancer here or could it just as easily be something else ?",

I was like that at the beginning of this year, never off sick from work and felt fairly fit, I never went to see the doctor. I had noticed that I had lost pressure when I went to the toilet and it would sometimes be a bit stop start but I was 58 years old and things are bound to slow down as you get a bit older, it was not a problem. To cut a long story short I went to the doctors for something unrelated, I had a PSA blood test and now a lot further down the road I am faced with a fairly agressive cancer. Prostate cancer marches on unoticed you may not have many(or any)symtoms but if you are reading this then there must be something on your mind. Go to your doctor have a simple PSA blood test, it may be nothing and on the plus side you will have a baseline PSA to refer to in the future. The blood test is no problem. You might have a rectal examination again no problem. Later if Pc is suspected you may have a biopsy and it is nothing to fear from my experience. Reading the posts on this forum has helped me a lot, someone will have had experience of whatever concerns you. I am now waiting for staging results and when I have them I will turn to my friends on the forum again for advice. Merry Christmas and thankyou for all your help along the way. Derek",
