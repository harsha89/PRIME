      "Content": "Originally Posted by Honeybun078 Have you guys seen any pirads 4 not come back ad Pc or have you seen from this group that biopsies come back no pc and another issue. And can leisons be due to infection? I recently had a single PIRADS 4 lesion on MRI targeted by 2 cores that both came back negative. One had \"atypical gland\" cells. 12 other standard core samples also negative. PIRADS 4 doesn't have nearly as good a correlation for aggressive cancer as PIRADS 5. There is certainly a reasonable chance for a benign lesion of some type at PIRADS 4, along with less aggressive Gleason 6 (3+3). I would guess that there are various types of benign lesions, including a benign tumor.",

Between residents, physicians and a nurse who did my PCA3 \"massage\", from fingers to coils to ultrasound probes, I often say \"Moon River\" when something goes in. So far, no one has ever commented or chuckled about the Fletch reference... I had a 3T MRI with ERC about 10 years ago. I did not have pain, but it wasn't pleasant, either. I would also say tolerable, the worst part being it took about an hour or so. I am happy to say on my recent return visit, the NIH/NCI did not use an ERC and it only took about half the time.",
