      "Content": "Chuck, First I'd like to say thank you for taking the time to reach out to me, I feel so overwhelmed with different emotions. I have two young kids, a beautiful family who depend on me, I saw my brother and my dad pass away from cancer, they had different, more serious types. It's very scary and very confusing, I don't know which path to take. I just turned 52, I'm in good shape, work out an average of two times a week, eat healthy, my work consists of manual labor so other than injury pains I feel pretty good. My PSA history, 11/14 - 4.8, 7/15 - 6.2, 11/15 - 3.6, 4/16 - 4.9, 10/16 - 5.9, 3/17 - 7.5, then again 3/17 - 8.2 Out of all of the samples taken, two were found to have a Gleason score of 7, (3 + 4), and the other three areas were a Gleason 6, (3 + 3). The two areas of Gleason seven were found on the right base lateral, 70% of the tissue sample, and right lateral mid, 15% of tissue sample. Thank you, Eddie",
