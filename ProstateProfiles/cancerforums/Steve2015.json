      "Content": "I recently posted on this forum but was asked to separate my post from another\u0092s posting. I was diagnosed with pc in December: PSA = 3.3 NP found a hard spot during a DRE confirmed by urologist Biopsy at Right Lateral Apex (<<5% of adenocarcinoma) 11 others negative Gleason Score 3+3+6/10 Surgery or radiation does not appeal to me. I\u0092m early in this and am just trying to learn my options while on active surveillance. Does anyone have any info on the option stated below? Abstract: The phenomenon of regression of adenocarcinoma of the prostate after the withdrawal of antiandrogens is well documented. However, to our knowledge we report the first case of durable complete remission of hormone refractory prostate cancer after cessation of diethylstilbestrol. The drug was discontinued because the patient had disease progression while on diethylstilbestrol and withdrawal resulted in durable remission. In more than 3 years of followup since discontinuing diethylstilbestrol there has been no evidence of clinical or biochemical recurrence. \u2028\u2028Of course this is not conclusive, but there are anecdotal reports of PSA not rising after intermittent ADT (Androgen Deprivation Therapy). This would, I think qualify as SR because the general view ADT is not curative. It is because of these incidents that I have wondered why early stage PCa is not treated with what I refer to as ADT Lite \u0096 limited shots of Zoladex for instance. If the colony is small enough, the combine effects of ADT and the immune system might wipe it out permanently. \u2028\u2028I am not suggesting in any way that anyone should rely on SR as a potential \u0091cure\u0092 , but I think it is important to bear in mind that those men \u0096 the substantial majority in the US especially \u0096 who have a diagnosis that fits the criteria for this study would probably not lose anything \u0096 and might gain confidence in the Active Surveillance option if they followed the suggested PRIAS protocols.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I've never heard of this, but doesn't mean it doesn't have merit What is Gleason 3+3+6/10, do you mean 3+3=6, in 6 out of 10 cores? I meant to write 3+3=6/10 I'm not sure what 6/10 means but that is how it is written on the report. 12 specimens were reported with 1 specimen (<<5%). (<<5%) is how it is written on the report. Right Lateral Apex Minute Focus (<<5%) of adenocarcinoma, Gleason Score 3+3=6/10 I'm looking for a way to eradicate the cancer cells without surgery or radiation. I'm early in this disease so have time to further research early stage use of ADT pros and cons while on AS and further research what may bring about SR. I'm somewhat skeptical about how aggressive the medical research community is to find a permanent cure. I don't want to have some procedure done then always feel the clock is ticking when the cancer will return. I have no problem setting my own protocol based on my own research that is backed by documented permanent cures. I am a young 65. My father, his siblings and his parents, all lived to be about 90. That's my goal for now. Thanks for your response.",
