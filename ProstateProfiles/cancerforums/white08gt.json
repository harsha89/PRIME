      "Content": "I am with MichiganMan16, why the hurry? Takes about 90 days for the remaining psa to wash out . At 1 month mine was 0.06, 2nd month 0.07 and 3rd at 0.08 a slow steady climb. Around the middle of the 4th month started on Eligard HT at which time my psa was 0.10, 5 weeks later started 39 SRTs. Seems to me he is jumping the gun, HT is a cash cow for the Doctors. It was proven I had a reoccurrence before starting HT, it is very hard on your body. I opted out of HT several months after completing SRT and it affects the body up to a year after stopping. Dr. Pat Walsh believes it better later than sooner, after going through it I do too. HT will rack your body, say goodbye to the twins, hello hot flashes, fatigue, weight gain, muscle and hair loss or thinning. The SRT is tolerable, watch what you eat, no spicey food, empty colon and full bladder, not much to it.",

      "Content": "I am with MichiganMan16, why the hurry? Takes about 90 days for the remaining psa to wash out . At 1 month mine was 0.06, 2nd month 0.07 and 3rd at 0.08 a slow steady climb. Around the middle of the 4th month started on Eligard HT at which time my psa was 0.10, 5 weeks later started 39 SRTs. Seems to me he is jumping the gun, HT is a cash cow for the Doctors. It was proven I had a reoccurrence before starting HT, it is very hard on your body. I opted out of HT several months after completing SRT and it affects the body up to a year after stopping. Dr. Pat Walsh believes it better later than sooner, after going through it I do too. HT will rack your body, say goodbye to the twins, hello hot flashes, fatigue, weight gain, muscle and hair loss or thinning. The SRT is tolerable, watch what you eat, no spicey food, empty colon and full bladder, not much to it.",

I have Medicare A&B was wondering if anybody knows how much these shots cost. trying to figure out if I may need to go back to my old Urologist and demand the firmagon vs. Eligard.

The company carved me out and know have to buy my own secondary insurance. because I am not primary starting in October my wife had to go over to Cobra which is quite abit more than we were paying for both of us. AT&T has a contract with AON to help determine what plans to choose from. We were given 15 minutes after going over 4 PPO carriers. only 1 out of 4 of my doctors would accept BCBST. my Urologist was the only one but they said their list was not up to date. after getting a 2nd opinion from a younger Urologist he answered all my guestions and offered other HT options. new plan is BlueCross Advantage plan which he does not accept. Oncologist and Radiology Oncologist do not accept either. then add insult to injury when I signed up with AON my drug coverage was discontinued as of 11-30. I have been getting the run around since 12-1 and still have no drug coverage. tuesday I go for my Firmagon shot, hope to find how much next year will I have to pay after Medicare. do not want to go back to my former Urologist, basically his way or no way. he did great on surgery but will not take time to consult with me. he adamant about me staying on HT for 3 years and so is my Oncologist. I was wondering how do I know if my 39 srt worked if the HT is suppressing my PSA. for the last 6 months my levels have stayed below 0.05 and as low as 0.02, my T is -3 at the end of my 6 month shot of Eligard. I do not know exactly where I stand, all scans have come back negative. the other thing is when is zero really zero, so as long as my PSA is not 00.0 the cancer is still there and growing?",

I opted out early with my HT, with the SRT combined with HT we hit hard. You can always go back on HT but with the 6 month dose you can't. It worked out for me, been over 4 years since my RP. Luckily I was retired when I went through all of this because I could not function on HT. Stayed in brain fog the whole time besides all the other side effects.",

      "Content": "My testosterone tanked after opting out of HT, stayed in the low 200s for 1.5 years. Talked my Uro about TT, working out 4-5 days a week and not seeing any results. I gained over 20 lbs after my surgery, HT and SRT. Uro is a young guy and been asking about replacement therapy and he said we could try but need to be checked really close. I suggested from what I have been reading about Clomid, insurance won't pay but thought I would give it a try. In 1 month my Testosterone went from 246 to 424 and PSA still zero, feel better already. It is a female fertility drug but given to men increases testosterone naturally. So far no side effects, after only 7 weeks. Originally Uro suggested cutting pills in half which I did for 2 weeks, then did whole pill once a day for 2 weeks when he had me come to check my PSA. So far so good, time to get back in the gym. Just hope my T continues to go up, will know in 2 months, my next check up.",

      "Content": "rising psa after Da Vinci in Feb 2014, HT started 6-12, 6 month shot of Eligard. finished 39 SRTs 10-3-2014. 12-1 psa <0.05 and 3-3-2015 psa <0.05 as low as lab reads. seems to me the radiation worked since I have not had the Eligard shot due 12-12-2014. Urologist wanted to continue HT but I asked for AS, so I go for blood work 4-14-2015. Dr. Pat Walsh in his book believes later than sooner works better for some cases. I had severe problems from the HT maybe compounded by the SRT. so for now I am not on HT, who has had SRT and no HT after?",

      "Content": "i had the DaVinci RP, little incontinence for a few weeks, nothing major. ED problems remain after 2 1/2 months, doctor says they will get better give it time. what i have questions about is he wants my PSA to be 0.0, 30 days out had a reading of 0.06, 60 days out 0.07. i go back in 30 days, last visit he discussed beam radiation, clinical trials and meeting with oncologist. i more incline depending on my next blood work to take a slower approach. i do not want to be over treated. i was under the impression anything under < 0.1 was considered undetectable. will decide after 3 month reading what the plan of attack is going to be. just want to know how many men after a RP have a 0.0 reading. i think things are moving to fast, need to get back to normal before another round of meds start. my urologist is good surgeon but does not spend the time to answer all of my questions. guess he has done his job, now handing me off to an oncologist after this next blood work. before all this started back around Thanksgiving i was healthy 64 yo, work out 4-5 days a week, retired with multiple hobbies. no warning signs or problems prior to discovery on a complete physical. did not expect to be cured completely after the RP, do not want side effects of the the cure to be worse than living with the disease.",

Lupron will probably hinder you getting an erection without some help, lowers your Testostrone. your wife needs to be more sympathetic to the changes your body is going through. you are still early in your recovery, she needs to undertand this. as far as incontinence it is still early also, have her read the stickies at the top of this forum. you did not give your age which would help with others to chime in on that are about same age group.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rwewpar4 Where did you have your surgery? I had my surgery at Vattikuti Urology Institute at Henry Ford in Detroit. My surgeon was the first to perform a robotic prostate surgery world wide in 2001. I noticed that you are from Collierville, Tn, My wife is from Paris, Tn. We live in Ohio but we are in Florida for the winter. When you went on the HT were the side effects immediate or were the progressive the longer you were on the HT. Were you on Lupron. I got the shot on 1/23/2015 and have had no side effects that I can recall. From what the medical people told me I expected more side effects. Do get me wrong. If this is as bad as it gets I'm ok with that. I assume you were asking me. I took the 6 month Eligard shot which might be a litle different. at first not really feeling anything but feeling out of sorts. then the hot flashes started, ankles starting swelling, breasts were tender and the twins starting shrinking along with itching down there. a general weakness took over, I walk 4-5 miles 5 days a week and lift weights at fitness center 3-4 times a week. I switched Urologists and he has recommended the monthly HT over the 3 or 6 month shots.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind What exactly do you hope to gain by the TRT? Many men think it's some sort of magical fountain of youth but it seldom meets that expectation..If your cancer has been CURED, it's no problem..But if it's just in remission, you will find that out soon enough, with or without the TRT.....Just my opinion... before finding out I had prostate cancer I was on TT for a 1.5 years, getting tested every 3 months. Evidently my doctor was not testing my blood for psa only testosterone. During the time I was taking the replacement for the first 7-8 months every 4 weeks switched to every 2 weeks. I had been working out 4-5 times a week until the biweekly shots saw very little change but suddenly dropped 25 lbs. and starting putting on muscle mass. Went from 218 to 192 over next 3-4 months of 2 week therapy. Knew I was getting much stronger because I could hardly bend to take a piss in the morning and now could bend it easily. LOL. Seriously, not having any ed issues before it seemed to be harder than before. Lost my belly fat which had always been the hardest place to lose while on TT. Now I am back to 208 and tried watching what I eat and don't have the energy to work out at the fitness center 2-3 times a week. When I was on the TT therapy after working out at night laying in bed my whole tingled and felt so good. Always very active and my job was very physical working sometimes 12-16 hours a day in the outside year round. Started the TT a year after retiring and was fountain of youth for me. I tried to get my medical records from my primary care doctor after I stopped the replacement therapy but never received them. Stonewalled at every avenue short of getting a lawyer, even my Uro asked for them and no go. A friends brother had PC and doctor let him start back after 5 years of clear margins. After HT, I know how bad it is not to have any T, would like to get back to having some more energy again. From what I have read their are 2 schools of thought on testosterone and pc. Most studies are from 1960s. Haven't decided yet whether I will start back on TT, just looking at some of the newer studies. Wondering if anybody on here started TT.",

I had a rising PSA after surgery, about 6 weeks after the shot started the SRT. 39 treatments, hitting with both guns. at 5 months and 2 weeks my T was .03 my Urologist wants me to stay on the HT for 3 years, the side effects are no fun. went to another Urologist for a second opinion about staying on the HT. told him I wanted to do a 3 month holiday and see if SRT worked, just got tested Tuesday, waiting to get results. Dr. Pat Walsh says sometimes later than sooner on the HT. some of the new data states 18 months is about as long as you should stay on it. HT is not a cure from what I read, it just suppresses it and after awhile the cancer figures out away around it. my PSA as been as low as 0.02 and the Doctor wants me to stay on it. depending on the results from this past Tuesday will depend if start my AS. just as I was getting my mojo back the HT killed it, Little Elvis has left the building. the twins have started turning to mush, tender breasts, weight gain and the hot flashes not to mention loss of energy. your situation is different than mine so this is my take on HT. you need to get the latest edition of Pat Walsh book on PC.

      "Content": "I am 65 and had no symptons of PC. discovered my high PSA, 10.6 on my physical. no urinary, ed or pain problems. after RP i felt like i had prostate problems because of having to get up at night to empty. really had no incontinence, a little dribble when i did my kegels. after about 2 months my ed was starting to go away but not yet firm enough for sex. getting better in that department week by week but PSA was also rising. Doctor started me on HT and that killed any thought of improving and the side effects are bad. then they added 8 weeks of salvage radiation, another set back. still trying to get my PSA to 0.00 undectable but keeping me on HT for now starting my 7th month. the surgery itself was a very easy on me, only took 1 pain pill when i got home. it was more just to sleep because of master strapped to my leg. radiation therapy caused little side effects and only lasted a couple of days. went in for surgery in the morning and went home late the next afternoon. the only pain was from the gas they bloat you up with when i would first sat up in bed. the gas migrates up in your shoulders, at least in me. I was up and walking with my master the same day of surgery. something i tried to get my doctor to do was give me the daily Cialis for 30 days prior to surgery and after to help with blood flow for healing purposes. seems that some members on here have done this, makes sense to me.",

Today after traveling in my truck about to bust a gut, finally got to my destination headed to the restroom, every step I released quite a bit of urine. Needless to say I was embarrassed and very noticeable in my shorts. From day 1 after cath removed had dry nights, urge would wake me up, only had minimal leakage during the day for a couple of weeks. Now this has started up worse than the beginning of my journey another problem has sprung up. When I take a Viagra and start getting aroused I start squirting urine also. To say this kills the mood is under statement, still do the Keges when I think about, not just every day. Started back doing them every day, maybe this is for life now. Even after emptying my bladder if my wife tugs on it, it is like she is milking a cow. I don't drink coffee and limit myself to 1 12 ounce soda a day usually at lunch. Almond milk in the morning or regular 2% and water at dinner or occasionally tea. Cut out drinking beer mainly because I started back in end of April riding a motorcycle. See my Urologist this coming Tuesday for my 3 month psa check up. I just don't understand what caused this to startup, could it have to do with nerve sparring.

Doctor more or less said my body was confused from the hormone therapy taking my testosterone to zero. I opted out 6 months after finishing my SRT. could not take the side effects of HT, also think it had something to do with heart problems which I never had had. for me opting out of HT for 2 years has been the right choice, <0.05 for the last 2 years. still have side effects from low T. thinking of starting testosterone replacement therapy, Urologist said I could start but would need to come in for PSA testing every 6 weeks to be checked.",

I guess i have to wait to the middle of november when i go back to my Urologist to find out the salvage radiation worked. thinking of discontinuing the HT, not so sure if it is worth it from reading numerous studies.",

I know he knows more than me but their is a chance the SRT will clean up anything left. from what I have read they likw to wait a full year before SRT or at least wait to see the PSA doubling time. there alot more on hear that have more knowledge than me that will chime in. I was given a 50/50 chance of beating this, at the least keeping it under control for a long time. your post PSA will tell a lot, I had a steady rise from 0.06 to 0.11 in 4 months time. started my HT at the end of the 4th month and took about 2 months to meet with Radiology Oncologist to schedule my SRT. your husbands age and PSA before surgery will help plus what type surgery? hope for the best",

Seems strange before HT never had heart problems, my daughter has worked at a heart clinic for 12 years and has kept me up on my checkups. Back in middle of June had 3 stents after having a tightness in my chest, Urologist said was probably just fatigue from HT. Heart problems could be attributed to the HT along with painful breasts which I had while on it. To me the risks and quality of life on HT out weigh the benefits. I opted out of HT after 3 months past my SRT was completed, took 6 months for my side affects to subside. My Oncologist wanted me stay on HT for 3 years as my Urologist did also. The lump probably isn't cancerous but hope it is just a gland. My testosterone is slowing coming back, only 269 up from 3 months ago of 246.",

      "Content": "I had a rising PSA after DaVinci surgery, 4 months later put on 6 month injection of Eligard. 6 weeks later started SRT, 39 treatments. I strongly recommend not taking the 6 month injection, monthly or 3 month at the most would be better. It took me 6 months after opting out of the HT to start feeling half way better. So far after SRT and opting out of HT my PSA has been <0.05. My question while doing both at the same time was how do I know if the radiation cleaned up what was left. The Eligard took my PSA from 0.11 to 0.05 in 6 weeks and during the SRT as low as 0.02. When it came time for the next 6 month shot I opted out and changed Urologist. The lab my new doctor uses only reads to 0.05 my PSA has been <0.05 for the last 8 months. Dr. Pat Walsh in his books thinks later than sooner when it comes to HT. I don't think Doctors realize how hard HT is on us, I know some tolerate better than others. 9 months after my initial injection, 3 months after opting out my testosterone was still castration level. Now my T is slowly coming back but only 249 now. Besides little Elvis has left the building, hot flashes, increased belly fat, the twins turn to mush and low energy to name a few. With me thinning of body hair, I know the radiation burned the hair on my lower belly but under arm hair all but gone. Where I had hairy legs it is still there just thinner and shorter. I work out at least 3-4 days a week with weights and walk 4-5 miles 5-6 days a week. Every time I work out no matter how hard I try I have hit a wall or regress, that is what no T does for you. Every time I go to the fitness center before PC and after I log my workouts for reps, sets and weights. Most people on here will recommend both HT and SRT combined but from reading some other just do the SRT.",

I also believe, now this just me, someone with already low testostrone may not notice is as much as a person with higher T. could be wrong, may just be the other way. if and when I have to back on HT, my new Urologist suggest that we try Firmagon. I know nothing about this drug, he tried to explain it but didn't understand the difference. need to read up on this drug, it is given monthly, I have been off HT since the middle of December when I was due for another dose. still having hot flashes, night sweats and loss of libido.",

Doc only started me because of how I healed and was not incontinent. my ED was about there after 4 months but a month later was given HT. Little Elvis has left the building for sure with after HT and SRT have not seen any lift off. ED pills do not work for me at least not yet, only came off the HT 3 months ago but my Testostrone is still less than 3. my PSA was <.05 on 12-1-2014 and <.05 on 3-3-2015. radiation was not bad at all, some serious manscaping took place between my navel and L E. like everyone else can not understand why you don't have your results yet.",

      "Content": "I for one could hardly tolerate the HT, only had the 6 month shot of Eligard. may have tolerated if I recieved the monthly or 3 month shot. right now have been off of HT for 3 months and still feel bad. it affected my thought process along with the fatigue, breast swelling, loss of body hair and libido. I had SRT right in the middle of HT. alot of new data says 18 months is long enough. after awhile the cancer finds a way around it, some suggest 6 months on and 6 months off. I made the decision to stop my HT to see if the SRT worked, otherwise how can you tell if the HT is suppressing the cancer or did the radiation work. was fine with HT in the beginning it brought my PSA down from 0.11 to 0.05 in a months time. urologist and I are keeping and eye on my PSA which is <.05 as low as the lab reads. not sure how Lupron compares to Eligard but it brought my testostrone down to .03 and still down 3 months. say goodbye to the twins, they turn to almost mush, at least mine did. I see a stranger when I get out of the shower and then get depressed. hope you are able to tolerate better than me, always been very active and now have to make myself leave the house. I quess it is better than the alternative. good luck",
