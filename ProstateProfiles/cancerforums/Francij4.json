      "Content": "Hi first post so some history: PSA monitored since age 40 due to fathers death from PC 4 years ago PSA had crept to 3.2 (aged 51) DRE by GP was normal retested 12 months later and psa was 3.8 GP advised me wait 6 months. 6 months later PSA was 4.2. Against his advice I insisted on seeing a urologist, the urologist sent me for an MRI which showed an area of interest. a subsequent biopsy tested postive for PC all grade 6. I was offered 3 options: monitor, operation or radio therapy. I chose the Davinci option and had it removed 20 months ago. Post op was a nightmare as I developed septicaemia and very nearly \"croaked\" 3 weeks in hospital with infection in places you don't want it was a nightmare. It turned out the surgeon (well respected 350+ proceedures) had had great difficulty re attaching to my bladder which he belived was the cause of the infection. Once that was out of the way everything else went swimmingly, continence returned despite the catheter being in for 1 month longer than intended. EF has taken 18 months to get close to being sorted (didn't help my wife of 34 years leaving 6 months after my op) I add this as somethings you just don't see coming! probably a non \"PC\" PC joke in there somewhere! PSA nadir was 0.008 6 months post op and the pathology was upgraded to T3A from T2C but all still grade 6 with my urologist saying it was only \"technically\" a T3 as the cancer had \"just touched\" the edge?? Now the bad news, PSA at 12 months post op 0.014, 15 months 0.015, 16 months (different lab) 0.020, finally my present value 20 months out is 0.024. Urologist recommended I see an oncologist for a second opinion (happening on thursday) What do you folks think ? I am now 56 in a new relationship but starting to think I am not going to beat this thing and should just bury my head in the sand and concentrate on enjoying myself???",

Urologist and second opinions from 2 oncologists and they all say the same no further treatment and some men seem to have a residual PSA regardless of outcome, interestingly one of them associated it with fully functioning erection? ???
