    "Content": "Please look into the johnson and johnson my brother has been on Zytiga for 6 weeks now and we qualified for the free Zytiga from them. What a blessing so far. His PSA was over 200 and after 30 days on it was down to 62. The paperwork was very easy to fill out and I had the social worker from his doctor check it over and she faxed it to him. Please ask your doctor if they have a social worker that can help you do the paperwork.",
