    "Content": "Hi guys. I don't have prostate cancer but a family member of mine has. He has been free of cancer for 3 years now which is such a relief and joy, however his sleeping patterns are not healthy. He has to get up every 2 hours due to going to the bathroom. I don't think his had a good nights sleep in years and I was wondering is there anything I can do to help him get more hours in. If anyone is wondering, he does not have the bag. This probably is a long shot and I don't have to much information about it. Thanks..",
