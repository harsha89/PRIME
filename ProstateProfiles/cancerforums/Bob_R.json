Do you mean if it has metastatiszed or what? Yes it can be a minefield and not everything you read means it will happen to you. Given your stats ( and you don't have any yet ) you may have a number of options in regard to treatment, Radiation, surgery, seeds they all have their pros and cons. As a rule of thumb the earlier PC is caught the more choice you have.. which in a way is a curse as you have to make the choice and generally none of us are medical practitioners to know what is best. If it has metastasized, which just by your comments is unlikely, it will reduce or change the treatment. My guess is that this is something which should be put aside for now as a conversation untill your results are in. The comments above about your PSA level ring true, but it is a little alarming that they have spiked, mine went from 2.5 year on year to 4.2 and I was diagnosed post biopsy. However I went on 2 rounds of anti biotics to rule out infection over a 3 month period. This is potentailly where you should be now.. ruling out the irregularity",

      "Content": "Welcome Tamborine, Quite a number of questions in there, I have to guess you are early into the learning curve. The Biopsy is probably the best way of advancing the answers to your questions, given your PSA is elevated this is a flag to say something is not right and needs further investigation. The Biopsy is not perfect however they have improved its application and it has a pretty good hit rate. In my case it painted a very positive picture however post op pathology showed is was much worse. For a PC to metastasize that quickly post biopsy means it was well underway already, they will get you scanned if the biopsy comes back positive anyway. As for your key question why not?, it generally is not a case of why not, more a case of what are my options, what are the impacts/ side effects and have I done all I can to assure myself that what I am being told is accurate.",

Sorry to hear the news, I guess you have been in the washing machine mentally given how quick this has come about. I can't offer you feedback on radiation but really I suggest you try and rest. Others will give you feedback but please don't stress this early after surgery.",

The Biopsy is probably the best way of advancing the answers to your questions, given your PSA is elevated this is a flag to say something is not right and needs further investigation. The Biopsy is not perfect however they have improved its application and it has a pretty good hit rate. In my case it painted a very positive picture however post op pathology showed is was much worse. For a PC to metastasize that quickly post biopsy means it was well underway already, they will get you scanned if the biopsy comes back positive anyway. As for your key question why not?, it generally is not a case of why not, more a case of what are my options, what are the impacts/ side effects and have I done all I can to assure myself that what I am being told is accurate.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Tamborine Yeah, I just started reading on all of this. Are you saying that a prostatectomy may not be an option in some cases? Do you mean if it has metastatiszed or what? Yes it can be a minefield and not everything you read means it will happen to you. Given your stats ( and you don't have any yet ) you may have a number of options in regard to treatment, Radiation, surgery, seeds they all have their pros and cons. As a rule of thumb the earlier PC is caught the more choice you have.. which in a way is a curse as you have to make the choice and generally none of us are medical practitioners to know what is best. If it has metastasized, which just by your comments is unlikely, it will reduce or change the treatment. My guess is that this is something which should be put aside for now as a conversation untill your results are in. The comments above about your PSA level ring true, but it is a little alarming that they have spiked, mine went from 2.5 year on year to 4.2 and I was diagnosed post biopsy. However I went on 2 rounds of anti biotics to rule out infection over a 3 month period. This is potentailly where you should be now.. ruling out the irregularity",

Do you mean if it has metastatiszed or what? Yes it can be a minefield and not everything you read means it will happen to you. Given your stats ( and you don't have any yet ) you may have a number of options in regard to treatment, Radiation, surgery, seeds they all have their pros and cons. As a rule of thumb the earlier PC is caught the more choice you have.. which in a way is a curse as you have to make the choice and generally none of us are medical practitioners to know what is best. If it has metastasized, which just by your comments is unlikely, it will reduce or change the treatment. My guess is that this is something which should be put aside for now as a conversation untill your results are in. The comments above about your PSA level ring true, but it is a little alarming that they have spiked, mine went from 2.5 year on year to 4.2 and I was diagnosed post biopsy. However I went on 2 rounds of anti biotics to rule out infection over a 3 month period. This is potentailly where you should be now.. ruling out the irregularity",

Think of it like sleeping on your arm and waking up to find it is all floppy and useless, blood starts to flow back in and the nerves recover from the shock and after a while it rights itself . Same thing except there has been trauma to the area and takes longer to recover. The key however is to keep good blood running through the area or scar tissue builds up and inhibits the recovery. The tablets are there for that purpose, originally Viagra was developed for heart condition patients to perform the same function on the heart muscle, generally blokes with heart conditions have ED and after taking viagra for their hearts their erections returned Nice side effect",

The purpose of Cialis,Viagra and Levitra is to keep blood flow going into the penis so the tissue does not atrophy and die wihile waiting for the nerves to heal. That therapeutic dose for blood flow is low and shouldn't have side effects. Hubby takes 2.5mgs every night. Night time is best so it's strength is strongest and simulates nighttime erections. Yep thats exactly how I understand it.. I am on 5mg a day of cialis and 100 mg viagra once a week",

This gave the Dr a reason to perform a DRE but there was nothing. Only when it jumped to 4.2 did alarm bells start ringing and I had the full biopsy and subsequent diagnosis. Given the location of the prostate it is entirely possible that all those other health issues are causing some of the symptoms you talk about. Personally I would rule them all out first before chasing the cancer route, and even in the worse case it is then be assured you have probably found it so early it is curable.",

My wife wanted to stay but I already set it up so my friends would ring her after 2 hours and send her home. We are only 10 minutes from the hospital, just get the hospital to ring you when he gets out of surgery and you can make your way down.

The coffee is a stumlant and will irritate the bladder causing control issues, beer is the reverse it is a relaxant and diaretic so it relaxes the bladder and the pelvic floor muscles causing high levels of leakage. I am down to 1 pad a day and it generally is in use from 4- 9 when I am tired. I agree it sounds like you hubby has more emotional and mental challenges, I stopped beer and coffee for nearly 2 months and then when reintroduced at very low quantities Have you taken him back to the doc as I think there are other options available but at 3 months there is still the expectations that there will be issues. I might suggest that you contact a depression management service because until there is motivation to help one self the physical aspects will continue to persist",

But also recommended a range of foods that assist in good nutrition as well as processing.. I was confused about bowel movements post op as you generally \"cleared out\" prior, I was passing wind within a day and if you have a soft diet and clean foods all goes well.. Never increased fibre at all",

      "Content": "Very sorry you are here and such a sad tale, the coffee and beer are probably the 2 worst contributors to leakage. The coffee is a stumlant and will irritate the bladder causing control issues, beer is the reverse it is a relaxant and diaretic so it relaxes the bladder and the pelvic floor muscles causing high levels of leakage. I am down to 1 pad a day and it generally is in use from 4- 9 when I am tired. I agree it sounds like you hubby has more emotional and mental challenges, I stopped beer and coffee for nearly 2 months and then when reintroduced at very low quantities Have you taken him back to the doc as I think there are other options available but at 3 months there is still the expectations that there will be issues. I might suggest that you contact a depression management service because until there is motivation to help one self the physical aspects will continue to persist",

My wife wanted to stay but I already set it up so my friends would ring her after 2 hours and send her home. We are only 10 minutes from the hospital, just get the hospital to ring you when he gets out of surgery and you can make your way down. Chances are he is not going to be in any condition to see you even when he wakes up anyway.",

      "Content": "Powderfinger, Sorry I forgot to say that I am now 8 days post surgery. Brachy is still the second most applied therapy, I was offered cryo but this is still considered experimental and I am just too young in the scheme of things to be part of the experiment. Don't apologise for the way you feel, I recollect that my first reaction was \"you are kidding right?, i am at my prime, spent all this time mastering the technique and you are suggesting I should pay someone to take it away \" ... but over the coming weeks you thinking is going to change as you realise that you have cancer , the big C and possibly the sneakiest of the lot. It is very slow growing and doesn't affect how you feel yet it can affect so much. The next mental step is you may have incontinence, now this is a major inconvenience, not sure what work you do but if you are a bus driver or long haul truck drive you are not going to like this at all.. The radio therapist I went to see suggested that he treated Football Coaches cause they didn't want to be packing down with a team of 20 year olds and leaking.. Once you start appreciating that in the scheme of things your ability to enjoy sex is the lowest of the priorities you can understand why the list that highlander put forward is the way the Doctors approach it. Anyway you are very early in the journey and we all have been there and it makes you feel like crap, however you do adjust your thinking though it never lessens the concern you have for retention of your favourite activity. Get past the first 2 and then realise that there are options to treat that and even those with little to work with still manage to make the most of it. As I started out saying, I have just had surgery and it appears by the reports I will eventually regain most of my pre operative function, however right now I got nuthin and I am a leaky boat. Coming from a fit and active perspective and enjoying 3 times a week the affections of my better half this is tough going. But regardless I don't have cancer anymore, and as my Surgeon says.. \" you will live to see your grand children grow up\"",

In the end the Radio therapist says \"at your age i would recommend the surgery as the history for radio therapy is not as long as surgery and you need more years\" His cut off was 50 for performing the procedure and I was just too young in his books.' Now the side effects from brachy initially are much lower and invasive than surgery and you get to retain most of your function, what you need to be understanding is that longer term you have a higher potential for your continence and erectile function to be impacted given that the radioactivity first kills the disease then starts a slow demise of your prostate then potentially surrounding soft tissue. The gamble is your age and whatever might get you in the end is ahead of all that. Now having been graphical about all this it is just what the specialists explained to me, I am no Dr just a patient. Given what I was told the brachy seems to have some merit given your age and the stats that you have listed in your sig. I would suggest you keep exploring the options till you are sure about the proposed approach. The key right now is to come to terms and become at peace with your decision rather than the end game which we all go to straight away. Keep talking, it helps a lot, most on here have difficult stories but want to share and assist. You are in the right place, keep reading but kep in mind everyone is different and there is only one wrong answer ... Do nothing",

      "Content": "Powderfinger, Sorry I forgot to say that I am now 8 days post surgery. Brachy is still the second most applied therapy, I was offered cryo but this is still considered experimental and I am just too young in the scheme of things to be part of the experiment. Don't apologise for the way you feel, I recollect that my first reaction was \"you are kidding right?, i am at my prime, spent all this time mastering the technique and you are suggesting I should pay someone to take it away \" ... but over the coming weeks you thinking is going to change as you realise that you have cancer , the big C and possibly the sneakiest of the lot. It is very slow growing and doesn't affect how you feel yet it can affect so much. The next mental step is you may have incontinence, now this is a major inconvenience, not sure what work you do but if you are a bus driver or long haul truck drive you are not going to like this at all.. The radio therapist I went to see suggested that he treated Football Coaches cause they didn't want to be packing down with a team of 20 year olds and leaking.. Once you start appreciating that in the scheme of things your ability to enjoy sex is the lowest of the priorities you can understand why the list that highlander put forward is the way the Doctors approach it. Anyway you are very early in the journey and we all have been there and it makes you feel like crap, however you do adjust your thinking though it never lessens the concern you have for retention of your favourite activity. Get past the first 2 and then realise that there are options to treat that and even those with little to work with still manage to make the most of it. As I started out saying, I have just had surgery and it appears by the reports I will eventually regain most of my pre operative function, however right now I got nuthin and I am a leaky boat. Coming from a fit and active perspective and enjoying 3 times a week the affections of my better half this is tough going. But regardless I don't have cancer anymore, and as my Surgeon says.. \" you will live to see your grand children grow up\"",

But, that's just me. I'll trade quality now, for wheel-chair time later. they can prop up a picture of me at that time. Walt (EDIT: my youngest is 13 as well. I am 51. FYI). I just turned 47 so close on your coat tails.. I reckon old age is a bitch to start with so to compound it with cancer was not appealing. Anyway we will see how it fairs in 18 months when I am closer to the prescribed recovery time, I also might add the missus is keen to get things back so puts a lot more effort in",

      "Content": "Hey gang, Having now reached 7 weeks since surgery I was expecting to be cartwheeling about the place with only the side effects of ED and continence to concern myself with. However I am struggling to get back into my work regime, being an office worker and reading about many here in construction I am thinking I am softer than I thought. I eased myself back into work 3 weeks ago, firstly with a couple of half days then 4 half days last week and then this week I figured time to go the full hog. I made it to Wednesday this week doing full days and crashed and burned on Thursday at midday and was a wreck yesterday. Today I am starting to feel normal again.. What should the expectation about recovery to normal operating levels be, am I over doing it? Just to give a clear picture, I am up at 5 - 5:30 each day, I trave an hour or so by car and train to the city each day, normally it is a 10 hour day but I have been keeping that to 8 hours and then return trip. Figured I should be shooting the lights out by now.. what have others experienced in this regard",

This as most will already know be a bit of a shock with no history in the family and in excellent health. The initial flag went up after a routine health check the company has in place and my PSA score jumped from a consistent 2.5 over some years to 4. I subsequently had the usual anti biotics and 6 weeks later retested with a drop to 3.8. The Doctor suggested a Biopsy but also the Urine test which came back inconclusive so had to undertake the Biopsy.. seems I have a Gleason score of 7 which says I have Cancer. Yesterday went for all the scans which will go back to the Doc and I guess the options will be narrow.. Hope to learn a bit more on this forum and with any luck not feel as worried as I currently do..",

      "Content": "Many thanks guys, it is very early and I am still in shock to be honest, probably still going through the grief cycle. You are right the stress and anxiety about what decision to make. I am reading anything and everything to get some dimension. The surgeon seems to be dead keen on surgery and my initial thought are this is the way to go, untill I read about the side effects which are terifying to be frank. Given I am an active and fit middle aged man with a very active sex life I am trying to appreciate just how much of a lifestyle change this will mean. Will get my hands on the book you have suggested and take all the advice. If nothing else I will get my hands on all my results, talk to folk and not rush if it isnt required. I think it is very early as my DRE provided no result and prior to the biopsy both the DR and Surgeon just thought I had elevated readings and the biopsy would verify... Appreciate the response and feel I have crossed a line somewhere because everything appears a little bit different",

But, that's just me. I'll trade quality now, for wheel-chair time later. they can prop up a picture of me at that time. Walt (EDIT: my youngest is 13 as well. I am 51. FYI). I just turned 47 so close on your coat tails.. I reckon old age is a bitch to start with so to compound it with cancer was not appealing. Anyway we will see how it fairs in 18 months when I am closer to the prescribed recovery time, I also might add the missus is keen to get things back so puts a lot more effort in",

      "Content": "gsteve A constant concern for me also, I posted a link to a very good lecture on rehabilitation in the ED thread. I am just hitting the 3 month mark and having some progress with cialis and viagra but not \"stuffable\" for any length of time as such. My result is heartening at the 3 month mark and I dont expect much as I do think it is going to be a 12-18 month journey to really get a handle on what to expect. My partner is very helpful in the rehabilitation so it takes some of the mntal challenge out of it which interesting enough can affect it dramatically. As the lecture outlines that adrenalin can restrict the ability to have a decent erection and this can be brought on by anxiety. I am seeing how the next few weeks go as improvements are rewarding with the tablets but I might go the injection route on my return as I have my 3 month blood test checkup",

This as most will already know be a bit of a shock with no history in the family and in excellent health. The initial flag went up after a routine health check the company has in place and my PSA score jumped from a consistent 2.5 over some years to 4. I subsequently had the usual anti biotics and 6 weeks later retested with a drop to 3.8. The Doctor suggested a Biopsy but also the Urine test which came back inconclusive so had to undertake the Biopsy.. seems I have a Gleason score of 7 which says I have Cancer. Yesterday went for all the scans which will go back to the Doc and I guess the options will be narrow..

      "Content": "Greetings, My name is Bob and I am 46 and 2 days ago was told that I have prostate Cancer. This as most will already know be a bit of a shock with no history in the family and in excellent health. The initial flag went up after a routine health check the company has in place and my PSA score jumped from a consistent 2.5 over some years to 4. I subsequently had the usual anti biotics and 6 weeks later retested with a drop to 3.8. The Doctor suggested a Biopsy but also the Urine test which came back inconclusive so had to undertake the Biopsy.. seems I have a Gleason score of 7 which says I have Cancer. Yesterday went for all the scans which will go back to the Doc and I guess the options will be narrow.. Hope to learn a bit more on this forum and with any luck not feel as worried as I currently do..",

I used the time to chat about the journey we had gone, he was begrudging complimentary of my challenging the diagnosis, how informed I was.. I got the feeling he was used to blokes walking through the door and just agreeing to treatment. He made some interesting comments about the growth in this industry as it is big business and many surgeons are rushing to get into it and making claims of prowess. I asked how many he had done to be considered one of the top surgeons in the country, his replied 200, to which I asked why in the states if they are in the thousands how does this compare? He indicated he was watching a lot of surgeons coming through making claims of hundreds of these operations but not end to end but various stages of the procedure yet racking this up to a full operation. Also no one publishes their results in this country, there might be one or 2, and the results are largely not scientific as there is no standard of measurement for continence or erectile function.. controversial yes but probably a lot in that to consider when making statements about surgeon selection. Anyway I am pleased with progress and his belief that within the year I should be close to pre op condition. I expected him to ask to see me every 3 months but he said nope, come find him if I have an issue otherwise undertake 6 month PSA test with my GP..",

I would wear the cost over the risk. yes you can eat before or after taking it, just have to understand that it is digested through the stomach and a meal will slow this process down. I take it an hour before I eat, I then have a light dinner fish is good. Then go watch TV for an hour by this time everything has a blue tinge to it so I know it is in my system so ready to go.

If your doctor is suggesting AS then it is a case of seeing i there is any aggressiveness or if indeed it just keeps at a rate that can be accommodated throughout your life. Given the results if it does move past an acceptable level for AS then you have a number of options open to you which you should investigate, surgery, seeding being the most popular. You should read up on both and weigh it against your lifestyle and suitability. But I would not stress and overthink it just now as there seems no real need to react.",

Given your age ( my age) I came to the conclusion after spending large wads of cash and touring to see all the specialists that really surgery is the best option for long term survival. Once you come to terms with the fact that you need to treat the cancer for life preservation the side effects become a secondary consideration important as they are. Just on the question of sex, it is different and if you are in a relationship the beginning of a new experience andyou will find from many posters here it isn't all bad you just have to be less conventional and more innovative. I have had all the nerve sparing done and given my age the expectation is I will return to my former self in time ( though at this stage it is hard to believe). Having said that the experience of orgasm is more extreme, sure like everyone else I am dry but that seems to be a plus for my other half and has made her more adventurous. Anyway I do know this is the time when it seems most frightening and you have to go on the accelerated leaning process which is overwhelming. It is tough so don't be hard on yourself regardless of the expectations you or others might have, I thought I was a corporate warrior and it knocked my confidence about a fair bit and still working it through.

Given it is so early it is hard to comment where you sit in the scheme of things, although 77 is a high PSA for your age. What did the DRE reveal? The Dr has done the right thing in putting you on anti biotics to eliminate a false reading because of infection but the PSA is so high I think that even if it does bring it down you definitely need to move quickly through the steps for diagnosis. If the biopsy comes back positive then depending on the staging it will open up what your options are. At this stage there is just not enough info to comment with any confidence or provide insight. Reading all the possibilities will make you fret and the wait is going to be a while given the time it takes to get all the results. Very sorry to hear of your situation",

      "Content": "Hey George, Welcome and sorry, you are in the right place and all here understand the fear and sadness which accompanies this news. I turned 47 last weekend and am 7 weeks post op after being diagnosed in August. I remember clear as day the journey and the denial followed by all the other emotions that go along with the grieving process. The reading will do your head in and because everyone is different it is hard to get a clear picture of what it means for you. The journey is not a fun one however I still believe the hardest part is trying to understand what the best treatment is for you. Given your age ( my age) I came to the conclusion after spending large wads of cash and touring to see all the specialists that really surgery is the best option for long term survival. Once you come to terms with the fact that you need to treat the cancer for life preservation the side effects become a secondary consideration important as they are. Just on the question of sex, it is different and if you are in a relationship the beginning of a new experience andyou will find from many posters here it isn't all bad you just have to be less conventional and more innovative. I have had all the nerve sparing done and given my age the expectation is I will return to my former self in time ( though at this stage it is hard to believe). Having said that the experience of orgasm is more extreme, sure like everyone else I am dry but that seems to be a plus for my other half and has made her more adventurous. Anyway I do know this is the time when it seems most frightening and you have to go on the accelerated leaning process which is overwhelming. It is tough so don't be hard on yourself regardless of the expectations you or others might have, I thought I was a corporate warrior and it knocked my confidence about a fair bit and still working it through. Keep talking and asking questions, there is a sea of knowledge and experience here to help you through.",

      "Content": "Stuart, I think you are on to something with muscle memory, I am convinced that pre training has helped with my post op recovery. The challenge I have found is the amount of conflicting information which only with time has helped, this is the recording of pad use, step count and volume for bladder training. I find if I try to get my physical level up via increased step count I then suffer increased bad use and lower volume and bladder training benefit. As said it is now 4 weeks and tracking all these religiously to now get the balance. To be fair I feel there is benefit in all the training but not convinced that it accelerates the return to continence as I know folk who under took no training at all and returned within 3 weeks to continence an no issue since. I suspect I will have this issue for some time yet although I am 46, fit and had all the required training and applied it daily. Would be keen to understand more of the technical thinking behind the training.",

I dont feel any infections and urinary tract infections, etc. ... 2 years ago i was diagnosed with azoospermia and Following this I did US Transrktali with no speacial findings. There is a sharp rise in the PSA values\u200b\u200b, which could be the reason? Is there anything to fear from? Thanks for the reply. Hey Bon, Sorry to see your stats and at such a young age.. it is fair to say that 2.5 at 33 is high even before getting to the 4.25. I was running at 2.5 for a number of years and then it jumped to 4.25. I went into denial because I was 45 and it seemed to be unlikely.. spent 6 months dodging the inevitable, I reckon you should go get a biopsy and rule it in or out asap.",

      "Content": "Hey Bob, welcome and wish you were not here with the rest of us. I am no expert just an experienced traveler so I will leave some of the techie answers to them, however they will ask for some more info such as your age, T level and Biopsy result. Options will be numerous given such a low score however you should look at those that you feel most comfortable with. My humble advice is to ask lots and lots of questions and read as much as you can. The initial awareness of what you should expect depending on your chosen option is going to be confronting and potentially worrisome. This is the best place to get an appreciation of where the road leads. Seems like they have found it early so prognosis is good but this depends on the other data your provide. Good to see another Bob here",

      "Content": "Hey George, Welcome and sorry, you are in the right place and all here understand the fear and sadness which accompanies this news. I turned 47 last weekend and am 7 weeks post op after being diagnosed in August. I remember clear as day the journey and the denial followed by all the other emotions that go along with the grieving process. The reading will do your head in and because everyone is different it is hard to get a clear picture of what it means for you. The journey is not a fun one however I still believe the hardest part is trying to understand what the best treatment is for you. Given your age ( my age) I came to the conclusion after spending large wads of cash and touring to see all the specialists that really surgery is the best option for long term survival. Once you come to terms with the fact that you need to treat the cancer for life preservation the side effects become a secondary consideration important as they are. Just on the question of sex, it is different and if you are in a relationship the beginning of a new experience andyou will find from many posters here it isn't all bad you just have to be less conventional and more innovative. I have had all the nerve sparing done and given my age the expectation is I will return to my former self in time ( though at this stage it is hard to believe). Having said that the experience of orgasm is more extreme, sure like everyone else I am dry but that seems to be a plus for my other half and has made her more adventurous. Anyway I do know this is the time when it seems most frightening and you have to go on the accelerated leaning process which is overwhelming. It is tough so don't be hard on yourself regardless of the expectations you or others might have, I thought I was a corporate warrior and it knocked my confidence about a fair bit and still working it through. Keep talking and asking questions, there is a sea of knowledge and experience here to help you through.",

It is tough so don't be hard on yourself regardless of the expectations you or others might have, I thought I was a corporate warrior and it knocked my confidence about a fair bit and still working it through.

      "Content": "Stuart, I think you are on to something with muscle memory, I am convinced that pre training has helped with my post op recovery. The challenge I have found is the amount of conflicting information which only with time has helped, this is the recording of pad use, step count and volume for bladder training. I find if I try to get my physical level up via increased step count I then suffer increased bad use and lower volume and bladder training benefit. As said it is now 4 weeks and tracking all these religiously to now get the balance. To be fair I feel there is benefit in all the training but not convinced that it accelerates the return to continence as I know folk who under took no training at all and returned within 3 weeks to continence an no issue since. I suspect I will have this issue for some time yet although I am 46, fit and had all the required training and applied it daily. Would be keen to understand more of the technical thinking behind the training.",

I learnt a long time ago to enjoy the journey not the destination which you seem to do with more flare and jazz hands than most. There are always worse cases than your own, I dont feel sorry for you because your circumstances appear more challenging than mine but I do respect your resolve as you do others happy venting Bob",

I would also recommend that there should be a nutritionist in the mix as well, I found that a walk through prior to surgery and a diet plan also immensely helpful....Good luck! Chuck I have read this issue seems to occur with women post Davinci Hysterectomy, they recommend you go back and see the doctor if it persists...At this point I am hating everything I am being told, so in a denial state I go and speak to other Urologists and Radio therapists, this is a good thing because it counter balances what you know and what you have been told. In the end the Radio therapist says \"at your age i would recommend the surgery as the history for radio therapy is not as long as surgery and you need more years\" His cut off was 50 for performing the procedure and I was just too young in his books.'...I went and saw a dietitian that was associated with the PT team at the hospital prior to surgery, she never promoted an increase in fibre just a balanced diet. But also recommended a range of foods that assist in good nutrition as well as processing.....In the end the Radio therapist says \"at your age i would recommend the surgery as the history for radio therapy is not as long as surgery and you need more years\" His cut off was 50 for performing the procedure and I was just too young in his books.' Now the side effects from brachy initially are much lower and invasive than surgery and you get to retain most of your function, what you need to be understanding is that longer term you have a higher potential for your continence and erectile function to be impacted given that the radioactivity first kills the disease then starts a slow demise of your prostate then potentially surrounding soft tissue....",
