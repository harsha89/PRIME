      "Content": "Hello everyone. my family doctor sent me to Dr. Korman because my PSA was high. He did the biopsy and it was positive. It is type T2a and here is summary of the biopsy report: \"Adenocarcinoma involving 6 cores of 12 with highest gleason grade 3+4=7 and maximum percentage cross sectional area involvement by tumor of 70% in the right mid. Gleason pattern 4 compromises 10% of the tumor in the left lateral mid. Perineural invasion (PNI) is identified in the left lateral mid\". Dr. Korman did not show much concern and said I have choice of radiation or robotic surgery to remove it. He gave me a name of a surgeon at Beaumont hospital Dr. SanjeevKumar Kaul. He said he is the best and a superstar in his profession and made an appointment to see Dr. Kaul next week. He also said that surgery cannot be done until six week from biopsy. After initial shock, I start reading about this and learned a few things such as have another pathologist look at my biopsy, having CT scan and MRI, good chance of surviving and etc. I really do not know much about what to do next beside seeing Dr. Kaul next week. I like to get some help from you about what I need to do and what questions I should ask. Thanks for your help.",

I do not really know what they mean.My main question is how to pick a surgeon, what questions should I ask him, is it really important who is the surgeon as long as he has done this operation many times?
