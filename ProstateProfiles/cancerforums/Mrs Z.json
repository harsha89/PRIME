We were told that it is \"VERY AGRESSIVE.\" During our last appointment I was trying to get a glimmer of hope from the doctor. Unfortunately that was not to be had. Husband has decided on radical prostatectomy with Dr. Han at Johns Hopkins. It has been scheduled for Sept 26th. Doctor says he will be there 1 or 2 nights. As a care-giver what can I expect? How many days should I take off from work? When he returns home, will he be able to climb the stairs to get to the bedroom? Will he need assistance when he returns from the hospital? Is there anything that I should buy now that will be needed for after his surgery? What don't I know that I should? Thanks, Mrs Z",
