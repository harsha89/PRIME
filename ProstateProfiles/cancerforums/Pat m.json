Re \"Appreciate any advice.\" We are not qualified to give medical advice but we will openly share out experiences with Prostate Cancer (PC) and offer suggestions and opinions. Re \"I asked about an MRI but it'll put treatment off for a couple of months.\" A couple of points: - Most MDs will not initiate treatment for about 7 weeks following biopsy to allow a very angry prostate gland to calm down. - Gleason (4+5) PC is very high risk - It appears that you and your MD have determined that surgery is the best treatment. Suggestions: - Do not put off treatment any longer than absolutely necessary - Immediately schedule an appointment(s) for 2nd Opinion(s) - Purchase a copy of one of the leading PC books like: Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Patrick Walsh, MD and read it! - You want to be treated by an expert MD who specializes in treating high risk PC (such an MD will be treating at least 3 - 5 new cases per week) - Keep a list of questions and write down the answers. - While there is a high likelihood (> 40%) that radiation may be needed after surgery. There is also the possibility that your PC is fully contained within the capsule of the prostate gland and surgery results in 100% cure. 2 Questions: 1. What City, State are you located?

      "Content": "Hi guys, I've been following this forum for a couple of weeks. I'm 52 and relatively fit, no health issues. At my yearly physical my psa went from 2 to 13. I had a biopsy 3 weeks ago showing 2out of 16 with a Gleason 4+5 =9 Bone and CT negative. My doctor is great but seems to think there'll be more treatment after surgery. I asked about an MRI but it'll put treatment off for a couple of months. Appreciate any advice. Pat",

Re \"Appreciate any advice.\" We are not qualified to give medical advice but we will openly share out experiences with Prostate Cancer (PC) and offer suggestions and opinions. Re \"I asked about an MRI but it'll put treatment off for a couple of months.\" A couple of points: - Most MDs will not initiate treatment for about 7 weeks following biopsy to allow a very angry prostate gland to calm down. - Gleason (4+5) PC is very high risk - It appears that you and your MD have determined that surgery is the best treatment. Suggestions: - Do not put off treatment any longer than absolutely necessary - Immediately schedule an appointment(s) for 2nd Opinion(s) - Purchase a copy of one of the leading PC books like: Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer by Patrick Walsh, MD and read it! - You want to be treated by an expert MD who specializes in treating high risk PC (such an MD will be treating at least 3 - 5 new cases per week) - Keep a list of questions and write down the answers. - While there is a high likelihood (> 40%) that radiation may be needed after surgery. There is also the possibility that your PC is fully contained within the capsule of the prostate gland and surgery results in 100% cure. 2 Questions: 1. What City, State are you located?
