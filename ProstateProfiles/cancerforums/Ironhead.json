      "Content": "This is my first post and as many, not one that I was expecting to write. I was diagnosed 5/25/17 and it has been a series of unfortunate events since. I made the decision to have surgery after meeting with a RO and talking to several different URO's plus many hours online researching. After having pre-Op 7 days out, my surgeon tore a bicep! So they came up with a replacement surgeon and it would only be pushed back a week. On hindsight maybe I should have waited the 2 months until he would be able to do surgery but I went with the replacement. During surgery a blood vessel was cut on my right side and post surgery had a huge hematoma, not sure how common this is, but I would think not very. So, after being released from hospital after a day and feeling pretty good after 3 days, the issues started. Started having pain in my right hip which moved to right abdomen (which I was attributing to the hematoma). Then it started on my left kidney area and was progressively getting worse. The Dr. Told me several things to do and some over the counter pills to take and along with pain pills the issue was tolerable. I had 2 days to go to get the damn catheter out and that was what I was focused on, but the night before my appt I had very little sleep and pain was becoming intolerable. Dr. told us to come in to office and after 5 mins with me said I needed to go back to hospital, which with the pain I was in I was more than happy to go. After 4 hrs of various tests and much pain it was discovered I had a leak from my repaired urethra and fluid pooling in my abdomen. So here I sit on the couch 14 days post-op with damn catheter still in and a JP drain hoping that it heals so I'm not back in surgery to repair, which will set me back another 10 days or so before catheter could come out. Sorry for the long post but hoping to give some help to anyone else that might have some of these issues in the future and to get some frustrations off my chest. Thanks, J / Ironhead",
