      "Content": "I am posting this hoping for some feedback. My uncle is in his mid-60\u2019s, diagnosed 3 years ago with prostate cancer \u2013 biopsy showed certain amount of spread in the gland. (Gleeson score was never given). He eats very healthy, he feels great, has lots of energy, works, exercises and has no physical symptoms whatsoever. He had quit smoking about 15 years ago, does not drink, nor take any medication. (He is under care of an oncologist for the last 3 years, along with a naturopathic doctor. The oncologist agreed to \u2018watchful waiting\u2019 method 3 years ago.) Save for some minor colds, he has been in great health for the last few years. His oncologist had talked about radiation treatment, steroid treatment and surgery. My uncle did not want any of these conventional treatments. Our concern is that his PSA level still kept rising slowly but steadily, but also started rising more rapidly as of recently. It is around 33 now, with the most recent jump of 7 points occurring over the last 2 months (in October it was 26, yesterday 33). We are concerned because of possible metastases. The oncologist, seeing the jump in PSA over the last several months, sent him for bone scan and CT scan. The results came this week, both negative. My uncle is now considering surgery, however, the oncologist is now saying that since PSA is high at 33 \u2013 surgery is not an option anymore, which he did not elaborate on. We don\u2019t understand this. Why is surgery contraindicated with high PSA? Again \u2013 there is no outside spread of tumor. The oncologist is now saying hormone therapy along with radiation therapy is the only option. He says both have practically no side effects and that my uncle\u2019s cancer is \u201ccurable\u201d \u2013 doctor\u2019s exact words. (I however did a bit of web search on hormone therapy side effects and there seem to be many debilitating ones so I find it peculiar that the oncologists states that the hormonal therapy side effects are \u201cminimal\u201d). I have read that PSA can rise to very high numbers and the person might not have prostate cancer at all, as the PSA rise can be caused by other reasons. We would certainly prefer that the reason for his growing PSA level is not the cancer. But it is hard to relax knowing that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer 3 years ago. Does the PSA rise inevitably point to spread and / or growth of cancer, or are there some other possible explanations? The oncologist himself hinted at other causes, but did not elaborate. If anyone has any similar experience or any guesses as to why the rise in PSA, and also why prostatectomy is contraindicated if PSA is \u2018high\u2019, I\u2019d much appreciate your experiences and opinions. Thanks. PS I think I should also add that the oncologist asked yesterday if my uncle had any symptoms of urinary tract infection, and he does have them indeed for the last 2 weeks. He was referred for urinalysis.",

      "Content": "Scratch: \u2013 my uncle inquired about an MRI scan with his oncologist about a month ago, at the previous appointment, but was told by the doctor that he (the doctor) would rather see the bone scan and CT pelvic area scan done, as they, in doctor\u2019s words, would cover more of an area that he needs to see, than MRI scan would. Now that both bone and CT scan are done and negative, I hope he might agree to send my uncle for an MRI scan (whether there is an option to choose between 3t machine and 2t machine, I don\u2019t know) .
