      "Content": "Hello, my name is Mike; just 70 y.o. History: Up till Oct 20014, and the last 15 years, I had been getting testosterone replacement therapy, 400 Ml every 3 weeks and my PSA all that time hovered around 1.88 then in Oct the Dr switched to every 2 weeks to keep levels steady and not plummet as it always did in the 3rd week; PSA then was 1.88. Then in Jan 2015, don\u0092t remember the reason, I had a PSA test= 3.36\u00853 weeks later it was 5.56\u00853 weeks later it was 9.56. Digital was neg. only moderate enlargement (no urine flow problems). Biopsy results in April 2015 showed Gleason 7 (4+3 (not the better 3+4)) one sample 20% and one sample 10%, and a Gleason 8 one sample <5%. Moving up to week before surgery with Dr meeting I asked for one more PSA exclaiming the testosterone switch from 3 weeks to 2 weeks was spiking the PSA level, results were PSA dropped to 1.36 and surgeon suggested now to wait\u0085Aug was 1.18, Sept 1.24, Oct 1.36, Dec 1.66, Jan 20016 1.99. Met with chief of radiation oncology at Northside Cancer Atlanta, Ga (referred by surgeon) Jan 19 and 5 days/week for 5 weeks IMRT was recommended, followed by seeding, followed by hormone depletion which according to DR was standard treatment across the country, I start my 3rd week of radiation this Monday; prior to the 1st radiation treatment I had another PSA, Feb 1st, and it dropped down to 1.17 from 1.99. I still speak with the surgeon even though I switched to oncology and she said I do have cancer and who knows what may be lurking next to where biopsy needle stuck. Question: this seems rather too aggressive for what is considered non metastatic, not that advanced PC (had a un related adnominal cat scan week prior to biopsy which only showed an enlarged prostate and a small kidney stone, nothing else; they were looking for a hernia) . I have read where IMRT was sufficient or seeds, either or, and depletion was called for at a much more advanced stage after the IMRT or seeds failed. Has anyone had similar advice or under gone this regime? Has anyone with a Gleason 7 & 8 had just one or the other, but not both treatments with very good outcome? The side effects of hormone therapy seems too much at this time in treatment when PC has not advanced. Question: is anyone out there being treated at Northside Atlanta? Thank You",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I\u0092ve posted before, but now a year out of treatment I have new concerns. Personal history: 71 y.o. heterosexual w/male; Up till Oct 20014, and the last 15 years, I had been getting testosterone replacement therapy, 400 Ml every 3 weeks and my PSA all that time hovered around 1.88 then in Oct the Dr switched to every 2 weeks to keep levels steady and not drop as it always did in the 3rd week; PSA then was 1.88. Then in Jan 2015 I had a PSA test: 3.38\u00853 weeks later it was 5.72\u00853 weeks later it was 9.1. Digital was neg. only moderate enlargement (no urine flow problems), and that started everything in motion; Had an unrelated CT with contrast (looking for a hernia) in Jan 2015, no hernia, and only showed enlarged prostate\u0085all these years had no urinary flow problems maybe get up at night just once at most. Standard range 8/26/13 4/30/14 1/13/15 2/23/15 3/10/15 6/30/15 8/3/15 8/31/15 10/1/15 11/2/15 12/1/15 12/31/15 2/1/16 2/29/16 PSA 0.00 - 6.50 ng/mL 2.21 1.84 3.38 5.72 9.1 1.39 1.18 1.30 .18 1.24 1.34 1.93 1.17 8.44 Biopsy results in April 2015 showed my Gleason score is 7 (4+3) 1 core 20%, 1 core 10%, and 8 (4+4) 1 core @< 5% Started EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY: 5 weeks/5days a week (25 treatments) Mar 2016, then PROSTATE SEED BRACHYTHERAPY May 2016 PSA after EBRT & Brachytherapy 7/1/16 =0.79 10/3/16 =0.44 2/13/17 =0.59 4/17/17 =0.56 6/19/17 =0.73 8/10/17 =0.95 The lowest psa is 0.44, some 5+ months after seeds, but since then every 2-3 months the psa has risen to now current 0.95. The Dr. said this is \u0093only\u0094 considered a bounce and not to worry, (very hard not to do), until 3 successive increases; I pointed out the already three consecutive rises on tests at two-three month intervals so she countered that with: OK, but now don\u0092t be concerned till it goes double over my lowest point, 0.44, which would be 2.44 and it could take a few years for that to come down. I have one more psa test due in Oct than after that she said the standard has changed to every 6 months to 1 year and she doesn\u0092t seem to want to budge from that. Has anyone had numbers bounce around similar to this and eventually come down? The Dr said at the beginning of it all that this protocol, which was national as in it\u0092s the same in NY, Ohio, as it\u0092s here, had something like a 15 year national survival rate for a cancer like I have/had; right now it doesn\u0092t look so good from my view point. Any encouraging experiences out there? Thanks everyone ...sorry, when I wrote this all the PSA's lined up just right under the dates, don't know why thread made it this way",

I found out the reader only had a little over a month experience so I asked for second reading, this is response: The Axumin PET was reviewed by another radiologist at Kaiser and the following was noted: \" Upon second review of the provided images, note is made of diffuse moderate homogeneous uptake throughout the prostate gland, which is slightly less than that of bone marrow uptake. This finding is considered borderline for local disease recurrence. No evidence of extra prostatic metastatic disease.\" What does made of diffuse moderate homogeneous uptake throughout the prostate gland, which is slightly less than that of bone marrow uptake mean in English? thank you",
