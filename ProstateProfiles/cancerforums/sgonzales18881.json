      "Content": "Thanks all! My dad is 60. His PSA had hung around in the low 4's until reaching 5.1 in October 2015 and dropping to 4.7 this past December. So not extremely high, but the MRI did exhibit some concern. The suspicious area in the MRI was very close to the bladder. During the biopsy, my father recalled that the suspicious area was about 30% of his prostate, which seems quite large (in his account). But as you both said, we won't know anything until biopsy results come in on Tuesday. Will be sure to update again then.",

      "Content": "Hi all, Father had a prostate biopsy a couple days ago and was wondering what something meant. He had an MRI and then a fusion biopsy of his prostate. He said they took 12 samples and there were a set of charts on a computer nearby the table. It gave readings as the samples were being taken. He said 11 of them were in a \"blue\" zone, which meant normal, but on the eighth sample it went into a \"red\" zone (the highest) and read very high. Does anyone know what this means or what that's measuring?",
