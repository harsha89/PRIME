I had a followup visit a week later with my urologist, and I thought I was convinced that the robotic surgery was what I wanted. My Ur does robotic and standard surgeries, and has done hundreds. I was surprised when he told me that he thought I was a better candidate for open surgery since that way, he could easily remove the lymph nodes during surgery. He told me that removing them with robotic was difficult. He also mentioned that you can have one 5-6 inch scar, or 5 or 6 1 inch scars. I have read that the robotic helps speed recovery, and in general is preferred these days. I'm a little confused. Sooo... there's the question. Has anyone that had robotic surgery had their LN's removed at the same time?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jerseyguy How soon after surgery do you think one can return to work full time (if ones job isn\u2019t very physical)? Glad things are going well. My main problem is sitting for long periods of time. Laying slightly really helps take the pressure off the stitches, and other parts down there. If I had a cot or pad to lay down on for 20 minutes every few hours, I could handle full time now. I get pretty \"uncomfortable\" now after 4 hours or so and really need to just zone out and forget all the pressures of life, even if only for 20 minutes. That is what works for me. I'm fortunate to have a job that allows it.",

      "Content": "A little background: A routine blood test for a life insurance policy showed an elevated PSA. I saw a urologist, who did a DRE and found nothing alarming. He recommended the biopsy and a few weeks later I got the dreaded news of PC. My gleason score was 7. I am one of those guys who didn't really want to talk about the whole \"cancer\" thing to anyone, except my wife and very immediate family. I even held out on telling my college age son who was taking summer classes. After much research, and lots of reading on these forums, I decided on robotic surgery to remove the prostate. At 52, with 2 young kids left to raise, I wanted the best odds of curing my cancer, and 3 different urologists said removal was just that. I figured I would share my experience so far, hoping that someone might find the info helpful. First off, for me, the biopsy was no big deal. It was a little freaky, especially since the Dr left the needle and the \"probe\" out in plain view after the procedure. I really had no pain to speak of during the procedure, although the loud \"click\" with each sample did seem to send a weird shock through my body. As I told my friend, if I had to go through it again, I wouldn't sweat it at all. Although I have no reason to dislike my original urologist, he just didn't seem to be totally confident to me. His demeanor was nervous, and he gave me some info that I came to question later on. He wanted to do the open surgery, and told me that he couldn't easily remove the lymph nodes by doing robotic surgery. All my research prior to his comments pointed to the robotic surgery being desired. I arranged another opinion, and immediately became very comfortable with the new urologist. In fact, it was a night and day difference. It should be noted that my original urologist and the hospital where he would have done the surgery is about 5 minutes from my home. My new urologist and hospital is 1 hour away. I still chose the new guy. He took more time and answered my questions, was totally confident, and when I left his office, I knew I was on the right path. My point here: If you aren't comfortable, get more opinions. 2 days before my surgery, my son arrived home after completing his summer term at college. I had a really good 2-3 hour conversation with him about the whole situation, and for the first time in my life, had 100% of his attention (lol). I just didn't see the need to complicate his life with the cancer news while he was working hard to get good grades. I was worried on how he would react when I did share the news with him, but it went really well. The day before surgery, I had oatmeal for breakfast, and then nothing except the fizzy laxative later in the day. No further commentary needed for that. I spent the last few days before surgery taking it easy. I have a physical job and didn't want to chance hurting myself at work, so I basically didn't work for 4 days before my surgery. I checked into the hospital at 5:30 am the morning of my surgery. They took good care of me, made me feel really comfortable, confident, etc. The second I got there, they treated my like I was a VIP. I met my anesthesiologist, and she got two IV's inserted and spent a good amount of time explaining the procedure. They wheeled me into the O.R., and there looming like some weird creature was the robot. That was a little weird, but the OR crew was swarming around me getting me ready for the procedure, so I didn't dwell on it. The anesthesiologist gave me a reassuring pat on the shoulder, and said \"ok... you'll be asleep in 10 seconds, and you'll wake up in the recover room\". What seemed like 10 seconds later, a nurse was telling me I was in recovery, and that everything went great. I remember telling her (exact words) that I had to pee like a racehorse, and asked if she could please help me to the bathroom. She laughed. She assured me that I was peeing just fine, with the catheter in place. I said I felt like I had consumed a 12 pack and really needed to go. She told me that the sensation would go away after a while. Laying there in a complete daze, I'm not sure how I came to this conclusion, but it is as clear as day, I realized that for 50 years, I have been telling myself NOT to pee while laying in bed. I reasoned with myself that now I had to learn how to release that sensation, which I did. I'm not sure it helped, but when I woke up in my room some hours later the sensation was gone. I don't remember a whole lot of the afternoon, but my wife and son came to visit. I ordered some jello and vegetable broth, and I consumed lots of ice chips too. It was late evening before I feel like I was really awake. I had a good room with a nice view of the city, and I laid there looking out the window resting. The nurses that were assigned to me all said the same thing, that I was urinating really well, and that it was clearing up nicely. They gave me some morphine after I told them my pain was a 6 out of 10. It helped immediately, buy wore off in an hour. Then they gave me oxy codone (or something like that), and everything was GREAT for 4 hours at a time. I could sure tell when it was time for more meds! I was really comfortable the whole time, with one exception. They got me up at about midnight and wanted me to walk around if I could. I got up ok, and made 4-5 loops around the floor by myself. All was great there, but when I went to get back into bed... HOLY CRAP, I thought I was going to die. You don't realize how much you rely on your stomach muscles to do everyday tasks. The next morning I was just waking when my Dr came in to check on me. He told me that the surgery went \"beautifully\", and that I lost very little blood. He also said he saw no signs at all that the cancer had spread, but we would talk about that in a week when I come in for my post-op check. I was really happy with his news. I was starving by now, so I had some oatmeal and juice, and more meds. They told me I could check out around 11 am. I asked if I could get up and walk again, so they got me up again, and I made quite a few more laps around the place. Walking really felt good, so I was eager to continue. After that, I arranged for my wife to pick me up and after they taught me how to care for the catheter, I was on my way home. Life around the house was tricky at first, since I have a really active 2 year old. She didn't understand why she couldn't crawl all over daddy like she is used to. It took a few days for her to adjust. I stayed segregated in the living room with a child gate to keep her out, and my son and wife took good care of me for the next few days. I took pain meds for 2 more days, and finally decided to stop. I didn't have too much trouble pain wise after that. I drank tons of water, and tended to my catheter bag. Living with the catheter was a little annoying, but not really that bad. You learn really quickly what to do, and especially what NOT to do. One hint, keep that tube secured to your leg with a little play. I used the overnight bag the whole time, and cleaned it each morning (during my shower) with soap and vinegar like they taught me at the hospital. I also kept a tube of neosporin handy to apply to the tip of my penis, which helped. I applied it several times throughout the day. I basically laid around all day for the week, and did a few laps around the yard each day. I had heard that I would feel 100% better each day that passed, and I can say that is definitely the case. The hardest thing for me was sleeping at night. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. It was hard to switch positions and keep the urine flowing into the bag. I worried about the bag filling up, so I set my alarm to go off every 3 hours, which was just about perfect. I would get up and drain the bag, and then go back to bed and try to snooze more. I got through it. FINALLY... day 7. I never anticipated a DR visit so much in my whole life! As I mentioned, the catheter isn't a big deal, but I couldn't wait to get that thing out of there none the less. My Dr checked my stitches, and read me the pathologist report. No evidence that the cancer had spread from the prostate. The lymph nodes showed no signs of cancer. I was really relieved, but guarded in my response. The next PSA test will tell the real story. He told me what to expect with regards to \"dripping\", and erections. He sent me home with some Cialis, and told me come back in 5 weeks. Then the nurse came in removed the catheter. It was completely painless. I was surprised how much of that thing was inside me. I am happy to report that the first night after catheter removal, I had a night \"visitor\". It wasn't \"cold steel\", but it woke me, and I was happy to see that things were still working down there. Since then, I have had some more, but also am experiencing some healing pain which has kept me from trying things out if you know what I mean. Things are starting to feel ok now, so the exercises will commence soon! I am also doing tons of kegels, and have pretty good control with only the occasional dripping. I bought some good pads on Amazon, and am wearing them 24/7 for now. The healing continues. I went back to work 2 weeks after surgery, working half days doing office work. I should be back to full days in another week or so, but won't be returning to my previous strenuous type duties for several months at a minimum. Thankfully I have a job that allows that. Being one of the owners doesn't hurt! Well, this is beyond long, so I will end it here. I hope that someone will read my experience and gain some comfort from it. I know I sure did when I read other's experiences. Updates as they come.... Steve",
