      "Content": "Hello, I had my Robotic Radical Prostatectomy back in January of 2009. I am to this day still suffering from incontinence, and ED. I saw him last week, and he said if I haven't got any erections after three years, then the likelihood I would ever have them is very unlikely and pretty much next to nil. GREAT NEWS! What's the point of a radical NERVE-SPARING surgery when I can't get any more erections now? Some members come on here bragging that they get erections only after a week post-OP or soon after, are full of B%$S&T! My Doctor and a few other urologists have told me NOT to believe everything you read on the internet. No DUH. It's a case by case, granted, but their PSA numbers, gleason scores, or the area where they removed such cancers were somewhat similar to myself, yet they are having erections and little or no incontinence as little as a few days or weeks post-Op, but I am still experiencing such a dilemma. Depends on the expertise of the surgeon. However, there may be a few exceptions with keeping and preserving more blood bundles on either side of the prostate to enable more blood flow and future erections. It is a case by case situation. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad to be prostate cancer free with 0.01 PSA results every six months post op, but the percentages of me dying from this cancer itself was very very VERY LOW! I am 57 years old. Don't know why I underwent this surgery in the first place. This is Only My opinion and I can just hear a few telling me, hey buddy, just be glad your are alive and healthy...sorry, I'm not that cheerful knowing I'm handicapped in this area of my life, and dealing with it the best as I can, no matter how frustrating it is for me. I also have a VERY rare NET Carcinoid Tumor Cancer I'm presently dealing with, and will have for life. Some of you might not even care about getting erections Post- Op, it's the point that he told me with certainty, that I would be able to, and now I can't after three years and will never be able to. I am talking naturally... no pump-up implants, no Trimix injections. So I have come to terms with me never being the same as I was before I decided to undergo this procedure. yes.... I am still incontinent. Little jimmy, still lifeless and remains limp. My wee wee doc told me after three years without an erection, the odds are against me to ever having a natural erection in my future. I saw another Urologist today, who talked about the SLING, and the AUS...Artificial Urinary Sphincter. The AUS is a three stage approach, all I remember is a balloon, a cuff, and a Pump is involved, maybe much more. I don't feel I want, nor need that AUS, given that I am a \"light' dribbler, so the SLING, if anything, might be contemplated. The SLING method, if I choose this approach, sounds far less invasive. \"Wrapping a mesh-like surgical tape around the urethral bulb, the sling gently and slightly moves the urethra into a new position that has been shown to be a method of overcoming incontinence. Something bothersome to me about this stuff...like, \"Permanent sutures in the perineum may create some pain in the post-operative period..\" \"Bleeding and infection of the mesh or the bone or pubic bone, erosion, inability to urinate, or recurrent leakage.\" SUM FUN NOW! This method says it's meant for guys with moderate to heavy urinary incontinence...two to three pads daily. I only wear one per day, if I go out of the house. I did my kegals for the first six months after surgery to help strengthen my pelvic floor muscles, which I thought helped, but now when i have to go pee, at home, I sit on the john for about five minutes after the initial pee, otherwise I still dribble. I do have 'stop & go' control, but it seems to keep dribbling, not bad. Either I go through with this SLING, which may or may not help me, or get used to these diapers for the rest of my life. I am 57 years old. BUT FIRST BEFORE I think about this SLING procedure, I have to undergo a URODYNAMIC STUDY, Cystometry, also known as flow cystometry, is a clinical diagnostic procedure used to evaluate bladder function. Specifically, it measures contractile force of the bladder when voiding. Anyway, up the peepee, then another tube into the 'other' orifice (down south) to check pressure. A little numbing and a little K-Y. (I've had many bad foley removals gone terribly wrong, so forgive me if I get squeamish here, and hence, I'm a big baby..OK, you win, I am just that, when it comes to shoving tubes in to places where they have no bizness being. I will have to be awake to talk to the doctor and follow commands, but Antivan might come in handy for the anxiety..I'm only hoping. (fingers crossed) Million dollar questions? Has anyone personally gone through this SLING procedure, and are you better off now? Any leakage? Do those permanent sutures bother you? Any regrets doing this procedure? Any suggestions? Anyone have the Urodynamic Study? Does it hurt? Urodynamic Study include Cystometry, Electromyelogram, Pressure Studies, Voiding Cystourethrogram, Multi-Channel Video Urodynamics, Measurement of Post-Void Residual...etc. Urodynamic Studies? Is this really necessary if I'm not on board with the SLING procedure? I notice when I sit down to go, it has spurts here and there that last for a few minutes after the main emptying of my bladder. Next week, My Urologist wants to do a Urodynamic Study,to see if I'm a candidate for a SLING procedure,and to also measure pressure. I am seriously thinking of cancelling. If my problem was having to wear three or more diapers per day,and more excessive leakage, then I would definitely consider it, but even after wearing a diaper all day when I'm out, it hardly notice any leakage or odor coming from the diaper, so..... The uro also discussed the AUS procedure, but that is way beyond went I need at this point. I am content with what I have to deal with now, and as one fellow poster said, \"Why temp fate\", which I can agree with given I also have a 6.8cmx7.6cm Lymphoceal pushing inside my bladder that also has to to be drained, ( a result of the RP, and surrounding lymph node removal) and if I were to do this urostudy, I should at least wait until this mass effect on my bladder is addressed first. I'm no doctor, but it's my body, and Ill have to think about that. Thank you all! Good luck to the rest of you, who are thinking about going through with this, and be sure to weigh all of your options, ask as many doctor questions and feel confident in your surgeon, but more importantly, Go have as much natural good and healthy sex as you possibly can now, before the fact. I always have the brotherhood here in my prayers, everyday!",

      "Content": "mkane09, Just goes to show just how 'SHALLOW' some women can be. I don't want to generalize that ALL women would run,not walk away from guys who had the Prostate surgery and was unable to please them sexually. Let's face it, we are guys. We love sex, and want to please the women folk the best we can, and in all facets of lovemaking,and if we can't, then it's a really big blow to our egos. We feel we have failed them. The bright side to all of this is, if there is one, is that we SURVIVED the CANCER, and to hell to those women who think that their man has to have a functioning hard penis to make the relationship a TOTAL one. I also thought that my future lack of sexual fulfillment with the opposite sex would be daunting, finding someone who would not care about my 'shortcomings', and the inability to stand erect at a given notice, but girls, that are my friends seem to calm me by telling me that not all women think with their vjj's as men do with their penises. That there are women out there that care more about other aspects of relationships, like holding hands, good conversation, snuggling, laughing,and just being close in that way, and not so much sexually. And they go on to tell me that there are a lot of other things a couple can do besides the boring,mundane missionary position. It's not all about sex...IF, you can find someone like that. I also find that orgasms now, are far more intense than before the surgery.....just sayin'. Hang in there, and try not to get so discouraged and beat yourself up over this, for always remember...we are cancer survivors first, and to HELL with all the little shallow girls out there..they just don't know what they're missing!",

      "Content": "Granny, First of all, congratulations on your upcoming 39th anniversary on the 21st! Hello, and thanks for weighing in here. What you said is good assurance coming from the opposite sex, and to take away fears that men have after going through with this surgery and the aftereffects. The human condition. Ummmm. I guess the same would be said if (maybe) a significant other had a bad diagnosis of breast cancer and had to have a double mastectomy, and would then have a flat chest, I'm sure there would also be 'shallow' men out there that would skip out on her at her time of need and support, (which would suck) so if we find that special someone that cares truly for his or her inner beauty and not what's on the outside, then that's special person is a keeper! We men need more women like you weighing on here to ease the already pain this cancer has given us, for the sake of not feeling so alone and inadequate, that there are nice women out there that care a lot about the emotional aspects of a relationship and not all physical.",
