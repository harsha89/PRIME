      "Content": "7. From what I've seen, it looks like final pathology only downgrades the Gleason score in 10% or less of men. It's upgraded in 20-30% and remains unchanged in the rest. (One study says that \"25-35% of biopsy Gleason 6 is upgraded to Gleason 7 or higher in the prostatectomy (RP) specimen.\") I couldn't find anything online describing final pathology after RP being completely negative. It's got to be less than rare. In addition, did your biopsy pathology report mention other biomarkers of PCa - like racemase? I'm not going to pretend that I understand exactly what that is, but I think that finding it bolsters the cancer diagnosis (beyond the visual appearance of the cells) - making it even less likely that the pathologist was completely wrong.",

      "Content": "I had DaVinci surgery on Aug. 17, and the recovery is going well, 11 days out. I'm 99.9% continent, and it already looks like hardly any ED side effects. Mild discomfort from the surgery, especially the bloating, but I needed painkillers less than a week. The worst part was probably dealing with the %^&* catheter. Margins were negative, and it was all confined to one lobe (PT2a). I go back for PSA testing in a few weeks, but the likelihood of recurrence is less than 1%. I hope that gives some relief to those worried about the surgery. Everybody's experience is different, but for me, it's been really just a bump in the road. Thanks again for all the information, guys. This site helps a lot of folks.",

Based on what I know so far, it was caught early and I'm in a low-risk category. I've got a Gleason score of 6 (3+3) and a PSA of just 0.6 ng/mL. Nothing unusual was felt with DRE. My cancer was caught only because I had a 10-month history of hematospermia (blood in semen). No other symptoms. They assumed prostatitis, but when antibiotics did nothing and the bleeding continued, a new urologist suggested a biopsy to rule out anything serious. Imagine my surprise. I will meet with my urologist again in two weeks to discuss treatment options in more detail, and I am seeing a different urologist for a second opinion soon after that. (Also, awaiting lab results on whether PTEN is absent.) My initial reaction is that prostatectomy seems best, given my age and life expectancy (dad lived to 87). But I'm keeping an open mind, and I'd welcome any suggestions. One question: I'll ask the doctors about the number of RPs they've done, rates of complications, how much incontinence their patents reported 3, 6, 12 month out, etc. (Q's that Dr. Walsh's book suggests.)
