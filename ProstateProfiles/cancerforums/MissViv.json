In answer to your question about why both a CT scan and a full-body bone scan are usually recommended, other than being routine investigative tools, they also serve as means to avoid pointless procedures. As I'm sure you are already aware, Gleason 8 represents an aggressive form of prostate cancer. I apologize if this is too direct but the bone scan is looking for whether the cancer has spread (metastasis). If so, it \"could\" rule out some treatments, such as surgery. As long as the cancer is believed to be confined within the prostate, a \"cure\" remains possible. However, even under a worst case scenario of metastasis, treatments are available to extend life for years and, sometimes, decades. Of course, it's not possible for us to understand or evaluate how his prior colon cancer may or may not impact upon his current diagnosis. Best of luck, Jim We did not get all of this information, in writing, but I will state what I remember. His age is 68 and I do not remember his PSA (maybe 12).
