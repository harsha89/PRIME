      "Content": "Thanks Chuck and MichaelF. My apologies for the late response. Life seems to happen more often, as I had to deal with health issues from my parents, and prepping for my son who is college bound. First time in awhile I had a breather. I had my appointment with the same urologist I used last year, and it was a quick meeting, as he wants me to come back and get an ultrasound along with a DRE to check on my prostate. My PSA last year when this all started was 4.7, and is 4.9 as of two months ago. While he mentioned there is nothing to be alarmed about at this point, he wants to make sure we stay on top of this. I guess would it make sense to have another mri and fusion biopsy at some point to make absolutely sure? I would not be surprised if the urologist makes this suggestion. Well, I do hope all is well, and I am fortunate to be part of this group of support. Stay tuned. Rob",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck! You are absolutely correct. I think every year I should go through the same process as I did last year. I really do not know why or how my PSA elevated from 2-3 years ago to now. I tried reading online on some of the causes, but so far nothing pertains to my condition or lifestyle. The urologist office will call me next week to firm up an appointment for another blood test, ultrasound, and possible DRE. As always thanks for the help and support. I know I have been away with my life events, but I will always try to make it back here. Thank you again! Rob",

      "Content": "Hello all, It has been some time since I last participated in the forum here. I was laid off five to six months ago, and since then I have been trying to focus my efforts in securing a new position since then. During this time I could not follow up with my PCP or my urologist. Fortunately, I finally secured a new position and received health benefits for my family and I. I had an physical exam with my PCP, and he mentioned to me my PSA is 4.9, and last year it was 4.7 before the fusion biopsy I had. I had a scheduled appointment with my urologist and I let him know my PSA just taken. I have not heard back from him, but I guess he will let me know what to do next. I do hope everyone I corresponded with is doing well, and do hope I can hear back from you guys. Looking forward to hearing from everyone. See you soon! RobP",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your reply. To be honest, I am scared to death. I have my biopsy scheduled for next week, and I am not even sure if the the doctor is good or not. He mentioned I will get some anesthesia during the procedure and that it will take five (5) minutes. I have read that this procedure only checks the posterior part of the prostate, and not the anterior. Is there something else that I would need? I also read about some men just opting of the removal of the prostate, and have it done so the \"erection\" nerves are still intact. As of this morning, I am thinking of doing the latter because I do not want to forever look over my shoulder. Does this sound sane or just panic? Or maybe a little of both? Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Thanks again Michael. I have my appointment with 2nd Urologist with who is the chairman of urology and who is supposed to specialize in mri biopsies. I am hoping that whatever I have can be taken care of at this facility. The 1st Urologist never mentioned anything in terms of \"positive\". After the ultrasound on my lower abdomen, and then the rectal probe where he was taking measurements of my prostate, all he mentioned was I may be constipated and that my prostate was 60 grams. He did an additional blood work, and said they will test my PSA again, and that there was an additional test that is more definitive (which he never mentioned the name of the extra test). Five days later, he called me early, and said the readings came back and there is a 25-30% chance of PC. He said with this percentage, he wants to order the P-bx procedure. I was hoping with either the ultrasound of my abdomen, and the rectal probe, that he would have said something along the lines of, \"There was\\were something on your prostate that may indicate PC\". But all he said your PSA is higher than what my PCP tested, and that the P-bx procedure would be needed. Trust me, I would have remembered if he said anything to the effect of me having anything positive PC. It has been 11 days since those two examinations, and all that is different with me is that my stomach feels achy like someone kicked me in my groin. It's not hurtful, but almost comes and goes with throbbing sensations here and there. I never felt this until he gave me the rectal probe. I am prepping my mind for the B-px procedure as I am sure there is a good chance of this being ordered at the second urologist. I have ordered from the first urologist office to mail my records of my examinations. I want to bring it to my second urologist. When I receive it, I will update this post with the tests that my first urologist took. Maybe you will have a better understanding of what was done to me. Thanks again and stand by for updates!",

      "Content": "Hello All, My name is Robert, and I need a little guidance here. Below are my stats: Age: 47 Height: 6'2\" Weight: 250lbs Health Issues: 1. Have three (3) herniated discs (L5/L4/L3), and S1 degeneration. Disc degeneration, slight nerve issue in both legs, atrophy mostly in right thigh 2. Hip alignment problem 3. Sciatica in 2013 4. Work as a field engineer for the past 7 years, and I drive all day, with sometimes siting for 3hours at a time 5. I have acid reflux and have been on Dexilant since about 2012. Stopped using Dexilant late 2015. While using Dexilant, it often made me urinate more than normal. 6. Last year, 2015, for my physical, my PSA was 3.6. Met with my PCP, and he notified me that my PSA is 4.2. Two weeks later, took another blood test, and my PSA is 4.6. Went to see a urologist the following week. I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your reply. To be honest, I am scared to death. I have my biopsy scheduled for next week, and I am not even sure if the the doctor is good or not. He mentioned I will get some anesthesia during the procedure and that it will take five (5) minutes. I have read that this procedure only checks the posterior part of the prostate, and not the anterior. Is there something else that I would need? I also read about some men just opting of the removal of the prostate, and have it done so the \"erection\" nerves are still intact. As of this morning, I am thinking of doing the latter because I do not want to forever look over my shoulder. Does this sound sane or just panic? Or maybe a little of both? Thanks again!",

I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your reply. To be honest, I am scared to death. I have my biopsy scheduled for next week, and I am not even sure if the the doctor is good or not. He mentioned I will get some anesthesia during the procedure and that it will take five (5) minutes. I have read that this procedure only checks the posterior part of the prostate, and not the anterior. Is there something else that I would need? I also read about some men just opting of the removal of the prostate, and have it done so the \"erection\" nerves are still intact. As of this morning, I am thinking of doing the latter because I do not want to forever look over my shoulder. Does this sound sane or just panic? Or maybe a little of both? Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Thanks again Michael. I have my appointment with 2nd Urologist with who is the chairman of urology and who is supposed to specialize in mri biopsies. I am hoping that whatever I have can be taken care of at this facility. The 1st Urologist never mentioned anything in terms of \"positive\". After the ultrasound on my lower abdomen, and then the rectal probe where he was taking measurements of my prostate, all he mentioned was I may be constipated and that my prostate was 60 grams. He did an additional blood work, and said they will test my PSA again, and that there was an additional test that is more definitive (which he never mentioned the name of the extra test). Five days later, he called me early, and said the readings came back and there is a 25-30% chance of PC. He said with this percentage, he wants to order the P-bx procedure. I was hoping with either the ultrasound of my abdomen, and the rectal probe, that he would have said something along the lines of, \"There was\\were something on your prostate that may indicate PC\". But all he said your PSA is higher than what my PCP tested, and that the P-bx procedure would be needed. Trust me, I would have remembered if he said anything to the effect of me having anything positive PC. It has been 11 days since those two examinations, and all that is different with me is that my stomach feels achy like someone kicked me in my groin. It's not hurtful, but almost comes and goes with throbbing sensations here and there. I never felt this until he gave me the rectal probe. I am prepping my mind for the B-px procedure as I am sure there is a good chance of this being ordered at the second urologist. I have ordered from the first urologist office to mail my records of my examinations. I want to bring it to my second urologist. When I receive it, I will update this post with the tests that my first urologist took. Maybe you will have a better understanding of what was done to me. Thanks again and stand by for updates!",

      "Content": "Hello All, My name is Robert, and I need a little guidance here. Below are my stats: Age: 47 Height: 6'2\" Weight: 250lbs Health Issues: 1. Have three (3) herniated discs (L5/L4/L3), and S1 degeneration. Disc degeneration, slight nerve issue in both legs, atrophy mostly in right thigh 2. Hip alignment problem 3. Sciatica in 2013 4. Work as a field engineer for the past 7 years, and I drive all day, with sometimes siting for 3hours at a time 5. I have acid reflux and have been on Dexilant since about 2012. Stopped using Dexilant late 2015. While using Dexilant, it often made me urinate more than normal. 6. Last year, 2015, for my physical, my PSA was 3.6. Met with my PCP, and he notified me that my PSA is 4.2. Two weeks later, took another blood test, and my PSA is 4.6. Went to see a urologist the following week. I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

      "Content": "Thanks again Michael. I have my appointment with 2nd Urologist with who is the chairman of urology and who is supposed to specialize in mri biopsies. I am hoping that whatever I have can be taken care of at this facility. The 1st Urologist never mentioned anything in terms of \"positive\". After the ultrasound on my lower abdomen, and then the rectal probe where he was taking measurements of my prostate, all he mentioned was I may be constipated and that my prostate was 60 grams. He did an additional blood work, and said they will test my PSA again, and that there was an additional test that is more definitive (which he never mentioned the name of the extra test). Five days later, he called me early, and said the readings came back and there is a 25-30% chance of PC. He said with this percentage, he wants to order the P-bx procedure. I was hoping with either the ultrasound of my abdomen, and the rectal probe, that he would have said something along the lines of, \"There was\\were something on your prostate that may indicate PC\". But all he said your PSA is higher than what my PCP tested, and that the P-bx procedure would be needed. Trust me, I would have remembered if he said anything to the effect of me having anything positive PC. It has been 11 days since those two examinations, and all that is different with me is that my stomach feels achy like someone kicked me in my groin. It's not hurtful, but almost comes and goes with throbbing sensations here and there. I never felt this until he gave me the rectal probe. I am prepping my mind for the B-px procedure as I am sure there is a good chance of this being ordered at the second urologist. I have ordered from the first urologist office to mail my records of my examinations. I want to bring it to my second urologist. When I receive it, I will update this post with the tests that my first urologist took. Maybe you will have a better understanding of what was done to me. Thanks again and stand by for updates!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Michael. Your post added much color to my cloudy thinking. And please, no offense taken. I only posted my issue because I just wanted get more info from men who actually have had experience with this. I do understand that my responsibility is to see the best doctor possible for this condition. My post was in no way looking for a \"self-medicated\" process. By the way, I am located in NY, USA. I just read about the MRI type of treatment which is what lead me to the idea of getting a second opinion, in the hopes of a better treatment. My worries started, when the urologist spoke to me, it was as if, he was rushing. Initially he spoke for 2 minutes, he gave me the ultrasound\\prostate probe exam about 5 minutes, then he said am I always constipated because he saw a hard bowel in me (yes I had to use the bathroom, but since I work out in the field, I do not use the bathroom until I get home, so I hold my bowels), then he said go use the bathroom and urinate, then he sat me down for 3 minutes, and stated I have an enlarged prostate, and that is indicative of PC. That is when he wanted me to schedule a B-px. All this, I walked away from the office still in shock. I wasn't sure if the urologist gave enough time to assess me. I looked up a doctor in Manhattan, that specializes in the imaging procedure you also mentioned. I called earlier to make an appointment. And yes, I know I have to lose weight. I am trying to eat smaller portions, and start doing Yoga. I swim once a week for about an hour, but I can only do 25 laps, back and forth, and the length of the pool is 25 yards. I will keep everyone informed, especially after my appointment with the second doctor. As much as I am terrified, if PC is positive, I will take care of it the best I can. One of my co-workers mentioned that persistent hard bowels, uses the prostate to push it out, could also be a factor, but I doubt that would even be considered. Thanks again Michael. I will keep you and Chuck in the loops. Rob",

      "Content": "Thanks again Michael. I have my appointment with 2nd Urologist with who is the chairman of urology and who is supposed to specialize in mri biopsies. I am hoping that whatever I have can be taken care of at this facility. The 1st Urologist never mentioned anything in terms of \"positive\". After the ultrasound on my lower abdomen, and then the rectal probe where he was taking measurements of my prostate, all he mentioned was I may be constipated and that my prostate was 60 grams. He did an additional blood work, and said they will test my PSA again, and that there was an additional test that is more definitive (which he never mentioned the name of the extra test). Five days later, he called me early, and said the readings came back and there is a 25-30% chance of PC. He said with this percentage, he wants to order the P-bx procedure. I was hoping with either the ultrasound of my abdomen, and the rectal probe, that he would have said something along the lines of, \"There was\\were something on your prostate that may indicate PC\". But all he said your PSA is higher than what my PCP tested, and that the P-bx procedure would be needed. Trust me, I would have remembered if he said anything to the effect of me having anything positive PC. It has been 11 days since those two examinations, and all that is different with me is that my stomach feels achy like someone kicked me in my groin. It's not hurtful, but almost comes and goes with throbbing sensations here and there. I never felt this until he gave me the rectal probe. I am prepping my mind for the B-px procedure as I am sure there is a good chance of this being ordered at the second urologist. I have ordered from the first urologist office to mail my records of my examinations. I want to bring it to my second urologist. When I receive it, I will update this post with the tests that my first urologist took. Maybe you will have a better understanding of what was done to me. Thanks again and stand by for updates!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Michael. Your post added much color to my cloudy thinking. And please, no offense taken. I only posted my issue because I just wanted get more info from men who actually have had experience with this. I do understand that my responsibility is to see the best doctor possible for this condition. My post was in no way looking for a \"self-medicated\" process. By the way, I am located in NY, USA. I just read about the MRI type of treatment which is what lead me to the idea of getting a second opinion, in the hopes of a better treatment. My worries started, when the urologist spoke to me, it was as if, he was rushing. Initially he spoke for 2 minutes, he gave me the ultrasound\\prostate probe exam about 5 minutes, then he said am I always constipated because he saw a hard bowel in me (yes I had to use the bathroom, but since I work out in the field, I do not use the bathroom until I get home, so I hold my bowels), then he said go use the bathroom and urinate, then he sat me down for 3 minutes, and stated I have an enlarged prostate, and that is indicative of PC. That is when he wanted me to schedule a B-px. All this, I walked away from the office still in shock. I wasn't sure if the urologist gave enough time to assess me. I looked up a doctor in Manhattan, that specializes in the imaging procedure you also mentioned. I called earlier to make an appointment. And yes, I know I have to lose weight. I am trying to eat smaller portions, and start doing Yoga. I swim once a week for about an hour, but I can only do 25 laps, back and forth, and the length of the pool is 25 yards. I will keep everyone informed, especially after my appointment with the second doctor. As much as I am terrified, if PC is positive, I will take care of it the best I can. One of my co-workers mentioned that persistent hard bowels, uses the prostate to push it out, could also be a factor, but I doubt that would even be considered. Thanks again Michael. I will keep you and Chuck in the loops. Rob",

      "Content": "Hello All, My name is Robert, and I need a little guidance here. Below are my stats: Age: 47 Height: 6'2\" Weight: 250lbs Health Issues: 1. Have three (3) herniated discs (L5/L4/L3), and S1 degeneration. Disc degeneration, slight nerve issue in both legs, atrophy mostly in right thigh 2. Hip alignment problem 3. Sciatica in 2013 4. Work as a field engineer for the past 7 years, and I drive all day, with sometimes siting for 3hours at a time 5. I have acid reflux and have been on Dexilant since about 2012. Stopped using Dexilant late 2015. While using Dexilant, it often made me urinate more than normal. 6. Last year, 2015, for my physical, my PSA was 3.6. Met with my PCP, and he notified me that my PSA is 4.2. Two weeks later, took another blood test, and my PSA is 4.6. Went to see a urologist the following week. I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

Stopped using Dexilant late 2015. While using Dexilant, it often made me urinate more than normal. 6. Last year, 2015, for my physical, my PSA was 3.6. Met with my PCP, and he notified me that my PSA is 4.2. Two weeks later, took another blood test, and my PSA is 4.6. Went to see a urologist the following week. I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

      "Content": "Thanks again Michael. I have my appointment with 2nd Urologist with who is the chairman of urology and who is supposed to specialize in mri biopsies. I am hoping that whatever I have can be taken care of at this facility. The 1st Urologist never mentioned anything in terms of \"positive\". After the ultrasound on my lower abdomen, and then the rectal probe where he was taking measurements of my prostate, all he mentioned was I may be constipated and that my prostate was 60 grams. He did an additional blood work, and said they will test my PSA again, and that there was an additional test that is more definitive (which he never mentioned the name of the extra test). Five days later, he called me early, and said the readings came back and there is a 25-30% chance of PC. He said with this percentage, he wants to order the P-bx procedure. I was hoping with either the ultrasound of my abdomen, and the rectal probe, that he would have said something along the lines of, \"There was\\were something on your prostate that may indicate PC\". But all he said your PSA is higher than what my PCP tested, and that the P-bx procedure would be needed. Trust me, I would have remembered if he said anything to the effect of me having anything positive PC. It has been 11 days since those two examinations, and all that is different with me is that my stomach feels achy like someone kicked me in my groin. It's not hurtful, but almost comes and goes with throbbing sensations here and there. I never felt this until he gave me the rectal probe. I am prepping my mind for the B-px procedure as I am sure there is a good chance of this being ordered at the second urologist. I have ordered from the first urologist office to mail my records of my examinations. I want to bring it to my second urologist. When I receive it, I will update this post with the tests that my first urologist took. Maybe you will have a better understanding of what was done to me. Thanks again and stand by for updates!",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your reply. To be honest, I am scared to death. I have my biopsy scheduled for next week, and I am not even sure if the the doctor is good or not. He mentioned I will get some anesthesia during the procedure and that it will take five (5) minutes. I have read that this procedure only checks the posterior part of the prostate, and not the anterior. Is there something else that I would need? I also read about some men just opting of the removal of the prostate, and have it done so the \"erection\" nerves are still intact. As of this morning, I am thinking of doing the latter because I do not want to forever look over my shoulder. Does this sound sane or just panic? Or maybe a little of both? Thanks again!",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Michael. Your post added much color to my cloudy thinking. And please, no offense taken. I only posted my issue because I just wanted get more info from men who actually have had experience with this. I do understand that my responsibility is to see the best doctor possible for this condition. My post was in no way looking for a \"self-medicated\" process. By the way, I am located in NY, USA. I just read about the MRI type of treatment which is what lead me to the idea of getting a second opinion, in the hopes of a better treatment. My worries started, when the urologist spoke to me, it was as if, he was rushing. Initially he spoke for 2 minutes, he gave me the ultrasound\\prostate probe exam about 5 minutes, then he said am I always constipated because he saw a hard bowel in me (yes I had to use the bathroom, but since I work out in the field, I do not use the bathroom until I get home, so I hold my bowels), then he said go use the bathroom and urinate, then he sat me down for 3 minutes, and stated I have an enlarged prostate, and that is indicative of PC. That is when he wanted me to schedule a B-px. All this, I walked away from the office still in shock. I wasn't sure if the urologist gave enough time to assess me. I looked up a doctor in Manhattan, that specializes in the imaging procedure you also mentioned. I called earlier to make an appointment. And yes, I know I have to lose weight. I am trying to eat smaller portions, and start doing Yoga. I swim once a week for about an hour, but I can only do 25 laps, back and forth, and the length of the pool is 25 yards. I will keep everyone informed, especially after my appointment with the second doctor. As much as I am terrified, if PC is positive, I will take care of it the best I can. One of my co-workers mentioned that persistent hard bowels, uses the prostate to push it out, could also be a factor, but I doubt that would even be considered. Thanks again Michael. I will keep you and Chuck in the loops. Rob",

      "Content": "Hello All, My name is Robert, and I need a little guidance here. Below are my stats: Age: 47 Height: 6'2\" Weight: 250lbs Health Issues: 1. Have three (3) herniated discs (L5/L4/L3), and S1 degeneration. Disc degeneration, slight nerve issue in both legs, atrophy mostly in right thigh 2. Hip alignment problem 3. Sciatica in 2013 4. Work as a field engineer for the past 7 years, and I drive all day, with sometimes siting for 3hours at a time 5. I have acid reflux and have been on Dexilant since about 2012. Stopped using Dexilant late 2015. While using Dexilant, it often made me urinate more than normal. 6. Last year, 2015, for my physical, my PSA was 3.6. Met with my PCP, and he notified me that my PSA is 4.2. Two weeks later, took another blood test, and my PSA is 4.6. Went to see a urologist the following week. I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Michael. Your post added much color to my cloudy thinking. And please, no offense taken. I only posted my issue because I just wanted get more info from men who actually have had experience with this. I do understand that my responsibility is to see the best doctor possible for this condition. My post was in no way looking for a \"self-medicated\" process. By the way, I am located in NY, USA. I just read about the MRI type of treatment which is what lead me to the idea of getting a second opinion, in the hopes of a better treatment. My worries started, when the urologist spoke to me, it was as if, he was rushing. Initially he spoke for 2 minutes, he gave me the ultrasound\\prostate probe exam about 5 minutes, then he said am I always constipated because he saw a hard bowel in me (yes I had to use the bathroom, but since I work out in the field, I do not use the bathroom until I get home, so I hold my bowels), then he said go use the bathroom and urinate, then he sat me down for 3 minutes, and stated I have an enlarged prostate, and that is indicative of PC. That is when he wanted me to schedule a B-px. All this, I walked away from the office still in shock. I wasn't sure if the urologist gave enough time to assess me. I looked up a doctor in Manhattan, that specializes in the imaging procedure you also mentioned. I called earlier to make an appointment. And yes, I know I have to lose weight. I am trying to eat smaller portions, and start doing Yoga. I swim once a week for about an hour, but I can only do 25 laps, back and forth, and the length of the pool is 25 yards. I will keep everyone informed, especially after my appointment with the second doctor. As much as I am terrified, if PC is positive, I will take care of it the best I can. One of my co-workers mentioned that persistent hard bowels, uses the prostate to push it out, could also be a factor, but I doubt that would even be considered. Thanks again Michael. I will keep you and Chuck in the loops. Rob",

      "Content": "Hello All, My name is Robert, and I need a little guidance here. Below are my stats: Age: 47 Height: 6'2\" Weight: 250lbs Health Issues: 1. Have three (3) herniated discs (L5/L4/L3), and S1 degeneration. Disc degeneration, slight nerve issue in both legs, atrophy mostly in right thigh 2. Hip alignment problem 3. Sciatica in 2013 4. Work as a field engineer for the past 7 years, and I drive all day, with sometimes siting for 3hours at a time 5. I have acid reflux and have been on Dexilant since about 2012. Stopped using Dexilant late 2015. While using Dexilant, it often made me urinate more than normal. 6. Last year, 2015, for my physical, my PSA was 3.6. Met with my PCP, and he notified me that my PSA is 4.2. Two weeks later, took another blood test, and my PSA is 4.6. Went to see a urologist the following week. I answered all their questions, but below is quick reference I can recall from memory: 1. No issue with erectile dysfunction 2. No issue with maintaining erection 3. No blood in urine and semen 4. My bowels are normally hard, and for most of my life I normally push my bowels out. I sometimes forget to have a bowel movement, and will have a bowel movement sometimes once in 2-3 days. 5. Once in awhile, I will have a slight-slight feeling of heat (or sting) after I urinate. 6. Once in a while, as I drive, my scrotum gets a warm sensation for a few seconds then goes away. The urologist performed an ultrasound on my stomach, and also performed a prostate probe where he inserted a probe in my rectum and took photos of me prostate. After the examination, he told me my prostate is about 60 grams, which is double the size of normalcy. He ran another test which is similar to measuring the PSA but also something else that I could not remember. A few days later, he said the results were that there may be a 25-30% chance that I may have prostate cancer, and suggest I go in for a P-bx biopsy procedure. I am very nervous and concerned because the urologist read the questionnaire and just asked me three questions, am I constipated, do I have problems with erections and does my urine drip out, all to which I responded no. Towards the end of his suggestion of a biopsy, he suggested I go see a neurosugeon about my lower back issues, which was odd of suggestion to me. Ever since the rectal prostate probe exam, my stomach has been aching. Not sure if it is related, but it never ached like that before, not even with relation to my acid reflux. I am still trying to get an appointment for the biopsy, but in the meantime, if anyone could could comment of what I posted that would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all in advanced. Robert",

      "Content": "Thank you so much Michael. Your post added much color to my cloudy thinking. And please, no offense taken. I only posted my issue because I just wanted get more info from men who actually have had experience with this. I do understand that my responsibility is to see the best doctor possible for this condition. My post was in no way looking for a \"self-medicated\" process. By the way, I am located in NY, USA. I just read about the MRI type of treatment which is what lead me to the idea of getting a second opinion, in the hopes of a better treatment. My worries started, when the urologist spoke to me, it was as if, he was rushing. Initially he spoke for 2 minutes, he gave me the ultrasound\\prostate probe exam about 5 minutes, then he said am I always constipated because he saw a hard bowel in me (yes I had to use the bathroom, but since I work out in the field, I do not use the bathroom until I get home, so I hold my bowels), then he said go use the bathroom and urinate, then he sat me down for 3 minutes, and stated I have an enlarged prostate, and that is indicative of PC. That is when he wanted me to schedule a B-px. All this, I walked away from the office still in shock. I wasn't sure if the urologist gave enough time to assess me. I looked up a doctor in Manhattan, that specializes in the imaging procedure you also mentioned. I called earlier to make an appointment. And yes, I know I have to lose weight. I am trying to eat smaller portions, and start doing Yoga. I swim once a week for about an hour, but I can only do 25 laps, back and forth, and the length of the pool is 25 yards. I will keep everyone informed, especially after my appointment with the second doctor. As much as I am terrified, if PC is positive, I will take care of it the best I can. One of my co-workers mentioned that persistent hard bowels, uses the prostate to push it out, could also be a factor, but I doubt that would even be considered. Thanks again Michael. I will keep you and Chuck in the loops. Rob",

      "Content": "Thanks again Michael. I have my appointment with 2nd Urologist with who is the chairman of urology and who is supposed to specialize in mri biopsies. I am hoping that whatever I have can be taken care of at this facility. The 1st Urologist never mentioned anything in terms of \"positive\". After the ultrasound on my lower abdomen, and then the rectal probe where he was taking measurements of my prostate, all he mentioned was I may be constipated and that my prostate was 60 grams. He did an additional blood work, and said they will test my PSA again, and that there was an additional test that is more definitive (which he never mentioned the name of the extra test). Five days later, he called me early, and said the readings came back and there is a 25-30% chance of PC. He said with this percentage, he wants to order the P-bx procedure. I was hoping with either the ultrasound of my abdomen, and the rectal probe, that he would have said something along the lines of, \"There was\\were something on your prostate that may indicate PC\". But all he said your PSA is higher than what my PCP tested, and that the P-bx procedure would be needed. Trust me, I would have remembered if he said anything to the effect of me having anything positive PC. It has been 11 days since those two examinations, and all that is different with me is that my stomach feels achy like someone kicked me in my groin. It's not hurtful, but almost comes and goes with throbbing sensations here and there. I never felt this until he gave me the rectal probe. I am prepping my mind for the B-px procedure as I am sure there is a good chance of this being ordered at the second urologist. I have ordered from the first urologist office to mail my records of my examinations. I want to bring it to my second urologist. When I receive it, I will update this post with the tests that my first urologist took. Maybe you will have a better understanding of what was done to me. Thanks again and stand by for updates!",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your reply. To be honest, I am scared to death. I have my biopsy scheduled for next week, and I am not even sure if the the doctor is good or not. He mentioned I will get some anesthesia during the procedure and that it will take five (5) minutes. I have read that this procedure only checks the posterior part of the prostate, and not the anterior. Is there something else that I would need? I also read about some men just opting of the removal of the prostate, and have it done so the \"erection\" nerves are still intact. As of this morning, I am thinking of doing the latter because I do not want to forever look over my shoulder. Does this sound sane or just panic? Or maybe a little of both? Thanks again!",

The guys here have helped me tremendously since I've joined, and would have been worse off without them. Just take one day at and time, and stay optimistic. The important thing I can add, echoing Michael, is find a really good Urologist that you feel comfortable with and trust. He\\she will know what to do and how to treat you, then follow their lead. It's normal to be a little frazzled, but also keep in mind that you found out now rather than much later. Reading these posts, that does help. Stay cool, and keep your stress level as low as possible. Keep us informed. Rob",
