      "Content": "KW, Here is how I look at it. For low risk PC, seeds has a cure rate of about 95% and surgery 85%. This is based on clinical staging as this is all you have at this time. If based on pathologic or post op staging surgery goes up to the 95% rate. The difference in cure rates based on clinical staging is that Brachy is more effective in treating the nerves, seminal vessicles and small extra capsular extensions than surgery. This is also why salvage radiation after surgery is used. If contained both have the same cure rate. Brachy is a 1 hour outpatient procedure with no recorded hospitalization due to procedure. Normal activities can be resumed on day two. Surgery requires a few day hospital stay and weeks of recovery. Surgical complication rates are in the 2% range and death occurs 1% within 30 days. ED rates for Brachy are 35%, for surgery 50%. Incontinence rates are zero compared to 11%. Urinary stricture rates are about 2% higher than surgery. ED is also better treated with Meds like Viagra. There is no evidence of secondary cancers being greater after 20 years in a cohort of surgical or Brachy patients. Since the radiation is local, bowel issues are rare. Surgery has the advantage of a final pathology, but you have to be willing to do immediate adjuvant treatment for it to be of use, and very few low risk patients do this. They always wait for a psa rise to begin salvage treatment so the final pathology is not of much use in a real world situation. The other advantage of surgery is that any psa rise after surgery is an indication of a reoccurrance. Reoccurrances are difficult to determine after radiation because of \"bounce\" and need three consecutive rises in psa to be deemed a reoccurrance. Surgery has good data beyond 20 years and modern Brachy data for 15 years. 10% of reoccurrances after surgery happen at later than 10 years. Reoccurrances for brachy are rare after 6 years. In general I believe that since low risk PC is rarely life threatening the treatment that produces the lowest side effects is the best. For high risk PC a more aggressive combination treatment regardless of the side effects is the best. Good luck in whatever treatment you choose as the probability of success is high regardless of the choice. JohnT",

      "Content": "Ron, I would be concerned, not worried. Brian made some excelent points. I had 12 negative biopsies and a negative MRIS over a 10 year period as psa rose to 40; free psa was between 7 and 15 . A slow and steady rise in psa over time is indicative of PC regardless of any other factors. A saturation biopsy is a good idea for you next biopsy as is a color doppler ultrasound guided biopsy or an MRI guided biopsy. I would also request a PCA3 test or a PCA3+ from Bostwick labs as it is more indicative for PC than a standard psa test. The one thing I learned in my 10 year search is that the vast majority of doctors, I saw 5 at major institutions, are pretty weak at dxing anything other than the standard cancers found in the perpheral zone, which is about 75% of cancers. There are two doctors that are experts in biopsying hard to find cancers, Dr Duke Bahn in Ventura Ca and Dr Fred Lee in Rochester Mn. The only draw back to a stauration biopsy is that the probability of finding indolant cancers increase significantly, and this opens up a whole new can of worms that is best left unopened.",

      "Content": "Ron, I would be concerned, not worried. Brian made some excelent points. I had 12 negative biopsies and a negative MRIS over a 10 year period as psa rose to 40; free psa was between 7 and 15 . A slow and steady rise in psa over time is indicative of PC regardless of any other factors. A saturation biopsy is a good idea for you next biopsy as is a color doppler ultrasound guided biopsy or an MRI guided biopsy. I would also request a PCA3 test or a PCA3+ from Bostwick labs as it is more indicative for PC than a standard psa test. The one thing I learned in my 10 year search is that the vast majority of doctors, I saw 5 at major institutions, are pretty weak at dxing anything other than the standard cancers found in the perpheral zone, which is about 75% of cancers. There are two doctors that are experts in biopsying hard to find cancers, Dr Duke Bahn in Ventura Ca and Dr Fred Lee in Rochester Mn. The only draw back to a stauration biopsy is that the probability of finding indolant cancers increase significantly, and this opens up a whole new can of worms that is best left unopened.",

      "Content": "KW, Here is how I look at it. For low risk PC, seeds has a cure rate of about 95% and surgery 85%. This is based on clinical staging as this is all you have at this time. If based on pathologic or post op staging surgery goes up to the 95% rate. The difference in cure rates based on clinical staging is that Brachy is more effective in treating the nerves, seminal vessicles and small extra capsular extensions than surgery. This is also why salvage radiation after surgery is used. If contained both have the same cure rate. Brachy is a 1 hour outpatient procedure with no recorded hospitalization due to procedure. Normal activities can be resumed on day two. Surgery requires a few day hospital stay and weeks of recovery. Surgical complication rates are in the 2% range and death occurs 1% within 30 days. ED rates for Brachy are 35%, for surgery 50%. Incontinence rates are zero compared to 11%. Urinary stricture rates are about 2% higher than surgery. ED is also better treated with Meds like Viagra. There is no evidence of secondary cancers being greater after 20 years in a cohort of surgical or Brachy patients. Since the radiation is local, bowel issues are rare. Surgery has the advantage of a final pathology, but you have to be willing to do immediate adjuvant treatment for it to be of use, and very few low risk patients do this. They always wait for a psa rise to begin salvage treatment so the final pathology is not of much use in a real world situation. The other advantage of surgery is that any psa rise after surgery is an indication of a reoccurrance. Reoccurrances are difficult to determine after radiation because of \"bounce\" and need three consecutive rises in psa to be deemed a reoccurrance. Surgery has good data beyond 20 years and modern Brachy data for 15 years. 10% of reoccurrances after surgery happen at later than 10 years. Reoccurrances for brachy are rare after 6 years. In general I believe that since low risk PC is rarely life threatening the treatment that produces the lowest side effects is the best. For high risk PC a more aggressive combination treatment regardless of the side effects is the best. Good luck in whatever treatment you choose as the probability of success is high regardless of the choice. JohnT",

      "Content": "Ronjem, The psa should not effect seeding any more than it would affect surgery, but a high psa is indicative of the cancer being systemic and beyond the reach of any local treatment, radiation or surgery. You should consult with a specialist medical oncologist for a second opinion. The issue of your prostate being against your bladder is an issue only an experienced brachytherapist can address. Were you told this by an experienced Brachytherapist or another doctor? It is very common for doctors not to be well informed about Brachy and offer information that is not correct. A brachytherapist will use a CT scan to determine the location of the prostate and the pelvic arch as well as other conditions that may effect the placement of seeds before he recommends anything.",

A CT scan can only see a lymphnode tumor greater than 10mm; by the time a tumor gets this big there already is wide spread matastisis. A simple PAP test that is elevated would tell you this long before any CT scan would see it. Bone scans may be used after matastisis is already identified or suspected. Baseline scans are good for monitoring treatments to see if they are shrinking tumors while on HT. Baseline images of the prostate such as a Color Doppler or MRI are good for monitoring AS patients. CT and bone scans for lower risk patients are worthless as baselines. It is basically throwing $6,000 out the door that could have been better spent; but who cares if you are not paying out of pocket. This is just one reason our medical costs are so high compared to other countries. If a patient were forced to pay out of his own pocket these types of scans would disappear and would only be used on advanced patients where there is still some value.",

This used to be a problem 20 years ago with the older ERBT, but has all but disappeared with the newer technology. The 20 year incidence of secondary cancers for IMRT is .5% which is equal to the 30 day mortality rate after surgery. The incidence of seconday cancers for brachytherapy is zero. The New Prostate Cancer Infolink has many studies and you can search for \"secondary cancers\" to read them yourself. 2. The idea of radiation having no second chances is false. The primary reason for most surgical failures is cancer already out of the prostate. Neither radiation or surgery will help these. The second most common reason for surgical failure is positive margins, about 21%, and cancer around the nerves, seminal vessicles and apex. Radiation will cure these the first time where surgery will need salvage radiation to cure these. If salvage radiation after a failed surgery will effect a cure then primary radiation would have also effected a cure the first time. The salvage treatments for failed radiation are reseeding with either HDR brachy or LDR brachy, cyberknife, HIFU or more commonly cryosurgery. Salvage surgery is rarely used due to it's morbidity, so it is unfair to compare salvage surgery when it is rarely used and never mention the other more common salvage treatments. These salvage treatments have the same effectiveness as salvage radiation after failed surgery at about 30%. The latest studies have shown that for intermediate grade cancer, G7, the most effective treatment is a combo Brachy/IMRT combined with a short course of HT, 6 months.",

      "Content": "J. It's normal to be scared; but the stats you posted are on your side. First a little about G6 cancers. They are not aggressive and rarely matastize. In 17,000 surgeries not one case of a matastized G6 was found. The death rate for untreated G6 cancers is less than 5% at 20 years and for treated G6 under 1%. Your first step should be to get your biopsy slides verfied by a pathologist specializing in PC. Either Jon Epstien at John Hopkins or Bostwick labs. Your doctor can arrange this through the lab. The bad news is that you have a nodule. It is important to learn from your doctor is the nodule cancerous or was it a calcium deposit. He should have biopsied the nodule. The nodule would indicate extracapsular extension if it was cancerous and would make a huge difference in your treatment options. With extra capsular extensions it is always better to do radiation rather than surgery as radiation has a much higher treatment margin into the prostate bed, about 10 to 15 mm. A surgical positive margin would mean salvage radiation after surgery adding to the probability of permanent side effects. For G6 cancers surgery has a cure rate of 85% vs about 95% for radiation, and this is entirely due to positive margins caused by extra capsular extensions. If the cancer is confirmed to be contained then surgery would be a good option, if not you should investigate the latest forms of radiation, IMRT or IGRT. In your case there is a question about the extracapsular extension and you should get several 2nd opinions before choosing a treatment. Definately see both a surgeon and a radiologist and they should have no connection to each other to avoid any conflict of interest. Also see a brachytherapist for his opinion as this option will have the least probability of side effects if appropriate for your situation. It may be well worth the money and effort to get an additional scan of the prostate only, either a multiparametric MRI or a Color Doppler Ultrasound to understand exactly how the nodule affects the margin. Without the nodule any option would be available to you including Active Survellience, but with the nodule you need to be very careful in making a treatment decision. JohnT Good luck JohnT",

Also if you go on The New Prostate Cancer Infolink and do a search for QOL or \"quality of life\" you will find many studies that compare the side effects of each treatment option. I admit that I'm biased toward brachy; long term cure rates are better and side effects are less. A one hour outpatient procedure compared to a major surgery with a few days hospital stay and weeks of recovery with the possibility of major complications. I had Brachy 3 1/2 years ago with a large 4+3 anterior tumor and a psa of 40. Went in for the procedure at 9am and was having lunch in a resturant at noon. I played a round of golf the next day. I had about 4 weeks of urinary frequency and urgency that did not affect work or daily activities. All psa's have been .1 since treatment. After 4 weeks I had no side effects and still have no side effects of any kind. My urinary functions are better than before treatment. There is always the possibility of ED with any treatment, but brachy has the lowest incident with ED at 35% and those being very effectivily treated with common meds. Bowel issues are rare and about 5% of patients have urinary strictures. The studies are very consistant in indicating that brachy patient indicate a much higher \"quality of life\" than other treatments. There are no garantees for any treatment, but long term cure rates across all gleason grades and lack of side effects favor Brachy. The biggest issue in favor of surgery is having a complete post op pathology. To me this information just has too high a price as most everyone uses a rising psa after surgery and not the post op pathology as a trigger for futher treatments. The common arguement that surgery gives you radiation as a backup just doesn't hold water. First brachy eliminates the major causes of surgical failure, extracapsular extension, nerve involvement and tumors in the Apex. This is why the initial cure rates are higher. There are also treatments for the rare brachy failures, reseeding with a different isotope, HDR Brachy, and cryosurgery. The most common reasons for failed Brachy, too low a dose and dead spots have all but been eliminated in the past 10 years through better imaging and better templets. JohnT",

The Sandlake scan uses nano particles which the lymphnodes absorb making much smaller cancers easier to identify. If you are suspected of having lymphnode involvement, its probably the best scan available, but not as good as the Combidex which was discontinued last year. The major benefit if less than 5 lymphnodes are found to have cancer is that they can be spot radiated and a cure can still be had.",

You have a high volume aggressive cancer and unless it can be confirmed contained with a very high probability, surgery may not be the best option. Brachy alone may also not be the best option as you must treat aggressive cancers very aggressively and that usually means some type of combination treatment. Brachy/IMRT combo will give a much higher radiation dose and wider margins than brachy alone. Also adding a course of Hormone therapy for at least 6 months to a year will also significantly improve the radiation's effectiveness and kill any stray cells that may already have escaped. JohnT",

There are other options such as combo Brachytherapy and IMRT which can treat the nerves and increase the probability of potancy over surgery. Cancer control is at least equal or slightly better than surgery. It is at least an option you should consider. I also had nerve involvement and have no ED at 3 years. This is a personal decision and your beliefs and values will usually dictate the treatment you choose more than any statistics. Men that fear cancer and believe that removing it will give the best chance of survival. Men that fear the side effects of surgery will more liikely choose radiation. JohnT",

      "Content": "Tim, You are probably pretty confused and scared at this point. As you learn more this will go away. First, be aware that 50% of the men your age have exactly what you have and most don't know it and never will. The difference is that you had a biopsy and it hit a small spot of cancer. Prostate cancer is really three different diseases with many subsets that makes it confusing. You have low risk pc, which means that you have a low risk of it ever developing into something that would harm you. Low risk is not zero risk. The best reference on low risk pc is \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr mark Scholz, a well know oncologist. You should also read \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Patrick Walsh for a surgical perspective. The first step would be to get your biopsy slides read by an expert pathologist, either Bostwick Labs or Jon Epstien at John Hopkins to confirm your Dx as a G6. The death rate for untreated G6s is about 5% after 20 years and just slightly lower for treated G6s. Most doctors would rate a 1 core G6 with a core of less than 50% and a psa less than 10 as \"very low risk\" and recommend Active Survelience. This means that you would check psa every 4 months and have a follow up biopsy in a year and you would only treat if the cancer shows signs of progression. In 70% of the cases it never progresses and if it does delayed treatment has the exact same results as immediate treatment. The other options are surgery, radiation and seeding. All of these have a very high cure rate for low risk cancer, but all come with high probabilities of side effects which include incontinence, ED and other complications. Your doctor should explain all these options to you and you should also get opinions from an experienced surgeon, radiologist and brachytherapist and a doctor that has experience in monitoring AS patients before making any decision. Remember you are an individual, but you can gain a lot of information by looking at how a very large cohort of men in the same situation have faired. Treatment for low risk PC extends life for only 1.6 months on the average as most men die from other causes, because low risk PC is very slow growing or may never grow at all. On the flip side, treatment will gain you a month or two, but comes at a price, 50% chance that you will have a side effect that will affect your quality of life for the next 20 or 30 years. Do your research well and choose the treatment option that you feel most comfortable with; but it is very important that you understand each option and its benefits and costs. You have time, many months, or even years so don't let anyone force you to make a quick decision. also go on other forums like YANA and HealingWell to see how other patients in your situation made out. Good luck in your journey; you should do quite well regardless of your choice. JohnT",

      "Content": "Tim, You are probably pretty confused and scared at this point. As you learn more this will go away. First, be aware that 50% of the men your age have exactly what you have and most don't know it and never will. The difference is that you had a biopsy and it hit a small spot of cancer. Prostate cancer is really three different diseases with many subsets that makes it confusing. You have low risk pc, which means that you have a low risk of it ever developing into something that would harm you. Low risk is not zero risk. The best reference on low risk pc is \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr mark Scholz, a well know oncologist. You should also read \"Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Patrick Walsh for a surgical perspective. The first step would be to get your biopsy slides read by an expert pathologist, either Bostwick Labs or Jon Epstien at John Hopkins to confirm your Dx as a G6. The death rate for untreated G6s is about 5% after 20 years and just slightly lower for treated G6s. Most doctors would rate a 1 core G6 with a core of less than 50% and a psa less than 10 as \"very low risk\" and recommend Active Survelience. This means that you would check psa every 4 months and have a follow up biopsy in a year and you would only treat if the cancer shows signs of progression. In 70% of the cases it never progresses and if it does delayed treatment has the exact same results as immediate treatment. The other options are surgery, radiation and seeding. All of these have a very high cure rate for low risk cancer, but all come with high probabilities of side effects which include incontinence, ED and other complications. Your doctor should explain all these options to you and you should also get opinions from an experienced surgeon, radiologist and brachytherapist and a doctor that has experience in monitoring AS patients before making any decision. Remember you are an individual, but you can gain a lot of information by looking at how a very large cohort of men in the same situation have faired. Treatment for low risk PC extends life for only 1.6 months on the average as most men die from other causes, because low risk PC is very slow growing or may never grow at all. On the flip side, treatment will gain you a month or two, but comes at a price, 50% chance that you will have a side effect that will affect your quality of life for the next 20 or 30 years. Do your research well and choose the treatment option that you feel most comfortable with; but it is very important that you understand each option and its benefits and costs. You have time, many months, or even years so don't let anyone force you to make a quick decision. also go on other forums like YANA and HealingWell to see how other patients in your situation made out. Good luck in your journey; you should do quite well regardless of your choice. JohnT",

I would immediately send your biopsy samples to either Bostwick Labs or Jon Epstien at John Hopkins for a 2nd opinion. All biopsies should always be reviewed by an expert pathologist before making any treatment decisions. Only pathologists assign a Gleason grade and this is based on what is seen under the microscope, not on any other factors. \"Minimal\" would pertain to a low risk G6; any G8 is aggressive and should not be treated \"minimally\". Your current stats indicate a high probability of a contained aggressive cancer and should be classified as high risk unless reversed by an expert pathologist in prostate cancer.",

      "Content": "Tony, You can most likely put off treatment for the rest of your life, so putting off treatment a few months would certaintly not hurt. You have what is considered low risk prostate cancer and depending on the size of your prostate may be in the \"very\" low risk catagory. Given your age and stats most doctors would recommend you just watch it and see what it does, before getting a treatment that could do more harm than good. \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr Mark Scholz is a good reference on low risk PC. John Hopkins, Sunny Brook, and UCSF all have programs on Active Surveillance and all data is pretty consistant, that only 30% of those participating in AS programs need treatment, and the data goes out to 12 years. When treated later, delayed treatment has similar results as immediate treatment. If your doctor has not discussed AS as an option I would recommend finding a doctor that has experience in AS and getting his opinion.",

You can also get a multiparametric MRI or a color Doppler to see if there is any extra capsular extensions visible or if the tumor is close to the nerves. Based on this you will have to decide if you wish to risk the probabilities of a surgical failure and subsequent salvage radiation stacking the odds of having permanent side effects. For a high volume intermediate grade cancer with a tumor in the Apex you should carefully investigate a combination of Brachy/IMRT with a short (6 month) course of HT (Casodex). This would give you the highest probability of success as the higher radiation dose will effect the large volume and the IMRT would extend into the prostate bed and handle any extracapsular extensions. The side effects would be much less than surgery followed by salvage radiation and most likely less than surgery alone. One misconception you have is about salvage radiation. If salvage radiation is able to cure a failed surgery, then it is close to 100% certainty that radiation would have been successful as a primary treatment. The local failure rate of of Brachy/IMRT is very rare and if a reoccurrance does occurr then the cancer is systemic and would not be cured by any primary treatment. The important point to take home is that surgery is a good option only if there is a high degree of certaintly that the cancer is contained and the nerve bundles are not affected. The nomograms will give your some idea of where you stand so you can make a more informed decision.",

If it is to shrink the prostate and to make radiation more effective, then Casodex and Proscar will work just as well with about 20% of the side effects of Lupron. If the purpose is to kill any micromets that may be present a longer course, 13 mos, including Lupron would be appropriate. With your low psa I assume that it is the former. I was on Casodex and Proscar for 3 months prior to treatment and 3 months after treatment. My psa has been a consistant 0.1 going on 4 years. Casodex caused some hot flashes, about 2 to 3 per day, lasting a few minutes. There was a complete loss of libido, but I could still get an errection. All of this disappeared in about 4-8 weeks after stopping the Casodex. My RO was recommending the same thing as yours, but my oncologist convinced him of the benefits of Casodex and Proscar only. It's also a lot less expensive than a shot of Lupron.",

It is also true that Walsh \"cherry picked\" his patients refusing to operate on any high risk patient or any patient that had any probability of extra capsular extension or anyone older than 70. Even with this his published results were only 85% for low risk patients. Scardino, arguably the best surgeon in the US, says that his \"trifecta\" rates are 64%, defined as cure, no complications, no ED and no incontinence. One can make a compelling arguement for any of the current conventional treatments and a patient's individual stats, tumor volume, grade, and tumor location will dictate the best individual treatment for that individual. The skill of the doctor he chooses will have a greater effect on his outcome that the treatment modality. Perhaps we should have \"gold doctors\" rather than a \"gold standard\".",

      "Content": "Hi Blank, This should give you some better data on treatment options as it summarizes over 800 peer reviewed published studies comparing all treatment options by risk classification, and was reviewed by the top 25 prostate cancer specalists from all fields, surgery, radiation, pathology and oncology. http://prostate-cancer.org/PDFs/Is14-2_p3-11.pdf You have a misconception about salvage radiation. The only reason that salvage radiation works is that the surgery was poorly performed or that it had already penetrated the capsul. Prostate tissue is always left behind at surgery and some of this tissue can contain cancerous cells. Also the rates of positive margins among surgeons differ greatly. At MKS the rates are 11% for the best and 48% for the worst with the average being 23%. If salvage radiation could kill the remaining cancer, it would have killed it as a primary treatment. There are also salvage treatments for failed radiation which are rarely mentioned by doctors, as they always bring up the morbidity of salvage surgery without mentioning the more common salvage treatments like brachytherapy, both low and high dose, cyberknife and cryosurgery. Surgery is rarely used as a salvage treatment, yet it is always mentioned without mentioning the other more common treatments. It is always wise to get opinions from surgeons, radiologists and brachytherapists before making a final decision so you can weigh all options and evaluate any misinformation that may be given about one treatment option. In reviewing the various forums over the past 4 years it seems that the \"seed guys\" do far better with side effects and cancer control than all the other options and the study linked above confirms that observation. Good luck, JohnT Good luck.",

With one core suspicious even if you were Dxed it would most likely be a very low grade PC. If psa rises or PCA3 goes over 35 then I would definately reconsider. You can also get a Color Doppler Ultrasound just to be sure.",

      "Content": "The HDR procedure is approximately two visits vs 45 for Proton. In every published study conducted there was no advantage to Proton vs conventional external radiation in terms of side effects or cure rate. Brachytherapy, both low and HDR have the highest cure rates across all gleason grades (Google the Prostate Cancer Study Group Results for a comparision of cure rates across all risk catagories as it summarizes over 800 peer reviewed studies). HDR will have more short term side effects, urinary frequency and urgency, but less long term side effects such as bowel issues. You can go to the \"New Prostate Cancer Infolink\" and do a search on Proton to see all of the most recent study data to separate the advocacy hype from the real numbers. There is probably little difference in LDR and HDR in terms of both cure and long range side effects, so don't eliminate this option in your research. You can't go wrong at UCLA with Jeff Dermains, and I would always go with the most skilled doctor as that is much more important than the treatment option you choose, in regards to both cancer control and SEs.

      "Content": "LL. Brachy/IMRT combo is a superior treatment especially when dealing with a high probability of extra capsualar exension and tumors in the apex, as surgery has a difficult time dealing with these particular issues. Regarding HT: Since you are taking only a short course an option would be to use Casodex only as for this situation it would be as effective as Lupron, but with only 20% of the side effects. My RO also suggested Lupron, but my more experienced oncologist convinced him that Casodex only was more appropriate in this situation. I had seeds/ brachy and 9 months of Casodex; three months before treatment and for three months after treatment to keep the prostate stable. The side effects from HT, loss of libido and hot flashes completely disappeared within a few weeks after stopping. The side effects of Brachy/ImRT were about 4 weeks of urinary frequency and urgency that did not affect any daily activities. I have no ED or any other side effects at 4 years and my psa of 40 has been at 0.1 since treatment. I have always had an issue using the term \"gold standard\" to describe any prostate cancer treatment, especially surgery as it is very misleading to patients. How can we identify something as a \"gold standard\" that has less than a 70% chance of curing the intermediate and higher grade cancers that are the ones most likely to harm us, while causing permanant side effects in about 50% of patients. If this is a \"gold standard\" then the bar is being set really low. Until we can get cure rates into the 90% and eliminate side effects due to treatment there is no \"gold standard\" The \"gold standard\" term was used about 25 years ago when options like radiation, AS, focal therapy and brachy were not very sofisticated. Radiation has come a long way technologically since then with higher doses being delivered more accurrately and newer imaging and templets making Brachy much more effective to the point that these treatments have now surpassed surgery in both effectiveness and probability of side effects. If we were to name a treatment as \"the gold standard\" today, the closest would be AS for low risk patients, as it has similar survival rates as all the other treatments while incurring zero side effects.

      "Content": "Newporter, My point exactly. I don't think there is a gold standard yet in PC treatments and to use the term today is misleading. It is also true that Walsh \"cherry picked\" his patients refusing to operate on any high risk patient or any patient that had any probability of extra capsular extension or anyone older than 70. Even with this his published results were only 85% for low risk patients. Scardino, arguably the best surgeon in the US, says that his \"trifecta\" rates are 64%, defined as cure, no complications, no ED and no incontinence. One can make a compelling arguement for any of the current conventional treatments and a patient's individual stats, tumor volume, grade, and tumor location will dictate the best individual treatment for that individual. The skill of the doctor he chooses will have a greater effect on his outcome that the treatment modality. Perhaps we should have \"gold doctors\" rather than a \"gold standard\".",

The only reason that salvage radiation works is that the surgery was poorly performed or that it had already penetrated the capsul. Prostate tissue is always left behind at surgery and some of this tissue can contain cancerous cells. Also the rates of positive margins among surgeons differ greatly. At MKS the rates are 11% for the best and 48% for the worst with the average being 23%. If salvage radiation could kill the remaining cancer, it would have killed it as a primary treatment. There are also salvage treatments for failed radiation which are rarely mentioned by doctors, as they always bring up the morbidity of salvage surgery without mentioning the more common salvage treatments like brachytherapy, both low and high dose, cyberknife and cryosurgery. Surgery is rarely used as a salvage treatment, yet it is always mentioned without mentioning the other more common treatments. It is always wise to get opinions from surgeons, radiologists and brachytherapists before making a final decision so you can weigh all options and evaluate any misinformation that may be given about one treatment option.

Surgery is rarely used as a salvage treatment, yet it is always mentioned without mentioning the other more common treatments. It is always wise to get opinions from surgeons, radiologists and brachytherapists before making a final decision so you can weigh all options and evaluate any misinformation that may be given about one treatment option.

      "Content": "Chief, As other have mentioned the extracapsular extensions are a red flag, but also is the involvement of the nerve bundles. I would carefully question the surgeon on how he plans to deal with these issues in particular. You do not want to be undergoing both surgery and clean up radiation, especially at your age. If the nerves are involved your best chance of preserving your potency is radiation, a combo brachy/IMRT being the best. The Nerve bundles will survive radiation in most cases, but if they are removed by surgery impotance is just about garanteed. The radiaion can also take care of the extra capsular extensions as the margins are far greated than what can be achieved with surgery. In any event you should get an opinion from both an experienced surgeon and radiologist, meaning that they have a minimum of 250 procedures for pc under their belt.",

      "Content": "Kevin, Sorry for the bad news. With a G9 and a psa of 31 it is highly indicative that your high psa is being generated by cancer outside the prostate gland even if the CT and bone scans come up clear. You should definately get a PAP test as it is the best indicator of a local failure. Since there is a very high probability that any local treatment will fail I would find the best prostate oncologist in your area for a second opinion (A list of oncologists can be found in the appendix of \"Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr Mark Scholz.) I would also read \"Primer on Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Stephen Strum in order to understand the biology of what you have. At this point you need much more than a surgeon's perspective on the disease. With your high psa and gleason it is highly recommended that Hormone therapy be added to any local treatment. Surgery would only be able to debulk the tumor and will not result in a cure, so you need a very aggressive combination treatment that targets both the tumor, lymphnodes and any cells still in the blood stream. this is beyond the skill level of of surgeons and radiologists and you need the best medical oncologist specializing in PC on your team from the very start. Good luck. JohnT",

Three consecutive rises in psa after SRT is an indication of failure. At this point I would be consulting with a medical oncologist that specializes in Prostate cancer for his recommendations. There are late studies that show that by adding a short course (6 months of HT) along with radiation added a significant benefit to G7 patients.",

      "Content": "KLA, If your doc said it was low grade then it was a G5. Follow the advice given to you and get your slides reread. A G5 should be monitored and not treated. \"Read Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr Mark Scholz as it is the best reference on low risk cancer. The Gleason grade is made up of 2 numbers added together. The the 1st number represents the majority, 51%, of the type of cells and the second number indicates the second most type of cell. They are given a grade from 1-5 and these numbers are added together for the the Gleason score. About 15 years ago pathologists decided to not report anything under a G6 as this was considered indolant. There is still an argument whether to call this cancer or not. G6 is low risk cancer, highly cureable and rarely causes death, G7 is intermediate risk and should be treated if you have more than 10 years of life expectancy. G8 and above are high risk and are very aggressive and dangerous and should be treated. Tumors have built in DNA and rarely progresss from their initial grade. It is pretty well established that G5s should be monitored and not treated. I would search out a doctor that is familiar with monitoring Active Survelience patients. The word \"cancer\" had a psychological impact, which you are currently experiencing. There are many doctors try to change the name of the type of cells you have to something other than cancer as it they do not act like a normal cancer and are mostly harmless. What it does show is that you have a predisposition to prostate cancer and must be carefully monitored to insure that higher grade tumors do not grow in the future.",

An agresssive cancer, coupled with a very high tumor volume such as your partner had, has a very high chance of already being out of the prostate when it was discovered. The Partin tables or any of the nomograms would have pointed this out as would a simple PAP test. His doctors clearly did not do enough testing before his surgery. Hormone therapy is a good method to control his cancer and can work for many years.",

      "Content": "At 40 and with a high volume of cancer, treatment is recommended. First have his biopsy slides confirmed by an expert pathologist like Bostwick labs, or Epstien at Hopkins or Jon Oppenhiemer to insure you are not dealing with a higher grade cancer. For G6 cancers any of the conventional options will work at a very high rate of cure approaching 90% and if confirmed to be contained close to 99%. Surgery is often recommended for younger men as they have a better opportunity to heal, but there is no evidence proving surgery for younger men is better than any of the other options that may provide a better chance of having less permanant side effects than surgery. Other options are Brachytherapy, External radiation and Cyberknife and all of these options should be researched before you make a final decision. Talk to an experienced Brachytherapist as this option has a long track record for excellent cure rates combined with minimal side effects. Before any decision on surgery some type of imaging should be done like color doppler ultrasound, MRIS or multiparametic MRI to insure that any surgery would have a high probability of success. Conditions identified on scans such as apex tumors, tumors involving the nerve bundles or seminal vessicles or any extra capsular extensions would have a high probability of surgical failure and radiation would be a much better option as it treats all of these areas.",

Three consecutive rises in psa after SRT is an indication of failure. At this point I would be consulting with a medical oncologist that specializes in Prostate cancer for his recommendations. There are late studies that show that by adding a short course (6 months of HT) along with radiation added a significant benefit to G7 patients.",

      "Content": "KLA, If your doc said it was low grade then it was a G5. Follow the advice given to you and get your slides reread. A G5 should be monitored and not treated. \"Read Invasion of the Prostate Snatchers\" by Dr Mark Scholz as it is the best reference on low risk cancer. The Gleason grade is made up of 2 numbers added together. The the 1st number represents the majority, 51%, of the type of cells and the second number indicates the second most type of cell. They are given a grade from 1-5 and these numbers are added together for the the Gleason score. About 15 years ago pathologists decided to not report anything under a G6 as this was considered indolant. There is still an argument whether to call this cancer or not. G6 is low risk cancer, highly cureable and rarely causes death, G7 is intermediate risk and should be treated if you have more than 10 years of life expectancy. G8 and above are high risk and are very aggressive and dangerous and should be treated. Tumors have built in DNA and rarely progresss from their initial grade. It is pretty well established that G5s should be monitored and not treated. I would search out a doctor that is familiar with monitoring Active Survelience patients. The word \"cancer\" had a psychological impact, which you are currently experiencing. There are many doctors try to change the name of the type of cells you have to something other than cancer as it they do not act like a normal cancer and are mostly harmless. What it does show is that you have a predisposition to prostate cancer and must be carefully monitored to insure that higher grade tumors do not grow in the future.",

      "Content": "Every major pathologist and oncologist recommends AS for low risk patients. Some major surgeons like Walsh and Scardino have come around to this option in the recent years and are now recommending it. There are still a lot of doctors, mainly urologists, that are still living in the 1990s, where every cancer should be detected early and treated. There are three main types of prostate cancer and a whole bunch of sub catagories. Low risk PC, means exactly that; there is a very low risk of the PC ever causing a problem in one's lifetime. This is because its DNA makeup causes it to grow very slowly and makes it difficult to live outside of the prostate. Death from a G6 is very rare and in 17,000 surgeries not one case of a G6 matastizing was ever found. If a cancer cannot matastize then it cannot kill you. This is why delayed treatment for low risk PC has the exact same results as immediate treatment in every study conducted. Low risk doesn't mean no risk; that's why there is \"ACTIVE\" in AS. It means that you monitor the situation and treat when there is a reason to treat, like a fast rising psa or a higher grade in a follow up biopsy. These occur in about 30% of the patients, mainly because the initial biopsy missed a higher grade cancer, so a follow up biopsy within a year is necessary and psa tests at least quarterly are required. The vast majority of progressions are identified within three years. There is excellent data on AS going out 15 years and this data is changing a lot of doctors minds of how to treat this version of PC. Find a doctor that is experienced in AS and you will avoid many of the side effects that plague PC patients.",

He has a very strict AS protocol that he outlines, and I would use that as a starting point in your discussions with doctors. You can also go on HealingWell prostate cancer forum as there are currently several active threads on AS and a few members actively paracticing it. Also on YANO you can see the stories of men who have tried AS. At a minimum your doctor should insist on psa tests quarterly and a repeat biopsy within a year. Futher biopsies could be substituted with a Color Doppler Ultra sound. I applaud your decision to go on AS as it is effective and safe for men with low risk stats as long as it is monitored properly. Even if you have to be treated at a later point you will have the same results as being treated immediately as every study has shown. You can also google Dr Lawrence Klotz as he has been the longest runnnning researcher on AS and has published many atricles on it. Also google UCSF AS program Diet and you will find that their AS program which included diet change, mediation and support has a 100% non progression rate as compared to a control group with the 30% progression rate that is normal.

With a high volume cancer the probabilities increase that extracapsular extensions, seminal vessicle invasion, or nerve involvement are present. At this point it would be wise to get a multiparametric MRI or an MRIS to better understand the extent of the cancer in the prostate so you can make a more informed decision about your treatment options. Since you are young surgery would be a good option only if the MRIs confirm that the cancer is contained and not in the seminal vessicles or the nerve bundles or the Apex. If any of these factors are present then surgery will have a very high probability of failure and may not be your best option. In this case a combination treatment of Brachytherapy and IMRT combined with a short (6 month) course of hormone therapy has proven very effective for high volume intermediate grade cancers. JohnT",
