      "Content": "Folks...would appreciate some advice. I am 62. Dx with PC in Nov 2014. 4/12 cores pos. Gleason 3+3 with PTI 10% in each. Small volume, low grade. Urologist recommends prostectomy first, radiation if I was opposed to removal. Felt because life expectancy >10 yrs, active surveillance not viable option. Radiation seeds not option either due to previous TURP for severe BPH. Saw rad oncologist who thought removal best option but high probability of success with radiation likely too. Agreed active surveillance not best choice at 62. Saw 2nd urological surgeon who felt risks of complications from removal too high given low grade and low volume cancer. Referred back to rad onco. Went to world-class cancer center in Boston for second opinion. They did pathological consult on 12 cores taken previously and agreed with earlier dx exactly. Ordered MRI guided coil biopsy. Results showed more \"microscopic cancer cell clusters\" in addition to slides but no well defined tumors. Organ confined only. Low grade, slow growing. They recommended active surveillance, PSAs retested every 4-6 months, biopsy every year unless PSAs rising. First PSA test (that started this whole matter in first place) was 5.1 Boston center retested and was at 5.3, 3 months later. Summary...urologist and rad onco thought removal best choice. 2nd urologist thought radiation best choice. Neither thought active surveillance viable option due to age. Boston center says active surveillance is best option since cancer is low grade. I would guess that since cancer is still early stage and organ confined at moment i might have greatest chance at complete \"cure\" before defined tumor develops with radiation. This is driving me nuts! Any thoughts would be most appreciated. Many blessings to all!",

But nothing compares to those who have \"been there, done that\". As I mentioned to Otago (not \"Octago\" as I wrote...my apologies Otago) seems the recommendation regarding AS might not in fact be the best advice but I do think I will give it some time to clear all the confusion up. Leaning towards radiation when time comes. To end my response with a bit of gallows humor myself, I was diagnosed with PC on Nov. 25, 2014. Sadly, my mother-in-law died of pancreatic cancer on the 16th just 9 days earlier. When friends and acquaintances heard of my cancer plight their first and immediate response was to express their sympathies for \"my poor wife\". I had the cancer but they felt bad for her! I took no offense I assure you as I understood where they were coming from. I plan to be an active participant in this forum and consider myself quite lucky, despite it all, that it is a resource available to me. Many blessings to you/yours. Wayne Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Wayne, Welcome to the forum. I would tend to go with the first doctors you saw -- either go with radiation or surgery. The general rule of thumb for active surveillance is to not have more than two positive cores. So, with four of 'em, I would say that a treatment option should be considered. If it truly is a Gleason 6, you should do fine after treatment because this is a low risk type of prostate cancer. The trick is whether or not this is ALL the cancer in your prostate, or could the biopsy have missed other tumors that are in there. This happens with about 20% of standard biopsies. If the first radiation oncologist recommended surgery, I would give that some thought because they would normally recommend their own specialty. So you had a very good rad oncologist who was giving an honest appraisal of the best course of action. This doctor may have made the surgery recommendation because of your previous BPH problems. The rad oncologist I consulted with at Mayo Clinic said the same thing because of my extreme BPH. He said that radiation or surgery could cure my low-risk case of cancer, but that only surgery could put an end to the BPH problems I was having. So I would tend to suggest that you consider a treatment option instead of AS. Once you've settled this in you mind, you can then do research on external beam radiation and surgery to make a decision you are comfortable with. If it helps to know this, my urination was in dribbles and a spray fine enough to make my garden hose nozzle jealous. Now, after the surgery, the nozzle is still jealous, but for a different reason -- because of the firehose stream that has replaced the spray. Putting the humor aside, I could not be happier with my choice of surgery because my urination problems are long gone. Chuck",

      "Content": "Folks: been here before (I'm the one with the RN wife who is vehemently opposed to trusting \"Western Medicine\" more than prayer and homeopathic treatments!). By way of brief background, was dx in Nov, 2014 At age 61. 4 of 12 cores positive, Gleason 3+3 (3), 3 + 4 (1). Urologist referred to rad oncologist who wanted to start me on Lupon for 4 months followed by 8 weeks radiation. PSAs at time of dx 5.3. F/u with urologist in Feb '15 and PSAs rose to 7.3 in just 3 months. He and Family phys encouraged radiation ASAP due to rapid rise in PSAs in short order. Wife strongly opposed to ADT and made arrangements for 2nd opinion at Dana Farber Cancer Center in Boston. Appt in early March. Did consult pathological review of previous 12 samples and concurred with originally dx across board. Radiation oncologist at DF ordered coil guided/assisted MRI and took another PSA which dropped from 7.3 to 5.2 one month later. MRI saw \"two suspicious areas\" including where biopsy already confirmed cancer and a second in mid zone. However, MRI did not suggest presence of high grade tumor and DF recommended AS which was inconsistent with EVERYONE else's opinion including several of you good folks here on this forum. Part of reasoning for AS recommendation by DF included precipitous drop in PSAs in short order. Wife in ecstasy over news insisting I am cured and of course should \"praise Jesus\". In her opinion should be end of story. Saw urologist Monday who took yet another PSA and lo' and behold numbers back up to 7.1 since March. Since I doubted but did not know for sure that perhaps sexual activity may have inflated the PSA numbers the first time they jumped from 5.3 to 7.3 then down again, I deliberately refrained from sex for days before the most recent 2 pt rise. There is no infection an no BPH. In fact, DF had performed a DRE on me 1/2 hr before blood draw and yet stilled dropped. Anyone have any thoughts as to what the hell may be going on here. I am still on AS but family is very concerned and encouraging me to do something...now! DF is world-class but I think they got it wrong here. Many blessings to all! Wayne.",

      "Content": "Incredibly well said Chuck! Now I understand why you are the moderator! I have in fact decided to go for treatment, with or without her support. I will see my family physician next Weds (who is a fiesty old battle ax and will NOT be at all happy I have not done anything yet! I will assume he will want to confirm recent PSA results then. If they are in the 7+ range again, which I would suspect, I will arrange for radiation (original plan A) right away. No more pussy-footing around to avoid confrontation with me wife. On a personal side note Chuck, my Mom is besides herself about this. She is 87 and we lost my father a little more than 15 yrs ago suddenly and unexpectedly. My Dad was a survivor of the infamous Bataan Death March during WWII and spent 42 months in Japanese prison camps once he made it through the March (half did not). Once WWII ended, he remained in the army and saw combat in both Korea and Vietnam as well. I was his only son and as the only male figure head left in the family my Mom is so concerned she may outlive me and that would do her in for sure. So it is not only my life my foot dragging is at risk it is hers too. My Mom is convinced my Dad suffered enough for both he and I and for her only son to face this is very dispiriting to her to say the least. It has finally dawned on me, thanks to you andmany other folks on this forum, that this has to be done for me, her, and him...God rest his soul. Thanks again, Chuck, for your compassionate and quick response. Wayne.",

      "Content": "Folks: been approx 1 year sinace last post. You were all great...more help than Drs were. Could use some advice again. Thanks in advance. Summary: dx in 2014 with stage 2 PC. Was 61 at time (was dx just 9 days after my mother-in-law died of pancreatic cancer!). 4 of 12 cores positive, 1 core \"suspicious\". Gleason 3 at 3+3, 1 at 3+4. PSA at time of dx 7.5 but was rising gradually for a few years. Urologist recommended treatment ASAP. Referred to rad oncologist who wanted to start me on ADT for 4 months followed by IMRT. Wife...an RN...was vehemently opposed to ADT. Went to Dana Farber in Boston. Recommended DaVinci surgery. After much thought I declined surgery due to catheter (already need CPAP mask for severe sleep apnea. Couldn't be tethered to anything else!). Then DF recommended active surveillance. NO ONE on this forum...or anywhere else for that matter...suggested AS as an option. As good as DF is they got it wrong here. Due to many recommendations and conflicts I did nothing for 10 months. Decided to go IMRT route in Sept 2015. Had rad 5 days/week for 9 weeks. Treatment ended Nov 8th 2015. Saw urologist on 2/12 for 3 month follow-up. He decided to test PSA even though he thought putting any stock in results 3 months after treatment would perhaps be \"premature\". Wanted to get sense as to how PSAs were behaving before 6 month fu in May. Said ideally PSAs should be less than 1 if cancer is gone but not too worry at this time. Results were 3.54. Said if PSAs are same or higher at 6 month fu then we will need to consider other treatment options at that time. More radiation is out due to amount received in 2015. Seeds out due to TURP surgery for BPH in 2007. DaVinci likely out due to catheterization though I could change mind if it becomes matter of life or death. Not sure what to make of current PSA reading. Is this an ominous sign? Anyone have thoughts as to what I might expect at 6 month fu? Any experience similar to this? May be jumping gun a bit but I am keeping current PSA readings from family...including my 90 yr old mother...based on Drs recommendation that I not worry. I am grateful for any feedback as always.",

      "Content": "Friends...posted a few times and responses were great and overwhelming in your counsel. Best source of unbiased help and information and I am grateful to all of you! As I have mentioned previously, I am being bombarded with recommendations that span the gambit. I have PCa, 4/12 cores positive, 10% PTI (small volume), Gleason score for 3, 3+3 and the forth 3+4. Initially, urologist recommended DaVinci surgery and made arrangements for me to see a surgeon and RO. Surgeon thought cancer was too early stage to risk complications (at time, Nov 2014) and sent me back to RO. Wife, a devout Christian, believes trusting in man instead of God is anti-biblical and would doom me. She insists on natural medicine and prayer. As compromise, she agreed to accompany me to Dana Faber Cancer Institute in Boston given world-class status of DF. I live approx 45 miles outside of Boston so visit was one of convenience. RO at DF ordered a MRI guided coil biopsy and conducted a pathological consult of previously collected 12 cores. Results were EXACTLY the same with respect to 4 positive, % PTI, and Gleason. However, MRI did NOT show ANY well defined tumors only area with positive cores \"hyper enhanced\" as well as a second area suggesting microscopic cancer cell clusters developing there. RO was so ecstatic over results I though she was going to arrange for a ticker tape parade! That was all my Jesus-touting wife needed to hear so now I am \"cured\". RO recommended AS with PSAs checked every 4-6 months and biopsy every year. This recommendation was totally inconsistent with EVERYTHING I have read, as well as inconsistent with the sound advice I received from all of you who responded to my earlier posts, AND my urologist who thinks 4/12 cores suggest cancer already progressing as well as my age, 62, being a bit too young for AS. Suggests the risk too high and need, at minimum, radiation. So, wanted to advise that there is a now another option available for all us PCa sufferers and that is Inactive Surveillance which is where I am now. Total limbo and I haven't a clue where to go from here. No matter which option I choose, I will face criticism for doing more than was needed or doing nothing at all. I sure hope all you good people never have to face a life-altering delemma like this as we have plenty else to deal with once we get that dreaded diagnosis! I will post again at a later date. God bless all! Wayne",

      "Content": "Friends...posted a few times and responses were great and overwhelming in your counsel. Best source of unbiased help and information and I am grateful to all of you! As I have mentioned previously, I am being bombarded with recommendations that span the gambit. I have PCa, 4/12 cores positive, 10% PTI (small volume), Gleason score for 3, 3+3 and the forth 3+4. Initially, urologist recommended DaVinci surgery and made arrangements for me to see a surgeon and RO. Surgeon thought cancer was too early stage to risk complications (at time, Nov 2014) and sent me back to RO. Wife, a devout Christian, believes trusting in man instead of God is anti-biblical and would doom me. She insists on natural medicine and prayer. As compromise, she agreed to accompany me to Dana Faber Cancer Institute in Boston given world-class status of DF. I live approx 45 miles outside of Boston so visit was one of convenience. RO at DF ordered a MRI guided coil biopsy and conducted a pathological consult of previously collected 12 cores. Results were EXACTLY the same with respect to 4 positive, % PTI, and Gleason. However, MRI did NOT show ANY well defined tumors only area with positive cores \"hyper enhanced\" as well as a second area suggesting microscopic cancer cell clusters developing there. RO was so ecstatic over results I though she was going to arrange for a ticker tape parade! That was all my Jesus-touting wife needed to hear so now I am \"cured\". RO recommended AS with PSAs checked every 4-6 months and biopsy every year. This recommendation was totally inconsistent with EVERYTHING I have read, as well as inconsistent with the sound advice I received from all of you who responded to my earlier posts, AND my urologist who thinks 4/12 cores suggest cancer already progressing as well as my age, 62, being a bit too young for AS. Suggests the risk too high and need, at minimum, radiation. So, wanted to advise that there is a now another option available for all us PCa sufferers and that is Inactive Surveillance which is where I am now. Total limbo and I haven't a clue where to go from here. No matter which option I choose, I will face criticism for doing more than was needed or doing nothing at all. I sure hope all you good people never have to face a life-altering delemma like this as we have plenty else to deal with once we get that dreaded diagnosis! I will post again at a later date.

      "Content": "Would love to respond to all of you personally but message would be the same. A thousand times thanks for VERY meaningful comments to each. I will be seeing my urologist in early June and if PSAs are up or even the same (as I would expect) I will move to treatment likely radiation. Can't imagine how difficult this whole matter is with so many \"recommendations\" from all angles including wife's. Bless you all! Btw to fill in the blanks Chuck...yes DF reviewed the same slides my urologist collected at the physical biopsy and came up with the same Dx. 4/12 pos 3 had Gleason of 3+3 and 1 had 3+4. As mentioned MRI shows a second area \"suspicious\" but no well defined solid mass found. I'll be on board this forum often as you folks are much more helpful to me than my own wife! Wayne.",

      "Content": "Help! Posted before and got much great advice from all! Thanks in advance. Dx in Nov 2014. 4/12 cores pos. 10% PTI each. Went to Dana Farber in Boston for 2nd opinion since I live close. DF did pathological consult review of previous cores and concurred fully...4/12 pos 10% PTI followed with MRI guided coil biopsy. Small volume early stage. MRI showed 2 suspicious regions including area where 4 cores came back positive, but could not see with any certainty ANY well-defined tumors. Called both areas \"microscopic cancer clusters\" and recommended AS. First urologist who did biopsy disagrees with AS. Said that 4 of 12 cores pos suggests cancer \"already on move\" but agrees slowly...for now. Wants either DaVinci surg or radiation. Wife, a devout Christian (AND an RN by the way) wants AS because \"God Has already healed me!\". So, what the hell are \"microscopic cancer clusters\"? Rad onco at DF said even more cancer areas found but it is as if there was nothing there.\" All it did was confuse matters since in my wife's mind just confirmation of God's involvement. Urologist insist he is not surprised at \"cancer clusters\" Dx since cores showed no more than 10% cancer. But vehemently disagrees with \"as if nothing is there\" comment. Any comments either way would be appreciated. I am 62 (61 at Dx). Organ confined. PSA at last check 5.3.",
