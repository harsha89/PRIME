      "Content": "Starting to do my research, (a little late) and putting together questions for my next visit, one question is, MRI is it a DCE-MRI or just an MRI, its scheduled for 12-20. Have done a lot of reading on DCE-MRI its newer and not all cancer centers have it in use, but the upside to using DCE-MRI is pin pointing cancer cells. Did ask for a genetic testing to be done on the blind biopsy. Its to late to ask the doctor now but I would like to see what he has to say about why in 2017 are we still doing blind testing biopsy and not using DCE-MRI first to pinpoint where \"if\" any cancer is. Would seem better to do 4-5 pin point needle test than 14 blind test and hope you got lucky and found all the cancer. There maybe a really good reason it's done this way, but to me it seem backwards. If anyone out there who is getting ready to see the Doctor because of high PSA score ask that question. If anyone on this forum has already asked this question, or done pin point biopsy might be helpful to guys just getting started with the process. Having 3+4 reading takes me out of the low risk treatments, so need to focus on what type of long term treatment I need. For guys just getting started with this process ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS, do lots of research there is tons of info out there on the net, and in excellent forums like this one. Take someone into the Doc room with you trust me your mind will only catch and retain 5% of what is being said, thanks to my wife she was able to ask all the right question because I went blank. Write down your questions ahead of time, If your Doc gets pissy about answering your question find another doctor. More research, you have time. and good luck. check out link Prostatecaluater.net. Will update after 12/20. MRI and visit with Oncologist, radiologist",

      "Content": "We are home resting 8/10, six holes in the tummy, never thought it could feel so good to pass gas, wow. After passing gas eased most of my pain, got some sleep last night. Following Doc instruction on meds and fluids. Walking no problem. Doc said it went well, found one vain that flows to the base of penis that he has never seen before, had to cut it because it was in the wrong place, or something like that, might be an issue with getting blood to one side of the penis. Was able to save nerves but they were what he called \"sticky\" and had to put a little more effort then usual to get them free. I am sure the nerves are not happy. 8/12 Had BM today, good grief needed that, felt a whole lot better, walk, walk, walk really helps. Have cut back on my pain meds, might not be the best move but the brain was in overload, I think every bad dream I had in life came back, not letting me sleep. Not having any real pain I can't manage. Have a sharp pain I upper left chest when I use the Airlife, after a few inhales pain goes away, think I have trapped gas up there. Eating light lots of fruit and veg's drinking lots of water and prune juice, things are moving in the right direction. will relax and walk the rest of the week, wife is waiting on me hand and foot, bless her hart, going to owe her big time. Post after Friday 19th hoping for the best path report.",

      "Content": "11\\15 Saw oncologist today, I asked him about the stones and he showed me in my pathology report that most of my cores showed chronic inflammation, which is the Calcification. Calcification which is a foreign body in the prostate will cause the inflammation and can raise your PSA. The jury is still out whether or not calcification is a cause or factor for prostate cancer. At this time I have no issue with my prostate other than slow stream, no pain. Doc ordered MRI 12/20, give time for prostate to heal from biopsy (by the way biopsy was painless except for the two antibiotic shot in the cheeks pre-test) Will meet with radiologist same day of MRI and surgeon the next week and go over options. In the mean time I will be researching all the different options. Also asked that the Doctor send my lab off for genetic testing. Going to enjoy the Holiday.",

      "Content": "Has anyone used a Cunningham clamp after surgery? Any positive or negative comments on the use of the clamp. Using UltraFlex external catheter with small leg bag, like it a lot better than pads. Has its drawbacks, wear compression pants over the bag, helps cover the bag when wearing shorts and holds everything in place. Looks a little strange but better than seeing bag hanging out the bottom of the shorts. I use one UltraFlex per day put it on in the morning and remove it at night when taking a shower. Use a pad in underwear at night, so far dry all night long. Would like to use the Cunningham clamp when going out, less bulk under pants. would be useful after shower. Have read that it should not be worn at night and to remove every 2 hours to pee. Three weeks out of surgery, dribble when I stand and walk, getting better each day. ??",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate The text and the signature do not match up. Was the signature showing G (3+4) lesions taken previously, and the text from a more recent biopsy? Looking at the text, I would not worry about prostate cancer. But, the data in your signature describes a low intermediate case that probably requires some type of treatment. Had an MRI today this text was the report from the MRI, have not talked to a Doctor yet seems they all are on vacation, Will see two end of the month. The signature shows my biopsy report done in Oct which was a 3+4=7",

Moderate to large volume of periprostatic venous plexus system is noted. Hemorrhage: None. Benign prostatic hypertrophy: There is mild hypertrophic changes. Prostate Lesions: 1. There is diffuse T2 hypointense appearance of the prostate gland. Within the peripheral zone, there are patchy areas of T2 hypointensity, although these lesions do not demonstrate DWI hyperintensity. No focal restricted diffusion is identified. These lesions also demonstrate gradual postcontrast enhancement with a type I curve. Given the appearance, these lesions are likely to be of PIRADS 2 lesion. Extra-prostatic extension (EPE): None Neurovascular bundle invasion (NVI): None Seminal vesicle invasion (SVI): None IMPRESSION: 1. Diffuse T2 hypointense appearance the prostate gland with patchy areas of peripheral T2 hypointense lesion have characteristics consistent with PIRADS 2 lesion. 2. No evidence of extracapsular extension, neurovascular bundle invasion, or seminal vesicle involvement.",

Following Doc instruction on meds and fluids. Walking no problem. Doc said it went well, found one vain that flows to the base of penis that he has never seen before, had to cut it because it was in the wrong place, or something like that, might be an issue with getting blood to one side of the penis. Was able to save nerves but they were what he called sticky and had to put a little more effort then usual to get them free. Have follow up Friday see what the pathology says. Hi to all; 24 hours from now I will be on the table with a robot digging around my insides, Its been a long haul from diagnose to treatment, the date is finally here. Wife and I feel confindent that we have got the post-opt issues worked out, supplies and meds. The team at M D Anderson Banner Gilbert, AZ have been the best, 5 star service, never recommended one treatment over the other, ask that we spend time reviewing all the options available, not only at Banner but at the other major cancer treatment facilities, which we did, learned a lot. The one thing that impressed me when visiting the Doctors was when asked what Doctor I was seeing at Banner they all knew DR. Mashni and gave him high marks, some even said if they were having surgery they would see him. The down time is going to be the biggest issue for me, I have never been down for more than a week at a time, very active life, workout 4 times a week. Always dong something to keep active. Have a supply of books to read and there is always Netflix. The not lifting over 10 pounds, ouch! Wife will be following me around like a hawk, don't do that, don't touch that, don't even think about picking that up! Thanks to my wonderful wife for all her support, she knows what I am going through having been diagnosed with Scleroderma 18 years ago being told she had less than 5 years and beating it, there is no quit in her. I am glad that I found this forum, its been a big help on this strange and unfamiliar road, thanks to all that give your support and advice. To all that are newly diagnosed, hang in there, research everything you can, find a cure that you can live with and never look back, cancer will change your life, accept it, kick its ass and move on. See you all on the other side.",
