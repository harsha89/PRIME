    "Content": "Fifty eight year old been going to large Western Cancer Center every six months for four years to monitor PSA and have DRE due to strong family history of PC. Last 12 months PSA went from 2.0 to 3.0. Uro wanted a \"baseline MRI\". MRI showed various \"suspicious\" lesions. Uro ordered Fusion Biopsy using ultrasound and MRI image. Nineteen cores taken, six cores of suspicious areas and then random areas as well. All nineteen negative - benign. Even suspicious areas just \"moderate chronic inflammation\". Very relieved and happy of course. Here is my question. Got results from RN via phone and told that monitoring would now be yearly, with next appointment for one year from now. Also told I would be switched to a new uro who is the guy who does \"active surveillance\", even though I don't have disease at this point. Hard to get the doc on the phone. Is moving the PSA monitoring to a year from now instead of every six months normal after a negative biopsy? Is there any reason I should be with the \"active surviellence\" guy if I had negative biopsy? Just curious what others think. Grateful overall for this outcome.",
