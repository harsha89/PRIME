I will follow up on Prostate issues (I took some BPH oriented survey ((maybe at the GreenLight site?)) and got a 19 score) soon plus I don't think the Flomax does much BUT right now I have to focus on the muscle/joint pain. It would be nice to get my shirt and socks on by myself again. The current hurdles are, despite living close to a major teaching med. ctr. (Dartmouth), getting app'ts. with specialists or even my primary. My urology consult was scheduled yesterday for March 27th. So today I enter what my buddies and I call PB mode..pushy bastard. Again, thanks...be well",

Can severe muscle/joint pain as I am experiencing be CAUSED by the prostate? Seems illogical to me, especially the shoulder issues but stranger things have happened.
