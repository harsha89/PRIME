      "Content": "I wasn't sure if I should have added this to old thread , but yesterday I had my biopsy. My biopsy was set for 11:00, but I wasn't seem until 12:00. Was told something happened unexpected on first bio of the day. Great I said... I was given antibiotics starting day before. I was also numbed. I think I was really nervous because before taking first sample I started to feel shaky. The doctor would tell me ... Breath in here I go. My the 2 times, I was fainting. Nurse had to stop doctor and gave me juice and cookies. Talk about weird. After I was done I was giving discharge instructions. Doctor told me he found an hyperechroic lump and took two extra samples of that... I'm scared. Doctor did not tell me anything else but that he will see me on Monday 11. Please keep me in your prayers. I'm in some pain and I'm bleeding everytime a pee. This was not easy but I know it's what I need to do. Thanks everyone",

      "Content": "My story starts in 2013 when I was 47, when I start experiencing urinary issues which landed me in ER, I was suffering from kidney stones and a bad infection. MIR showed kidney stone coming down, nothing else. In 2014, I saw a uriologst for the kidney issues, all he did was lab work, nothing bad every came back. I did not ask about PSA at the time since I had no idea what that was. Since my kidney stones, I often get UTI which I get antibiotics for, but since then my lower back always hurts and my urine steam is weak and I go to rest room more often. After being pushed by my daughter, I went to my PCP and asked for a DRE. He found a nodule on the right side (the same side where my kidney stone came down.) He did NOT refer me to a urologist but instead sent me to have an prostate ultrasound. I'm scared, I'm only 50 year old and have no record of my PSA to even have any idea. My ultrasound is on Friday and although my PCP doesn't know, I have set an appointment with a urologist on Tuesday Feb 23. I have read that once a nodule can be felt by DRE, the cancer is likely to be more advanced? Is this true? Another question is why didn't my PCP just sent me to a urologist who can do ultrasound and biopsy? In my mind I'm just wasting time, if the ultrasound shows something than I have to have a biopsy, if I was under the care of a urologist I could do both at once. Another thing I'm wondering about is that the facility doing my ultrasound wants me to have a full bladder before the test. I have not read anything about needing a full bladder for a prostate ultrasound. I'm confused. I have no family history, not African American. Any advice is welcomed.",
