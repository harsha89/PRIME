So far in this journey, I have been hoping that everything could be explained away with his enlarged prostate. After all, bph can cause increasing and higher psa numbers and even low free percentage numbers, if I understand right. Although the 9.5 free psa was a bit more concerning than the 6.7 psa alone, it could still be affected by bph, I think. Maybe I'm wrong there, or maybe it's just wishful thinking. Anyway..... I am thinking that finding suspicious areas on an MRI cannot be explained away by bph. It seems a bit of a game changer, considering the bph basket I put all our eggs in, so to speak. Any thoughts on this? Anything I should be asking at this point? I know nothing more than the suspicious areas....don't know if the doc. actually said more than that.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PCASpouse My DH at 57 is almost same age as yours. I sat with him at the initial urology appointment with his PSA of 4.2 and <10% free report from his primary care doc, and many years of worsening BPH symptoms he ignored. I asked the doc to comment on my reading that 30-50% of patients with free PSA this low have some level of cancer, and he just shrugged and replied that 50% or more do not and many of those have BPH. No citation offered, but it does make some sense. BTW meanwhile DH had his MRI I pushed for, and which insurance covered, and which showed a 2.5x1.4 cm suspicious area. The guided bx is 3/29. I hope it is just a big nest of prostatitis and a false positive, despite the free PSA being low, and also wish your DH a negative MRI on 4/1! Hoping your hubby's bx is ok. Thanks for replying. Funny how different doctors are. My hubby's doc told him flat out it was likely he had cancer....which I thought was odd, given the \"56 percent of men with under 10 percent free have cancer\" thing you read online. I mean just that alone would suggest that less than half do. My husband's psa is a bit higher than yours......but given the bph, it's not that unusual I don't think.",

      "Content": "So hubby has had bph and high psa for a few years. PSA gone steadily from around 3 to close to 7. He has had one 12 core biopsy....they didn't find anything and was told to come back in 6 months. At that time, his psa was 6.5 and percent free was 10.3 Prostate measured 35-40. This time psa was 6.7, free psa percent was 9.5. Prostate measured 40. So he is scheduled for an MRI on April 1st. He is 56. Question......I know bph can cause higher psa numbers in general......but can bph also cause lower free percentage numbers....or not so much? I know they use percentage free to access risk, but didn't know if it was affected by bph, like the total number. Also, I cannot find any information regarding free psa and age. Only info. concerning psa numbers in general and age. An under 10 percent free psa is associated with a \"56 percent cancer risk\" according to what I have found.....but nothing about how age factors into that. Does anyone know? His doctor flat out said that because of his age, cancer is \"likely\" but we need the MRI to find out for sure.",
