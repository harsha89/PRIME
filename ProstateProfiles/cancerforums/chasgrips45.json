All through journey ,incontinence & repeated trips to the bathroom at night have been a problem. I spoke with the nurse at my oncologist`s office last & week she suggested Flomax . Why would I take Flomax ? I don`t have a prostate so why would I need a drug that helps urine flow!? Is it used to relax the bladder neck muscles? Here`s an off the wall question, does anyone use marijuana to alleviate the symptoms of radiation, or hormone therapy? Just thought i`d ask.",

This 3 month wait is a real bitch! Ok i can give just some of the details because I don`t have my records .Believe me ,what i do know ,i remember. Da vinci 8/2011, Psa 4.6, gleason 4+4 (a real \"fast burner\"! Only one side of my prostate was affected PT3A. The margins were clear, 10 lymph nodes were removed & were clear. Margins were clear, Seminal vesicles clear. As i was told by the doc,Dr Kenny Simpkins, in Ashville N.C he, was quite happy with the results . After surgery & up until 8/2012<.1. This December, .1 ,this March, .2 Now I`ve got to wait until June to get tested again. I feel like i`m coming out of my skin. My sweet wife has been suffering with the effects of Alzheimer's disease ,getting progressively worse since 2008 . I need to start making some decisions as to what to do if this psa keeps rising. I am essentially alone here in Franklin N.C .I Just need some thoughts ,& opinions, as to my situation. It seems that the nurses at the office take these differing results from patients as a matter of course . I guess they call so many patients daily it becomes routine. The nurse mentione to me after i asked ,that if it goes any higher I`d have to see the doc. Another quick question, i have an interstim installed ,would that make any difference? Thanks , Charlie",

      "Content": "So step 2 in my little journey. I hate the term Salvage radiation ,but i guess that`s what it was. During the treatment ,I had minimal side effects . Pooper a little sore, continence about the same. The worst was the urge to get up 7 times a night to pee. So today is Friday, & I`m as weak as a kitten,& have a hell of a headache. The doc gave me a little better than a 50% chance of a cure. Bad #8 Gleason . I lasted for a year before a rise in psa. I hope I`m wrong ,but here`s the way this thing plays out IMHO . I probably go for a while with a zero psa ,after the initial bump. It`s then the 3 mo waiting game for the psa test . How long before it returns,maybe 5 yrs, tops. I then hope that the doubling time is slow. No hormones. I sure as hell don`t need my mood to get any lower! I had no idea that AFTER the radiation ,I would feel so tired . Maybe I`ll go back for more to get my strength back! I`m not sitting on the pity pot it`s just that I hope this process is for naught. I feel like i`m in a fog ,I`ve got to rest.",
