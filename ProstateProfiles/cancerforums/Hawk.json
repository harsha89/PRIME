      "Content": "Hello all, I have been gone for a while but have encountered an interesting situation. I had Gleason 8 (4+4) prostate cancer in 2004 and had radical prostatectomy at that time. After failure in 2009 I had external beam salvage radiation which knocked my PSA down to .02 for a few years then, it started up again. It has been climbing at a fairly constant rate for three years with a doubling rate of about 12 months. Six moths ago it was at 0.34 so I expected about a 0.46 with this test but I always hope for better. I was stunned with a test result of 0.17. That is a cut in half with a roll-back to where it was 18 months ago. I am on no treatment at this stage. Since my last test, the only medical situation was a brutal 6-week bout with kidney stones and taking flowmax to help me pass the stones. Has anyone ever seen a late stage PCa that failed surgery and salvage radiation drop like this for no apparent medical reason? Thanks PS: Attempting to attach a PSA graph to give a visual. The first drop was after salvage radiation. The most recent drop is unexplained",

      "Content": "Thanks Fairwind, Originally Posted by Fairwind Sometimes as PC metastasizes, it reaches a point where it no longer produces much PSA and the PSA test becomes an unreliable marker...Your doctor (oncologist) might order a PET scan ...! My PCa has always been very high PSA-producing (18.2) and took three biopsies for a total of 34 needles before two needles hit cancer pre-op. The highest it has ever been post op was 0.34 when it plunged to 0.17 so even at 0.34 before the PSA drop it was still far too low even for the most sensitive PET scans that I think require a 2.0 before they will scan.",

      "Content": "I have not had Da vinci surgery but i did have laparoscopic RP by the Frenchman that perfected the surgery and was recruited by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. He does nothing else and does several hundred a year. My outcome was not what I had hoped for and 4 years later I am facing a likely PSA rise. HOWEVER, no one can give you anything but odds on your outcome. Problem is that odds are useless or nearly so for an individual. They work great for groups. I was once told (after 2 negative biopsies) that the odds were 80% that I did not have cancer. You were given only a 1 in 6 chance of having PCa Those odds were worth nothing to me or you. You cannot be certain about the future. You have to educate yourself, make your best judgment, and not waste time second guessing the decisions that are behind you. I was 54 with Gleason 8 and a PSA of 8.7 and higher so my decision was easier. Even in your shoes, I would need some very expert convincing before I decided on watchful waiting however. Good luck and keep us posted.",

I am looking for the earliest possible imaging such as C11 Acetate PET. and also possible consultation on risk/ befits of early treatment. I suspect at this point my best shot would be that I gained access to C11 Acetate PET, that a small hot-spot was found and radiated and BINGO ! Any one know of access to C11 Acetate PET within reasonable access to the east coast. Anyone ever hear of treatment at these low PSA levels? Thanks Hawk",

First as others have said, the Vacuum Erection Device (VED) will certainly work but DO NOT over pump. penis damage can lead to Peyronies Disease which is its own night-mare www.PeyroniesSociety.org The vacurect is one VED that is reasonably priced for a medical quality VED (medicare pays part of cost if a doctor writes a prescription) Its main benefit is it is unique one hand operation and very compact. Just a bit less awkward to work into the moment. There are other good brands and a vacuum is a vacuum as long as you do not over do it. L-Arginine is an amino acid you can get at GNC or any supplement store. It is used by body builders but it will give those with a weak erection a stronger one. It is subtle, not like Viagra but if you are healthy and take 2000 mg with a Viagra it will enhance the effect enough to make the critical difference for me and many others that have tried it. It is also great taken daily after surgery to promote circulation to the penis and maintain penile health in the absence of erections (which are important to penile health) Trazodone - Is a prescription antidepressant prescribed at 200 -300 mg for depression. The secret is that 1/6 that dose which is way to small to give an anti-depressive effect will cause night time erections (NTE). I get much more of a NTE with a half of the smallest 50 mg trazodone tablet that I get with 100 mg Viagra. The great thing is it is as cheap as dirt, $3.00 for a months supply. A side effect is listed as inappropriate erection or priapism (prolonged erection). Talk to your doc and ask him for it and take with some food before bed-time (it will help you sleep but not feel drugged) . Remember this is only a 1/6th dose. It does not work that good for me for daytime erections but is very beneficial in giving NTE that preserve penile health. Avoid antihistamines. The attach to adrenaline receptors and kill erections just like fear, or anxiety. In fact if an erection will not go down from an injection, the first response is 4 sudafed. It will usually kill an erection within 25 minutes or less. Doctors second approach is neosynephrine (SP) (another antihistamine) injected in the penis which works within a minute or two. I don't want to write a book but the list goes on of what you need to know about your penis after a prostatectomy. Penile injects can work great but they CAN (usually don't) cause Peyronies Disease. The Peyronies Disease Society has a not for profit (free) site addressing such issues at www.Peyroniessociety.org. You will find most of the help on their forum For information on ED or penile deformity or loss of length issues it is a great place to check out. It does NOT address cancer. This place is tops for those issues. I hope this helps someone! And be thankful!",

      "Content": "As you can see from my profile signature I had surgery, and got some low PSA readings after 46 months. I opted for high dose salvage radiation while my PSA was still around .15 Ultimately my PSA dropped to .02 although that took a while. I went some time without a psa test (approx 1 year) In Feb 2014 it was up to .06 Six months later in July of 2014 it is .10 All and all the SRT took my Gleason 8 PCa down to undetectable limits for 5 years. It seems pretty clear to me that I have a tiny amount of localized Gleason 8 cancer that I will have to deal with so now I begin the process of educating myself with the many varied opinions on when to start HT etc. Comments and opinions are welcome.",

After being around the horn for 10 years, Surgery, SRT, etc. I have faced uncertainty many times and have yet to ever have a cancer symptom, only side-effects from treatment. This test result was more like getting an official letter that told me I am in fact mortal. I was already keenly aware of that so no real shock or panic. After monitoring my PSA for about 12 years, I do however think it VERY likely that every PSA test from here on will bump up until the point I finally opt for HT or some other less conventional approach.",

I opted for high dose salvage radiation while my PSA was still around .15 Ultimately my PSA dropped to .02 although that took a while. I went some time without a psa test (approx 1 year) In Feb 2014 it was up to .06 Six months later in July of 2014 it is .10 All and all the SRT took my Gleason 8 PCa down to undetectable limits for 5 years. It seems pretty clear to me that I have a tiny amount of localized Gleason 8 cancer that I will have to deal with so now I begin the process of educating myself with the many varied opinions on when to start HT etc. Comments and opinions are welcome.",

After being around the horn for 10 years, Surgery, SRT, etc. I have faced uncertainty many times and have yet to ever have a cancer symptom, only side-effects from treatment. This test result was more like getting an official letter that told me I am in fact mortal. I was already keenly aware of that so no real shock or panic. After monitoring my PSA for about 12 years, I do however think it VERY likely that every PSA test from here on will bump up until the point I finally opt for HT or some other less conventional approach.",

      "Content": "I thought switching from a one decimal test to a two decimal test was useful since I was dealing at the very low end of PSA (.06-.15 range) All of this was showing .1 on the one decimal test. On this two decimal test most centers of excellence consider anything below .05 as test \"noise\" and not even necessarily a real PSA reading. It is hard to see a value in a 3 decimal test. On another forum, there is an interesting/revealing account of a guy that had a daily PSA test for a long period of time. I would like to have a female take a 2 or 3 decimal PSA test. I am willing to bet they would get some reading.",

      "Content": "Mark, All men and all surgeries are unique. For instance men have varying degrees of erectile functioning before surgery. Age and other factors can impact healing. During surgery, nerves can be totally destroyed, largely spared, or any degree in between. The way those factors pair up mean no one can predict your progression. Certainly patients on a forum could never predict your outcome. However there are some important points. RP damages or traumatize nerves (some are traumatized even during surgical healing right AFTER RP,). Of course some nerves are actually removed. Your surgeon should be able to qualitatively tell you the degree of nerve removal for the right and left nerve bundle. In any event, if nerves were spared, you will continue to get some improved nerve pathways for at least 12 months after surgery and possibly for 24 months. The chances are that it will never be exactly like it was but rarely, miracles happen. Sometimes intimacy and sex even improves as you and your spouse explore the possibilities. There are many things you can do to have a positive impact on the process and outcome. Improve healing and preserve penile health by increasing blood flow to penile tissue (including the large part of penile tissue inside of your body). Do this with a 1/4 Viagra nightly. Challenge yourself at least weekly with attempts at sexual activity (use it or lose it). You may want to take an entire Viagra at these times. A half of a 50 mg Trazadone tablet at night (prescription) also encourages nocturnal erections which maintain penile health. I would encourage any man that has a RP to strongly consider a Vacuum Erection Device (VED) to encourage blood flow. Penile tissue that is deprived of blood flow from erections or VED tends to lose elasticity. This can contribute to the seldom discussed loss of penile size that Urologists all know about. Here again, blood flow and oxygenation are thought to help prevent Peyronies Disease. Be careful with injuring a borderline erect penis during sex. Injuries can lead to Peyronies Disease which is much more prevalent in prostatectomy patients than the general male population. Lots of lubrication and controlled positions are important in the beginning. Things that help erections: Supplements L-Arginine 2- 4 grams per day. (recommended by many urologists) Horney Goat Weed Acetyl L-Carnatine & propionyl-l-carnitine http://www.peyroniesforum.net/index....pic,649.0.html Things that reduce erection Smoking, caffeine, antihistamines like Sudafed etc, adrenalin which can not only be triggered by sudden fear but also by performance anxiety.

One correction however, FEW foods supply vitamin D in any significant quantities. You have only 2 choices for getting it. Either ultra-violet light or a specific vitamin D supplement (not a multi-vitamin with 400 IU)",

I would also put it in checked baggage since that area should be unpressurized and very cool during flight. I will give you my standard warning: Always apply direct pressure to the injection site for several minutes and do not take prescription or over the counter blood thinners. Finally if you notice ANY deformity, change in curve, indentations etc. Stop using trimix at once. It can set off a cascading progression of peyronies disease not only from the trauma and leaked blood in the tissue but because one of the 3 drugs used in tri-mix is know to cause fibrosis.",

      "Content": "A couple thoughts on this topic: My Conversation with Dr. Bertrand Guillonneau who performed my surgery at Sloan-Kettering Question: \"At what point does this cancer start throwing cells out into my blood stream?\" Answer: \"Oh, you have cancer cells in your blood stream. That does not mean they are capable of establishing themselves and surviving. No one can tell what moment that may happen.\" I am not suggesting this is the last word. As Dr. Guillonneau himself says at times, \"What do I know, I am only a surgeon\" albeit a world renown surgeon. One other point. I can easily see how MRI can guide a biopsy and increase the odds of not missing a small tumor. It would have possibly spared me 3 biopsies if I had my endo rectal coil MRI earlier on. What makes no sense to me is how it can reduce one bit the slim risk of tracking cancer during a biopsy. A biopsy needle is still inserted into the tumor and extracted exactly like any biopsy. They obviously use a fresh needle with each core taken so the needles that miss the cancer are no risk and that is all the MRI is designed to reduce. That is unless they imply they can do the job with one or two needles because they now they hit the tumor. Even in that scenario, I only had two needles hit my tumor.",

My PSA was down to .10 and ultimately dropped to .04 at the 9 month mark in Dec 2009. My 12 month post SRT PSA test in March 2010 remains at .04 It would have been nice to see it squeak down to .03 but I am pretty happy that it has held for now. Pre SRT .16 Post SRT .10 3 month .09 6 month .06 9 month .04 12 month .04 PS: Just a side note , but my PSA lingered around .09/.10 on the way up just like it did on the way down.

I had SRT 3 ½ years ago and just got a PSA of 0.02 It took 24 months to bottom out at that reading and has been steady there for 18 months. I have to say I am a bit pleasantly surprised. I went 18 months between my last 2 PSA tests because I lived from test to test every 3 to 6 months for 6 years and just got tired of it. I figured at this stage there is no rush for hormone therapy if the PSA started back up anyway so why not just focus on other stuff for a while.

      "Content": "Garza65, On one hand DRE's should be done but on the other hand they are very unreliable at eliminating cancer since only one side of the prostate can be felt. The fact that it seems large but without lumps etc is as good as you can hope for. The large could explain your somewhat elevated PSA and the absence of lumps means no obvious signs of cancer as far as it can be examined by feel on one side. The biggest indicator of PC other than a biopsy is the trajectory of the PSA. Is it climbing, dropping, or steady over a period of time. Since this is your first test you have no trend thus a PSA test in your range means little. Could be cancer, could be infection, could be irritation, could be your normal PSA for the volume of your prostate. You know no ore than before the PSA tests. As far as back pain is concerned, it means you have a very healthy active mind. In the months while I waited for Gleason 8 prostate cancer surgery with a PSA of 16.4 my hip bothered me anytime I sat for a very long period. My back also hurt up over my kidney. After my surgery I had strange pains beyond number. I have no idea what it was but 8 years later with a PSA of 0.02 I know it was not prostate cancer. You have 2 courses. Wait 3 months and take a new PSA AT THE SAME LAB or go ahead with the biopsy and see what the result says. If it is negative (cancer free) get a PSA every year and respond accordingly. Good luck, PS: You can probably thank you doctor for that test regardless of the outcome.",
