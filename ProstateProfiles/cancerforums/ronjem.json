My psa was at 11.2 and according the the gleason scale my right grade is 4+3= 7 & my left grade is 3+4=7. I don't wanna have radiation because it can damage other parts of the body as well so im going to have the whole thing removed. I'm not going to give up because i've come to far in life. I am a era-vet & a recovering addict who just celebrated 8yrs clean, so giving up is not an opition for me. Please if there is any information that you can give me please feel free to do so!!!!",
