      "Content": "I am not very happy with the performance either. I am now four months passing the surgery. Initially, the doc put me on three times a week cialis treatment which I found does not help much because I get semi erection without it as well. Never full even with cialis. Now the doc put me on cialis daily routine. I really hope that it will help me in long term. Yes, i think we all feel depressed sometime when you think about BEFORE and AFTER, but I try to not think about it. I have not tried any other methods yet. Still doing some research. Yep, don't give up.",

Since my insurance only pays 6 pills a month, my dr sent me to a pharmacy which makes generic Cialis compound. I think it works as good as the original pill. I think I am getting better in that area. By the way, the Cialis compound costs $50 for 30 days supply which is not bad. If anyone needs the contract info for the pharmacy, please let me know.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Pacer1, Can you post some additional information from your biopsy pathology report here, as you see in members' signatures? Also, be sure to check out the \"stickies\" at the top of this menu. Prostate cancer is usually slow growing, and, depending on your report, you may have considerable time to research and ponder your course of action. Good luck to you. ---------------------------------- The dr called me this past Thursady and only mentioned a few things and asked me to schedule a consultation next week. I will have discussion with my dr on Monday and should know more details of my biopsy report then. I will post more details next week. Thank you",

I am afraid it may be take too long to get to treatment. I like to get it done as soon as possible. My current dr is also very engaged in robotic surgery, but I have not got a chance to ask him about the number yet. Thanks.",
