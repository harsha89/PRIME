(too many, not to ignore) Previously been on lupron and bicalutamide, but it stopped its effectiveness. I am really lucky to be approved for this treatment, as I am uninsured. I feel great, as long as I treat my pain. Does anyone here have any suggestions or tips for me. Thanks, and have a nice weekend. Bobbie. Oh and prednisone also started. I never had any drugs prior to pc",

      "Content": "Sorry, I should have given more info. I am 46 ys. old and 2 years ago, was diagnosed with stage 4, gleason grade 8, metastatic prostate cancer to the ribs. psa was 300, and was put on Lupron and Casodex (Casodex was stopped after 4 mos. ) treatment brought psa down to I think around 4. I lost my insurance, went broke and stopped treatment. but luckily, was able to continue treatment at a new hospital. psa was at 12, but came down to 6, after lupron injection. Recently I started having prostate pain, and nausea. Doc sent me in for mri and bone scans (both came back good) Doc said prostate looked lumpy, and thinks prostate tumor is causing psa increase, so he started me on Casodex (yuck), in hopes that it will bring psa down. I was just wondering if prostate is ever removed, when tumor growth etc. causes pain, or urinary restriction etc.",
