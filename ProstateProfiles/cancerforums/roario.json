    "Content": "Hi, My dad has advanced prostate cancer to the bones. When my dad found out that he had prostate cancer the PSA was about 10.000. He started with hormone therapy for about 6 months. The PSA was amazing 32 on its best. Then the value increased again and he had to start with cytotoxin. The PSA decreased for a while, and then it was not effective enough and PSA value increased again. Now the value is about 600 and he had to start with a new hormone therapy named Zytiga. Has anyone heard of that? Is that a good one? But I am really scared and worry about him, and hope someone can give some advise and tips about new treatment that could help him.",
