      "Content": "Recently posted that I was a bit concerned my Psa was very slowly getting higher finally had my appointment with Urologist but as usual had me confused walked out thinking what did he say. First said it could be microscopic cancer cell spread but the time it has taken to reach my current level 0.051 at 4 years he said I don't think you have anything to worry about for 10 to 15 years I thought great by that time most likely wont be here. But then said we will continue to monitor it was 6 month Psa testing and if it reaches 0.07 will look at options but not keen on radiation as it can cause more problems than it fixes as he said with microscopic spread there is know way of knowing where the cells are. They could be where the prostate was or could have traveled else where in the body that is why not keen on radiation could radiate wrong part of the body. So I'm confused nothing to worry about 10 to 15 years then keep a eye on things and way up options",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lLance I have asked within some other posts but never got a response, so I decided to start a thread. I had my nerves removed when I had RRP 7 weeks ago. The Dr. said in another month or so I could get a Penile Implant if I wanted. I have read up on them and seen some pretty good reviews and it seems most are pleased with the results. Especially the hydraulic types. Although I am having very good orgasm's, it would be nice to be able to try out my little fellow again. Is there anyone out there who can give me some 1st hand knowledge about them? I haven't seen them mentioned even from some who say they have had long term ED. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks, Lance Have you thought about posting and reading posts on Frank Talk very good posts regarding implants considering it myself.tony04w",
