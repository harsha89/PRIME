I was told that his tumors are too large and can't be removed surgically (2+ cm3). The two PSA tests were conducted in two different hospitals. They ran a third test today. We'll know the results tomorrow. I spoke with his doctor today, and he told me that if his PSA reading is, indeed, that high, they will have to remove his testicles surgically. Then, after my father heals (in about a month), he will be hospitalized again and they will begin chemotherapy. I will speak with the doctor again tomorrow. What sort of questions should I ask him?
