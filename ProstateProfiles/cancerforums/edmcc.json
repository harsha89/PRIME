      "Content": "Visit to doctor today. My PSA was.5 and he was not very optimistic . He said to come back in six weeks for another PSA test. He told me that he would be able to tell by the \"slope\" of the next PSA if the cancer was still in the prostate bed or if it had spread to a distant site. His best case scenario was that if it was in the prostate bed I can have radiation to that area. Otherwise it has spread beyond that area and I would not be cureable. Very scary words. What options are there if this is the case?",

After being tested and biopsied it was found I had Gleason 7 cancer and had the DaVinci procedure on February 10, 2014. My prostrate was 80 percent cancer. The results post surgery showed no evidence of lymph node envolvement but the tissue around the prostrate did have microscopic traces of cancer. I go back to the doctor at the first of April for a PSA to see if there is any cancer remaining. Hopefully I can move forward with my life from here and deal with the issues I have now.
