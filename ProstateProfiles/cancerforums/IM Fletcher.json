      "Content": "Hello, all! I'm excited to be in the club, so to speak. OK, so not so much, but I'm guessing that none of you sought out membership, either. In truth, I don't know if I'm a member or not, but I'm willing to learn. Sorry, I tend to wander off topic sometimes. To get to the point, I'm searching and seeking any information on this wild ride down Prostate-Ville. My history: I'm 48 and in excellent shape (it's illegal to live in Boulder, Colorado and be out of shape). I run (a lot), ski, play golf, etc. I have two daughters, ages 4 and 7, who keep me very busy. And a wife. I have one of those, too. Anyway, two past events play into this adventure. #1 I broke my sacrum in a pretty bad skiing accident in January of 2005. That accident dinged some nerves that take care of bathrooms #1 and #2 as well as sexual function. Luckily, the sex part came right back but I've been partially deficient in the bathroom side of things since then. Deficient as in my lower bowel is still numb and I poo like a rabbit with little pellets. Too much info? Probably not on this forum. I never empty out fully. I live in a constant state of constipation (which can make long running races interesting). On the bladder side, since that accident I've been prodded and poked and hooked up to probably a lot of the same stuff you guys have in the past. All this adds up to the fact that my urination has been abnormal since then. I've gotten to know a lot of urologists and neurosurgeons over the years. #2 Nearly five years ago I suddenly got very ill one day. I had felt really run down for a few days as if I had been overtraining. No energy, lethargic, radiating pain in joints, etc. My fever spiked to 105 that day and I took a bunch of ibuprophin and broke the fever overnight. I went to the urologist (I had been there once when trying to get answers about the nerve damage stuff) and found out that I had a bladder infection. They gave me two week supply of Cipro and sent me on my way. Oh, and they asked me a whole bunch of times if I had been having sex with men (since apparently men don't generally get bladder infections). Cipro nearly hobbled me (on an aside, if you run or are active in any way, Cirpo is the devil). I went back four days later (limping horribly) and they gave me Bactrim. Seemed to work. Symptoms went away. Later found out that doc was close to hospitalizing me on initial visit. Fast forward a month and it came back again. Went back in and they gave me more Bactrim and scheduled a bunch of tests. Conclusion was acute prostatitis. Doc told me that he has one guy who has been on antibiotics for 25 years. Hooray. Anyway, over the past four-plus years I've learned a lot about it and manage it pretty well. I can tell when it's coming on and what it feels like. I haven't had any episodes since. I've got it dialed in to about four pills of Bactrim a month. I had my vasectomy with this same urologist and also went through some new treatments to try to fire the nerves up a little to help with urination. Didn't really help. I also started getting testosterone shots in the past year when I was found to be a \"Low T\" guy. Great. I'm also a \"performance enhancing drug\" runner now, too. Bottom line is that due to the above two situations I have been monitored closely for awhile. My PSA came in really high for my age a few years ago during a routine exam (nearly 6, I think). They were pretty sure it was due to inflammation from my prostatitis. Rechecked three months later and it went down to 3 something. They felt good about that. Over four year period my PSA is always elevated but it dropped to 1.92 in December. Due to 1.92 at my age the PA at the office said I should get an ultrasound (the one with the magic wand). Doc performed it and said I had a few curious areas. I've never had any irregular DRE, including that day. He thought that perhaps those areas were prostatitis-caused, but ordered 4Kscore test to help. I'd never heard of that one before. 4K score comes back at 15 with free PSA at 11 and regular PSA went to just under 4. Doc orders a biopsy. That brings us up to this week. The week that I went down the internet worm hole and concluded that I probably have a year left. The nights this week were brutal and I wound myself up about as far as you could go. Every ache and pain that I have (a lot of them over the years from running) turned into \"probable metastatic areas.\" I think I scared the crap out of my wife. I called doc office and made appointment with PA for yesterday. I had to ask some questions to help me understand where I sit. Biopsy was scheduled for next Tuesday (originally it was scheduled for four weeks from now but due to a family ski trip, they worked with me to move it up). With it being so close me hardly being able to function from fear, I felt I had to talk to someone. I met with PA (who I like and trust) who answered my plethora of questions. She decided to cancel the biopsy for next week and schedule an MRI instead. After MRI I'll go in for consult and to determine next step, which she said would most likely be biopsy. She calmed (a bit) by how casual she was and in how no one seemed in a rush to get these things done. I forgot to ask some important questions, but I did feel better when I left. At least I was able to sleep and take the kids skiing today without fixating on it for every minute. I can at least live again. And that brings us to now. Here's what I think I know: 1. I need to stop going down the internet wormhole and stick to a place like this (which was recommended) My questions: 1. From the info I've given, I'm curious to hear the opinions and viewpoints of some of you \"veterans\" who have been in the prostate field for a long time. (not really a question, I guess. More of a comment) 2. The whole \"metastasis\" thing has me thrown. What \"numbers\" or markers would indicate that it might be in that ballpark? What would one feel like if they had a metastic prostate cancer (un-diagnosed)? I know it's a loaded question and not one that has a direct, black and white answer. I think what I'm looking for is for someone to tell me that my numbers plus age plus whatever don't have the look of the worst case scenario. I have random elbow pain that started four weeks ago (no idea where I got it) and have dealt with knee and hip pain over past two years on and off, which I've always attributed to running. When something like this pops up suddenly I start connecting dots after reading the \"symptoms\" of a prostate cancer that has metastasized. Probably putting the cart in front of the horse before I even own a cart or a horse. 3.

      "Content": "I've posted on here previous in regards to my ongoing prostate issues, but to catch up: Age 48. Excellent health and fitness. Prostatitis since June 2012. Currently on 1/2 pill daily of Bactrim antibiotics. PSA all over the place recent years. High in the 7's when inflamed. Went down to 1.92 in December and then back up to 3.96 in January. Had ultrasound in early January and doc saw \"concerning\" area. DRE was and always has been negative. Doc ordered 4Kscore test, which came back at 15. Doc ordered biopsy. I went back to re-visit decision after investigating and getting educated on this stuff (lots of great info here) and decision was to get MRI first. So far MRI has been rescheduled four times due to insurance balking at paying for it. Terribly frustrating. I saw a highly recommended urologist locally (E David Crawford). He ordered a urine test called Select MDX. The result of that test was VERY LOW RISK. It said I indicate a 98% probability that I DON'T have PC with a Gleason greater than 7 and 99% for NOT HAVING PC with a Gleason greater than 8. This all seems like very good news. My follow up is next Wed. My questions are all in relation to the Select MDX test and any experiences anyone on here has had with it (how accurate it is, your particular situation, etc.). Meanwhile, I am experiencing elevated symptoms that are not indicative of my \"normal\" prostatitis issues. I'm urinating much more frequently, especially at night and the urgency has been elevated the last month or so. I'm still very leary of getting a biopsy (not scared of it but more so wondering if necessary) but would appreciate any of your personal experiences with any of what I'm going through. Thanks in advance for response- Chris Justice Boulder, CO",

      "Content": "I won't bore you again with my details, but very quickly...I'm 48 and have had prostatitis for five years. PSA as high as somewhere in the 7s and it has lowered to 1.93 in December. My urologist seemed concerned and did a ultrasound, which showed \"something\" that he was mildly concerned about. Did the 4K blood test and it came back at 15 (11% free PSA). He wanted me to get a biopsy but I started asking more questions and he seemed concerned about possible infection due to my daily antibiotic, so he ordered an MRI (which was a fiasco due to insurance balking several times because, apparently, the \"protocol\" is to get one after a positive biopsy. Makes no sense to me after all my research and the comments I've gotten on here). In the meantime during insurance fiasco, I sought second opinion from a highly recommended guy in Denver, E David Crawford. He looked at my stats and ordered a fairly new blood test called a Select MDX test. That came back with a very encouraging result of it saying that I had a 1% of having aggressive PC and 2% of having any PC. Again, it's a new test and I'm not sure of the overall reviews it's getting. Regardless, good news results are good news results. Finally got the MRI, which came back completely clean. Again, good news results. The kicker here is that my local urologist also showed me three cases that he's had that showed nothing on MRI but turned out to have PC. He decided that I should come back in three months and check PSA again and do ultrasound. Bottom line, I'm learning, is that the prostate is one puzzling piece of work. There doesn't seem to be a definitive anything. Even a biopsy could miss cancer. Then, if you have cancer, there is no definitive on whether to treat or not. It's extremely frustrating. I know I'm preaching to the choir. I have an appointment with Dr. Crawford for second opinion after he looks at the MRI. The question for today is whether or not any of you have had a clean MRI prior to a positive biopsy? Secondary question is about the three months. I know what I've read here and abound, but it goes against my rational thought to sit on things for three months. Why not check the PSA next week and see where it is? If (the big IF) I were to have it, couldn't it get worse or leave the prostate in three months time? At some point there has to be a line of demarcation in regards to metastasis, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of urgency when it comes to PC (minus, of course, the urgency to find the nearest restroom often...thanks, I'll be here all week). As usual, thanks in advance for any insight you can provide. Chris J in Boulder, CO",
