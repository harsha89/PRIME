      "Content": "Hello, My husband, just turned 59 on Tuesday has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. His PSA test was 3.9. Biopsy shows 1 out of 12 samples is positive. Gleason of 6. Doctor discussed four options with us. 1. Removal 2. Radiation (M-F for 8 weeks - says takes about 5 mins but 1/2 hour total each day). 3. Seeds 4. Wait and see. He highly recommends #4 option of wait and see, with returning for an office visit every 3 months and a repeat PSA every 3 months. Of course you can imagine the things going through our minds. I should tell you that he is also a kidney dialysis patient (we do his hemo dialysis treatments at home 5 times a week) He is a high school biology teacher (also teaches summer school). He is on three transplant lists for almost two years now. We are wondering what others might have done in the same situation where the doctor recommends a \"wait and see\" option.",
