      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another ....The last one they blame will be the cancer itself. Since day 1 talking to people and being on forum sites, I've thought this very often. There are so many good treatment options it makes the choice difficult. We know that. I don't hear many people say they have ED or continence issues resulting from having prostate cancer. But I have had people tell me they have it from their treatment. I 've heard it from both sides of the coin. I'm in IT. There's an old saying, \"The last one to touch it, owns the problem\". I'm finding that true in medical treatment as well. No wonder doctors want to be paid well, that's a heavy sack to carry. I'd need a lot of stiff drinks to calm my nerves after a day of clinical work. (yes, pun intended)",

      "Content": "Thought about your topic here a lot over the last months, and especially more recently. I know five people directly, locally here and not on this site, who have had RALP. Safe to say, three have all had no real side effects 12 months after their surgery, other than maybe using an ED drug on occasion. They were all near my age and healthy going into it. Two have had incontinence issues. One had a number of other health issues for years leading into it, continence is still a big issue after 10 months, ED for years prior, RALP at 70. Other one, his PCa caught in later stage with higher Gleason score, RT within 12 months after RALP at 63. Incontinence is a nuisance for him and he's learning to deal with it. Maybe a pad or two a day, drips now and then, I think, but he seems ok. As he told me, it's better than being dead. Switched from beer, to sipping whiskey, that kind of stuff he explains to me. I knew almost immediately I wanted surgery. It just felt right for me, gut feel. Many would tell me I didn't research RT enough, and I probably didn't. This site scared the heck out of me at times reading stories of RALP. But I came to the conclusion of the 160,000 or so diagnoses of PCa each year, very few of them find forums and post their stories and situations. And the ones who do after surgery may typically have more issues. My personal interactions with people gave me the input I needed to decide RALP was right for me. I figure in the grand scheme of things, reading posts from about 60 new people joining this forum, in the three months I knew I had cancer, versus the six I personally knew was of statistical insignificance. (I read very few old posts) Surgery at the age of 56 seemed the best choice for me. Again, for me. Along the short journey since diagnosis, three surgeons told me, you are a very healthy man with a bad prostate. I held that thought, and knew it to be true from mid-June to my surgery end of August. It's almost as though they new, I'd be fine. After all, two of them had done over 3500 robotic surgeries each. Maybe they have pretty good insights. Is a surgeon hedging his bets when he talks to you, or his he saying you most likely wont have issues. I look back at my conversations with my surgeons a little different now after my surgery, things I didn't pick up on prior they said and how they said it. The third surgeon did an open procedure, he wasn't as confident about incontinence and ED as the other two. Interesting now replaying those conversations in my head. Was I really very lucky, or am I actually closer to the norm for a healthy man having RALP. I don't know. Seems like articles I read talk about how long you live after each. Very little statistics for quality of life at 1, 5 or 10 years. Why is that? Too many variables to factor in I suppose.",

My surgery is scheduled for next week at the Mayo in Rochester. This Thursday, I will do a phone interview, I assume to verify I understand the process of what I'll need as prep next week. On Tuesday of next week I spend the day at Mayo for multiple appointments for 1) Preoperative Evaluation 2) Venipuncture Specimen Collection 3) Surgery Education Class 4) Electrocardiogram 5) Study Coordinator Appointment and 6) a One on One with my surgeon. The surgery will follow on Wednesday.",

      "Content": "Consult1 - I'd say around the 5-6 month period. I took my daily 20mg pretty regularly. Almost daily. I had to do most of the heavy lifting in a solo experiences (if ya know what I mean) for quite a while, and still do. I do have some issues when with my wife. I tend to think more about \"how am I doing\", \"am I still hard\" , etc. and really breaks the mood. That's why I said I didn't realize how much for me has been mental. When flying solo, there's never an issue, so I know it's in my head. I need to relax more and enjoy the time, which I'm finally starting to accomplish. It has definitely changed this for my wife and I. I think she's still a little freaked by this whole thing. Although I get good wood, since my diagnosis a year ago, she tends to not come to bed when I do and sex has become very infrequent. It never seemed to be an issue prior my diagnosis. It's almost as this has become a way for her to get away from sex. She was never one to initiate, but would always be willing. But since last June, three months prior to surgery, any interest for her is simply gone. We do need to talk about it more, but it's not her style. So my real issue is that I've recovered well but sex is almost non-existent, when it was a couple of times a week prior. I wonder if anyone else has experienced this with their spouse??",

      "Content": "All: One year ago today, I joined this forum. The day after my diagnosis. It's been quite a ride, and I feel fortunate. First thanks to all of you for your support, advice and kind words when I needed them. I met many good people in the medical profession which gave me good advice and great medical care. Nine months after my surgery, I'm fit as a fiddle. My third and latest PSA is holding at <.04 ED is not much of an an issue. It's not perfect but close enough. At times I'll use 20mg Sildenafil, but sometimes not. I think it helps more form a standpoint of simple daily use for blood flow. I notice no difference in Swanky Johnson when I step out the shower in the morning, if I periodically use it. I've learned for me, the sexual side of this has been just as emotional, and maybe more than physical, from a performance standpoint. That is the most surprising thing in all of this for me. But, I'm a guy, basically a single cell organism. Speaking of the shower, I look at my 6 scars every morning, when I step out of the shower. I'm looking forward to the day when they become as unnoticed as my appendectomy scars. I forget they are even there. I think about PCa every time I urinate. Not because I have any issues, but it's some type of association. I also wonder when I will stop thinking about PCa in that scenario. How long will it take before I kind of forget I even had it? Can that happen, or will it really become something that never seems to go away. With a great outcome, I thought it would. But I'm amazed how much I still think about it. I'd like to stop. I wonder if it's possible?? I don't feel concerned my <.04 will rise, but it could. But, I keep asking myself when I'll think of it less. I know I've had an easy road. I am writing this simply to get these words out of my head hoping it will help. And to tell others who may be new to this, great outcomes are very possible. Maybe down deep I know I'm still in the early cycle of this all, even if things get only better, it's still the early innings. Thank you all. I wish you all nothing but the best. Dan",

      "Content": "Hello all. Been on this site the last couple of days reading. I live in the Minneapolis MN. 56, Married, three grown children. Diagnosed with PC just Monday 6/5/17. But the story begins 4 1/2 years ago. Because I hit the magical number of 50, i thought about doing my first real physical exam. Things being what they are I waiting 1.5 years and had an exam six months after turning 51. I recall asking my general practitioner about a PSA test. He said he did not believe in them with the studies being non-conclusive and the possible false-positives and the potential to do harm to someone completely healthy. Together we decided to skip the PSA test. He continued on with the exam and after performing the digital rectal exam, he said \u0093something\u0094 didn't feel quite right. He suggested a PSA. I laughed. He said the test was now warranted because of the abnormality he may have felt, but was unsure. I believe my PSA result came back around 3. I was referred to an urologist. Saw a urologist, felt nothing with the rectal exam, but indeed my PSA was around 3. I tested a couple of times in the next two years, my PSA results staying elevated. Two years in, he decided a biopsy was in order. I believe my PSA was around 4. Age of 54. Did a couple more PSA tests, rectal exams the next two years. Through all of this the urologist never felt anything abnormal with my prostate. PSA rose to near 7 in February 2017. Another biopsy was recommended. This time with an MRI first. The MRI showed a couple of potential points of interest. This image was then used for a fusion biopsy. That biopsy was a little more intrusive than the first as the tools were forced to certain areas to gain additional samples in those key areas. My diagnosis summary: PSA 5.9 Adenocarcinoma of Prostate. Specimens: Left lateral base, Left lateral mid, MR Lesion; Highest Gleason score is 7; Highest PTI is 90. A) Left lateral base: Gleason score 4+3=7 involving 10% of the length of the core, Perineural Invasion not seen B) Left lateral mid: Gleason 3+3=6 involving <5% of the length of the core, Perineural Invasion not seen C through L) All other cores were Benign prostatic tissue, atrophic changes. Although left base had chronic inflammation. M) MR lesion: Gleason 3+4=7 involving 40-90% of the length of cores. Perineural Invasion present. I also had this, which I am researching to understand: T1cN0m0 Had a bone scan done yesterday and get that result next week. I have asked for all my records as up to this week to have on hand. I felt I didn\u0092t really need them until now, it was simply the PSA is high and we\u0092ll keep watching it. Got my attention now. Still trying to figure out what this all means. I\u0092m thinking to go surgical to remove it. But I still have more appointments and researching robotic vs. open surgery. My urologist does open surgery only. Open to any suggestions, ideas, and maybe questions I should be asking. Thanks for all of you, and what has already been shared in this forum.",

Never filled my pain med prescription just extra strength Tylenol when I felt it would help me rest.",

      "Content": "Greetings all!! I am sitting in my recliner, recovering from my RALP last Wednesday, 8/30. Things seem to be going well. I was released from the hospital in just under 24 hours from my surgery. Surgeon felt things went very well. Pain has been minimal, taken Tylenol 500 couple of times a day as needed. Decided once I got home to wait to fill the Oxycodone for pain unless I needed it, so I haven't. BM's have been good, first one was on Saturday, and twice a day since. Been taking two over-the-counter Senokot, just to be sure I don't have constipation. The only prescription I've take daily since being home is Oxybutynin to prevent bladder spasms, which I've had none so far. Catheter has not been bad. Inconvenient for sure, but no pain or real discomfort. I keep a tube of Bacitracin handy, and keep opening well lubricated. The only area of concern I have is the color of urine. Still pretty red. I'll call the clinic tomorrow, as asked, before my Wednesday catheter removal. They said if urine color was still red, they'd put me off. I'm curious how quickly blood cleared from other's urine. All in all, feeling pretty fortunate right now. ( I just knocked on the wood TV stand next to my recliner for luck) take care -Dan",

      "Content": "Yes, if you look at my stats below my PSA had a history of doing this. When I had my first PSA in 2012, it dropped the next two years before returning to an upward trend. PSA topped out in March of 2017 to 7.5, then a 2 months later at biopsy time it dropped to 5.9 when my PCa was found. I believe for me, those first few years, I never researched prostate cancer or PSA testing. I showed a downward trend and just figured that was good, right? Not so much now in hindsight. Oh, what I know now as opposed to then.....",

      "Content": "I had a surgeon with well over 3500 surgery's, he did two per day, occasionally more. When talking to the people prepping me they saw my previous appendix scars and commented about scar tissue. I asked if that would be an issue, they said they didn't think so but that the surgeon was extremely particular how equipment was placed into me, and the angle of every piece. That told me two things, 1) he had a team he's worked with very often and they knew what he expected and 2) muscle memory must be very important to him and how he moves those instruments. I've had wonderful results from my surgery.",

      "Content": "All: One year ago today I had my surgery. I'm reflecting more already this morning than I thought I would about it. In someways, it seems like years ago, in others it seems like just a couple months ago. I see my scars every morning stepping out of the shower, and I noticed I never go without looking at them. I feel good and they are a reminder each day to take better care of myself. Not that I did anything wrong to acquire PCa, but I've learned there are things I can and should do to take better care of my health, and do try that more now. My regular walking twice a day started about a year ago and continues to this day. I think that's my big take away from all of this is that I can be a better advocate for my own health, ask myself questions about it, as no one else will do it for me. I don't take my health for granted. I very much appreciate the feedback from all of you along the way, starting at diagnosis 15 months ago. You're great people. I received my 4th consecutive <.04, (it's as low as the office reports) I will screen twice in the next year, and if all goes well on to annual screening the rest of my life. At this point in time I couldn't be happier where I'm at. Thanks all, it's been a trip.",

      "Content": "I had a surgeon with well over 3500 surgery's, he did two per day, occasionally more. When talking to the people prepping me they saw my previous appendix scars and commented about scar tissue. I asked if that would be an issue, they said they didn't think so but that the surgeon was extremely particular how equipment was placed into me, and the angle of every piece. That told me two things, 1) he had a team he's worked with very often and they knew what he expected and 2) muscle memory must be very important to him and how he moves those instruments. I've had wonderful results from my surgery.",

      "Content": "Had my 90 day post-op PSA. Received my zero!! Urologist looked through my pathology report and agreed it looked very good. There was the one <.1 cm near the margin but agreed with the surgeon that it shouldn't be an issue. He suggested some Uros would discuss follow-up radia..... I just stopped for a minute, shook it off and continued listening and had to go back to where I stopped listening. He was sayin some might want to radiate as a precaution but felt for me it would be over treatment. We discussed for a while, interesting conversation about pathology and the pathologist process, PSA screening moving forward and what would occur if numbers were to ever rise. He said I have a zero, and we get the next results in three months, and continue on the path of monitoring. He, and I, expect continued good results moving forward. I expected my zero, and handshake and I'm outta there. The next appointment will be! The talk of radiation, although not required, is todays subtle reminder that there's always a chance of things changing, and I appreciate my urologist discussing this. Most important take away is the realization I have been extremely fortunate throughout this entire process, and thank you all to help me along the way. Dan",

      "Content": "Hello All: Been thinking about my sex drive for the last few (maybe many) months. It's not what it used to be. In retrospect I felt this way once I was diagnosed and a couple months prior to surgery, I put that to psychological. After surgery physical sexual function is good, I just don't have the desire I used to have. I believe my wife is glad. So I've been searching and reading online and found this: \"The prostate gland contains a crucial enzyme, 5-alpha-reductase. This enzyme converts the hormone testosterone in the body to DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which is at least ten times more powerful than simple testosterone. This potent hormone DHT has several purposes including male sexual drive and function. Over time, a build-up of toxins in the prostate may affect the production of this enzyme, which is then responsible for the declining sex drive in men as they age.\" This was new information to me. I'd searched prior about sex drive and the prostate but never ran across this. Maybe I figured my drive would come back to 100%, but now thinking it may not ever be to the same level. Previously I figured it was all in my head and it would just take time to reach pre-surgery. The physical part of my recovery has been good. My wife surprised me before my business trip this week and asked if I wanted to \"be done\", heck yes I said. It was a good romp. She even equated to a prior surgery experience. I'm trying to decide if this lack of drive is a good or bad thing for me. My lovely wife has never really had the drive I had which in itself has caused some expectation issues over the years. Maybe this has evened the playing field?? Not sure how I missed this tidbit of information in my research last summer. I probably focused more on the surgery and specifically ED and urinary issues. I wondering now about the long term effects of this, in terms of muscle mass as I age. I know I'm not as strong as I was 10 or 5 years ago, but will this cause me to need to work even more to keep muscle mass/strength? Has anyone researched this at all? Thanks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two Dad finished his 35 sessions of SRT in early December. Did first PSA test today and it has almost halved already! Down to 0.025 from 0.044! Needless to say we are very happy and excited that it seems to have targeted the right spot! Fingers crossed that it keeps going down! ���������� Mom2two, you're post has me really thinking this morning after reading it. Should I assume in the signature line the ECE is the same as \"EPE*- extra prostatic extension\", is that the reason for SRT after surgery with a PSA of 0.44? Margins all looked good. The reason I ask is two fold, one I still get confused with the PSA after surgery. I under stand zero is the goal, but I read <.1 is non-detectable and for all accounts zero. Or should is it <.01 non-detectable? It seems so many times I read about post-surgery PSA and they contradict another thread, or maybe typos once in a while confuse me with the decimal point. Is it fare to think those low numbers have different meanings based on the actual pathology report? Is a reading of .04 good for some, but not so good for others? As you see, at 3 months I was <.04 that's why this hits home. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two Dad finished his 35 sessions of SRT in early December. Did first PSA test today and it has almost halved already! Down to 0.025 from 0.044! Needless to say we are very happy and excited that it seems to have targeted the right spot! Fingers crossed that it keeps going down! ���������� Mom2two, you're post has me really thinking this morning after reading it. Should I assume in the signature line the ECE is the same as \"EPE*- extra prostatic extension\", is that the reason for SRT after surgery with a PSA of 0.44? Margins all looked good. The reason I ask is two fold, one I still get confused with the PSA after surgery. I under stand zero is the goal, but I read <.1 is non-detectable and for all accounts zero. Or should is it <.01 non-detectable? It seems so many times I read about post-surgery PSA and they contradict another thread, or maybe typos once in a while confuse me with the decimal point. Is it fare to think those low numbers have different meanings based on the actual pathology report? Is a reading of .04 good for some, but not so good for others? As you see, at 3 months I was <.04 that's why this hits home. Thank you.",

      "Content": "Greetings all! Been away for a bit. Just seeing if staying away from research/reading of PC will help me think less about it. I don't know that it does this early in the game, and maybe I shouldn't be trying/hoping to think less of it. Still all pretty new I guess, relatively speaking. So anyway, I had my 6 month PSA followup and had another reading of <.04. It's as low as their equipment will readout. So I'm feeling pretty good, but I sure would like to see a 0.00. I guess I could have 0.00, just not on paper. Sure gets nerve wracking the days leading up to a PSA test though. I would have never guessed that. I have been more nervous for those two PSA follow-ups than my surgery, or any initial meetings after my diagnosis. Thanks all. You've all been wonderful to talk to.",
