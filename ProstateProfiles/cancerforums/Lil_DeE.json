I actually live in North London so am I safe to assume I should hopefully qualify for eligability to attend the Royal Marden as I live in the London area? is there a website available that I can check what other specialist units are in the London area or should i stick with the Royal Marden as the best choice for prostrate cancer diagnosis/treatment?",

      "Content": "Hello all, I have just had a higher than normal PSA test and i'm about to be refered to a specialist for further diagnosis/treatment. I've been told by a friend that I dont have to go to my local catchment Hospital but I can ask my Doctor to be refered to any hospital of my choice. The Royal Marsden was suggested as a world leader in cancer diagnosis/treament. Can anyone here confirm: a) That I can pick which NHS hospital I attend in the UK under current rules? b) The Royal Marsden would be the best hospital to attend for Prostrate cancer diagnosis/treatment in London? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
