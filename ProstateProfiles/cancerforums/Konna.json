      "Content": "Hello everyone. My father, who's 60 years old has just been diagnosed with prostate cancer. On August 30th his psa was high at 27,50 and after a suspicious DRE he was told to redo the psa plus freepsa test. It came back 43,10 in just two weeks from the first one and the freepsa was only 3,4% of the total. For starters I hope that one of these two tests was wrong cause the doubling time couldn't be so short, right?. After that a biopsy was performed and today we got the results. 11 out of 16 samples were cancerous, with a gleason score of 6. The cancerous cells were detected in both lobes, although the ultrasound showed only a 1,4cm tumor on the left lobe. On Thursday we have an appointment with the urologist to discuss the next steps. Truth is I am very confused by those results, first of all because of the two so different psa tests in two weeks and second from the amount of cancerous samples in spite of the gleason score 6. By the way my father claims that he has no symptoms, although he has chronic back and pelvis pain, which he says is because he does not move a lot, due to neuropathy from previous strokes and alcoholism. That is definitely a tricky case I think, and all the stories I read from you all are very inspiring, but I need to hear what to expect, how to manage it and what are our odds of this being something that we can get through with.. Thank you for your attention. Konstantina, Greece.",
