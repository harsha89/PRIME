      "Content": "Originally Posted by JJ888 I\u2019m told, watch out for counterfeit mail order drugs and you can get inexpensive Cialis mail order. Can someone specifically give me a list of good mail order companies to order from with a good track record? The hysteria about counterfeit Cialis is severely overblown. If you stick to reputable mail-order pharmacies (that require a prescription), the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor that you'll get good product. Stick with one of the verified pharmacies at Pharmacy Checker. Ask you doctor to write you a 90-day prescription for Tadalafil, being specific about the strength. Your best \"bang for the buck\" if you're taking the 5mg daily dose is to buy 10mg tabs and split them. (there isn't as much competition for 5mg tabs). I hesitate to recommend one pharmacy lest anyone claim I'm shilling for them (I'm not), but my favorite for 1st-time buyers would be Canadian Prescription Drugstore. I have bought from them several times and so have friends of mine, and never had any problem with anything I bought from them. But there are lots of good ones, and they're all selling the same products made by reputable generic drug makers in India. One caveat-- they can't sell to Canadians. Also--- Cialis is off-patent in Canada now, so you can buy Canadian-made generics now in addition to generics from India, but the Canadian generics are almost as expensive as the name brand.",

See my answer towards the end of the sticky thread, \"What I need to know about ED\". You can get perfectly good generic Cialis (Tadalafil) through a Canada-based internet pharmacy, and pay a fraction of that. You won't get ripped off, and it's perfectly effective.",

      "Content": "Hey Mike, I'm 21 months post brachytherapy so I can give you some answers about my experience: Did this happen to you? Oh yes. The first month or two were pretty painful. There were times it was like I could feel every single drop traverse the path from bladder to toilet. Did it finally subside? For sure. It takes awhile, it's slow. Mine didn't stay as painful as the first month or 2 for very long, but it took a good 5-6 months before mine died down to be very tolerable. If it gets really unbearable, ask your doc about phenazopyridine, 200mg. I believe you can also buy it OTC, but the prescription strength really helps. Be aware, it does color your urine, so don't be alarmed. But it definitely worked when I needed it. Did you ever get a slight pinching feeling where it felt like you might have leaked, but nothing was there? I usually get this phantom pee sensation about 20 minutes after each urination. Nope, I don't think I got that. By 20 minutes later I often DID have to pee again, though! More details: I definitely had days where I had to whiz easily 15 times a day, and 4-5 times overnight. Amazingly, I never wet the bed, which surprised me. Good news: 30 days after my brachytherapy my PSA was down from 6.8 to 0.9. Another 45 days after my brachytherapy, when I was about half-finished with my short course of external radiation, my PSA was down to 0.1. I've had 7 consecutive PSA results of 0.1 since then, hasn't budged. I'm getting my 21-month post-seeds follow-up at the end of this month and I expect another 0.1. My oncologist informed me for Gleason 7 score, as I was, with my cancer likely \"organ-contained\", my procedure showed success rate of approximately 96%. All in all, I'm pleased with my choice of treatment. I hope your results are equally good as mine are thus far. (feel free to PM me if you'd like).",

      "Content": "I had blood in my semen after the biopsy (obviously); then after the brachytherapy (again not surprising); then a couple of times during and after having my short course of external radiation. During my external radiation, I attributed it to my pipes being more sensitive and inflamed by the radiation. Mine didn't last 6 months, but I could see how it might, depending on how long it takes for you to recover from the inflammation. I still look back now am amazed that it took as long as it did for the soreness (both front and back) to go away. Seemed to me like a very long time for the tissues to calm down, though all my literature told me taking a year or even more isn't that unusual.",

Not even just questioning whether higher testosterone levels make PC worse, but some evidence even questioning whether low testosterone worsens outcomes.

      "Content": "I also had RT (25 sessions) but in combination with brachytherapy. Was a Gleason 7=4+3. My PSA went from 6.8 down to 0.9 within a month (after the seeds), then to 0.1 another month later, halfway through the RT. I'm now 21 months post-initial brachytherapy (I obviously also still have my prostate), and am still at 0.1. If I understand correctly the sensitivity of the test is 0.1. I've never been on any hormone-supression therapy. I'm not so sure it's all that rare for PSA to go to 0.1 after RT --though my urologist did warn me it's also not unusual to see a bounce after a year or even 2, but not to freak out about it, as it may mean nothing.

      "Content": "Bill, Yes, my Urologist said with my particulars, and where they estimated my cancer to be, I was a candidate for RP, RT+Brachy, or RT-only. He said any would probably work for me, and in his opinion the most important factor (for MY situation) was that I was comfortable with my choice of treatment. That led me to choose Brachytherapy. It was only afterwards he said I'd also need a shorter course of RT, because of the increased chance my seminal vesicles having become cancerous (the difference between a Gleason 6 & 7). Wasn't too happy to hear that, but I went with it anyway. My outcome (knock wood) has been very good. I think there is some increasing evidence that questions the link of testosterone to PCa. By no means universally agreed, but some Urologists and Oncologists now believe hormone suppression therapy is unnecessary because they question the link between testosterone and progression of the cancer to begin with. I personally know several men who had none of it either. Before my surgery, I saw a shrink for a couple of sessions who himself had undergone prostate cancer treatment. He started with hormone suppression, but said he found data and studies that convinced him it wasn't necessary, so he stopped the hormones (probably against the advice of his doctor). I'm not suggesting anyone stop hormones if their doctor says they need them, just pointing out that not all docs believe that link anymore. Which would explain it being more common to not have any hormone treatment before or after surgery. Can't say I'm sorry I missed that.

Interesting to see someone treated with just Brachy+RT and no HT whatsoever! Regards",
