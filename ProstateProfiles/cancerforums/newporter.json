      "Content": "Originally Posted by LILDOG We all know that positive margins are an adverse finding on the path report after prostate surgery but do they always result in BCR ? Your thoughts and literature if available to back up your answer please ! Let me comment/speculate as a layperson: 1. As Dr. Walsh said in his book, the act of cutting away might kill off cancer cells that were left behind from the positive surgical margins. So BCR is not a given. 2. Most surgeons recommend not start radiation right away when positive margins are < a few mm as they may not cause BCR. 3. I watched a number of Da Vinci prostatectomy videos and noticed differences in surgical techniques of different surgeons. Most surgeons used a combination of Thermal Dissection and Athermal Dissection. In addition, after cutting out the prostate, often, some surgeons \"cleaned up\" the area around the void and removing \"debris\" before attaching the urethra to the bladder. If the positive surgical margin is small my speculation is that in using Thermal Dissection, and in cleaning up, the remaining cancer cells might perish or be removed. This is pure speculation on my part and have no medical basis. Best wishes.",

It is also not unusual you have some tiny amount of benign cells left behind as one of the early posts on this forum discussed some time back. But, it is prudent to keep an eye on it regularly. In the mean time arm yourself with some knowledge of what options you have in case it keeps going up. This is a life time watch for us all. Watching our PSA on a regularly basis is something we all do for the rest of our life.",

      "Content": "robrauy, First of all welcome, second, you should not worry too much, especially about all the diagnostics they are going to perform on you. They are all quite easy to handle and really not too painful (the biopsy) at all. As for the symptoms, they could mean BPH, inflammation or cancer, with cancer the least likely outcome for someone your age. Your doctor should be able to use the DRE (or later using ultrasound during biopsy), to \"gauge\" the size of your prostate and from that gets an estimate of whether your PSA is \"normal\". You see, there is a general rule of thumb sometimes used by doctors: Prostate Volume x .066 = approximately the PSA #. There are a lot of variabilities but could give you a sense of whether your PSA is \"excessive\". Working backward, a PSA of 2.6 means your prostate size is around 4 cm in diameter, which for your age is as your doctor described, \"biggish\". By the way, a normal size prostate for someone your age is ~2.5cm. Good luck and hope you won't join us.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two first of all his PSA was undetectable, which is great! Let's hope it stays that way. As for the pathology report: -surgical margins all are negative for malignancy (apical, bladder neck and peripheral) -perineural invasion is present (not so good) -extraprostatic soft tissue-tumor shows established extra-porstatic extension, left posterior aspect (pT3a) (this is where I really start to worry) -bladder neck final margin, query median lobe: prostate tissue that is negative for malignancy histologic type: adenocarcinoma (acinar) -extraprostatic extension : present nonfocal (established extensicve) -margins: margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma perineural invasion: present Primary tumor: pT3a: extraprostatic extension or microscopic invaskon of bladder neck Regional lymp nodes (pN): pN0 (number of regional lymph nodes examined-1) GROSS DESCRIPTION: tumor grossly identified: white irregular, left apex to mid posterior prostate perihpehral; approximate size: 1.1cm x0.8cm x 0.6cm; gross extent of local invasion: confiend to the prostate; no tissue is stored frozen Overall I suppose I feel good, but the ECE worries me as does the fact that from the biopsy there was no perineural invasion present and while waiting all this time for sugery it was now prsesent...I am happy the Gleason went from 8 to 7, though most of it was still a 4 rather than a 3. Welcome back! I highlighted those areas of your concerns. Let me give you my non professional opinion: 1. Don't worry too much about PNI, many studies concluded that those found by post op pathology report that are within the prostate did not increase the chances of recurrence. 2. The finding on EPE, and surgical margins etc. seemed conflicting but that is very good news. Apparently, there were EPE of soft tissues involvements, but his surgeon made a wide cut and took out all of the cancer tissues and that was why all the final inked margins were deemed negative. 3. There were no lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or other areas where cancer invaded. 4. That is why first PSA was undetectable, the surgeon did a good job. Overall a very good pathology report. Let's hope he will continue to have undetectable PSA. If you are not comfortable, get a second opinion from an oncologist about whether it still makes sense to do any adjuvant treatments. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "ILance, Your pathology report looks very good but sorry you keep having penis pain. Not knowing any details and not a healthcare professional mean I can only speculate and give you perhaps some suggestions. First is to see if you can get a copy of the surgeon's surgical notes. Many surgeons have written reports after surgery to record what they did. If it is available, you might be able to see what challenges the surgeon faced during surgery and if he encountered any challenges with nerve sparing, etc. especially since you had extraprostatic extension, as pain could be nerve damage related. Second, pains in certain areas after surgery are very common, after all, this is a major surgery, one of the most complex surgeries in medicine. We all had some pains here and there. I had some penis discomforts/aches and swelling scrotum but they went away after a few weeks. 4 months is a little long but probably not out of the normal range of surgical after effects. Third, you did not say what type of aches are you encountering? dull aches, dull discomforts, sharp pains, continuous vs occasional, are they there during certain activities and conditions. Usually, a sharp pain needs attention right away and dull aches can wait. You need to let your doctor know exactly what you are having. The fact that when you drank a lot of beer and the pain went away is a good sign. Perhaps that means it might go away eventually. Give yourself time, drink a lot of fluid to stay hydrated and take things easy for a while. Fourth, in addition to UTI, there is one potential post surgery problem that might also cause some pains in that part of the body: a lymphocele that accumulates fluid and thus presses on some of the nerves/blood vessels. These are speculations by an untrained layperson and most likely completely off base. I am doing it to provide some talking points for you to talk to your doctor. Please consult your doctor. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind The study linked below made big waves when it was first published. I think it's just as valid now as it was 1.5 years ago .. http://www.prostatecancertreatmentce...tudyGroup.aspx Fairwind, I have no doubt the results are valid but we have to be a little careful about the conclusions. There are usually some study biases in any study no matter how careful the researchers scoped and framed the study. For example, the results are valid for the surgeons they selected for the study just as valid as the brachy practitioners they selected. Dr. Grimm is one of the best, if not the best brachy physicians in the world and his associates are up there too. If I selected brachy, he would be my first choice. If Dr. Walsh compared his and Johns Hopkins' results to the typical brachy oncologist, they are probably better or at least comparable. I compared the 2011 published Johns Hopkins 30 years survival results to your study and the Johns Hopkins' surgery outcome were better than the one you quoted and their survival results spanned 30 years. My own opinion is that in the hands of a good practitioner, all three treatment methods perform about equally well. Perhaps, brachy should produce the least side effects just because of the physics of the method. I almost went for brachy after I read Andy Grove's account of his research for his prostate cancer but my prostate was too large and I wanted to see the final pathology. Peace and cheers.",

      "Content": "RTS, Sorry you are joining us but welcome. My suggestion is instead of worrying about your diet, first order is to understand your cancer stage and condition; formulate with your doctor a treatment approach, then worry about what diet to follow. If you already have cancer, it is not likely that diet will cure your cancer. I have not found any scientific evidences to substantiate those claims of cures. That said, I agree with the others, if a diet \"do no harm\" go ahead if you like to do it but do not risk your life on a diet cure. Just my personal opinion. By the way, your cancer seemed to be early stage (G6) and if the clinical staging indicated it is organ confined, you have a high probability of cure if you choose a good treatment plan. Good luck.",

But the initial report said they got it all.... The doctor did not say if it was in lymphnodes etc...does this mean it spread? All bone/cat scans came back fine. Thanks for any insight! rooster, Your post does not make sense to us. If pathology came back all clear, how did the doctor concluded that \"a couple of cells escaped\"? Was it because of post Op PSA reading not \"zero\"? If PSA post Op is not zero, it certainly is not \"a couple of cells escaped\". You and your Dad need to get hold of the pathology report and read it. Or, it you like post it here and perhaps the others can look at it and comment.",

      "Content": "robrauy, First of all welcome, second, you should not worry too much, especially about all the diagnostics they are going to perform on you. They are all quite easy to handle and really not too painful (the biopsy) at all. As for the symptoms, they could mean BPH, inflammation or cancer, with cancer the least likely outcome for someone your age. Your doctor should be able to use the DRE (or later using ultrasound during biopsy), to \"gauge\" the size of your prostate and from that gets an estimate of whether your PSA is \"normal\". You see, there is a general rule of thumb sometimes used by doctors: Prostate Volume x .066 = approximately the PSA #. There are a lot of variabilities but could give you a sense of whether your PSA is \"excessive\". Working backward, a PSA of 2.6 means your prostate size is around 4 cm in diameter, which for your age is as your doctor described, \"biggish\". By the way, a normal size prostate for someone your age is ~2.5cm. Good luck and hope you won't join us.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two first of all his PSA was undetectable, which is great! Let's hope it stays that way. As for the pathology report: -surgical margins all are negative for malignancy (apical, bladder neck and peripheral) -perineural invasion is present (not so good) -extraprostatic soft tissue-tumor shows established extra-porstatic extension, left posterior aspect (pT3a) (this is where I really start to worry) -bladder neck final margin, query median lobe: prostate tissue that is negative for malignancy histologic type: adenocarcinoma (acinar) -extraprostatic extension : present nonfocal (established extensicve) -margins: margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma perineural invasion: present Primary tumor: pT3a: extraprostatic extension or microscopic invaskon of bladder neck Regional lymp nodes (pN): pN0 (number of regional lymph nodes examined-1) GROSS DESCRIPTION: tumor grossly identified: white irregular, left apex to mid posterior prostate perihpehral; approximate size: 1.1cm x0.8cm x 0.6cm; gross extent of local invasion: confiend to the prostate; no tissue is stored frozen Overall I suppose I feel good, but the ECE worries me as does the fact that from the biopsy there was no perineural invasion present and while waiting all this time for sugery it was now prsesent...I am happy the Gleason went from 8 to 7, though most of it was still a 4 rather than a 3. Welcome back! I highlighted those areas of your concerns. Let me give you my non professional opinion: 1. Don't worry too much about PNI, many studies concluded that those found by post op pathology report that are within the prostate did not increase the chances of recurrence. 2. The finding on EPE, and surgical margins etc. seemed conflicting but that is very good news. Apparently, there were EPE of soft tissues involvements, but his surgeon made a wide cut and took out all of the cancer tissues and that was why all the final inked margins were deemed negative. 3. There were no lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or other areas where cancer invaded. 4. That is why first PSA was undetectable, the surgeon did a good job. Overall a very good pathology report. Let's hope he will continue to have undetectable PSA. If you are not comfortable, get a second opinion from an oncologist about whether it still makes sense to do any adjuvant treatments. Best wishes.",

But the initial report said they got it all.... The doctor did not say if it was in lymphnodes etc...does this mean it spread? All bone/cat scans came back fine. Thanks for any insight! rooster, Your post does not make sense to us. If pathology came back all clear, how did the doctor concluded that \"a couple of cells escaped\"? Was it because of post Op PSA reading not \"zero\"? If PSA post Op is not zero, it certainly is not \"a couple of cells escaped\". You and your Dad need to get hold of the pathology report and read it. Or, it you like post it here and perhaps the others can look at it and comment.",

      "Content": "Fairwind is correct about lymphocele. The risk is real. For the majority of folks, it stays asymptomatic and eventually goes away. For some, it could be life threatening. I had asymptomatic lymphocele for three years but this last July, the abscess was infected and turned sepsis. It almost killed me. I was hospitalized in intensive care with a drain tube in my stomach, 24/7 iv antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs. Home iv antibiotics until infection cleared up. I will need to get periodic CT scan to make sure it does not recur. It is one of the risks most surgeons do not mention. The IR radiologists who did the drainage told me it was more common than a lot of surgeons admitted. That said, if I were to do it over again, I would still want the lymph nodes out - I believe in the points njs said, it is still worth the risks. Best of luck to you",

There is a reason other than hype that 80+% of prostatectomy are now robotic. In my non professional opinion, robotic allows for more precision because the mechanical arms have more degrees of freedom, smaller steadier movements, and color 3D, 10X magnification view which more than compensate for lack of feel of the surgeon's hands. An analogy would be machine soldering vs hand soldering of electronic boards. That said, the surgeon operates the machine so make sure you find the best operator to work on you. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Harding, I don't think you should worry as long as the PSA continues to drop. What is killing your cancer cells is the radiation and for most folks it takes a while for the effects to fully deploy. You are at less than three months and that is early. It is not uncommon to take 1 to 2 years. Also, since you are really not on ADT but is naturally low on T, intuitively I think the effects are not the same as there should be no drastic drop from suddenly starting ADT, as is typical of people on combined radiation and ADT. I think your RO is correct. I think your treatment is successful and you just have to be patient. Good luck and best wishes.",

If it worked as hope, this type of tests should cut down on unnecessary treatment and at the same time provide early detection for those that really need it. In terms of whether our cancer was aggressive and required treatment, we were essentially flying blind. For most of us the gamble that it was indolent even with high probability was not an option we wanted to take, thus most chose treatment and some suffered from unwanted side effects unnecessarily.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two first of all his PSA was undetectable, which is great! Let's hope it stays that way. As for the pathology report: -surgical margins all are negative for malignancy (apical, bladder neck and peripheral) -perineural invasion is present (not so good) -extraprostatic soft tissue-tumor shows established extra-porstatic extension, left posterior aspect (pT3a) (this is where I really start to worry) -bladder neck final margin, query median lobe: prostate tissue that is negative for malignancy histologic type: adenocarcinoma (acinar) -extraprostatic extension : present nonfocal (established extensicve) -margins: margins uninvolved by invasive carcinoma perineural invasion: present Primary tumor: pT3a: extraprostatic extension or microscopic invaskon of bladder neck Regional lymp nodes (pN): pN0 (number of regional lymph nodes examined-1) GROSS DESCRIPTION: tumor grossly identified: white irregular, left apex to mid posterior prostate perihpehral; approximate size: 1.1cm x0.8cm x 0.6cm; gross extent of local invasion: confiend to the prostate; no tissue is stored frozen Overall I suppose I feel good, but the ECE worries me as does the fact that from the biopsy there was no perineural invasion present and while waiting all this time for sugery it was now prsesent...I am happy the Gleason went from 8 to 7, though most of it was still a 4 rather than a 3. Welcome back! I highlighted those areas of your concerns. Let me give you my non professional opinion: 1. Don't worry too much about PNI, many studies concluded that those found by post op pathology report that are within the prostate did not increase the chances of recurrence. 2. The finding on EPE, and surgical margins etc. seemed conflicting but that is very good news. Apparently, there were EPE of soft tissues involvements, but his surgeon made a wide cut and took out all of the cancer tissues and that was why all the final inked margins were deemed negative. 3. There were no lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or other areas where cancer invaded. 4. That is why first PSA was undetectable, the surgeon did a good job. Overall a very good pathology report. Let's hope he will continue to have undetectable PSA. If you are not comfortable, get a second opinion from an oncologist about whether it still makes sense to do any adjuvant treatments.

If you folks are near the U of Michigan and have not done so, you may want to consult with the oncologists there to see if his cancer can be controlled better: Dr. Maha Hussian or Dr. Ken Pienta came to my mind, both are at the U of Michigan, both published extensively on prostate cancer research and may be able to provide some out of the box thinking. Every prostate cancer case is different so treatment needs to tailor to each individual. A good oncologist is very important in managing the outcome.

      "Content": "gjune, I am glad you are looking at getting him to MDA. It is certainly one of the best if not the best cancer center in the US. I hope they can find a combination medications that could work for him. My understanding is with so many different treatment options, it is not clear what combination or sequence will work best for your Dad. For example, one review article (http://www.jnccn.org/content/12/5S/773.short) stated: During the past 4 years, a host of new agents have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. As a result, selecting the right agent for the right patient at the right time is a clinical challenge. At the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Celestia Higano explored the rationale behind such therapeutic decisions and the supporting clinical trial data. She reviewed the different classes of therapeutic agents, from immunotherapy and hormonal therapies to chemotherapy and radioisotopes, and offered suggestions for the clinical scenarios in which they may be used most successfully. Therefore someone with experience like MDA could be most helpful. Best wishes.",

He has never shown any signs of having cancer and now has extremely aggressive liver mets. Based on his genotesting, the new PD-1 drug could work for my Father, but he needs to get into a clinical trial. It is his only option. Has anyone had the drug or know of any available trials. Thank you in advance! IMHO, you did not provide us enough information to comment on whether joining the PD-1 clinical trial is right for him. The obvious question is has he exhausted all available options including all of the modern drugs, immunotherapy, chemo, etc.? Sometimes, trying different sequencing, different combinations (e.g. combined chemo and hormone) work well for some patients. Getting advice from a medical oncologist specializing in treating prostate cancer is perhaps the next step. He/she can also help sign him up for the PD-1 clinical trial. Best wishes.",

There is a reason other than hype that 80+% of prostatectomy are now robotic. In my non professional opinion, robotic allows for more precision because the mechanical arms have more degrees of freedom, smaller steadier movements, and color 3D, 10X magnification view which more than compensate for lack of feel of the surgeon's hands. An analogy would be machine soldering vs hand soldering of electronic boards. That said, the surgeon operates the machine so make sure you find the best operator to work on you. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Yes, it was basically a good report. The only thing I would say is that they'll probably keep a close check on his PSA due to the perineural invasion. It is possible to have a recurrence, when perineural invasion is identified, even with clear margins. This is because with PI, cancer cells group themselves in the space around the tiny nerves inside the prostate near the surface. Highlander, Not trying to argue your point but since I also had PNI, I did some research to find out the implication of PNI at the time of surgery. PNI found in biopsy seemed to have some increase risk of adverse outcome post treatment but PNI found in post op pathology did not have adverse effect on outcome. For example, an Italian study published in 2010 looked at post op PNI found by post op pathology and recurrence. Here is a link to the report: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20516669 And here is the statement they made: The actuarial biochemical progression-free survival rate for all patients was 96.9 and 93.5% at 60 and 84 months, respectively, and the stratification based on the presence or absence of PNI did not allow us to identify different prognostic groups. Here is a summary by The \"NEW\" Prostate Cancer Infolink: http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...me-of-surgery/ who stated: This study appears to suggest that the prognostic impact of PNI on risk for progressive prostate cancer is actually much lower than has been assumed in the past. So, I believe mom2two should not worry too much about the PNI finding in the pathology report. Peace.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LILDOG We all know that positive margins are an adverse finding on the path report after prostate surgery but do they always result in BCR ? Your thoughts and literature if available to back up your answer please ! Let me comment/speculate as a layperson: 1. As Dr. Walsh said in his book, the act of cutting away might kill off cancer cells that were left behind from the positive surgical margins. So BCR is not a given. 2. Most surgeons recommend not start radiation right away when positive margins are < a few mm as they may not cause BCR. 3. I watched a number of Da Vinci prostatectomy videos and noticed differences in surgical techniques of different surgeons. Most surgeons used a combination of Thermal Dissection and Athermal Dissection. In addition, after cutting out the prostate, often, some surgeons \"cleaned up\" the area around the void and removing \"debris\" before attaching the urethra to the bladder. If the positive surgical margin is small my speculation is that in using Thermal Dissection, and in cleaning up, the remaining cancer cells might perish or be removed. This is pure speculation on my part and have no medical basis. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "ILance, Your pathology report looks very good but sorry you keep having penis pain. Not knowing any details and not a healthcare professional mean I can only speculate and give you perhaps some suggestions. First is to see if you can get a copy of the surgeon's surgical notes. Many surgeons have written reports after surgery to record what they did. If it is available, you might be able to see what challenges the surgeon faced during surgery and if he encountered any challenges with nerve sparing, etc. especially since you had extraprostatic extension, as pain could be nerve damage related. Second, pains in certain areas after surgery are very common, after all, this is a major surgery, one of the most complex surgeries in medicine. We all had some pains here and there. I had some penis discomforts/aches and swelling scrotum but they went away after a few weeks. 4 months is a little long but probably not out of the normal range of surgical after effects. Third, you did not say what type of aches are you encountering? dull aches, dull discomforts, sharp pains, continuous vs occasional, are they there during certain activities and conditions. Usually, a sharp pain needs attention right away and dull aches can wait. You need to let your doctor know exactly what you are having. The fact that when you drank a lot of beer and the pain went away is a good sign. Perhaps that means it might go away eventually. Give yourself time, drink a lot of fluid to stay hydrated and take things easy for a while. Fourth, in addition to UTI, there is one potential post surgery problem that might also cause some pains in that part of the body: a lymphocele that accumulates fluid and thus presses on some of the nerves/blood vessels. These are speculations by an untrained layperson and most likely completely off base. I am doing it to provide some talking points for you to talk to your doctor. Please consult your doctor. Good luck.",

They are all quite easy to handle and really not too painful (the biopsy) at all. As for the symptoms, they could mean BPH, inflammation or cancer, with cancer the least likely outcome for someone your age. Your doctor should be able to use the DRE (or later using ultrasound during biopsy), to \"gauge\" the size of your prostate and from that gets an estimate of whether your PSA is \"normal\". You see, there is a general rule of thumb sometimes used by doctors: Prostate Volume x .066 = approximately the PSA #. There are a lot of variabilities but could give you a sense of whether your PSA is \"excessive\". Working backward, a PSA of 2.6 means your prostate size is around 4 cm in diameter, which for your age is as your doctor described, \"biggish\". By the way, a normal size prostate for someone your age is ~2.5cm. Good luck and hope you won't join us.",

      "Content": "robrauy, First of all welcome, second, you should not worry too much, especially about all the diagnostics they are going to perform on you. They are all quite easy to handle and really not too painful (the biopsy) at all. As for the symptoms, they could mean BPH, inflammation or cancer, with cancer the least likely outcome for someone your age. Your doctor should be able to use the DRE (or later using ultrasound during biopsy), to \"gauge\" the size of your prostate and from that gets an estimate of whether your PSA is \"normal\". You see, there is a general rule of thumb sometimes used by doctors: Prostate Volume x .066 = approximately the PSA #. There are a lot of variabilities but could give you a sense of whether your PSA is \"excessive\". Working backward, a PSA of 2.6 means your prostate size is around 4 cm in diameter, which for your age is as your doctor described, \"biggish\". By the way, a normal size prostate for someone your age is ~2.5cm. Good luck and hope you won't join us.",

Welcome back! I highlighted those areas of your concerns. Let me give you my non professional opinion: 1. Don't worry too much about PNI, many studies concluded that those found by post op pathology report that are within the prostate did not increase the chances of recurrence. 2. The finding on EPE, and surgical margins etc. seemed conflicting but that is very good news. Apparently, there were EPE of soft tissues involvements, but his surgeon made a wide cut and took out all of the cancer tissues and that was why all the final inked margins were deemed negative. 3. There were no lymph nodes, seminal vesicles or other areas where cancer invaded. 4. That is why first PSA was undetectable, the surgeon did a good job. Overall a very good pathology report. Let's hope he will continue to have undetectable PSA. If you are not comfortable, get a second opinion from an oncologist about whether it still makes sense to do any adjuvant treatments.

No surgery turmor was to large. Gleason score 9. Spread to lymph nodes in 2009 and to bones in March 2014. We are still talking, thinking and praying on what to do. Carol My heart goes out to you and your husband. If you folks are near the U of Michigan and have not done so, you may want to consult with the oncologists there to see if his cancer can be controlled better: Dr. Maha Hussian or Dr. Ken Pienta came to my mind, both are at the U of Michigan, both published extensively on prostate cancer research and may be able to provide some out of the box thinking. Every prostate cancer case is different so treatment needs to tailor to each individual. A good oncologist is very important in managing the outcome. I believe the endgame is still far far away so don't give up and keep on fighting. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "RTS, Sorry you are joining us but welcome. My suggestion is instead of worrying about your diet, first order is to understand your cancer stage and condition; formulate with your doctor a treatment approach, then worry about what diet to follow. If you already have cancer, it is not likely that diet will cure your cancer. I have not found any scientific evidences to substantiate those claims of cures. That said, I agree with the others, if a diet \"do no harm\" go ahead if you like to do it but do not risk your life on a diet cure. Just my personal opinion. By the way, your cancer seemed to be early stage (G6) and if the clinical staging indicated it is organ confined, you have a high probability of cure if you choose a good treatment plan. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind The study linked below made big waves when it was first published. I think it's just as valid now as it was 1.5 years ago .. http://www.prostatecancertreatmentce...tudyGroup.aspx Fairwind, I have no doubt the results are valid but we have to be a little careful about the conclusions. There are usually some study biases in any study no matter how careful the researchers scoped and framed the study. For example, the results are valid for the surgeons they selected for the study just as valid as the brachy practitioners they selected. Dr. Grimm is one of the best, if not the best brachy physicians in the world and his associates are up there too. If I selected brachy, he would be my first choice. If Dr. Walsh compared his and Johns Hopkins' results to the typical brachy oncologist, they are probably better or at least comparable. I compared the 2011 published Johns Hopkins 30 years survival results to your study and the Johns Hopkins' surgery outcome were better than the one you quoted and their survival results spanned 30 years. My own opinion is that in the hands of a good practitioner, all three treatment methods perform about equally well. Perhaps, brachy should produce the least side effects just because of the physics of the method. I almost went for brachy after I read Andy Grove's account of his research for his prostate cancer but my prostate was too large and I wanted to see the final pathology. Peace and cheers.",

Andy Grove, the former Chairman and CEO of Intel had prostate cancer back in the mid 1990s and after extensive research selected brachy as his first line treatment. Fortune published an article in 1996 on his journey and his rationales for selecting brachy. I went through very similar reasonings, read the Fortune article but ended up selecting surgery. Truly, there are more than one way to skin a cat. If you selected brachy, you won't go wrong. Just make sure you pick an experienced radiation oncologist. Good luck.",

But the initial report said they got it all.... The doctor did not say if it was in lymphnodes etc...does this mean it spread? All bone/cat scans came back fine. Thanks for any insight! rooster, Your post does not make sense to us. If pathology came back all clear, how did the doctor concluded that \"a couple of cells escaped\"? Was it because of post Op PSA reading not \"zero\"? If PSA post Op is not zero, it certainly is not \"a couple of cells escaped\". You and your Dad need to get hold of the pathology report and read it. Or, it you like post it here and perhaps the others can look at it and comment.",

If it worked as hope, this type of tests should cut down on unnecessary treatment and at the same time provide early detection for those that really need it.

For most of us the gamble that it was indolent even with high probability was not an option we wanted to take, thus most chose treatment and some suffered from unwanted side effects unnecessarily.",

I hope they can find a combination medications that could work for him. My understanding is with so many different treatment options, it is not clear what combination or sequence will work best for your Dad. For example, one review article (http://www.jnccn.org/content/12/5S/773.short) stated: During the past 4 years, a host of new agents have been approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. As a result, selecting the right agent for the right patient at the right time is a clinical challenge. At the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. Celestia Higano explored the rationale behind such therapeutic decisions and the supporting clinical trial data. She reviewed the different classes of therapeutic agents, from immunotherapy and hormonal therapies to chemotherapy and radioisotopes, and offered suggestions for the clinical scenarios in which they may be used most successfully. Therefore someone with experience like MDA could be most helpful. Best wishes.",

I had asymptomatic lymphocele for three years but this last July, the abscess was infected and turned sepsis. It almost killed me. I was hospitalized in intensive care with a drain tube in my stomach, 24/7 iv antibiotics and anti-fungal drugs. Home iv antibiotics until infection cleared up. I will need to get periodic CT scan to make sure it does not recur. It is one of the risks most surgeons do not mention. The IR radiologists who did the drainage told me it was more common than a lot of surgeons admitted. That said, if I were to do it over again, I would still want the lymph nodes out - I believe in the points njs said, it is still worth the risks. Best of luck to you",

But the initial report said they got it all.... The doctor did not say if it was in lymphnodes etc...does this mean it spread? All bone/cat scans came back fine. Thanks for any insight! rooster, Your post does not make sense to us. If pathology came back all clear, how did the doctor concluded that \"a couple of cells escaped\"? Was it because of post Op PSA reading not \"zero\"? If PSA post Op is not zero, it certainly is not \"a couple of cells escaped\". You and your Dad need to get hold of the pathology report and read it. Or, it you like post it here and perhaps the others can look at it and comment.",

Andy Grove, the former Chairman and CEO of Intel had prostate cancer back in the mid 1990s and after extensive research selected brachy as his first line treatment. Fortune published an article in 1996 on his journey and his rationales for selecting brachy. I went through very similar reasonings, read the Fortune article but ended up selecting surgery. Truly, there are more than one way to skin a cat. If you selected brachy, you won't go wrong. Just make sure you pick an experienced radiation oncologist. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Harding, I don't think you should worry as long as the PSA continues to drop. What is killing your cancer cells is the radiation and for most folks it takes a while for the effects to fully deploy. You are at less than three months and that is early. It is not uncommon to take 1 to 2 years. Also, since you are really not on ADT but is naturally low on T, intuitively I think the effects are not the same as there should be no drastic drop from suddenly starting ADT, as is typical of people on combined radiation and ADT. I think your RO is correct. I think your treatment is successful and you just have to be patient. Good luck and best wishes.",

He has never shown any signs of having cancer and now has extremely aggressive liver mets. Based on his genotesting, the new PD-1 drug could work for my Father, but he needs to get into a clinical trial. It is his only option. Has anyone had the drug or know of any available trials. Thank you in advance! IMHO, you did not provide us enough information to comment on whether joining the PD-1 clinical trial is right for him. The obvious question is has he exhausted all available options including all of the modern drugs, immunotherapy, chemo, etc.? Sometimes, trying different sequencing, different combinations (e.g. combined chemo and hormone) work well for some patients. Getting advice from a medical oncologist specializing in treating prostate cancer is perhaps the next step. He/she can also help sign him up for the PD-1 clinical trial. Best wishes.",

Looks like your father's cancer is under control, so, before spending large sum of money for new drugs, perhaps his doctor should keep trying combinations of existing medications. The top oncologists in the US like Myers, Scholz, Lee et al, are able to use combinations, sometimes inexpensive drugs to keep cancer under control, some for years. Perhaps you should discuss with his doctor about a consult with those oncologists. Hope this buys you time so that in a couple of years generics should be available in India and should be reasonably priced. Good luck.",

There is a reason other than hype that 80+% of prostatectomy are now robotic. In my non professional opinion, robotic allows for more precision because the mechanical arms have more degrees of freedom, smaller steadier movements, and color 3D, 10X magnification view which more than compensate for lack of feel of the surgeon's hands. An analogy would be machine soldering vs hand soldering of electronic boards. That said, the surgeon operates the machine so make sure you find the best operator to work on you. Good luck.",

I really feel for you and your Dad. However, lancepeace made a good point. There maybe other medications he can try before resorting to Zytiga, Jevtana, Xtandi... Looks like your father's cancer is under control, so, before spending large sum of money for new drugs, perhaps his doctor should keep trying combinations of existing medications. The top oncologists in the US like Myers, Scholz, Lee et al, are able to use combinations, sometimes inexpensive drugs to keep cancer under control, some for years. Perhaps you should discuss with his doctor about a consult with those oncologists. Hope this buys you time so that in a couple of years generics should be available in India and should be reasonably priced. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Cvmiller My question is which is the better of the types of surgery, robotic or open prostectomy. Welcome. To specifically answer your question, go robotic. There is a reason other than hype that 80+% of prostatectomy are now robotic. In my non professional opinion, robotic allows for more precision because the mechanical arms have more degrees of freedom, smaller steadier movements, and color 3D, 10X magnification view which more than compensate for lack of feel of the surgeon's hands. An analogy would be machine soldering vs hand soldering of electronic boards. That said, the surgeon operates the machine so make sure you find the best operator to work on you. Good luck.",

The author, Stephen Feller, makes the statement: \"Although studies have suggested PSA tests give false positives too often and can miss tumors, the tests have been used to detect or predict prostate cancer since the early 1990s.\" Either he is highly misinformed or I've accidentally clicked onto the wrong Forum! A far better summary appeared in Uro-Today: \"Results of a number of studies demonstrate that the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in and of itself is an inadequate screening test. Today, one of the most pressing questions in prostate cancer medicine is how can screening be honed to identify those who have life-threatening disease and need aggressive treatment.\" As we are witnessing the field of genomic testing advance at a rapid rate, medical science is getting us all closer to answering: The BIG PCa Question = \"How to discriminate between lethal and non lethal PC?\" I greatly look forward to the answer. MF The study was hot off the press so represented the latest and the author was MA Preston: Preston MA et al. \u0093Baseline Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in Midlife Predict Lethal Prostate Cancer,\u0094 Journal of Clinical Oncology DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2016.66.7527 I did not read the original paper but according to Harvard School of Public Health, here is the summary: The researchers found that this single, baseline PSA level measured at midlife could accurately predict future risk of prostate cancer: Of the lethal prostate cancer events, 82 percent, 71 percent and 86 percent occurred in men with a baseline PSA above the median at ages 40-49, 50-54 and 55-59, respectively.",

If your parents let you, you should accompany them to the follow up appointment and help ask questions to prepare for follow up actions if necessary. Here are some of the questions to ask: 1. Ask the urologist for a copy of the full pathology report (if you only have the summary report) and explain the findings, e.g., if the surgical margins were positive/negative (negative is good); if there were spreads outside the prostate (EPE), seminal vesicles, lymph nodes, etc. and the staging T2, T3, etc. 2. If he had a PET scan (not pre op CT & bone scans) post surgery, ask for the finding of and explain the scan results. 3. Ask for what sort of follow up actions are required and treatment options, what ifs. 4. Ask to refer to a medical oncologist and a radiation oncologist for second and third opinions. To educate yourself, go read the book by Dr. Pat Walsh on Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. Good luck and best wishes.",

BJU Int. 2006 Sep;98(3):573-9 Efficacy of primary hormone therapy for localized or locally advanced prostate cancer: results of a 10-year follow-up.

The outcome seemed too good to me: Out of 347, treatment side had 63 fatalities and out of 348 on the AS side, had 99 fatalities. It is like every 9 you treated early, you saved 1 extra live. Much better outcome than the USPSTF's position that every 1000 you save 1. So, something does not add up. Let me read the journal article before I make any further comments. Regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F TY for the confounding info newporter! The author, Stephen Feller, makes the statement: \"Although studies have suggested PSA tests give false positives too often and can miss tumors, the tests have been used to detect or predict prostate cancer since the early 1990s.\" Either he is highly misinformed or I've accidentally clicked onto the wrong Forum! A far better summary appeared in Uro-Today: \"Results of a number of studies demonstrate that the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in and of itself is an inadequate screening test. Today, one of the most pressing questions in prostate cancer medicine is how can screening be honed to identify those who have life-threatening disease and need aggressive treatment.\" As we are witnessing the field of genomic testing advance at a rapid rate, medical science is getting us all closer to answering: The BIG PCa Question = \"How to discriminate between lethal and non lethal PC?\" I greatly look forward to the answer. MF The study was hot off the press so represented the latest and the author was MA Preston: Preston MA et al. \u0093Baseline Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in Midlife Predict Lethal Prostate Cancer,\u0094 Journal of Clinical Oncology DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2016.66.7527 I did not read the original paper but according to Harvard School of Public Health, here is the summary: The researchers found that this single, baseline PSA level measured at midlife could accurately predict future risk of prostate cancer: Of the lethal prostate cancer events, 82 percent, 71 percent and 86 percent occurred in men with a baseline PSA above the median at ages 40-49, 50-54 and 55-59, respectively.",

      "Content": "ronjem, How high was your PSA? When I was researching treatment options, my urologist told me the primary consideration for brachy was prostate size and that mine was too enlarged for brachy and neither my PSA of >10 nor my Gleason were factors. As JohnT said, I now know that I could have brachy if I took hormone to shrink the prostate prior to seeding. However, like surgery, seeding success depends greatly on the skill of the radiation oncologist. I think this is one of the confusion on the success rate of seeds. For example, if you research the success rate of great radiation oncologists in Seatle, Southern and Northern Cal... you find excellent outcomes that were better than surgery but general published results were a little different. By the way, this is the same with surgery if you compare Dr. Walsh's results vs generally published results. In your case, perhaps a combination of hormone+brachy+IMRT, like what JohyT had is the best option for you. Make sure you consult a radiation oncologist and an oncologist. Good luck.",

      "Content": "There were a lot of discussions on this topic in a number of threads lately. However, I think most on both sides just hand waved and didn't back up their claims one way or another. Let me try to present some numbers from a number of recent studies in medical journals. I don't claim the studies were unbiased and let the readers decide for themselves. There is a June 2010 publication I collected (right at the time my urologist told me I had prostate cancer so it was timely for me) from the journal Therapeutic Advances in Urology:2(3)119-125. It was a review paper, namely it reviewed a bunch of studies and summarized their outcome in the paper and drew some conclusions and those that are technically inclined will spot some inconsistencies in the studies and conclusions: 1. The incidences of secondary primary cancer after radiation therapy was 1/70 (1.4%). The most common sites were bladder and rectum. 2. The latency period between radiation therapy and malignancies were between 5 and 15 years. 3. One study in 2006 cited National Cancer Institute's SEER data and concluded the incidences were 9.9% after treatment (I think the results were from the early 1970s to 2002). It said the risks were greatest for EBRT and least for brachy and in between for brachy+EBRT. Another study indicated brachy did not significantly increase the risk. 4. Epidemiological studies indicated the risk of bladder cancer is 5% to 6% vs 3.7% for surgery patients. 5. The authors' conclusions were that the risk is real but modest however they question the use of radiation therapy for low risk prostate cancer patients with minimal risk of dying from prostate cancer because of the adversed effects. I took a look at the SEER database on bladder and colorectal cancer and found some inconsistent statistics: The lifetime risks of bladder cancer was 2.4% and colorectal cancer was 4.8%. But if you sum the incidences by age, the total incidence was only about 2% for colorectal cancer and 1% for bladder cancer. If you double the numbers, for radiation patients, 2% incidence for bladder cancer and 4% for colorectal cancer for a total of 6% for bladder and colorectal cancer combined. A side note, the often quoted risks of dying from prostate cancer surgery was 1-2%, also not insignificant. I welcome others to show statistics that are different.",

That seemed like a much larger % than reported elsewhere but since I do not have the full article yet and cannot determine the detail of their study regarding upgrade criteria. By the way, I checked your link and it was no longer active. Regards,",

      "Content": "Researchers from Cambridge University in UK published an article in the British Journal of Cancer in January 2014, claimed that the current tools of PSA, biopsy etc. did not accurately select the right candidates for AS. The link: http://www.nature.com/bjc/journal/va...c2014192a.html Here is a summary of their finding: Results: Of 848 patients, 415 had Gleason 3+3 disease on biopsy. Of these, 32.0% had extra-prostatic extension and 50.2% were upgraded. One had positive lymph nodes. Two hundred and six (24% of cohort) were D\u0092Amico low risk. Of these, 143 had more than two biopsy cores involved. None of the tools evaluated has adequate discriminative power in predicting insignificant tumour burden. Accuracy is low in PSA-screened and -unscreened populations. Their conclusion: We need better tools in order to select the right candidates to practice AS. The authors were not against AS, they just concluded that the diagnostic tools we currently have are not too accurate in predicting staging and severity of cancer and therefore may not get the right patients to practice AS.",

      "Content": "I think you won't find too many surgeon's peer reviewed surgical outcome studies nowadays. In the early days of robotic surgery (prior to 2010) pioneering surgeons did published a lot of their statistics but now most don't. Many surgeons (mine for one) keep their own unaudited statistics and are willing to share with prospective patients. I ended up not using any of the surgeons that published but a local guy willing to share statistics and patients references. Some interesting recently published global statistics are that robotics are actually better than open and that high volume surgeons performed better than low volume ones. Also, we are all obsessed with PSM (I was) but it turned out PSM was not a strong predictor of overall survival but cancer characteristics was. First of all, volume is a strong predictor of PSM, i.e., # performed per year is an important determinant of outcome. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771246 High volume surgeons have less peri-operative and postoperative complications and better surgical and disease-free outcomes than low volume surgeons. In the UK, raising the current minimum Improving Outcomes Guidance threshold from five RP cases per surgeon per annum to no less than 20 (and ideally to 35 or more cases per annum) could potentially improve overall outcomes. Second, it takes a long time and a large number of operations for surgeon to be proficient, and they are not talking about a hundred but a thousand! Also, their conclusion was the same as the UK study that tumor characteristics determined PSM. http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingC...e/ASCOGU/24908 The principal outcomes of interest were the rate of positive surgical margins and operative time. Surgical performance was evaluated after every 50 RALP procedures. For all cases, positive-margin rate started at about 20% and then gradually declined to less than 10% after 1,600 total cases. At the end of the six-year review period, rate remained in a downward trajectory, suggesting continuation of the learning curve, said Sooriakumaran. For the subgroup of patients with extracapsular disease (pT3), the positive-margin rate began at about 40% and remained stable throughout the study period. Third, here is an interesting statistics about positive surgical margin and overall survival: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2490/14/86 This is their Conclusions: More aggressive tumor characteristics were strong determinants for positive margins. Furthermore, surgical margin status per se was not an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer-specific survival after adjusting by the gravity of the disease in the multivariate analysis. Ten-year PCSS (prostate cancer specific survival) was 96.6% [95% CI: 94.3-98.] for the negative surgical group, and 92.0% (95% CI: 88.5-95.4) for the PSM group [log rank p\u2009=\u20090.008]. What they were saying was that PSM was more associated with patients' tumor staging than anything else. What you need is to find a high volume surgeon. If I use this to predict your outcome, most likely with a high volume surgeon your chance of PSM is very small (<10%) and even if you have PSM, your overall 10 year survival will not be very different from those of us with NPSM. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo This is not helpful for those who already went through seeds or radiation.... ddayglo, It is actually helpful. The two numbers you need to focus on are: For radiation treatment, the secondary cancer rate was 1.4% For surgery, the mortality rate was ~1-2% All the other studies, claims are somewhat contradictory. In other words, the \"bad things\" that can happen are about equal. So, for the uninformed, it makes no difference. The reason I chose surgery was not secondary cancer but that I could control the 1-2% mortality rate by being fit, no prior abdominal operations, no heart problems, no obesity and find a good surgeon, etc. whereas I was not sure I could control the secondary cancer rate. Hope this answers your concerns.",

If that were true most patients who chose robotic surgery were doomed to BCR failure but I just don't see the statistics indicating such.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by blank If the article is flawed then we should point out its flaws. If it isn't men should know. I read the article. It is a sample of three surgeons. I don't think 3 is a sufficient sample size for a statistical analysis and draw general conclusions. Also, one might confuse improvement with proficiency. One notable surgeon, Dr. Walsh, constantly tried to improve his technique. He mentioned in his book that he video taped his surgery and watched them to see how he could keep improving the outcome and that he constantly improved his outcome. His last surgery statistics were phenomenal, better than his prior results. I would consider someone proficient once his outcome reaches an inflection point, namely at that point no further improvements are achieved while using the same technique and that the outcome equalled standard outcome. I consider improvement when he figured out a way to achieve better outcome than the general standard. One example is surgeons figured out how to use \"cold\" scissors instead of the normal \"hot\" cut and thus improved the ED rate by reducing nerve damage.... And this, a few years after they used Da Vinci so according to this article they were still learning and not proficient. I am happy surgeons can constantly improve their techniques so that those come after us reap the benefits, just like radiation oncologists constantly improve on theirs. Thanks for your post. It is good to present different data to share with us so we all can learn something new.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by blank If the article is flawed then we should point out its flaws. If it isn't men should know. I read the article. It is a sample of three surgeons. I don't think 3 is a sufficient sample size for a statistical analysis and draw general conclusions. Also, one might confuse improvement with proficiency. One notable surgeon, Dr. Walsh, constantly tried to improve his technique. He mentioned in his book that he video taped his surgery and watched them to see how he could keep improving the outcome and that he constantly improved his outcome. His last surgery statistics were phenomenal, better than his prior results. I would consider someone proficient once his outcome reaches an inflection point, namely at that point no further improvements are achieved while using the same technique and that the outcome equalled standard outcome. I consider improvement when he figured out a way to achieve better outcome than the general standard. One example is surgeons figured out how to use \"cold\" scissors instead of the normal \"hot\" cut and thus improved the ED rate by reducing nerve damage.... And this, a few years after they used Da Vinci so according to this article they were still learning and not proficient. I am happy surgeons can constantly improve their techniques so that those come after us reap the benefits, just like radiation oncologists constantly improve on theirs. Thanks for your post. It is good to present different data to share with us so we all can learn something new.",

      "Content": "Welcome to our club. We know how you feel - been there, done that - your feeling is normal. With a G7, and all right cores positive, you need treatment soon. Usually surgeons won't perform prostatectomy until 8 weeks after biopsy since right now the prostate is like a pin cushion and it takes time to heal so the surgeon won't miss anything when he/she opens you up. I used your numbers and ran the MSK nomogram, you have less than 10% probability the cancer spread to other organs including the seminal vesicles and lymph nodes and that is excellent odds in my book. So, the good news is you caught it early. If you select surgery, 15 year cancer specific survival (your chance of not dying from prostate cancer) is 99%. radiation should give you similar odds. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Brett Trommler I was diagnosed with prostate cancer back in February. Fortunately it was a very early detection; only 10% on one of the twelve cores of the biopsy. I was blessed to be able to receive cyberknife treatment in April and when I was tested in August, my PSA was down to 2.8 which is almost normal for me. Well, I was tested again a couple weeks ago and now my PSA is up to 4.6 which is higher than it's ever been. My oncologist is hopeful that it is only an infection and I have just completed a round of strong antibiotics and will be retested in a couple weeks. My question is... will sexual activity affect the PSA? I did ask the doctor if my wife could be intimate during this whole process and she said that was no problem. But I am wondering if that may be what's causing the high PSA reading. Because quite honestly, things have never felt quite... normal, during sex or otherwise, since the cyberknife treatment. Brett, Welcome. There is something called PSA bounce after radiation treatment, i.e., the PSA will go up and down, sometimes a few times but the general trend after the first bounce is down. I don't know if the first bounce can get higher than the PSA prior to treatment but am not surprise if it does. Your current PSA about 6-12 months after radiation treatment could be a case of PSA bounce. The next couple of PSA tests will indicate if you have a bounce or if it is something else. Your cancer seemed to be early stage. We don't know your biopsy history (e.g. Gleason score, staging etc.) so don't know how aggressive is your cancer. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "I think you won't find too many surgeon's peer reviewed surgical outcome studies nowadays. In the early days of robotic surgery (prior to 2010) pioneering surgeons did published a lot of their statistics but now most don't. Many surgeons (mine for one) keep their own unaudited statistics and are willing to share with prospective patients. I ended up not using any of the surgeons that published but a local guy willing to share statistics and patients references. Some interesting recently published global statistics are that robotics are actually better than open and that high volume surgeons performed better than low volume ones. Also, we are all obsessed with PSM (I was) but it turned out PSM was not a strong predictor of overall survival but cancer characteristics was. First of all, volume is a strong predictor of PSM, i.e., # performed per year is an important determinant of outcome. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21771246 High volume surgeons have less peri-operative and postoperative complications and better surgical and disease-free outcomes than low volume surgeons. In the UK, raising the current minimum Improving Outcomes Guidance threshold from five RP cases per surgeon per annum to no less than 20 (and ideally to 35 or more cases per annum) could potentially improve overall outcomes. Second, it takes a long time and a large number of operations for surgeon to be proficient, and they are not talking about a hundred but a thousand! Also, their conclusion was the same as the UK study that tumor characteristics determined PSM. http://www.medpagetoday.com/MeetingC...e/ASCOGU/24908 The principal outcomes of interest were the rate of positive surgical margins and operative time. Surgical performance was evaluated after every 50 RALP procedures. For all cases, positive-margin rate started at about 20% and then gradually declined to less than 10% after 1,600 total cases. At the end of the six-year review period, rate remained in a downward trajectory, suggesting continuation of the learning curve, said Sooriakumaran. For the subgroup of patients with extracapsular disease (pT3), the positive-margin rate began at about 40% and remained stable throughout the study period. Third, here is an interesting statistics about positive surgical margin and overall survival: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2490/14/86 This is their Conclusions: More aggressive tumor characteristics were strong determinants for positive margins. Furthermore, surgical margin status per se was not an independent prognostic factor for prostate cancer-specific survival after adjusting by the gravity of the disease in the multivariate analysis. Ten-year PCSS (prostate cancer specific survival) was 96.6% [95% CI: 94.3-98.] for the negative surgical group, and 92.0% (95% CI: 88.5-95.4) for the PSM group [log rank p\u2009=\u20090.008]. What they were saying was that PSM was more associated with patients' tumor staging than anything else. What you need is to find a high volume surgeon. If I use this to predict your outcome, most likely with a high volume surgeon your chance of PSM is very small (<10%) and even if you have PSM, your overall 10 year survival will not be very different from those of us with NPSM. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "When it comes to PSA testing after surgery, it can be confusing because different testing lab uses different machine with different sensitivity (resolution), some has sensitivity of .1, others .01, etc. What you should look for is the < sign in front of the PSA number, for example, if the machine sensitivity is .1, anything less than .1 is considered undetectable, < .1, = 0. Your tests were done with an ultra sensitive machine and there were no < sign in front of the PSA numbers meaning your PSA were not 0. Does it means your cancer is back? Not necessarily. Sometimes, some benign tissues were left behind and so the PSA was not 0. There were a few posters on this site had this happened to them. However, in those cases, PSA stabilized to a small number and stayed there. That is also why the medical community considers recurrence only after three successive number of > .1 and PSA reaches .2 or greater. My advice is to watch your PSA carefully and start to prepare for plan B just in case, i.e., prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Plan B should include consultation with an oncologist and a radiation oncologist as Fairwind stated. Good luck.",

      "Content": "When it comes to PSA testing after surgery, it can be confusing because different testing lab uses different machine with different sensitivity (resolution), some has sensitivity of .1, others .01, etc. What you should look for is the < sign in front of the PSA number, for example, if the machine sensitivity is .1, anything less than .1 is considered undetectable, < .1, = 0. Your tests were done with an ultra sensitive machine and there were no < sign in front of the PSA numbers meaning your PSA were not 0. Does it means your cancer is back? Not necessarily. Sometimes, some benign tissues were left behind and so the PSA was not 0. There were a few posters on this site had this happened to them. However, in those cases, PSA stabilized to a small number and stayed there. That is also why the medical community considers recurrence only after three successive number of > .1 and PSA reaches .2 or greater. My advice is to watch your PSA carefully and start to prepare for plan B just in case, i.e., prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Plan B should include consultation with an oncologist and a radiation oncologist as Fairwind stated. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Your husband's pathology report did state that the one lymph node positive is microscopic, so, like all the other posters said, if I were you folks, I would still shoot for a cure: adjuvant radiation to the prostate bed and lymph nodes areas and ADT. There are a number of studies indicating adjuvant radiation and ADT after a failed surgery increased the chances of cure and survival. Also, as JNF said, some oncologists believed and practiced spot radiation to a few affected spots and claimed to have good outcome. Agree with Fairwind that you folks need to consult with an oncologist, one that specializes in prostate caner. Good luck and hope everything works out for you folks.",

Beginning immediately after the surgery I noticed a significant change in my urine -it is cloudy and smells horrible. I have talked to my doctors and am being told that the only thing that could cause this is dietary changes, of which there haven't been any. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? maplessr, First thing to try: drink a lot of water to see if that can flush things out. If persist, get a second opinion. cloudy and smelly urine could indicate infection. So, perhaps ask for a urine analysis. There could be other causes and a blood test might also be appropriate.

      "Content": "poppygirl, Sorry you have to be here but welcome. A PSA of 5.3 by itself coupled with an enlarged prostate could be normal and not necessarily prostate cancer. As for a \"positive\" DRE, you have two conflicting results: First consultant stated prostate was enlarged but smooth indicating normal. The second felt one side \"rigid\" but he really did not feel a \"nodule\" and that could be due to inflammation from the first DRE disturbing the prostate too much and the subsequent high (5.3) PSA could be due to that also. That said, a biopsy is probably a smart thing to do to rule out cancer. Biopsy is uncomfortable but not painful and many of us had multiple biopsies over the years. Even if he has cancer and has to join our club, it is not a death sentence. We survived and thrived after diagnosis. So, look at the bright side and wait for the biopsy result. In the unfortunate case that he tested positive, come back and many of us would be happy to be helpful, share our experiences and opinions. I am not a healthcare professional and my opinions are just opinions and not professional advices. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by nrhk Thanks Michael F and Highlander for your responses and your support. We did his next chemo today. He does have nail discoloring, but thankfully no other bad symptoms. The team of oncologists decided that since his PSA is going up, it could be one of two things - a flare from the catheterization, or perhaps the chemo isnt working to control the cancer. They have advised we should do a repeat bone scan, chest XRay and a CECT abdomen in two weeks, and another PSA before the next chemo to figure out what is going on. I really hope and pray that the cancer hasnt spread to the organs, that would really suck. There is another possibility, sometimes at this stage immediate PSA is not a good indicator of whether the treatment is working. The fact that your dad's pain is gone and he seemed responding well is a good sign to me and may be they should finish the chemo before doing anything else. Also, after first line hormone e.g. Lupron, fails, new classes of hormone still work, e.g. Zytiga and Xtandi because they act on different sites on the cancer cells. I am wondering if it makes sense to add them to the treatment protocol at this stage? I am a layperson so all these are just pure speculations on my part. Best wishes.",

This has been an ongoing battle between radiologists and urologists for years. JohnT, It is interesting that radiologists perform most biopsies, like breast, liver, kidney...except prostate. My personal belief is that radiologists are trained in diagnostics and should be more competent in performing biopsies. In fact my final biopsy that detected cancer was done by a radiologist. He was a lot more careful and spent more time examining the ultrasound image while conducting the biopsy. In any case, if the DRE was positive, usually a biopsy was called for.

      "Content": "Let me add my comments to what Michael and highlander said: 1. It is always advisable to get a second opinion both for a re-read of the biopsy slides and the treatment options. It may change the approaches to treatment. 2. With a PSA of 30 and a diagnosis of t3, it is likely the cancer may have grown outside the prostate and it that case the radiation + hormone is as food if not superior to surgery since there is a high probability that radiation is needed after surgery to clean up the cancer outside. 3. Radiation two months after the start of hormone is a standard protocol. It serves two purposes: Sensitizes the cancer cells to radiations for easier kill; shrink the prostate so radiations can be more effective. many studies confirmed the advantages. 4. You need to ask what mode of radiations is the doctor talking about as there are many different protocols. Seeds, IMRT, EBRT are the most common and sometimes they combine seeds + IMRT. For large prostates, IMRT or EBRT are more appropriate. By the way seeds are not appropriate for large prostate. 5. Sounded to me his doctor is very up to date on the subject and the approach is appropriate so don't worry too much. The one thing I would worry if he agrees to go the radiation route is the equipment is critical. Older generations of radiation equipment are just not as good and precise and the side effects/damages to surrounding tissues are worse. So make sure he gets the latest and best equipment. I am just a layperson so my opinions are not advices. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "The cost of a biopsy is not cheap, ~ a couple of thousands, maybe more if you do not have insurance as hospitals charge more if you do not have insurance. As your doctor would have told you, there are three possibilities for a high PSA: enlarged prostate, infection/inflammation and cancer. Your DRE should tell you if you have enlarged prostate and gave you a size estimate which could be used to estimate PSA due to a large prostate. In addition, chronic inflammation also causes high PSA, sometimes abnormal DRE and is difficult to get rid of even with Cipro (mine was never cured by Cipro). A PSA of 8.5 may not indicate cancer but is certainly a concern. For sure if the next PSA increases another 1 or 2 points, you should get a biopsy. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by johnT Most urologists will not recommend scans in lieu of a biopsy, because they are usually done by radiologists and not urologists. This has been an ongoing battle between radiologists and urologists for years. JohnT, It is interesting that radiologists perform most biopsies, like breast, liver, kidney...except prostate. My personal belief is that radiologists are trained in diagnostics and should be more competent in performing biopsies. In fact my final biopsy that detected cancer was done by a radiologist. He was a lot more careful and spent more time examining the ultrasound image while conducting the biopsy. In any case, if the DRE was positive, usually a biopsy was called for. By the way, I agree with your other comments.",

They do provide 10mg valium and one percocet First and foremost, follow the instructions to make sure your bowel is clean otherwise you increase the chance of infection. Second, take the antibiotics as instructed. If I were you, I would request them to numb the site before the actual biopsy so there will be minimal pain and discomfort. Old urologists claimed there were no nerves there and so not painful. They were wrong. Now, numbing the site should be a normal procedure. Good luck.",

      "Content": "SeaCock, There were a number of very old threads on this site discussing this issue and I recalled a gentleman discussed using T replacement after prostate cancer treatment and without ill effect. Here are my logics for and against: 1. Hormone therapy starves cancer cells that feed off testosterone and is able to shrink the tumor as a result. So, if there are still cancer cells in your body after surgery, don't feed the cancer with T replacement. 2. On the other hand, if after surgery, your PSA is undetectable for a prolong period of time, it means there are no more cancer cells or prostate cells. In that case T replacement should not be an issue. As for the finer points of pros and cons, here are articles discussing this very subject in case you are interested: http://www.harvardprostateknowledge....rostate-cancer http://www.europeanurology.com/artic...l-implications Regards,",

I did a nomogram for your stats and it came back as 74% probability of organ confined and less than 4% probability of lymph node involvement which are very good odds (better odds than mine prior to treatment). Look at the bright side, you did gain two years of \"normal life\" and it is not too late to take action. Good luck and cheers.",

      "Content": "SeaCock, There were a number of very old threads on this site discussing this issue and I recalled a gentleman discussed using T replacement after prostate cancer treatment and without ill effect. Here are my logics for and against: 1. Hormone therapy starves cancer cells that feed off testosterone and is able to shrink the tumor as a result. So, if there are still cancer cells in your body after surgery, don't feed the cancer with T replacement. 2. On the other hand, if after surgery, your PSA is undetectable for a prolong period of time, it means there are no more cancer cells or prostate cells. In that case T replacement should not be an issue. As for the finer points of pros and cons, here are articles discussing this very subject in case you are interested: http://www.harvardprostateknowledge....rostate-cancer http://www.europeanurology.com/artic...l-implications Regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JustBrandon Hello once again everyone, one topic in prostate cancer I find of particular intrigue, and that is perineural invasion, both in biopsy and surgical pathology. Some articles have mentioned PNI as a negative factor in prognosis, especially if found on biopsy. Other articles have said it is of little significance. What is your take on this? Ill throw it out there that my dad had PNI in both the biopsyand surgical pathology. It was present in the left lobe, but not in the right. JustBrandon, Sorry you are here but welcome. I have not participated in prostate cancer forum for a while and just happened to see your post. Since I had PNI so I was naturally worried after surgery. Like Highlander's post, my surgeon also said it was nothing to worry about. Still, I was worried and so did my own research. There were indeed a number of clinical studies on this subject and indications were PNI was not a predictor of surgery outcome. And, after three and a half years, I am still in remission. If you really want to be technical, here is a summary of one study I kept in my file that indicated such: The prognostic implications of perineural invasion at the time of surgery (Posted on June 23, 2010 @ prostatecancerinfolink.net) A recently published Italian study has reported on whether perineural invasion (PNI) has prognostic value in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for organ-confined prostate cancer, and on its possible correlation with other recognized prognostic factors. Between January 2000 and December 2007, Masieri et al. carried out a careful prospectively designed study and collected data from 251 consecutive patients who had pathologically localized (organ-confined) prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy. Data from 239 of these patients was usable for analysis. The authors defined PNI as adenocarcinoma observed within the perineural space adjacent to a nerve. The results of their study showed that: Intraprostatic PNI occurred in a total of 157/239 patients (65.7 percent). PNI was more commonly observed in men with pathologic stage T2b/c (149/204 patients or 73 percent)) than in men with pathologic stage T2a (8/35 patients or 26 percent). PNI was also more common in men with a Gleason score of 7 to 10 (73/93 patients or 78.5 percent) than in men with a Gleason score of 2 to 6 (84/146 patients or 57 percent). Average (mean) follow-up was 65.4 months (range, 24 to 118 months). 11/239 patients (4.6 percent) had biochemical recurrence after surgery and 7 of these 11 patients (63.6 percent) showed PNI. 228/239 patients (95.4 percent) were free from biochemical progression after surgery and 150 of these 228 patients (65.7 percent) had PNI. The actuarial biochemical progression-free survival rate for all patients was 96.9 percent at 60 months and 93.5 percent at 84 months, respectively. Stratification based on the presence or absence of PNI did not allow for identification of different prognostic groups. The authors conclude that, at least in their series of patients, men with pathological stage T2 disease and PNI were found to present with a higher pT2 stage and Gleason score than men without PNI, but that the biochemical progression-free outcomes among these patients were similar to the outcomes of patients without PNI at a follow up of between 2 and 12 years. This study appears to suggest that the prognostic impact of PNI on risk for progressive prostate cancer is actually much lower than has been assumed in the past. It may well be that as men have increasingly been diagnosed earlier in the progression of their disease, that perineural invasion is a less significant prognostic factor for men with truly localized disease than it has been thought to be for men known to have extraprostatic extension of their disease. In other words, PNI in men with pathological T3/4 disease may have greater prognostic significance than it does in men with pathological T2 disease. Good luck",

However, Frenchy made a good point, when your cancer is aggressive, here in the US, many doctors want to get a jump in case the cancer has not spread and there is time to catch it. One way is get a post op PSA done at 4 to 6 weeks instead of 3 months because in your case time may be important. The second way they try to beat the cancer is to do adjuvant treatment, usually start hormone right away and after a short period of a few months do adjuvant radiation. Of course none of us are healthcare professionals so it is best you discuss all of these with your doctors. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by JD1969 Well last week I had my 1 month follow up. PSA came back at .22 and then a retest a few days later (different lab) showed .24, so it looks like radiation treatment is in my future. For those that have gone through it, what can I expect? Is one month too soon to be looking at PSA numbers? JD1969. Sorry about your PSA results. Looks like your PSA is not undetectable. There are two possibilities: cancer has escaped or some benign prostate tissues may be left behind. Looking at your pathology report summary, looks like you had positive margin on one side with EPE and seminal vesicle involvement so it is possible the cancer has escaped causing the PSA. If all cancer cells and benign cells are out, a one month PSA test should be undetectable. PSA half life in your body is between 2 to 3 days which means with an initial PSA of 10, within 30 days, it should be down to .01 or less. I suggest you consult an oncologist and a radiation oncologist to plan you next attack and hopefully the cancer is still local, in the prostate bed and can be eradicated. No lymph node involvement is a good sign. Again, I am not a healthcare provider so it is just a layperson speculation and could be wrong. Best wishes and good luck.",

Most likely your husband's cancer has been there for a while. The PSA rule of 4 is usually for older folks. For those younger and at risk the cut off is lower. My question is what is the size of his prostate and has he been taking medications like Proscar that masked his PSA #. If his prostate is normal size (~25cc) his PSA should be less than 2 so anything higher is caused by something else, could be infection, inflammation or cancer, indolent or aggressive. In any case from now going forward, focus on treating and managing his cancer to ensure a long remission. Take care.",

For individual cases, most likely the outcome will be a lot better than the statistics cited in the trials. A logical thinking is the combination reduces the chance that cancer cells can mutate into something deathly, cancer cells that is not killed by hormone will be killed by chemo, perhaps similar to the HIV treatment using combination drugs. So, we don't know but he should do a lot better than hormone mono therapy and let's hope for a complete remission, or to a point that allows for other adjuvant therapy. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by chrisz I've been through this PCa scare-thing for 8 years. My PSA keeps going up and down. Up to 15 then next PSA down to 3.0. PSA now 12. Free and Total PSA look bad. Udoc wants another Biopsy. My 3rd Biopsy (one was a saturation biopsy), with my third different Udoc. Lately I have loss my desire for sex, and before that I had the desire, but hard to get an erection. I've tried 3 different ED meds, none help even a little bit. Mdoc and Udoc both did not seem to know why. I am 61 years old. Wife doesn't seem to care that I don't want sex.... In fact, she seems happy. So, do you think PCa can cause this ? I do have BPH, may it could cause it ? ED is one of the symptoms of prostate cancer. However, all prostate cancer symptoms can be caused by other problems like BPH, infection.... To rule out you have cancer at places that the needles cannot get at (and perhaps why the negative biopsy), you need different tests, i.e., PCA3, color doppler, C11 PET scan... To understand what I said, you can look at the human anatomy and see that the transrectal probe and needles can easily access some areas and hard to get at some other areas (frontal, apex and transition zones for example) within the prostate. The other poster's suggestion of getting a second opinion is a good one. It took a radiologist, instead of an urologist, performing the biopsy to find my cancer.",

      "Content": "In the three years after surgery, I had a few bouts of minor UTI. Each time it increased urgency and frequency and caused some dripping after urination. So, UTI is something to watch out for. Then there is the possibility of bladder spasm which in minor cases sometimes has the same effects. Finally, if your stitches are not healing properly or have small scar tissues, they might also cause similar problem. Ask your surgeon if there are additional things you can do (back to Kegel?) or medications you can take. You are only a few weeks out so time will heal most short term problems. Let your body heal. Best to you.",

After a few months, the bladder seemed to learn to get back to its old self and I never had to get up at night anymore. Daytime frequency is now 4-6 hours in between. Looking at your pathology report, your prostate is not that big (mine was twice your size) so should not cause any bladder wall thickening issue. Most likely what you experienced was just effects after surgery and should not be permanent. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "I don't know how you could call prostate cancer a hoax when it is the second leading cancer death among men and in 2014 29480 men will die of it. I for one am thankful there was a PSA test that alerted me to a potential fetal disease and cured me of it. Before PSA tests came along, back in 1975-77, the 5 year survival rate of all prostate cancer patients were ~65% about the same as many other types of cancer like lymphoma, etc. and today it is >98%. I believe the main reason is due to PSA testing and early detection from that. Even today, if you do not take a PSA test and find out about your cancer due to having symptoms, i.e., cancer metastasizes to distant organs, the five year survival rate is <30%. If I were you, I won't ignore my PSA number and if it is high, go do a biopsy which is quite painless and then if positive, decide if you want treatment or not. Peace and best wishes.",

I am sure there are a number of specialists at Harvard, Mass General etc. who are in a better position to help you. You were able to get your PSA down to almost undetectable which is a good sign that many medications should work in your favor. I am wondering the same thing: why stop Casodex so early and why not a triple blockage, combination of Casodex, Lupron and Avodart which had proven to do a better job? Best of luck to you.",

However, Frenchy made a good point, when your cancer is aggressive, here in the US, many doctors want to get a jump in case the cancer has not spread and there is time to catch it. One way is get a post op PSA done at 4 to 6 weeks instead of 3 months because in your case time may be important. The second way they try to beat the cancer is to do adjuvant treatment, usually start hormone right away and after a short period of a few months do adjuvant radiation. Of course none of us are healthcare professionals so it is best you discuss all of these with your doctors. Good luck and best wishes.",

Since there is no universal registry that rates physicians, one of the criteria I look at is how busy the surgeon is. Unfortunately, if he/she is extremely busy, he/she has very little time to answer \"unimportant\" questions (to them, a negative biopsy is not important). My surgeon was very nice when I met with him face to face but it is extremely difficult to get him to return my calls for general discussions/questions. Most of the time it was his PA that returned my calls. If he is very busy, very competent and you trust him, stay with him if not find someone else.",

Shortly after the surgery they discovered an abseced pocket of lymph fluid in his gut that they had to drain for almost a week. now, that appears to be normal but his leg is swelling. It is almost twice the size of his other leg. In other news, while I keep reading that the hormone therapy doesn't offer a cure, according to dad's oncologist, post surgery and after adding the casodex with the shot, dads PET and PSA has come back clean and his PSA in 0. The oncologist says he is currently cancer free, but that they must monitor it because it will most likely return in the future. thoughts, comments, suggestions??? Thank you, Steve Lymphocele/lymphedema is quite rare but do happen - in about 3% of cases. I had the same thing happened to me - lymohocele/lymphedema after surgery because the surgeon took out some lymph nodes and the fluid had no place to go and accumulated inside. The swelling of the leg is related so should go away. You are right hormone is not a cure but it can keep things under control for a long time sometimes decades. Good luck.",

      "Content": "In my non professional opinion, C-11 Choline scan should be very beneficial to determine your best treatment options. Yes, most C-11 Choline scans are used for recurrence because it is more sensitive to detecting metastasis than CT or MRI. In your case, there is still a chance for a cure if scan can identify all of the metastasis sites and if it is oligometastatic, either surgically removing them (lymph nodes or soft tissues) or spot radiating (bones). In a number of cases, that together with treating the prostate achieved lasting remission. Between 2011 and present, as part of the usual AS protocol, did your physician order at least annual biopsies to see why PSA went up so much? Perhaps the decision to treat should have been made earlier. In my opinion, you should get a second opinion/third opinion on treatment options. Good luck.",

His clinical stage is aggressive (one G4+4) but the amount of involvement is quite small. In other words, he is fortunately he caught his cancer quite early and it is very likely organ confined. Either surgery or radiation should provide an excellent chance of a \"cure\" or remission as some others would prefer we said. There are actually a number of excellent clinics in NY, for example Sloan Kettering is probably the best cancer center in the US if not the world. Cleveland Clinic is also one of the very best and you cannot go wrong with going there either. Don't wait to seek treatment as in his case time is of the essence. Good luck and peace be with you.",

Using your non < PSA numbers from Sept 2011 to Jan 2014, your doubling time is about 16 months. So, it is slow rising and if continues, will be years before you need treatment. For such slow doubling, Johns Hopkins's 30 year survival statistics were very good. Also, in your case, supplements like pomegranate juice, etc., and a healthy diets may slow PSA doubling even further and worth a try. It is also possible that your surgeon left behind a microscopic amount of benign prostate tissues and they are slowly growing larger. I had read cases where PSA slowly rising and plateau at a low level. Some oncologists sometimes try finasteride and if the PSA # went down by half and stays there, then it might be benign tissues.

      "Content": "Welcome and like Highlander, I thank you for your service to our country. Since the USPSTF (US Preventive Service Task Force, a penal appointed by the US Department of Health and Human Service) recommended no PSA testing in 2012, it has been the policy of Government Health Care Units to not do routine PSA test. So, you should not blame the VA, blame the US government for the VA not measuring your PSA on a routine basis. On the other hand, it sounded like your surgeon was quite bad for cutting a hole in both your bladder and rectum and was unable to extract the whole prostate! In any case a post surgery PSA of 2.33 indicated cancer is still within you so you need to continue treatment. As for a pre op PSA of 9.47, it is high but actually not too high (my pre op PSA was 10.7), indicating you cancer was probably still local. If I were you I would get a second opinion from a radiation oncologist and a prostate cancer oncologist to see if radiation is still an option now that both holes are \"patched\". If radiation is possible, you can still shoot for a cure instead of just controlling the cancer with Eligard. Good luck and best wishes.",

Inflammation of the prostate is very difficult to get rid of and for some (like mine) it stays there even after a course of antibiotics. Your PSA # is consistent with someone with a 50 cc prostate so if there is cancer, yours doesn't produce a lot of PSA. Anyway, good luck to your upcoming second biopsy.",

Im leaning towards brachy. What effect will having my prostate pretty much killed off on muscle quality , retention , strength etc? Is that the info needed? thanks sj Testosterone is not produced by the prostate so treatments, either brachy or surgery, should not affect your T level. Hormone therapy on the other hand would reduce testosterone level. Testosterone is fuel for prostate cancer so it is not advisable to take T unless you are sure the cancer is completely eliminated. With surgery, if you have undetectable PSA for a few years, some doctors would prescribe T. For brachy, sometimes PSA does not reduce to undetectable due to benign cells remaining in there. When that happens taking T is not smart. That said, with a 39cc prostate and 8 core G6, you are a good candidate for brachy. Good luck.",

My Oncologist stated that Colo-rectal Cancer is possible after Rad Treatments. I just have to keep an eye on things as my stool color has changed and or not consistent as before the treatments, From what I read, the side effects you mentioned were common for external radiation treatments (about ~60% experienced urinary issues and ~30% rectal issues). The good news is they mostly subsided after 6 months. As for secondary primary cancers (colon and bladder), they increase but for most folks not a major concern as doubling from a very small number (<< 1%) is still a very small number. You made the right choice for you and everything should work out fine. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "dupres, If you don't mind can you share your biopsy results here? Most important is the extend of your positive cores. A pre treatment PSA of 29 is quite high and the extend could indicate if the cancer was localized Michael F made a good point. After primary radiation treatment PSA usually does not go to zero but remains at a low but stable level (nadir). Sometimes there is a bounce but after 5 years, it should remain at a low level. You can see how stable by looking at PSADT. If I use all the PSA numbers you posted, your doubling time is 8.4 years meaning within the measurement errors, most likely it is very stable and there is nothing to worry about (at that doubling time you will die of something else in your old age). I did a couple of additional regression analyses. Perhaps the early years did not count because of hormone, so I used the last two years' data, from 5/29/2013 to the most recent #: PSADT is now 8.9 years! I begun to see a trend only if I used the 5 most recent PSA numbers. PSADT is now 1.9 years however because the data has significant spread, I think the statistical error is too large to be meaningful. The next PSA measurement will be important to see if the trend is real. Another scenario is the base value of 1.2 indicated benign prostate tissues and the highs are caused by infection/inflammations. Do you have any symptoms of urinary infections? Anyway, the following link indicated a PSA nadir of ~1 or less produced good outcome in terms of recurrence: http://www.cancernetwork.com/article...ostic-variable I am just a layperson so discuss all of these with your RO.

There are multispectral MRI but there is no consensus if that gives a better reading.

The other point I remembered is JH's AS protocol requires one side positive and not both sides. Anyway AS is a good way to go if you fit the criteria. Good luck.",

It is unusual for prostate cancer to metastasize to the liver first unless it is an unusual kind, for example small cells or neuroendrocrine. po18guy and Highlander gave you excellent advices to seek help from a cancer center because finding out what kind is key to find the right treatments. If you can, go to Johns Hopkins or MSK which are reasonably closest to you. Perhaps, they can perform a liver biopsy to see the type of prostate cancer so a good treatment plan can be formulated. Of course I am a non healthcare professional and it is only my opinion. Good luck.",

Since you have a G7, you should not do Active Surveillance and need to seek treatment to get rid of your cancer. Without anymore information, it is difficult to say anymore except in your case, either surgery or seed will do an equally good job. However, if you are young say < 50, most doctors recommend surgery. If you have any questions, please ask as we are here to help and share our experiences with you. good luck.",

Im leaning towards brachy. What effect will having my prostate pretty much killed off on muscle quality , retention , strength etc? Is that the info needed? thanks sj Testosterone is not produced by the prostate so treatments, either brachy or surgery, should not affect your T level. Hormone therapy on the other hand would reduce testosterone level. Testosterone is fuel for prostate cancer so it is not advisable to take T unless you are sure the cancer is completely eliminated. With surgery, if you have undetectable PSA for a few years, some doctors would prescribe T. For brachy, sometimes PSA does not reduce to undetectable due to benign cells remaining in there. When that happens taking T is not smart. That said, with a 39cc prostate and 8 core G6, you are a good candidate for brachy. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I searched past posts on this site and here is one from neutrondbob back in May 2011 on Zytiga that may be useful. Also, all else fail, if he had not tried Ketoconazole, a very similar drug targeting the same CYP17 enzyme and might be effective.Talk to his doctor if he has not try Keto yet. If you buy Keto from Canada, the cost is very reasonable (costs ~$100 per month?). Good luck. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- From neotrondbob: Abiraterone/Zytiga discussion fwd- J & J has financial assistance program now too Here is the good, the bad and the ugly on this from another forum where I brought up my questions, and pointed out it looks like re-engineered Ketoconazole with a huge price tag added, sure likely is better and more potent, you would think so at this price. Words below are from a leading PCa advocate on another forum whom is experienced in helping patients for many years now.--- I understand from what Robert says that there is a lot of frustration among men with advanced prostate cancer concerning cost of the newer drugs like (one cited to me today) Zytiga. I sympathize with this frustration. Zytiga doesn't impress me much. They tweaked keto. Lately a lot of tweaking of androgen blockades and chemos. Tweaking makes a difference and it also resets the price with a new patent. The new versions of old therapies will help more than a few men. Incremental improvements are important for handing advanced prostate cancer as a \"chronic disease,\" which has been the oncologists' and pharma companies' best aim for the past decade. But these are not major game changers. Specifically regarding Zytiga - for anyone who can't afford it: Johnson and Johnson (the pharma company that bought the Zytiga patent from its start up company, Cougar) has a financial assistance program for men who qualify. They make it sound like a trip to Vegas. Here's what I know so far: ZytigaOne Instant Savings Program Flashcard. Eligible patients may qualify for instant savings on their private insurance co-pay, deductible, and co-insurance medication costs for ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) through ZytigaOne Instant Savings Program.

Im leaning towards brachy. What effect will having my prostate pretty much killed off on muscle quality , retention , strength etc? Is that the info needed? thanks sj Testosterone is not produced by the prostate so treatments, either brachy or surgery, should not affect your T level. Hormone therapy on the other hand would reduce testosterone level. Testosterone is fuel for prostate cancer so it is not advisable to take T unless you are sure the cancer is completely eliminated. With surgery, if you have undetectable PSA for a few years, some doctors would prescribe T. For brachy, sometimes PSA does not reduce to undetectable due to benign cells remaining in there. When that happens taking T is not smart. That said, with a 39cc prostate and 8 core G6, you are a good candidate for brachy. Good luck.",

It is most common in men aged 30 to 40 years and in men over 50 years of age with benign prostate enlargement (BPH). The majority of cases go away in time without treatment. To answer your question specifically, prostate biopsy is an easy procedure and the pain/discomfort is quite minimal so if your physician orders one, don't be too concern about taking it. Our only advice is to follow the instructions carefully to avoid post biopsy infection which is more trouble than the biopsy itself. Many of us had multiple biopsies without any problem. Good luck.",

      "Content": "A recent UCLA study indicated that: Prostate cancer stem cells evolve into different cells as the disease progresses and this becomes a moving target for treatment, U.S. researchers say. Drs. Andrew Goldstein, Owen Witte and Tanya Stoyanova and colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles' Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, said scientists must be prepared for the continual evolution of the stem cell as tumors adapt and become resistant to new and more potent therapies. The study, published online ahead of print in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found prostate cancer can develop in one type of stem cell, then evolve to be maintained by a stem cell that looks very different, creating a moving target for treatments. (Adult stem cells are regenerative cells that replace diseased or damaged cells in organs. The researchers previously reported that prostate cancer can originate in basal type stem cells. The new study, based on that research, showed that tumors can start in basal stem cells that evolve to luminal cells that result in aggressive spread of the cancer and that these luminal cells can change in their characteristics over time; thus, making them resistant to treatment.) Read more: http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2013/...#ixzz2lpAoMbYT Does that mean cancer that is initially non aggressive can evolve into more aggressive cancers? Does that mean that our view that G6 will never evolve into more aggressive cancer may not be correct?",

Tonight I have a little pinch or pain in my groin on the left side, is this to be expected or going to get worse? I am not a health care professional so I am just speculating: I believe radiation can cause irritations to the nerve bundles that surround the prostate. Those nerve bundles control erection and sensations around the groin area so perhaps the slight groin pain is a side effect of nerve irritations. If that is the cause, it should go away after a while. You should discuss it with your radiation oncologist to make sure it is a common side effect of his treatment protocol. Good luck.",

For some, chemo is well tolerated whereas others may not be. The thing I would do if I were you is to send his biopsy slides to Johns Hopkins or Bostwick for a second read. I would be most interested in finding out his cancer type, i.e., the most common form or the rarer forms. The treatment protocols may be different depending on that. After the second read by a US lab, you can then do a second opinion consult with a US oncologist (i.e., JH, Mayo or MDA, etc.). That can be done by telephone. Even with the cancer spreading, with the right treatment, he will be around for years, so the family should not look at it as a death sentence and make sure he knows that too. Best wishes.",

I had seen another poster on a diff site who had a nightmare experience with staples as his surgeon left several inside him, and over time they moved and caused some severe bladder damage. Brave Bravehardon, What you referred to are not staples but surgical clips used during surgery e.g. to seal blood vessels to prevent bleedings, etc. Both open and robotic surgeries use them. They are left behind after surgery. Sometimes they can migrate and cause problem. Most common is bladder neck contracture and causes urination problem. the incidences are rare and happened in less than 1% of cases. As for staples, many surgeons do not use them but use \"superglue\" (mine) or other means instead. Take care.",

He also needs to get bone and CT scans again to see where the cancers are now. The radiation oncologist should no longer be the one treating him now.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nibbs His last PSA test was this week and in the last 3 months it has risen to 90. I'm so scared the cancer is back. Obviously all the tests are being scheduled. Bone scan, CT scan, biopsy. They have started him on pills (hormone maybe?) and he will be getting the hormone shot this week. Is there anything more to do? I'm scared. I want it to be an infection....is there a high chance of that at all? Any stories here about PSA rising after treatment and such? Sorry you are here and sorry about your Dad's situation. He had radiation and hormone, PSA went to zero for a while and came back so I am afraid he has what we call a BCR (biochemical recurrence) meaning cancer is back. It is not likely the PSA rise is due to infection. You need to find him an oncologist that specializes in prostate cancer and get the best treatments possible. There are many new medications that can control the growth of prostate cancer and he can still live a very long and productive life under treatment. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Fatherbuild, If you search many of the posts here you will find testicular swelling is very normal and it should subside. As for pain in the bottom of his feet, that is more unusual but many posters had pain in a lot of other areas after surgery. The good news is eventually they all reported the pains went away or reduced significantly after allowing sufficient time to heal. We all heal differently so some will take longer. I am not a healthcare provider so it is just layperson opinion: His surgeon decided to \"go aggressive\" with the surgery. Very likely he/she disturbed or damaged some nerves. The nerves that are around the prostate touch many of the lower half of our body including our legs. It is entirely possible those are affected and if so, they will heal and go away in time. Tell your Dad not to worry too much and concentrate on healing. Good luck.",

I had seen another poster on a diff site who had a nightmare experience with staples as his surgeon left several inside him, and over time they moved and caused some severe bladder damage. Brave Bravehardon, What you referred to are not staples but surgical clips used during surgery e.g. to seal blood vessels to prevent bleedings, etc. Both open and robotic surgeries use them. They are left behind after surgery. Sometimes they can migrate and cause problem. Most common is bladder neck contracture and causes urination problem. the incidences are rare and happened in less than 1% of cases. As for staples, many surgeons do not use them but use \"superglue\" (mine) or other means instead. Take care.",

      "Content": "Pratoman, I know you are the worrying type so want to make sure everything is exactly correct. Sometimes the surgeon's support staffs did not know the exact situation and might have embellished. If indeed this is the case, it said your surgeon had done an excellent job of looking out for you and it is indeed a negative margin case so you have nothing to worry about. Many times, the surgeon will cut widely just to make sure he got it all. Under the 10X magnifications of a Da Vinci camera, he could see a lot more clearly but yours did it even better by taking it to the pathologist before he closed you up. I read a detail surgery report of my relative's surgery two years ago: The surgeon did not like the look at the bladder neck and cut out a chunk more. After taking out the prostate, she took out a lot of the surrounding fatty tissues and lymph nodes because she wanted to make sure. Turned out cancer invaded the bladder neck and some fatty tissues. So far, his PSA is undetectable. Best wishes.",

Since you have a G7, you should not do Active Surveillance and need to seek treatment to get rid of your cancer. Without anymore information, it is difficult to say anymore except in your case, either surgery or seed will do an equally good job. However, if you are young say < 50, most doctors recommend surgery. If you have any questions, please ask as we are here to help and share our experiences with you. good luck.",

State of the art 3 Tesla MRI has a resolution of ~.5cm. Even endorectal MRI is only slightly better, so, if your cancer is multi-focal or focal << .5 cm, most likely MRI won't show. There are multispectral MRI but there is no consensus if that gives a better reading. However, my knowledge of MRI is about 2 years old, so there maybe better machines and procedures out there that I am not aware of. 2. In the end, you still need a biopsy to be a definitive diagnosis. 3.

It is most common in men aged 30 to 40 years and in men over 50 years of age with benign prostate enlargement (BPH). The majority of cases go away in time without treatment. To answer your question specifically, prostate biopsy is an easy procedure and the pain/discomfort is quite minimal so if your physician orders one, don't be too concern about taking it. Our only advice is to follow the instructions carefully to avoid post biopsy infection which is more trouble than the biopsy itself. Many of us had multiple biopsies without any problem. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Pratoman, I know you are the worrying type so want to make sure everything is exactly correct. Sometimes the surgeon's support staffs did not know the exact situation and might have embellished. If indeed this is the case, it said your surgeon had done an excellent job of looking out for you and it is indeed a negative margin case so you have nothing to worry about. Many times, the surgeon will cut widely just to make sure he got it all. Under the 10X magnifications of a Da Vinci camera, he could see a lot more clearly but yours did it even better by taking it to the pathologist before he closed you up. I read a detail surgery report of my relative's surgery two years ago: The surgeon did not like the look at the bladder neck and cut out a chunk more. After taking out the prostate, she took out a lot of the surrounding fatty tissues and lymph nodes because she wanted to make sure. Turned out cancer invaded the bladder neck and some fatty tissues. So far, his PSA is undetectable. Best wishes.",

When it came back positive, the Surgeon cut more, and sent it for Frozen Section and it came back Negative. So they stopped cutting. They didn't take any of my nerve bundles (near the Apex, I believe). Are you sure this is what happened? Did you speak with your surgeon about this? If not, you should talk to him directly.",

As for pain in the bottom of his feet, that is more unusual but many posters had pain in a lot of other areas after surgery. The good news is eventually they all reported the pains went away or reduced significantly after allowing sufficient time to heal. We all heal differently so some will take longer. I am not a healthcare provider so it is just layperson opinion: His surgeon decided to \"go aggressive\" with the surgery. Very likely he/she disturbed or damaged some nerves. The nerves that are around the prostate touch many of the lower half of our body including our legs. It is entirely possible those are affected and if so, they will heal and go away in time. Tell your Dad not to worry too much and concentrate on healing. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Badger199 Just about everything has gone wrong - keyhole surgery was abandoned and after 2 hours in theatre the surgeon had to resort to full open surgery, wound opened up after 12 days, urinary infection and now an extra week with catheter. Is anything going to be straightforward for me I wonder! Think of the positives. There was a reason they had to abandon keyhole, could be scar tissues, adhesions or too much fatty tissues, etc. You are actually fortunate your surgeon (or someone) was able to revert to open and finished it. Imagine the alternative if they could not find someone experienced enough to do open at the time? Also, with urinary infection and the risks of stricture, blockage, etc., it is best to leave the catheter in a little longer. If they took out the catheter too soon and there was blockage, you could end up in the emergency room. I don't recall reading any report that tied incontinence to how long the catheter is in. I think it mostly depends on how much of the sphincter muscles the surgeon can spare. Give yourself time to heal and this shall pass. In a few months, all these will be distant memories. I wish you a great recovery.",

With salvage, We wait and see what happens down the line. My MAIN concern is if I opt for salvage, if and when it becomes necessary, am I increasing my risk for distant mets? I'm not as concerned about treatment side effects as I am in eradicating the cancer! I'm sort of asking, what would you guys choose if this was your case? Thanks for any input! Welcome back! You asked a question that no one has an answer, not even the best urologist or oncologist. With your stat my guess is most doctors would recommend wait and see. There were some studies indicated for advanced and aggressive cancer, adjuvant had a survival advantage but for early stage like yours, I had not come across any studies favoring adjuvant treatment. Dr. Walsh mentioned in his book that positive margins did not automatically meant some cancer cells were left behind. For me personally, I tend to be aggressive and if I had an advanced case, I would go for broke and throw everything at it. However, if I had your case, I would wait.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nibbs His last PSA test was this week and in the last 3 months it has risen to 90. I'm so scared the cancer is back. Obviously all the tests are being scheduled. Bone scan, CT scan, biopsy. They have started him on pills (hormone maybe?) and he will be getting the hormone shot this week. Is there anything more to do? I'm scared. I want it to be an infection....is there a high chance of that at all? Any stories here about PSA rising after treatment and such? Sorry you are here and sorry about your Dad's situation. He had radiation and hormone, PSA went to zero for a while and came back so I am afraid he has what we call a BCR (biochemical recurrence) meaning cancer is back. It is not likely the PSA rise is due to infection. You need to find him an oncologist that specializes in prostate cancer and get the best treatments possible. There are many new medications that can control the growth of prostate cancer and he can still live a very long and productive life under treatment. Good luck.",

Another point, Gleason grades and scores are not objective grades but subjective based on the opinions of the trained pathologists, so if they said you were a G6, were you really a G6?. My post was not intended to contradict conventional wisdom but to point out there are always exceptions and variations and as laypersons we should seek expert advices when in doubt. Your post op outcome and pathology report are as good as they come and your long term prognosis should be excellent. Best wishes.",

I recommend you read Dr. Walsh's book especially the section on side effects after surgery and radiation. He said it could take up to 18-24 months for side effects (incontinence and ED) to heal. In the mean time, like the others said, do your Kegel but do not overdo. Also avoid some beverages like beer, coffee etc. Someone said some types of beverages may cause leakage in the first few months after surgery as they might affect the sphincter muscles' function . I don't know if that is true but no harm trying. Good luck.",

With salvage, We wait and see what happens down the line. My MAIN concern is if I opt for salvage, if and when it becomes necessary, am I increasing my risk for distant mets? I'm not as concerned about treatment side effects as I am in eradicating the cancer! I'm sort of asking, what would you guys choose if this was your case? Thanks for any input! Welcome back! You asked a question that no one has an answer, not even the best urologist or oncologist. With your stat my guess is most doctors would recommend wait and see. There were some studies indicated for advanced and aggressive cancer, adjuvant had a survival advantage but for early stage like yours, I had not come across any studies favoring adjuvant treatment. Dr. Walsh mentioned in his book that positive margins did not automatically meant some cancer cells were left behind. For me personally, I tend to be aggressive and if I had an advanced case, I would go for broke and throw everything at it. However, if I had your case, I would wait.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OTCHU on the 13 samples, 3 are bad .... here the numbers, if somebody can explain me ... I dont understand : Core(cm) Gleason %PCA 1.5 3+3 5% 1.0 3+3 <5% 1.1 3+4 5% so the doctor told me that I will have to choose my options: - remove with a robot the prostate - freeze the prostate - radiation Please guys, I need some advices .... I am so young for that Sorry you are joining our club but welcome. Relax, most likely you can be cured if you choose a good treatment plan that fits your situation. The side effects of surgery and radiation are real but most were able to lead a normal life without incontinence. ED is a tougher challenge but again even if you have ED, with medication it can be managed. With a PSA of 2.86 and Gleason score of 3+3, 3+3 and 3+4, your cancer is early stage and the Gleason 3+4 indicated a small sample of the cancer cells are intermediate aggressive (the second # is the minority sample, 4 indicated more aggressive cancer cells). Here is what your biopsy basically said: They took out 13 cores (samples) and 3 of the samples are positive for cancer. The cores they took out ranged from 1 cm to 1.5 cm long and only 5% of the cores that are positive showed cancer and of those, most are low grade (Gleason 3+3). So, it is actually not a bad situation for you. It means very early stage and you have a good chance for a cure if you choose the appropriate treatment. What should you do? First of all ask the urologist (doctor) to send the slides to a different pathologist for a second opinion. It is important to confirm the Gleason scores (3+3, 3+3 and 3+4) because the scores will tell you what path to take. Second, read up on the subject, perhaps buy and read Dr. Walsh's book on Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. You will find that you have lots of treatment options and you have to select the plan that is most comfortable to you. Surgery and radiation offers equal outcome in terms of cancer cure but slightly different outcome in side effects. There is no right or wrong choice, whatever you choose will be the right one for you. Third, find the best surgeon or best radiation oncologist you can find and have him/her performed the treatment you selected. The outcome depends more on the doctor's skill that the treatment options. Good luck",

      "Content": "CPO2CWO, In spite of my prior post, I believe it is safe to say that most G6 will not morph into G7,8,9 and it is a very low risk cancer as numerous studies confirmed that cancer death from G6 is very low (but not zero - from a Johns Hopkins study). Another point, Gleason grades and scores are not objective grades but subjective based on the opinions of the trained pathologists, so if they said you were a G6, were you really a G6?. My post was not intended to contradict conventional wisdom but to point out there are always exceptions and variations and as laypersons we should seek expert advices when in doubt. Your post op outcome and pathology report are as good as they come and your long term prognosis should be excellent. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FeatherBoy Adjuvant or salvage. With adjuvant, I start radiation now even with a zero PSA based on the positive margins. With salvage, We wait and see what happens down the line. My MAIN concern is if I opt for salvage, if and when it becomes necessary, am I increasing my risk for distant mets? I'm not as concerned about treatment side effects as I am in eradicating the cancer! I'm sort of asking, what would you guys choose if this was your case? Thanks for any input! Welcome back! You asked a question that no one has an answer, not even the best urologist or oncologist. With your stat my guess is most doctors would recommend wait and see. There were some studies indicated for advanced and aggressive cancer, adjuvant had a survival advantage but for early stage like yours, I had not come across any studies favoring adjuvant treatment. Dr. Walsh mentioned in his book that positive margins did not automatically meant some cancer cells were left behind. For me personally, I tend to be aggressive and if I had an advanced case, I would go for broke and throw everything at it. However, if I had your case, I would wait. Just a personal opinion and not a medical advice.",

Heterogenous signal could mean a lot of different things like inflammation, BPH, cancer.... and without a biopsy, one cannot rule out anything. However, the fact that you had two separate MRI and both indicated the same and no changes, and that your PSA is normal means probably you just have to keep watching things and not have to do anything at this stage. Of course I am not a healthcare professional, so please get advice from a real physician. Best wishes.",

By the way, in your case, both surgery and radiation are good options, it is more a personal preference than which is a better outcome.

      "Content": "The standard definition of a failed radiation treatment is a PSA of nadir+2. You reached nadir in May 2011, if PSA bounces around 1.2 to 1.4, I would not worry. My friend's PSA after SRT went from undetectable to about 1 within a year but then stayed at 1 for many years since. That said, the last # of 1.7 is worrisome, hopefully just a random fluctuation. Your urologist is correct to want to see your PSA in three months. Using your last 6 PSA #, your doubling time is about 1.7 years. It would be about 2 years without the last PSA #. So, yes, long term it is slowly going up. With that doubling time, most likely you will die of something else and not prostate cancer. Also, you should have plenty of time to consider if you want treatment or not. Good luck with the next PSA test.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OTCHU on the 13 samples, 3 are bad .... here the numbers, if somebody can explain me ... I dont understand : Core(cm) Gleason %PCA 1.5 3+3 5% 1.0 3+3 <5% 1.1 3+4 5% so the doctor told me that I will have to choose my options: - remove with a robot the prostate - freeze the prostate - radiation Please guys, I need some advices .... I am so young for that Sorry you are joining our club but welcome. Relax, most likely you can be cured if you choose a good treatment plan that fits your situation. The side effects of surgery and radiation are real but most were able to lead a normal life without incontinence. ED is a tougher challenge but again even if you have ED, with medication it can be managed. With a PSA of 2.86 and Gleason score of 3+3, 3+3 and 3+4, your cancer is early stage and the Gleason 3+4 indicated a small sample of the cancer cells are intermediate aggressive (the second # is the minority sample, 4 indicated more aggressive cancer cells). Here is what your biopsy basically said: They took out 13 cores (samples) and 3 of the samples are positive for cancer. The cores they took out ranged from 1 cm to 1.5 cm long and only 5% of the cores that are positive showed cancer and of those, most are low grade (Gleason 3+3). So, it is actually not a bad situation for you. It means very early stage and you have a good chance for a cure if you choose the appropriate treatment. What should you do? First of all ask the urologist (doctor) to send the slides to a different pathologist for a second opinion. It is important to confirm the Gleason scores (3+3, 3+3 and 3+4) because the scores will tell you what path to take. Second, read up on the subject, perhaps buy and read Dr. Walsh's book on Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. You will find that you have lots of treatment options and you have to select the plan that is most comfortable to you. Surgery and radiation offers equal outcome in terms of cancer cure but slightly different outcome in side effects. There is no right or wrong choice, whatever you choose will be the right one for you. Third, find the best surgeon or best radiation oncologist you can find and have him/her performed the treatment you selected. The outcome depends more on the doctor's skill that the treatment options. Good luck",

      "Content": "You should discuss with your doctor the risks of taking Proscar. Here is the FDA's safety announcement in 2011 regarding this class of medications use to treat BPH: FDA Safety Announcement [6-9-2011] The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing healthcare professionals that the Warnings and Precautions section of the labels for the 5-alpha reductase inhibitor (5-ARI) class of drugs has been revised to include new safety information about the increased risk of being diagnosed with a more serious form of prostate cancer (high-grade prostate cancer). This risk appears to be low, but healthcare professionals should be aware of this safety information, and weigh the known benefits against the potential risks when deciding to start or continue treatment with 5-ARIs in men. Facts about 5-ARIs Drugs in this class are finasteride (marketed as Proscar [finasteride 5 mg] and Propecia [finasteride 1 mg]) and dutasteride (marketed as Avodart). Dutasteride is also available in combination with tamsulosin, under the brand-name Jalyn. Proscar, Avodart, and Jalyn are approved to improve symptoms of an enlarged prostate gland (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Proscar and Avodart are also approved to reduce the risk of urinary retention or surgery related to an enlarged prostate. Propecia is approved to treat male pattern hair loss. Approximately 5 million male patients received a prescription for a 5-ARI between years 2002 to 2009. Of these, nearly 3 million patients were between the ages of 50 to 79 years.1 The new safety information is based on FDA\u0092s review of two large, randomized controlled trials\u0096\u0096the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) and the Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events (REDUCE) trial\u0096\u0096which evaluated daily use of finasteride 5 mg versus placebo for 7 years and daily use of dutasteride 0.5 mg versus placebo for 4 years, respectively, for the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer in men at least 50 years of age. The trials demonstrated an overall reduction in prostate cancer diagnoses with finasteride 5 mg and dutasteride treatment (see Data Summary below). This overall reduction was due to a decreased incidence of lower risk forms of prostate cancer. However, both trials showed an increased incidence of high-grade prostate cancer with finasteride and dutasteride treatment. For more information about this safety issue, also refer to the Questions and Answers. Many doctors disagree with the FDA and continue to prescribe them but some doctors are more cautious. I read the results of the clinical trials and according to my non professional view, the results of increased risk of higher grade cancers were statistically significant, and cannot be easily explained away, that is why the FDA warning.

Your Dad definitely has a very aggressive prostate cancer and for stage 4 a cure is currently not possible. However, there are a number of hormone and chemo drugs available to slow down the cancer. Typically, each will work for a period of time, maybe months maybe years. When they stop working, the doctor will try another and another... For some, it went on for years (one of my former colleagues has been on hormone for 15 years!) while for others, it stopped working after a couple of years. Get a good oncologist to take over and manage his disease. Treating metastasized prostate cancer requires someone specializes in prostate cancer to get optimum outcome. Best of luck to you and don't give up hope.",

With aggressive cases, one should prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Hopefully everything will work out for him but ask his urologist about his views on adjuvant vs salvage radiation and if he recommend going ahead with adjuvant, would he also recommend adding hormone therapy prior/during/after adjuvant radiation. There were studies that indicated for very high risk cases, adjuvant radiation plus hormone offers better odds of getting rid of the cancer. Also ask him for a referral to a radiation oncologist and/or an oncologist for a second opinion consult. Best of luck to you and your husband.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobertG Kind of confused by what I'm reading here - is surgery generally preferred if you are younger? I'm guessing with the Gleason 7 on the left side the best I could hope for is single nerve sparing, correct? I am pro surgery because I wanted to find out the extent of my cancer and only surgery allowed me to see the pathology of the prostate. And I always tried to avoid radiation as much as I could. But I admit the cancer control outcome for guys with your stats should be about the same and in more advanced cases radiation is actually better. Therefore in your case it is a matter of personal preference and your physical conditions. The only advice is whichever you choose, find a skill practitioner, one that has many many treatments under his/her belt. Quote comments: No so. G7 on one side has nothing to do with nerve sparing or not. Nerve sparing depends on the skill of your surgeon and how close the cancers are to the nerves. Good luck and take care.",

      "Content": "Tom C, Sorry you are here but welcome. Urologist can usually guesstimate what your \"normal\" psa should be by using your prostate size and made some assumptions. If your prostate is small and the cancer is minute, a low psa is usually good news. However, as Fairwind said, some prostate cancer cells do not produce psa and those are usually very aggressive. Your biopsy clinical report should identify the type of cancer cells they found. If they are the garden variety adenocarcinoma, you are probably very early stage and perhaps could do AS for many years without problem. You should get a second opinion from an expert pathologist, e.g. Johns Hopkins, to make sure the cancer is the garden variety type. If you want additional input from others, you might want to post your stats here. For example, JohnT, a regular poster here, uses (.066 x prostate volume) to calculate what your \"normal\" psa should be. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Am232628 Dear Chuck Many thanks for telling me the book. I will order immediately to study. He is 71 and he did have previous PSA values and recently did some rectum related test, so I guess it is the procedure you mentioned. Now I know what info to ask for and will share more. The last PSA test score of 10, was taken immediately after our romantic weekend getaway. He did not realize that he should not do the test immediately. After subsequent research, I mentioned that the score could be affected and he should mention it to his doctor. In Asia, men at the golden age, often are reluctant to mention they have sexual needs and activities. They would often be judged as inappropriate individuals, especially by the younger generation, like one's children. Often men would not want to mention their medical conditions to their family, as they fear it would cause worries and fears. So I will try to find a way to get the info without being too investigative. Will get back soon. Many thanks Chuck. The info is fantastic! Best, A Welcome. Sounds like he had a biopsy. This is what he should ask his doctor about the biopsy results: 1. How many samples were taken and how many showed cancer? 2. What are the Gleason scores. They range from6 to 10, 6 being the least aggressive and 10 the most aggressive. 3. What was the pathologist's staging? Tx, where x is between 1 and 4. 1 and 2 usually mean cancer is confined within the prostate and 3 or 4 mean it has spread outside the prostate. Don't be bashful, ask because it affects what treatment he will have to take and his chance of survival. Based on his age and PSA reading, my guess is his is not the aggressive type and will be OK, so don't worry too much. Best wishes and good luck.",

The last 2 nights I was able to sleep a bit on my side instead of my back...what a relief! I'm still having some sharp pains if I sit any length of time, bend the wrong way, or make any sudden moves. I suppose it's normal after everything was moved and poked during the surgery. How long does this last? A couple of Tylenol in the AM and PM seem to help. Where is the pain? If it is near the incision sites it should go away soon? If not near the incision sites and you also have other symptoms like a fever you need to consult your surgeon. One thing few surgeons talk about post op is the possibility of lymphedema and lymphocele. Do you have leg swelling post surgery and is the pain near the lower abdomen? Lymphocele is a collection of lymphatic fluid in the lower abdominal cavity. Usually it is asymptomatic and goes away after a short period but if it gets infected it can cause pain in that area. You had a successful surgery and lets hope it is just a case of simple recovery. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Fairwind, I have been thinking about your case a lot lately. I am not a physician or in the healthcare field so my comments are purely speculative: 1. Most physicians in the US practice evidence based medicine namely unless a treatment showed demonstrable results from a clinical trial, they won't prescribe it. It is all good and it is what made modern medicine so effective. However, in some situations when there is a predictable eventual bad outcome like CRPC, that maybe too conservative. Cases like what I mentioned will probably not be in a lot of physician's treatment repertoire even if the patient will eventually becomes CRPC. 2. What do hormone therapies do to prostate cancer cells and the non scientific answer is they \"kill\" them or at least \"starve\" and make them dormant. So, since some small percentages do not respond to the first line treatment, eventually as the treatable ones are \"killed off\" the non-treatable ones will take over. The obvious answer to me is if one can find some combination that works for all, and typically medication works when the cancers are not overwhelming, it may be a winning strategy to the patient. A patient of one and not statistics. 3. That to me explained perhaps why the combination of Xtandi and Provenge worked in that particular case. To get general acceptance, it will take an expensive clinical trial and a few more years whereas guys might not have a few more years. 4. The case parallels HIV and AIDS in that what eventually worked was a \"cocktail\" of medicines. In breast cancer, the physicians are more aggressive and combination/adjuvant treatments are now a norm for aggressive cases (my wife's situation and it worked so far after 10 years). 5. So, current way of sequencing drugs will eventually fail as the remaining cancer cells will prevail or mutate into drug resistant kind. 6. The challenge is all hormone/cancer treatments have bad side effects and a combination of a few may cause the side effects to be worst than the \"cure\". However, there must be some physicians who are willing to try, perhaps a reduced doses of the drugs but in combination to give the same \"side effect strength\" but kill off all cancer types. 7. I had decided if I were ever in your situation, I would be aggressively pursuing a combination of all the new medications and will try to find a physician who is willing to work with me and there are a few on my short list. Again, this is not advice and is just pure speculation. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobertG Kind of confused by what I'm reading here - is surgery generally preferred if you are younger? I'm guessing with the Gleason 7 on the left side the best I could hope for is single nerve sparing, correct? I am pro surgery because I wanted to find out the extent of my cancer and only surgery allowed me to see the pathology of the prostate. And I always tried to avoid radiation as much as I could. But I admit the cancer control outcome for guys with your stats should be about the same and in more advanced cases radiation is actually better. Therefore in your case it is a matter of personal preference and your physical conditions. The only advice is whichever you choose, find a skill practitioner, one that has many many treatments under his/her belt. Quote comments: No so. G7 on one side has nothing to do with nerve sparing or not. Nerve sparing depends on the skill of your surgeon and how close the cancers are to the nerves. Good luck and take care.",

      "Content": "Fairwind & Old Sailor, My heart goes out to both of you. Those of us who are not facing CRPC just cannot imagine how you feel. I know it is easy for me to say not to give up but I think the data for prolonged survivals and success stories are real and not hype, especially for those that are at the beginning like in your cases. Here is one case published in Feb 2013 where combining Xtandi and Provenge provided complete response: Complete biochemical (prostate-specific antigen) response to sipuleucel-T with enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a case report with implications for future research. Graff JN, Drake CG, Beer TM. Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR 97239, USA. [email protected] Abstract OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a patient with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who achieved a complete and durable biochemical response after treatment with sipuleucel-T while continuing with enzalutamide and to explore the immunologic basis for such a response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements and bone scans to assess the patient's response to enzalutamide followed by the addition of sipuleucel-T. Using preclinical and clinical data, we describe his response through known immunobiologic mechanisms. RESULTS: This patient's PSA level became undetectable during treatment with enzalutamide and began to increase again after 14 months. He opted for treatment with sipuleucel-T, while continuing with the enzalutamide. This resulted in another complete PSA response 6 months after exposure to sipuleucel-T. CONCLUSION: Sipuleucel-T typically does not produce significant PSA reductions, and, to the best of our knowledge, only 1 previous report of a durable complete PSA response in a patient with metastatic disease has been published. The timing of this response supports an immune mechanism. The biologic rationale for the combination, coupled with the clinical result observed in our patient, provides a basis for studies of the combination of sipuleucel-T and enzalutamide. Published by Elsevier Inc. PMID: 23374810 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kazzie61 Hi, My husband had a RP 3 weeks ago and has already been told he'll need radiotherapy. On his post op appt on June 14th which will be 4.5 weeks after the op we'll find out what radiotherapy they will suggest. If it is aduvant therapy my research on the internet(!) says aduvant therapy would start 'immediately'. This might sound stupid but what is immediately when the post op appt is already 4.5 weeks after the op. Don't you have to recover more fully from the surgery before radiotherapy starts? Most likely they found his pathology had some problems and that's why they wanted adjuvant radiation. If he has no incontinence or his leakage is minimal, his radiation oncologist could start him as soon as can be scheduled. And Fairwind is right, studies found hormone in addition help reduced recurrance.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Am232628 Dear Chuck Many thanks for telling me the book. I will order immediately to study. He is 71 and he did have previous PSA values and recently did some rectum related test, so I guess it is the procedure you mentioned. Now I know what info to ask for and will share more. The last PSA test score of 10, was taken immediately after our romantic weekend getaway. He did not realize that he should not do the test immediately. After subsequent research, I mentioned that the score could be affected and he should mention it to his doctor. In Asia, men at the golden age, often are reluctant to mention they have sexual needs and activities. They would often be judged as inappropriate individuals, especially by the younger generation, like one's children. Often men would not want to mention their medical conditions to their family, as they fear it would cause worries and fears. So I will try to find a way to get the info without being too investigative. Will get back soon. Many thanks Chuck. The info is fantastic! Best, A Welcome. Sounds like he had a biopsy. This is what he should ask his doctor about the biopsy results: 1. How many samples were taken and how many showed cancer? 2. What are the Gleason scores. They range from6 to 10, 6 being the least aggressive and 10 the most aggressive. 3. What was the pathologist's staging? Tx, where x is between 1 and 4. 1 and 2 usually mean cancer is confined within the prostate and 3 or 4 mean it has spread outside the prostate. Don't be bashful, ask because it affects what treatment he will have to take and his chance of survival. Based on his age and PSA reading, my guess is his is not the aggressive type and will be OK, so don't worry too much. Best wishes and good luck.",

      "Content": "Fairwind, I have been thinking about your case a lot lately. I am not a physician or in the healthcare field so my comments are purely speculative: 1. Most physicians in the US practice evidence based medicine namely unless a treatment showed demonstrable results from a clinical trial, they won't prescribe it. It is all good and it is what made modern medicine so effective. However, in some situations when there is a predictable eventual bad outcome like CRPC, that maybe too conservative. Cases like what I mentioned will probably not be in a lot of physician's treatment repertoire even if the patient will eventually becomes CRPC. 2. What do hormone therapies do to prostate cancer cells and the non scientific answer is they \"kill\" them or at least \"starve\" and make them dormant. So, since some small percentages do not respond to the first line treatment, eventually as the treatable ones are \"killed off\" the non-treatable ones will take over. The obvious answer to me is if one can find some combination that works for all, and typically medication works when the cancers are not overwhelming, it may be a winning strategy to the patient. A patient of one and not statistics. 3. That to me explained perhaps why the combination of Xtandi and Provenge worked in that particular case. To get general acceptance, it will take an expensive clinical trial and a few more years whereas guys might not have a few more years. 4. The case parallels HIV and AIDS in that what eventually worked was a \"cocktail\" of medicines. In breast cancer, the physicians are more aggressive and combination/adjuvant treatments are now a norm for aggressive cases (my wife's situation and it worked so far after 10 years). 5. So, current way of sequencing drugs will eventually fail as the remaining cancer cells will prevail or mutate into drug resistant kind. 6. The challenge is all hormone/cancer treatments have bad side effects and a combination of a few may cause the side effects to be worst than the \"cure\". However, there must be some physicians who are willing to try, perhaps a reduced doses of the drugs but in combination to give the same \"side effect strength\" but kill off all cancer types. 7. I had decided if I were ever in your situation, I would be aggressively pursuing a combination of all the new medications and will try to find a physician who is willing to work with me and there are a few on my short list. Again, this is not advice and is just pure speculation. Best wishes.",

They can't offer radiation in that particular area because of the organs surrounding it. I recalled Dr. Kwan at Mayo Clinic at one time talked about the possibility of lymph node resection if there were only very few lymph nodes involved and could result in a \"cure\" or significantly delayed the progression of the cancer. You may want to contact Mayo and get a second opinion. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Fairwind & Old Sailor, My heart goes out to both of you. Those of us who are not facing CRPC just cannot imagine how you feel. I know it is easy for me to say not to give up but I think the data for prolonged survivals and success stories are real and not hype, especially for those that are at the beginning like in your cases. Here is one case published in Feb 2013 where combining Xtandi and Provenge provided complete response: Complete biochemical (prostate-specific antigen) response to sipuleucel-T with enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a case report with implications for future research. Graff JN, Drake CG, Beer TM. Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR 97239, USA. [email protected] Abstract OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a patient with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who achieved a complete and durable biochemical response after treatment with sipuleucel-T while continuing with enzalutamide and to explore the immunologic basis for such a response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements and bone scans to assess the patient's response to enzalutamide followed by the addition of sipuleucel-T. Using preclinical and clinical data, we describe his response through known immunobiologic mechanisms. RESULTS: This patient's PSA level became undetectable during treatment with enzalutamide and began to increase again after 14 months. He opted for treatment with sipuleucel-T, while continuing with the enzalutamide. This resulted in another complete PSA response 6 months after exposure to sipuleucel-T. CONCLUSION: Sipuleucel-T typically does not produce significant PSA reductions, and, to the best of our knowledge, only 1 previous report of a durable complete PSA response in a patient with metastatic disease has been published. The timing of this response supports an immune mechanism. The biologic rationale for the combination, coupled with the clinical result observed in our patient, provides a basis for studies of the combination of sipuleucel-T and enzalutamide.

On his post op appt on June 14th which will be 4.5 weeks after the op we'll find out what radiotherapy they will suggest. If it is aduvant therapy my research on the internet(!) says aduvant therapy would start 'immediately'. This might sound stupid but what is immediately when the post op appt is already 4.5 weeks after the op. Don't you have to recover more fully from the surgery before radiotherapy starts? Most likely they found his pathology had some problems and that's why they wanted adjuvant radiation. If he has no incontinence or his leakage is minimal, his radiation oncologist could start him as soon as can be scheduled. And Fairwind is right, studies found hormone in addition help reduced recurrance.",

      "Content": "Fairwind & Old Sailor, My heart goes out to both of you. Those of us who are not facing CRPC just cannot imagine how you feel. I know it is easy for me to say not to give up but I think the data for prolonged survivals and success stories are real and not hype, especially for those that are at the beginning like in your cases. Here is one case published in Feb 2013 where combining Xtandi and Provenge provided complete response: Complete biochemical (prostate-specific antigen) response to sipuleucel-T with enzalutamide in castration-resistant prostate cancer: a case report with implications for future research. Graff JN, Drake CG, Beer TM. Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Portland, OR 97239, USA. [email protected] Abstract OBJECTIVE: To describe the case of a patient with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer who achieved a complete and durable biochemical response after treatment with sipuleucel-T while continuing with enzalutamide and to explore the immunologic basis for such a response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements and bone scans to assess the patient's response to enzalutamide followed by the addition of sipuleucel-T. Using preclinical and clinical data, we describe his response through known immunobiologic mechanisms. RESULTS: This patient's PSA level became undetectable during treatment with enzalutamide and began to increase again after 14 months. He opted for treatment with sipuleucel-T, while continuing with the enzalutamide. This resulted in another complete PSA response 6 months after exposure to sipuleucel-T. CONCLUSION: Sipuleucel-T typically does not produce significant PSA reductions, and, to the best of our knowledge, only 1 previous report of a durable complete PSA response in a patient with metastatic disease has been published. The timing of this response supports an immune mechanism. The biologic rationale for the combination, coupled with the clinical result observed in our patient, provides a basis for studies of the combination of sipuleucel-T and enzalutamide.

Prostate situation is consistent with the results of the prior biopsy. For the radiologist's CYA, he/she said there are uncertainties in the peripheral zone but no nodule seen so probably OK. I can give you the long answer but you don't need it. Good news overall so relax and the added benefit is you do not need to check your bladder (systoscope) or colon (colonoscopy) or intestines (diverticulosis) for the radiologist examined all of your interior and gave you a clean bill of health.

      "Content": "Welcome back Kathy. Sounds like his oncologist is on top of thing and is giving him the best treatment protocol, combination hormone and radiation. Fairwind gave a very good suggestion and that is to radiate that positive lymph node and its surrounding. I am quite sure his radiation oncologist is going to do that but no harm discussing with him on that aspect of his treatment. If radiating the positive lymph node did not result in a cure, most likely at this stage his doctors will be talking about managing his disease like a chronic condition instead of a cure. His chance of living a normal life for a long time is still good as there are lots of options left. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Tom C, Sorry you are here but welcome. Urologist can usually guesstimate what your \"normal\" psa should be by using your prostate size and made some assumptions. If your prostate is small and the cancer is minute, a low psa is usually good news. However, as Fairwind said, some prostate cancer cells do not produce psa and those are usually very aggressive. Your biopsy clinical report should identify the type of cancer cells they found. If they are the garden variety adenocarcinoma, you are probably very early stage and perhaps could do AS for many years without problem. You should get a second opinion from an expert pathologist, e.g. Johns Hopkins, to make sure the cancer is the garden variety type. If you want additional input from others, you might want to post your stats here. For example, JohnT, a regular poster here, uses (.066 x prostate volume) to calculate what your \"normal\" psa should be. Good luck and best wishes.",

I know a lot of folks probably feel you are rushing into surgery a little too soon, without the benefit of second opinions on alternatives like seeds or radiation. My opinion is just the opposite. If I were you, I know I need treatment and I won't want to give my G8 cancer any more time to grow or heaven forbid, leave the prostate. My suggestion is \"parallel processing\", i.e., schedule your surgery at the same time consult with radiation oncologists and oncologists since popular surgeons have long wait lists. This way, you won't lose time if the end result is still surgery. In fact that was exactly what I did as my surgeon's wait time was two to three months at a minimum. By doing so, I was able to schedule surgery two months after diagnosis. The two surgeons you considered are two of the best in the US so you won't go wrong. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Nic till I have read so much Negative stuff. What are the chances that his biopsy results are not accurate. Also are the surgery side effects really that bad for young men with no prior issues. If we do not treat it now, what are chances it will not spread and not cause issues in the future. Please help, I am losing my mind thinking of him having to wear pads for the next 20 yrs... Thanks for any advice you have. Sorry you have to be here but welcome. It is normal to be scared but do not worry too much as the situation is not as bad as you think. We all were very scared when first diagnosed but for most things turned out OK. The others gave excellent advices so here I just want to give some positive news: 1. For early stage prostate cancer, the current 10 year cancer specific survival (according to the National Cancer Institute's statistics) is almost 100% and 20 years cancer specific survival after treatment is equally impressive. So, you will no doubt see your husband around for a long long time. 2. As for surgery side effects, most actually recovered their continence after a recovery period, and a majority avoided ED. For those that had ED, medications will help most men. 3. Being young is actually an advantage regarding avoiding surgery side effects. If you have not already done so, you and your husband should take the time to look into other treatment options. However, being only 39, I do not think not treating is a good idea as his cancer has many years to grow and mutate. The key to long term survival is early detection and he is very lucky that he caught his cancer at an early stage, so you folks should actually be thankful for the job physical that could save his life! Best of luck to both of you.",

As for his healing problem, it could be he has some problem with slow healing, e.g., those with diabetes tend to have slow healing, etc. However, given time he should recover fully. You and him just have to be careful with infection and make sure he does not exert too much to stress the stitches and wounds. We have all been given a set of post op instructions like: Make sure bowel movements are smooth (by taking Colace and drinking prune juice for example), do not lift anything over 5 lbs, etc. If he has not been given such, ask his surgeon/GP to provide a set of do's and don't's. I think it is a good sign that he may not have ED. The urge to urinate is common and will subside gradually. Hopefully by \"very wet\" his surgeon doesn't mean he will have difficulty with incontinence. Again, prior to surgery, our physicians advised us to do Kegel exercise and after catheter out also continued to do Kegel to strengthen the muscles that control the urination. Things will get better.

      "Content": "I have never encountered or read anything about someone as young as you had prostate cancer. The youngest I read or met was in his late 30. The problem with AS for someone your age is you have too many years for the cancer to grow and escape. Once out of the capsule, it is incurable. Also, reading your biopsy report, I saw you had 4 cores positive so you do not fit the definition/recommendation for AS. In addition, you had three other cores with atypical cells which usually will lead to cancer. You also had one core High Grade PIN which could also lead to cancer. So, all in all my opinion is don't wait, get rid of your prostate before the cancer escape the capsule. Remember, your life expectancy is over 78, so you have another 50 years' life left if you can get rid of the cancer. Go find a surgeon who has done hundreds of procedures. You then have a better chance of not having any side effects. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I have never encountered or read anything about someone as young as you had prostate cancer. The youngest I read or met was in his late 30. The problem with AS for someone your age is you have too many years for the cancer to grow and escape. Once out of the capsule, it is incurable. Also, reading your biopsy report, I saw you had 4 cores positive so you do not fit the definition/recommendation for AS. In addition, you had three other cores with atypical cells which usually will lead to cancer. You also had one core High Grade PIN which could also lead to cancer. So, all in all my opinion is don't wait, get rid of your prostate before the cancer escape the capsule. Remember, your life expectancy is over 78, so you have another 50 years' life left if you can get rid of the cancer. Go find a surgeon who has done hundreds of procedures. You then have a better chance of not having any side effects. Good luck.",

There is a small spot on the liver, however he is sending me for a second opinion and feels we must go after the Prostate Cancer. Treatment will be with Hormone Therapy and Radiation after the second opinion and as soon as it is possible. The spot on the liver did not show up on both tests and is so small he does not want to wait any longer then getting the second opinion and starting my treatment. I am going to record my voice on the answering machine this week just encase some one were to think it is Nancy answering the phone after the Hormone treatments begin. Friendly Very encouraging and good results. I don't think the small spot in your liver means anything. I had some questionable stuffs in my liver and kidney too but the radiatologist said they were most likely nothing serious. You make the right choice going with hormone and radiation. And, you are correct, don't wait any longer and get it over with. See you on the other side with good results. Best wishes.",

Some could measure to .1, some .01, etc. So, usually you will see something like: PSA <.1 or PSA < .01 which usually is interpreted as 0.0 or undetectable by the machine, whether it is .1 or .01. It looks like your machine had a higher resolution that .06 or .07, since I don't see the < sign in front of the number. It is important to check your PSA a couple of times to see if it stays at ~.06, ~.07 or is creeping up. If it were me, I won't take action if the PSA stays stable even if it is not undetectable since it could be due to benign tissues left behind. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Sorry you had a positive diagnosis. Glad you made your decision on treatment as your G3+5 means you really should get treatment without delay. I know a lot of folks probably feel you are rushing into surgery a little too soon, without the benefit of second opinions on alternatives like seeds or radiation. My opinion is just the opposite. If I were you, I know I need treatment and I won't want to give my G8 cancer any more time to grow or heaven forbid, leave the prostate. My suggestion is \"parallel processing\", i.e., schedule your surgery at the same time consult with radiation oncologists and oncologists since popular surgeons have long wait lists. This way, you won't lose time if the end result is still surgery. In fact that was exactly what I did as my surgeon's wait time was two to three months at a minimum. By doing so, I was able to schedule surgery two months after diagnosis. The two surgeons you considered are two of the best in the US so you won't go wrong. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I have never encountered or read anything about someone as young as you had prostate cancer. The youngest I read or met was in his late 30. The problem with AS for someone your age is you have too many years for the cancer to grow and escape. Once out of the capsule, it is incurable. Also, reading your biopsy report, I saw you had 4 cores positive so you do not fit the definition/recommendation for AS. In addition, you had three other cores with atypical cells which usually will lead to cancer. You also had one core High Grade PIN which could also lead to cancer. So, all in all my opinion is don't wait, get rid of your prostate before the cancer escape the capsule. Remember, your life expectancy is over 78, so you have another 50 years' life left if you can get rid of the cancer. Go find a surgeon who has done hundreds of procedures. You then have a better chance of not having any side effects. Good luck.",

Recently I had my three year check up with my surgeon and I posted the question to him and this was his reply: I always preserved both sphincter muscles and both nerves unless the cancers were too closed to the bladder neck or the nerves. If both muscles were preserved incontinence usually should not be a problem, and recovery should be easier. For those considering Da Vinci, perhaps it is worthwhile to enquire if your surgeon preserves both sphincter muscles.",

He told me that the later would aid incontinence issues much quicker. I don't recall coming across this anywhere else. Has anyone else heard this? No one commented so let me try. First of all, congrats for an excellent surgical outcome with all negative margins and cancer confined to your prostate. As far as I know, some surgeons do practice the technique you described, and mine was one of them. Good luck.",

At my 2nd opinion consult with Dr Dattoli, with him participating, color doppler ultra sound, prostate measured at 65.1cc? Someone made a mistake. The difference is about 40%. If I have to guess, the correct size is the one measured at Dr. Dattoli's place. It is important as the radiation dosage and coverage depend on the determination of the prostate size. The markers determine the locations only. In my opinion, the real time method of location adjustment together with accurate measurement of the prostate size should be a better approach. I suggest you get to the bottom of this before starting treatment. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I have never encountered or read anything about someone as young as you had prostate cancer. The youngest I read or met was in his late 30. The problem with AS for someone your age is you have too many years for the cancer to grow and escape. Once out of the capsule, it is incurable. Also, reading your biopsy report, I saw you had 4 cores positive so you do not fit the definition/recommendation for AS. In addition, you had three other cores with atypical cells which usually will lead to cancer. You also had one core High Grade PIN which could also lead to cancer. So, all in all my opinion is don't wait, get rid of your prostate before the cancer escape the capsule. Remember, your life expectancy is over 78, so you have another 50 years' life left if you can get rid of the cancer. Go find a surgeon who has done hundreds of procedures. You then have a better chance of not having any side effects. Good luck.",

Their basic conclusion was there were no survival difference between the two treatment method. The lead author of the study was JM Crook, MD. You can google his name and read the article.

Some folks (including some of my personal friends) have been fighting this for many many years some for over a decade. It is not hopeless as there are lots of drugs/treatments available that are able to keep the cancer under control for a long time. 2.

I also think a PSA history, as HighlanderCFH stated could shed some lights on whether you can delay treatment. If PSA is doubling fast, don't wait. I did not want to wait when I had a PSA of 10.7 at diagnosed and the final pathology report was much worst than biopsy indicated. In any case, we are not healthcare professionals and are just speculating. His doctor must know more so if he says OK to wait, perhaps he is right. Best wishes.",

For many years my psa has been <1. Now it is over 7. So I think I have a lot to learn. This seems like a good place to start. 1. See a urologist get a DRE and rule out enlarged prostate and infection. 2. Discuss with the urologist your PSA history (PSA velocity), the PSA number vs your prostate size, and % free PSA vs Total PSA and then perhaps a biopsy. 3. As Fairwind said in the sticky, read Dr. Walsh's book. Good luck and hope we can deny your membership application.",

I know it was the first visit, and she hadn't reviewed the disk with the bone scans yet, But I couldn't get a percentage rate of how many make it 5 years and beyond. All she would say is it depends on if you respond to the treatment. But this sounds encouraging. Yes, some lived way beyond 10 years. Of course every case is different and it is difficult to predict which camp one would belong to. However, one oncologist told me treating metastatic prostate cancer is still an art than a science and sometimes a good practitioner can rotate through different medications to keep cancer at bay for a long time. It is advisable to find an oncologist specializes in prostate cancer for treatment if you have metastasized cancer. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by p_shah Hello All, Dad (is in India) was diagnosed with prostate cancer with bone mets last June. His Gleason score then was 9 and his PSA was 12. The cancer had spread to his spine, pelvic and some other bones. He had no symptoms other than weight loss. After biopsy, bone scan and other tests at that time the best approach was determined to go with Orchiectomy to reduce his testosterone levels. His PSA dropped to 0.6 and stayed there till last month. The PSA not has risen back to 2.6 in the test a month ago and 5.2 in the recent tests. He has been taking Zoledronic acid (Zometa) injections every month to 6 weeks on the onco's recommendation for his bone strength. So far no other meds and he has some minor pain, but no major symptoms. His age is 78 years old. We have talked to a couple of oncologists and oncosurgeons and are getting two schools of thoughts: 1. Get him on chemo (and maybe additional Hormone) and that will help both his pain but also might lengthen his lifespan 2. Given his age - don't treat the PSA - but treat his symptoms. If he is not in pain, wait till the pain comes and then manage pain through Hormone first and then evaluate Chemo. The thought here is Chemo at his age will really have a lot of side effects and will impact his quality of life quite a bit without really lengthening the lifespan dramatically. The opinion really was neither will cure the cancer completely. We might use localized radiation to manage pain at some point in time as well. So the goal is to manage the pain / quality of his life as well as use the optimum treatment to lengthen the lifespan as much as possible. Given the background, I had a couple of questions - any experiences or recommendations will help us determine the course of action: a. The general presumption is that Chemo has tons of side effects at that age - I presume it has gotten better over years, but we are not sure if we should go to chemo immediately or wait. b. I have read up on immunotherapy and it sounds promising, but at this advanced stage - there didn't seem like an option. Any trials that are worth considering? c. Any experiences on what is the standard approach in US in this stage. I am in US, while my dad (and siblings) are in India. At this point we are a confused about the next step and whether we go aggressive or manage to his quality of life. Probably no silver bullet, but the path forward seems blurry. Thanks in advance for your help. Also I am new to the forum so if I can provide any other info - please let me know. thx Look into the following scientific study and review papers and draw your own conclusions: http://www.thelancet.com/journals/la...012-1/abstract http://journals.lww.com/oncology-tim...astatic.3.aspx The second article was by Dr. Maha Hussian MD, Prof of Medicine, U of Michigan, one of the foremost prostate cancer oncology experts in the US. In my view, if I were him and I am healthy, I would go for chemo. There is a > 40% longer survival. Chemo side effects can be managed for many folks and you can always stop if things get out of hand. This is a layperson opinion as I am not a healthcare professional, just a fellow patient. Good luck and best wishes.",

I have read a lot of pros and cons of this treatment. Any info you could give me would be very appreciated. Here are my results: Gleason 9 (4+5). EPI (+) (+) PNI SVI (+) Portion of prostate involved by tumor 95%. PT3b. Seminal vesicle invasion present. extraprostatic extension present. perineural invasion present, extensive. No regional lymph node metastasis. Is it worth it to try radiation or too late? I have heard radiation can cause many more problems. I am very confused. BTW I am 52 yrs old and otherwise very healthy. Thanks. Your only chance of a cure is to do radiation (or in combination with hormone). Is is too late? No one knows for sure, not even your doctor, but you are still young and healthy so should be able to withstand the rigor of radiation well. If I were you I would go for it: Prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Good luck.",

      "Content": "LogicBoy, Seems like you are very logical, so, here is one way to look at your situation logically: 1. Your urologist should gather the following information in addition to the biopsy in order to logically decide the treatment approach: DRE result, estimate of the size of your prostate, any symptoms, CT, bone scan and MRI-3 Tesla and trans-rectal coil if possible. These tests will hopeful shed some light on if the cancer has escaped the capsule. This should then give you a clinical staging of your cancer and perhaps the optimum treatment plan. 2. A PSA of 11 is not too high if you have a very large prostate, however, even then, you do have aggressive prostate cancer (G9), so as Fairwind said, aggressive treatment is probably needed. However, if I were you, I would not eliminate any options until I have a complete assessment and second, third opinions. You have one chance to do it right and there is no do-over in this business. 3. Go to Walsh's book, look at the Partin Table, that will give you some assessment of the probability of cancer escapes the capsule. 4. At 66 years of age, my opinion is radiation is a very good choice, so if you are comfortable with radiation, go for it, but I would add adjuvant hormone therapy if I were you. 5. Get a third opinion from a radiation oncologist in addition to an oncologist, and a second opinion on your biopsy slides. Good luck and hope to see you around.",

      "Content": "I am posting this link as a public service for those newly diagnosed with G6 prostate cancer. Normally G6 are low risk cases and many argued that they are indolent and should not be treated and are excellent candidates for AS. So, even if it changes, there is time enough to take action. More cancer centers are advising patients to take this route some here would even say that G6 would never metastasize outside of the prostate. I was always puzzled by the logic and statistics since I saw a 30 year Johns Hopkins study indicating clearly some G6 metastasized. The argument was always it was wrongly read by the pathologist as a pure G6 or there must be some microscopic G7,8 or 9 hiding in there, specifically Dr. Epstein of JH was a strong proponent of AS for G6. In a recent article in The \"New\" Prostate Cancer Infolink, Dr. Epstein provided an answer to my puzzled: It is not just the cancer staging and Gleason scores that determined metastasis, it is some classifications that though identified by biopsy as G6 were more aggressive, e.g., intra-ductal prostate cancer. http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...leason-scores/ Based on this study, Khani and Epstein conclude that \u0085 most men with IDC-P on biopsy/TURP have aggressive tumors, even when the invasive tumor on biopsy is Gleason score 6. As a minority of men may only have Gleason 6 invasive cancer at RP and a favorable prognosis, we recommend that IDC-P on biopsy/TURP be reported separately and not assigned a Gleason score. i.e., intra-ductal G6 can be successfully treated by surgery if done soon enough but could spread if waited too long. I am now in the camp that G6 can successfully do AS without additional risk provided one is a true G6. The challenge for us patients is when confronted with a biopsy report of G6 and no other differentiations as to the type of cancer, how do we know if there is a chance we have \"more aggressive variants lurking around\"? I think at a minimum, if you are a G6 and are considering AS, send your biopsy to at least one other place like JH for a second read to make sure you are a pure G6.",

I am not a healthcare professional so my knowledge of prostate cancer came mainly from my own research as a patient while trying to determine what treatment approach I should take and trying to prepare for my \"what if\". They are from medical journals, studies, reports, discussions with doctors... According to my notes, prostatic adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (positive with neuroendocrine markers) typically means small cell carcinoma of the prostate. They tend not to metastasize to bones but to other soft organs. Also, hormone tends not to be effective and I think that is why abireterone did not work for you. But chemo that are effective against small cell carcinoma of other organs (lung, for example) are effective against this type of prostate cancer, e.g. docetaxel, cisplatin, etoposide..... I may be all wrong so please consult your doctor. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by okadam PSA 7. Adenocarcinoma, highest Gleason score 7 of 10 (3+4) involving both sides of prostate. Tumore involves 8 of 14 cores. Greatest linear dimension of tumor 0.7 cm. We welcome you with open arms. Your stats indicated a moderately aggressive cancer (G7) and fairly extensive (8 of 14 cores positive) so treatment is most likely needed. The other folks gave you excellent suggestions and I will add additional comments: 1. Take your time to understand this disease by reading and doing some research, you do not have to act immediately. You have one shot to do it right and it is important to find the treatment you are comfortable and only you can make the final choice. What is the right treatment for me may not be right for you. 2. As many before us said, the first priority is to cure your cancer, then the second priority is to minimize complications and side effects. 3. If preservation of sexual function is important to you, perhaps you should look at radiation treatment more seriously. Many on this site that chose radiation reported less ED problem than us surgery guys. Modern radiation treatment produces similar long term results in terms of cancer outcome and sometimes less side effects. 4. Even if you have ED after treatment, do not despair, there are medications and treatments that can fix it, so, don't be too worry. 5. Talk it over with your surgeon but ask to seek a second opinion from a radiation oncologist and then decide. Hang in there and best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "The argument against testing was cost effectiveness, bad side effects and no life saving benefit: The number I remembered that USPSTF cited was like out of 1,000 tested you saved 1 life and created a large number with side effects. However, statistics can be manipulated to suit one's answer. For example, one European long term study indicated testing saved life and provided much better survival. For me the telling answer came from the long term US Cancer Institute SEER statistics. It indicated much better survival today than in the 1970s (prior to PSA testing). These are total statistics and cannot be manipulated. 10 year cancer specific survival in 1975 was < 55% whereas 2000 and beyond (after PSA testing was implemented) cancer specific survival was >98%. These are for all cases diagnosed in a specific year. It indicated to me that most of the better survival was due to early detection by using PSA testing. For even today, 5 year survival was 100% for organ confined and localized cases whereas for metastasized cases was 28%. Modern medical treatment advancement really did not offer any better survival once the cancer metastasized. On a personal level, two of my friends never tested until symptoms showed up. One was dead within two years (passed away last year), one is in hospice after two years. Of the 7 of us that found our cancer through testing within the past 10 years, all are still living. 2 had BCR and is being treated with hormone (survived 10 years), 1 is on AS for a few years now, 4 are cancer free after treatment. To me the most important thing is to test early perhaps at 45 or 50 to establish a baseline. Then look at our own case individually and make our decision after looking at our own risk factors and consult with our physician. Maybe we do not test for another 5-10 yrs or maybe we test more often after that. We are talking about <$100 to do a blood test and the cost is even less if it is included in an annual blood test.",

      "Content": "Jacakay, Sorry your husband may have metastatic prostate cancer. If unfortunately it is confirmed, then he needs to seek treatment. With treatment, he will have many years of productive life ahead of him. Here are some of the questions to asked his urologist: 1. Ask him to explain the biopsy pathology report to you. Take note as you will forget what he says if you do not take note. Also, ask for a copy so you can take it to another physician for review if necessary. 2. You like to have in addition to the bone scan, a CT scan and a MRI scan to look at the soft tissue involvement, especially the lymph nodes, the bladder neck area, the Seminal Vesicles, any extra-prostatic extension. Ask him to order those tests. They are important diagnostic tools to assess the situation and develop a treatment protocol. 3. Is a cure still possible? Even with metastatic cancer, there may be hope for a \"cure\" if the spread is limited to only a few spots (<5 for example). Some oncologists like Dr. Myers advocate spot treating the metastatic spots with radiation in addition to hormone therapy. They reported some complete remissions from that treatment protocol. 4. Ask for recommendation to see a radiation oncologist and an oncologist. If the cancer escapes the prostate, the urologist is not the best physician to provide treatment, you need an oncologist, preferably one that specializes in treating prostate cancer. 5. Ask him to recommend some books for you to get familiarize with this disease. Good luck.",

I do wonder on exercise however, I used to ride a lot (and need to start again) and kept my heart rate up high like the exercise experts say. I wonder if my bp shot up then too. Bigbrad, if I am not mistaken, exercise increases both heart rate and blood pressure which is normal. What is important is resting blood pressure should be within the range recommended. However, FeatherBoy is correct, at our age, we need to exercise with care. Best wishes to you and gearloose.",

      "Content": "I am posting this link as a public service for those newly diagnosed with G6 prostate cancer. Normally G6 are low risk cases and many argued that they are indolent and should not be treated and are excellent candidates for AS. So, even if it changes, there is time enough to take action. More cancer centers are advising patients to take this route some here would even say that G6 would never metastasize outside of the prostate. I was always puzzled by the logic and statistics since I saw a 30 year Johns Hopkins study indicating clearly some G6 metastasized. The argument was always it was wrongly read by the pathologist as a pure G6 or there must be some microscopic G7,8 or 9 hiding in there, specifically Dr. Epstein of JH was a strong proponent of AS for G6. In a recent article in The \"New\" Prostate Cancer Infolink, Dr. Epstein provided an answer to my puzzled: It is not just the cancer staging and Gleason scores that determined metastasis, it is some classifications that though identified by biopsy as G6 were more aggressive, e.g., intra-ductal prostate cancer. http://prostatecancerinfolink.net/20...leason-scores/ Based on this study, Khani and Epstein conclude that \u0085 most men with IDC-P on biopsy/TURP have aggressive tumors, even when the invasive tumor on biopsy is Gleason score 6. As a minority of men may only have Gleason 6 invasive cancer at RP and a favorable prognosis, we recommend that IDC-P on biopsy/TURP be reported separately and not assigned a Gleason score. i.e., intra-ductal G6 can be successfully treated by surgery if done soon enough but could spread if waited too long. I am now in the camp that G6 can successfully do AS without additional risk provided one is a true G6. The challenge for us patients is when confronted with a biopsy report of G6 and no other differentiations as to the type of cancer, how do we know if there is a chance we have \"more aggressive variants lurking around\"? I think at a minimum, if you are a G6 and are considering AS, send your biopsy to at least one other place like JH for a second read to make sure you are a pure G6.",

      "Content": "dirkv, Sorry to see you here but welcome. I have not had hormone or radiation but did a lot of research on them \"just in case\". I also have plenty of friends and folks at my support group gone through surgery, salvage radiation and hormone. If you refused radiation the first time, very likely your cancer is systemic by now (three years later) and it may be too late to try radiation. But I am not a doctor, so, you are smart to consult a radiation oncologist. As for Casodex, my understanding is many patients after taking Casodex and Lupron for a long time and see their PSA increasing can see a reduction in PSA by stopping Casodex. So, oncologist will try this first before going to plan B. However, this response is temporary and eventually the PSA will start to rise again. If this fails, don't give up, there are other hormones, immunologic treatment and chemo that can keep your cancer at bay. Good luck.",

And those in your support group that has salvage radiation, was it effective for a while? Thanks! catsforkids, Welcome. Most hospitals have prostate cancer support groups. So, the first place to look is to contact the hospital where your Dad did his surgery. At my hospital, there are two groups, one for general support and education. Every month, we invited practitioners/experts to give talks on various topics. In my three and a half years with this group we had cycled through all the topics of detection, treatment options, BCR, clinical trials, ED, incontinence..... We also tried to help one another by sharing experiences. The other support group is for prostate cancer patients with metastasis. Some patients participated in both. I do not know the success rate of salvage radiation in my group as we did not keep record. As usual, most folks that were successfully treated with radiation tended to move on and we did not see them again. Definitely there were failures as we met some of them. One that I remembered well was the Chief of Pathology of one of the local hospitals. But after failed radiation, he managed to control his with Lupron and came back to talk about it. Good luck and best wishes.",

I have read a lot of pros and cons of this treatment. Any info you could give me would be very appreciated. Here are my results: Gleason 9 (4+5). EPI (+) (+) PNI SVI (+) Portion of prostate involved by tumor 95%. PT3b. Seminal vesicle invasion present. extraprostatic extension present. perineural invasion present, extensive. No regional lymph node metastasis. Is it worth it to try radiation or too late? I have heard radiation can cause many more problems. I am very confused. BTW I am 52 yrs old and otherwise very healthy. Thanks. Your only chance of a cure is to do radiation (or in combination with hormone). Is is too late? No one knows for sure, not even your doctor, but you are still young and healthy so should be able to withstand the rigor of radiation well. If I were you I would go for it: Prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Work out, lose weight and keep in shape are excellent steps to take prior to treatment. I did that and believed they helped my recovery. I am still biased against AS, especially for someone in their 50s. Your cancer has 30-40 years to grow and turn nasty and I am not sure you can be 100% sure when is the right time to take action, or that your cancer is indolent or will stay indolent... Is is worth it to take the gamble? Will G6 ever turns into G7, G8? Of course they might, otherwise why would my non cancer prostate first turned into PIN, then atypia then cancer? Looking at my post op pathology, mine was quite extensive by the time of surgery and seemed to rapidly turning into tertiary G8 from G6. Who knows, if I waited another year cancer might escape the prostate. It is not even a question of cost: Take a biopsy every year for 20-30 years, take PSA every 3-6 months and see your urologist every 3-6 months for 20-30 years, the cost is at best about a wash compare with surgery (two years after surgery, my urologist released me back to my PCP) or brachy. If you ended up having to take action, it will be more costly. As for side effects, folks here reported very few radiation side effects and mine surgery side effects were minimal with QOL actually better than before surgery (hematuria, slow stream, unable to empty, nocturia, frequent urgencies, lower back pain, groin pain all gone). But, it is a personal opinion and not medical advice. Also, I greatly admire folks who have the courage to do AS and deal with the uncertainties over long periods. Good luck.",

      "Content": "oshguy, Welcome to our side of the world. Looks like you got your cancer out just in the nick of time before it spread and your chance of a complete cure is very high. Overall I think the news for you is very good with minor negatives of microscopic bladder neck invasion and a positive margin. It is great news that lymph nodes are all negative, seminal vesicle negative (another big deal) and fat, fibrovascular tissue negative (meaning no evidence of microscopic spread). You had a very good surgeon. He removed a lot of lymph nodes and surrounding fat tissues, saw the extend of the cancer and cut wide including the bladder neck where the microscopic invasion was. He is correct that very likely the cut (using a heated knife) killed off any cancer cells at the margin or near the bladder neck. The reason I know he cut wide is your current incontinence, with a wide cut into the bladder neck, he probably affected some of the smooth muscles that control the opening of the bladder so your continence recovery will be slower than most. And I bet he spared both your nerves. He is also proactive and wanted a PSA test in 6 weeks instead of 3 months to make sure you get an early start if something more needs to be done. Good luck.",

      "Content": "dirkv, Sorry to see you here but welcome. I have not had hormone or radiation but did a lot of research on them \"just in case\". I also have plenty of friends and folks at my support group gone through surgery, salvage radiation and hormone. If you refused radiation the first time, very likely your cancer is systemic by now (three years later) and it may be too late to try radiation. But I am not a doctor, so, you are smart to consult a radiation oncologist. As for Casodex, my understanding is many patients after taking Casodex and Lupron for a long time and see their PSA increasing can see a reduction in PSA by stopping Casodex. So, oncologist will try this first before going to plan B. However, this response is temporary and eventually the PSA will start to rise again. If this fails, don't give up, there are other hormones, immunologic treatment and chemo that can keep your cancer at bay. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Deb 27 The following are his results: Margins involved by invasive carcinoma, unifocal. Perineural invasion was present. Additionally, it said it was high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. PT2c. So, the positive margins have me a little concerned as well as the perineural invasion!!! Deb 27, It is an excellent pathology report except for the two things that worried you. I like to add my response to the two items quoted above to support the other posters' responses. First of all, the positive margin is unifocal, meaning they only found it at one place. Also, I interpret from your post op pathology summary that it barely showed at that margin. If that is the case, very likely the act of surgery killed any cancer cells at the margin (per Dr. P Walsh's book). If you are still not sure, get hold of the pathology report and see what they actually said about cancer at the margin (usually expresses as _ mm at the margin). Some pathologist also examined the cancer cells at the margin to see if it is grade 3 or grade 4. If it is grade 3, they normally don't live long outside the prostate even if surgery did not kill them, so you can relax. Second, perineural invasion (PNI) in post op pathology findings has no bearing on the risks of BCR (biochemical recurrence). There were several medical studies on that topic and that was their conclusions. In his case, it is even better as they stated the PNI was not cancer but high grade PIN (did I read it correctly?), which is pre-cancerous cells. Overall, you should be happy with the outcome and we wish him the best of luck.",

      "Content": "Fairwind is correct. Not too many surgeons took the time and effort to compile and publish their success/failure rate. It is a no win situation for the surgeon and it takes time, money and manpower to keep and compare records. Only a few high volume surgeons or surgeons at academic centers of excellence bothered to published peer review studies. Those that published indicated it took a surgeon 250-400 procedures to be very good at it. ThatBiopsyHurt is also correct, The Cleveland Clinic is one such center of excellence and surgeons at the center who has done more than 250-400 should be quite good. You also need to interview them to pick someone you are comfortable with. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by catsforkids Hi dad! Glad to see you on the forum! Newporter, how do you find a support group? And those in your support group that has salvage radiation, was it effective for a while? Thanks! catsforkids, Welcome. Most hospitals have prostate cancer support groups. So, the first place to look is to contact the hospital where your Dad did his surgery. At my hospital, there are two groups, one for general support and education. Every month, we invited practitioners/experts to give talks on various topics. In my three and a half years with this group we had cycled through all the topics of detection, treatment options, BCR, clinical trials, ED, incontinence..... We also tried to help one another by sharing experiences. The other support group is for prostate cancer patients with metastasis. Some patients participated in both. I do not know the success rate of salvage radiation in my group as we did not keep record. As usual, most folks that were successfully treated with radiation tended to move on and we did not see them again. Definitely there were failures as we met some of them. One that I remembered well was the Chief of Pathology of one of the local hospitals. But after failed radiation, he managed to control his with Lupron and came back to talk about it. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Rolian Hello, hope everyone is doing well here. My dad received surgical castration early June and has been taking Flutamide. PSA dropped to 4.08 first month after. Another blood test couple of days ago, and his PSA bounced back to 50!! So worried, what could be wrong? Does it mean it's castration resistant already? Doctor did not give much info yet as what the next step will be, we gonna talk to him later. Does anyone have similar experience, or know anything about what the problem could be, and next step? Thank you Rolian, Sorry to hear you Dad's PSA bounced back. From a nadir of 4 to 50 in 6 months is a very rapid increase and most likely indicated his cancer is aggressive and not responding to castration or first line hormone treatment. I don't know how the medical system works in China but in the US/Canada he usually is been treated at this stage by a medical oncologist specializing in prostate cancer and in cases like his probably will move him to second line treatments like chemo, new generations of hormone, immunology therapy.... By cycling through the new treatments, they will be able to keep his cancer at bay for a long time. Best wishes and best of luck to your Dad.",

      "Content": "The argument against testing was cost effectiveness, bad side effects and no life saving benefit: The number I remembered that USPSTF cited was like out of 1,000 tested you saved 1 life and created a large number with side effects. However, statistics can be manipulated to suit one's answer. For example, one European long term study indicated testing saved life and provided much better survival. For me the telling answer came from the long term US Cancer Institute SEER statistics. It indicated much better survival today than in the 1970s (prior to PSA testing). These are total statistics and cannot be manipulated. 10 year cancer specific survival in 1975 was < 55% whereas 2000 and beyond (after PSA testing was implemented) cancer specific survival was >98%. These are for all cases diagnosed in a specific year. It indicated to me that most of the better survival was due to early detection by using PSA testing. For even today, 5 year survival was 100% for organ confined and localized cases whereas for metastasized cases was 28%. Modern medical treatment advancement really did not offer any better survival once the cancer metastasized. On a personal level, two of my friends never tested until symptoms showed up. One was dead within two years (passed away last year), one is in hospice after two years. Of the 7 of us that found our cancer through testing within the past 10 years, all are still living. 2 had BCR and is being treated with hormone (survived 10 years), 1 is on AS for a few years now, 4 are cancer free after treatment. To me the most important thing is to test early perhaps at 45 or 50 to establish a baseline. Then look at our own case individually and make our decision after looking at our own risk factors and consult with our physician. Maybe we do not test for another 5-10 yrs or maybe we test more often after that. We are talking about <$100 to do a blood test and the cost is even less if it is included in an annual blood test.",

To say that because there are false positives and abandoning it is short sighted in my humble opinion. To put things in perspective, compare the 28% survival after 5 years for metastasized prostate cancer at detection, five year survival for lymphoma is 66%, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 79%, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 61%, eye and orbit cancer 81%, colorectal cancer (overall) 65%, colorectal (metastasized) 13%, lung cancer 17%, breast cancer (overall) 89%, breast cancer (metastasized) 24%......

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jbdubose I was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had prostatectomy in Dec. 09'. I had a high cancer score (8+). The follow-up PSA test a few weeks after showed my level at 2.9. The doctor was astounded saying the margins were clear from my surgery. So he did another PSA a week later and it was 3.2. Evidently he did not get it all and it was climbing up fast. So, in Mar. 10' I got sent to radiation for 40+ treatments and as an added \"bonus\" I got started on Lupron. Yes, I have now read all the bad stuff on the drug and completely agree with many assessments. It did a number on me as well. I was on the drug for 1.5 years getting zeros all the while and talked my doc into getting off of it (Nov. 11'). He said it would take the same amount of time for the drug to wear off before my PSA tests would be truly accurate and for my hormone levels to bounce back. But he did mention that I was not a candidate for HRT since I was stage 3 at one point (Radiation, etc). Since Nov. 11' I have continued to get zeros on my PSA but my pituitary gland never kicked back and my hormone levels ranged 68 until recently. Now they are dropping (50) again. Now, the doc has ordered some pituitary blood tests to see if a tumor is present. He has also relented and has put me on HRT (via gel). Options? Is there any medicine, natural or otherwise, out there that can \"jumpstart\" my pituitary? Although there may be a risk in doing HRT again, I have done extensive research and have found that prognosis unstable. So I am 50/50 on HRT. Has anyone in this forum experienced this or have heard of this happening? Any advice? Please help...I am pretty frustrated! Thanks in advance, Jim I am not in healthcare so I am posting as a layperson giving non professional opinions. I gather by HRT you are referring to Testosterone replacement therapy. After off Lupron, your T level should return to normal or near normal after it wears off in about 6 months. Obviously yours are still low (I understand normal is over 200). Since T is associated with energy and well being in male, low T often leads to not feeling well. First, all T gels have warning labels that it is counter indicated for prostate cancer, so most doctors won't prescribe for us. However, there are some limited studies that indicated it is OK for those whose cancer is in remission and PSA is undetectable for a period. We had a thread here sometime ago, going back and forth about the appropriateness of T replacement for us prostate cancer sufferers and if my memory is correct there were fellows on it then. I am personally against it for the cancer risk but since I don't suffer from low T, I am not in a position to argue for or against it. Who knows, with the supervision of your physician, it may be worth a try if you are suffering from depression, low energy.... If you and your doctor decide to go ahead, perhaps you can share the results so future sufferers can benefit? Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Work out, lose weight and keep in shape are excellent steps to take prior to treatment. I did that and believed they helped my recovery. I am still biased against AS, especially for someone in their 50s. Your cancer has 30-40 years to grow and turn nasty and I am not sure you can be 100% sure when is the right time to take action, or that your cancer is indolent or will stay indolent... Is is worth it to take the gamble? Will G6 ever turns into G7, G8? Of course they might, otherwise why would my non cancer prostate first turned into PIN, then atypia then cancer? Looking at my post op pathology, mine was quite extensive by the time of surgery and seemed to rapidly turning into tertiary G8 from G6. Who knows, if I waited another year cancer might escape the prostate. It is not even a question of cost: Take a biopsy every year for 20-30 years, take PSA every 3-6 months and see your urologist every 3-6 months for 20-30 years, the cost is at best about a wash compare with surgery (two years after surgery, my urologist released me back to my PCP) or brachy. If you ended up having to take action, it will be more costly. As for side effects, folks here reported very few radiation side effects and mine surgery side effects were minimal with QOL actually better than before surgery (hematuria, slow stream, unable to empty, nocturia, frequent urgencies, lower back pain, groin pain all gone). But, it is a personal opinion and not medical advice. Also, I greatly admire folks who have the courage to do AS and deal with the uncertainties over long periods. Good luck.",

      "Content": "No one responded so let me give it a try and I assumed you had a negative DRE. There are three possibilities: Enlarged prostate (BPH), infection/inflammation and cancer. Enlarged prostate does not give yo-yo PSA numbers, usually the PSA increases gradually over a period of time as the prostate grows larger. Cancer also normally does not give yo-yo PSA number and usually PSA increases rather rapidly if the cancer is aggressive. That leaves infection/inflammation. PSA can go up and down based on the infection flair up, etc. So, a yo-yo PSA could signal infection. However, you also have a rather high baseline - >4 (you didi not mention your age, I am just guessing you are young) so it could be a combination of all three that caused the symptoms. Another thing to remember is that a TRUS biopsy does not sample all areas of the prostate, even if the doctor do a saturation biopsy. There are some areas that are difficult for a TRUS biopsy to access so if there is cancer there biopsy could be all negative. You and your doctor might want to try other means, maybe MRI, color doppler ultrasound etc. by an experienced radiologist.... Another note, in 2011, the FDA asked the drug manufacturers of finesteride to put a warning label that indicated a possibility of increase detection of more aggressive prostate cancer. There are currently two schools of thoughts on this, one group of doctors believe finesteride makes detecting aggressive cancer easier whereas another group believe finesteride promotes the growth of more aggressive prostate cancer. You might want to get a second opinion about taking this medication. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Lowlightsolutions thanks very much for responding, PSA actually closer to 7 now. Yes biopsy does not sound pleasant. I may post another question as I'm thinking of changing doctors and there are minor complications. For someone who is 53, a PSA of 3.5 is considered on the high side. 7 is certainly very high. There are three possibilities: BPH (enlarged prostate), infection and cancer. Most urologist will try to eliminate the first two before doing biopsy to detect cancer. Your urologist should be able to tell if your prostate is enlarged by doing DRE, and he should have given you a course of antibiotics to see if the high PSA is caused by infection. Also, he should tell you that a few days prior to PSA test, do not engage in sex or doing anything to upset the prostate (like riding a bike for a long time, or a DRE, etc.) to eliminate tasks that stimulate the production of PSA from your prostate. If after all of the above, your PSA is still 7, I would not be afraid to go for a biopsy as it is really the only sure way to detect cancer if found positive and it is not that painful. On the other hand, a negative biopsy does not mean no cancer because it could miss the cancer. If you are not comfortable with your urologist, you should change doctor. It is very likely that you need a lot of care and advice from your urologist and you absolutely have to trust him and like him. Best of luck and hope you won't join our club.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Katyana08 Now he has been diagnosed with aggressive stage 4 cancer and they recommended radiation therapy and hormone replacement therapy. He is refusing both, as his father and uncle died of this disease and he refuses to deal with the side effects of the treatment. I am wondering how much time he might have left. I want him to see me get married, and for him to travel and see family and friends, but I have no idea if this is something likely to kill him in a few months or years. Any information would be helpful. Thank you! Every individual is different so it is difficult to answer you question as to how much time he has. I am not a healthcare professional so the following is from researching cancer statistics compiled by the National Cancer Institute and I could be miss interpreting the outcomes so please check with his physicians: For those whose cancer is organ confined or regional (metastasized to the adjacent organs like bladder, rectum, etc.) the 5 year relative median survival is almost 100%. On the other hand, if it metastasizes to the bones, the 5 year relative median survival is only about 30%. Still, in that case, it means 30% still live more than 5 years after the staging. He is a stage 4, which include metastasizes to either regional lymph nodes, organs or bones so it is important to find out which is which. Also another thing is that there are some very significant advances in prostate cancer treatments recently and the outcome will definitely be much better than during his father and uncle's time. A combination of chemo and hormone dramatically lengthen the survival time compare to conventional treatment by over 40%. As for side effects, there are a few medications that can minimize them. I sure wish he would not give up and continue to fight. I have an associate who as a stage 4, survives over a decade after failed surgery with various treatments. He is still living and I visit him regularly; he is by no means cured as he has to keep taking medications but he live a very meaningful and happy life. Best of luck to both of you and I pray that he still has time to see you get married.",

But it seems like that is the main tool they all use in determining if your cured or if treatment your taking is working or not. Until researchers can find a more definitive tool, it is all we have. To say that because there are false positives and abandoning it is short sighted in my humble opinion. To put things in perspective, compare the 28% survival after 5 years for metastasized prostate cancer at detection, five year survival for lymphoma is 66%, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 79%, Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 61%, eye and orbit cancer 81%, colorectal cancer (overall) 65%, colorectal (metastasized) 13%, lung cancer 17%, breast cancer (overall) 89%, breast cancer (metastasized) 24%......

Normally, folks that had successful surgery seldom hung around support sites like this, mostly they moved on and return to a normal, routine life. I decided to hang around because I continued to read up on the latest research on prostate cancer and wanted to share them with you. Also, I wanted to make many of the newcomers aware that there were successes and not all gloom and doom. Well, after six years of <.1, and surgery only a very faint memory, it is hard for me to \"share\" my experience and advice others anymore. So it is time to move on, \"ride off into the sunset\" and let others who are more qualified to hold your hands and give you comfort. My post is to say good bye and to thank you all for keeping me sane after my diagnosis, supported me emotionally and provided me with lots of advices post surgery to help my recovery.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jessjokin I've purchased a book on nutrition for prostate cancer, so now I'm drinking 2 soy protein shakes a day \"about 90 gm\" with vitamins, lycopene, longevinex and peterapure \"resveratrol\", vitamine E 400, n-acetyl cystene, and tomato juice daily, anyone having any advice or thoughts on nutrition would be greatly appreciated. thanks With a PSA of 24 to 30 and a Gleason score of 8, you need the best in conventional medicine to fight your cancer. Adding diets and supplements are smart moves but do it in moderation and as an adjunct. IMHO, it is OK to use diet to help fight your cancer as you will find that most of us (me included) eat a lot healthier (and added supplements) after cancer diagnosis. However, using proven, evidence based medical treatment is critical to help you get rid of your cancer. If you search published peer review scientific studies, you will not find any of the supplements in your list proven to cure cancer. In fact, a clinical trial on vitamin E was stopped when the result indicated it actually increased the risk of prostate cancer. It is just like financial investment: When it is too good to be true, it is not true. That said, to support what Fairwind said, as far as I know, the only clinical trial (2 phase II trials in fact, one from UCLA and the other from Johns Hopkins) that I found demonstrated a slow down in PSA increase (after conventional treatments failed) are on pomegranate juice and extract (pills). Even then, the results were not definitive (they were only phase II trials). I apologize if I sounded impolite, but please take it as I care about you getting well. Good luck and peace be with you.",

      "Content": "There are a lot of hypes about proton but studies did not indicate any survival or side effect advantages over brachy or IMRT, just very expensive. Also, long term outcome studies are lacking. Based on what I have read, if you choose radiation, brachy+IMRT offers the best outcome and least side effects. Also, some studies point to even better outcome if you combine that with adjuvant hormone therapy. Good luck.",

You cannot go wrong using their service, especially Dr. Grimm. I would ask for Dr. Grimm if he is available. When I was trying to decide on treatment, he was my top Brachy option. However, most likely they have many good radiation oncologists that he trained and they should be very acceptable too. Good luck.",

You want someone who has done at least 2 to 4 a week every week. Practice makes perfect and frequency is important. 2. What are his statistics regarding positive margins, incontinence and ED? The best surgeons, e.g., Dr. Walsh, kept statistics, video tape their operations and published their statistics and you can go online to find out. 3. Can you talk to some of his recent patients? If he is good, he should be very willing to share his statistics with you, if not find someone else. You have one shot and there is no \"do over\" in this business so you want and should demand the very best. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Oncologists generally follow two different approaches, one practice is sequencing through medications and the other is more in using multiple drugs regimen to hit the recurrence hard to prevent recurrence. Recent evidences suggest the multiple drug approach could be better at prolonging remission. None of us are doctors, we get our knowledge through our own experiences or by reading/researching. Since every case is different and we don't know your case, you should discuss this with your oncologist. Casodex and Lupron act on different mechanisms (anti-androgen - blocking the production of testosterone vs LHRH argonist - blocking the enzyme that starts testosterone production), if Casodex stops working Lupron could still work because neither is 100% effective, of course if the cancer cells that remain do not need testosterone to grow then Lupron will be of no use. But I am just a lay person, so please ask your doctor. Good luck.",

Your abdominal pains should go away soon. They might be due to irritation of the wounds (internal or external) from coughing. Dry cough is normal due to breathing tube irritations. Pressing a pillow on your abdomen while coughing is smart, that should minimize potential damages to your wounds and surgical stitches. Getting rid of the catheter ranked as one of the best moments of my life. Good luck.",

I wouldn't say you had 100 core and only one is positive because they were taken at different years, but I would say if you have a saturation biopsy of 30+ and they only found 1 core 5% G6, it is very early stage. I think the MD Anderson recommendation is a good one. Even if your cancer progresses you still have time to treat. I also read somewhere that transition zone cancers tend to be less aggressive, less prong to spread? Don't risk treatment with all the potential side effects, as neither surgery nor radiation are a walk in the park. Perhaps, change your diet, take some supplements and wait it out for a couple of years with AS is your best option. Good luck.",

Wait a few months and retest, make sure this time, a few days prior to test, you do not have sex, ride a bike for too long, etc. I used the PSA history you provided and with all the data your PSA doubling time is about 10 years! If I removed the latest PSA, your doubling time is > 12 years. And, if I removed the early years using data from 2009 onward, your PSA doubling time is now 18 years. With this level of doubling time, you will be 90 years old with a PSA of 10-20, and you will die of something else and not prostate cancer. In your situation my opinion is unless your future PSA increases rapidly and is monotonic, you need not worry too much. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by D&K FYI: my husband's PSA was 6 3 yrs ago; 2 yrs ago was 7. no one seemed worried. Last year it somehow got missed. This year was 73; EVERYONE jumped on the bandwagon, doing MRI & CT scan. He has metastasized, & immediately got into treatment. IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, JUST DO IT! Sorry about your husband's situation. Why his physician was not worry about a PSA of 6 and 7 is quite a surprise to me as that indicated a PSA doubling time of 4.5 years, and not doing yearly monitoring or discussing his options? In my opinion his PCP is not doing his/her job. We need to be educated and understand what our test indicators mean in our situation. I hope going forward you and your husband read up on what his doctor's treatment protocol means because in prostate cancer there are multiple options and often time patient needs to participate in selecting the best option to fit his situation. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Like lancepeace said, HT could keep his cancer under control for years. In my cancer support group, many are on HT for many years. I have a colleague on intermittent HT for over a decade and another on HT for some time after BCR and failed surgery/SRT and currently with PSA undetectable. He will be on HT vacation soon. The question is, your dad enjoyed undetectable PSA for a few years, but once PSA started rising why not took action and why waited until it went up to 49? From his stats of G7 and initial undetectable PSA, he is someone who could enjoy long survival with HT. It is not too late to act. Consult his oncologist for recommendation as there are many options even with a heart condition. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jessjokin I've purchased a book on nutrition for prostate cancer, so now I'm drinking 2 soy protein shakes a day \"about 90 gm\" with vitamins, lycopene, longevinex and peterapure \"resveratrol\", vitamine E 400, n-acetyl cystene, and tomato juice daily, anyone having any advice or thoughts on nutrition would be greatly appreciated. thanks With a PSA of 24 to 30 and a Gleason score of 8, you need the best in conventional medicine to fight your cancer. Adding diets and supplements are smart moves but do it in moderation and as an adjunct. IMHO, it is OK to use diet to help fight your cancer as you will find that most of us (me included) eat a lot healthier (and added supplements) after cancer diagnosis. However, using proven, evidence based medical treatment is critical to help you get rid of your cancer. If you search published peer review scientific studies, you will not find any of the supplements in your list proven to cure cancer. In fact, a clinical trial on vitamin E was stopped when the result indicated it actually increased the risk of prostate cancer. It is just like financial investment: When it is too good to be true, it is not true. That said, to support what Fairwind said, as far as I know, the only clinical trial (2 phase II trials in fact, one from UCLA and the other from Johns Hopkins) that I found demonstrated a slow down in PSA increase (after conventional treatments failed) are on pomegranate juice and extract (pills). Even then, the results were not definitive (they were only phase II trials). I apologize if I sounded impolite, but please take it as I care about you getting well. Good luck and peace be with you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Race A friend of mine had RALP last month, and I went over to cut his grass for him. He seemed to have a little rougher recovery time than I had. He said he had a drain in for about 10 days. Then he also said the doctor told him not to eat anything with red dye in it for awhile. I had never heard of this. So, I'm wondering, what's up with that? It sounds more like a colonoscopy kind of thing. Don't know about the red dye part but I think the reason he was having a rougher time was because his surgeon took out some lymph nodes which sometimes caused additional discomfort. That was also the reason for the JP drain for 10 days.",

However his DR. did say 2 tumors, one is larger and \"aggressive\" He is 59 and in good health/shape. He begins radiology on monday which is scary because from what Ive read here, most effected usually have more time to wait. Any thoughts/info appreciated. DDBNY, Welcome. Based on the stats you mentioned, your Dad's cancer is early stage and non aggressive. PSA of 4.2, G6 and 2 cores positive, mostly likely the cancer is organ confined - stays in the prostate capsule, and the chance of cure is very high. Radiation treatment is an excellent option, sometimes does produce side effects but often they go away after treatment so don't worry unnecessarily. Go get Dr. Walsh's book and read the section on radiation treatment to understand the treatment protocol and possible side effects and treatment of side effects. Good luck.",

Your PSA of 40 to 60 are very high numbers indicating a risk of EPE (extra-prostatic-extension), i.e., cancer may have grown beyond the prostate. In addition a Gleason (4+3) is moderately aggressive. So you should not waste any time and seek treatment asap. However, that said, with the right treatment, you should be around for a long time. Best of luck to you.",

I wouldn't say you had 100 core and only one is positive because they were taken at different years, but I would say if you have a saturation biopsy of 30+ and they only found 1 core 5% G6, it is very early stage. I think the MD Anderson recommendation is a good one. Even if your cancer progresses you still have time to treat. I also read somewhere that transition zone cancers tend to be less aggressive, less prong to spread? Don't risk treatment with all the potential side effects, as neither surgery nor radiation are a walk in the park. Perhaps, change your diet, take some supplements and wait it out for a couple of years with AS is your best option. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Agree with the others, it seems premature to take aggressive action unless there are indications of cancer escaping the capsule, after all, .04 is <.1 or consider undetectable in standard PSA tests. First order of business for you is to get hold of the post op pathology report to see what the pathologist said about the specimen: Any EPE (extraprostatic extension, cancer outside the capsule), any positive margins (cancer outside/on the edge of the specimen), any seminal vesicles involvement, any bladder neck involvement, any urethra involvement, any lymph nodes involvement..... If there are none of the above, there are two possibilities for non zero PSA post op other than cancer cells left behind: some benign tissues left behind or the PSA was taken too early as the PSA half life in the blood is about 2 to 3 days so it takes several weeks for the remaining PSA to clear the blood plasma. Anyway, most of us do the following: Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Good luck and hope for the best for you.",

Wait a few months and retest, make sure this time, a few days prior to test, you do not have sex, ride a bike for too long, etc. I used the PSA history you provided and with all the data your PSA doubling time is about 10 years! If I removed the latest PSA, your doubling time is > 12 years. And, if I removed the early years using data from 2009 onward, your PSA doubling time is now 18 years. With this level of doubling time, you will be 90 years old with a PSA of 10-20, and you will die of something else and not prostate cancer. In your situation my opinion is unless your future PSA increases rapidly and is monotonic, you need not worry too much. Good luck.",

I was a bit surprised at the ~12% new patients being diagnosed as node positive. g. George, Good points. I am a layperson but I agree with you 100%. Reading many of the advances in cancer and HIV treatments, a lot of breakthroughs came from combination therapy. It has been standard for breast cancer for at least 10 yrs; HIV became a chronic disease instead of a death sentence after combination of drugs given concurrently.... I just don't understand why this is not done for prostate cancer that has spread. The recent clinical trial combining chemo and hormone early showed significant survival advantage is just a first step. Intuitively, I would think a combination would cut down cancer cell mutation, drug resistance and have a higher chance of kill. Best wishes.",

This year was 73; EVERYONE jumped on the bandwagon, doing MRI & CT scan. He has metastasized, & immediately got into treatment. IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, JUST DO IT! Sorry about your husband's situation. Why his physician was not worry about a PSA of 6 and 7 is quite a surprise to me as that indicated a PSA doubling time of 4.5 years, and not doing yearly monitoring or discussing his options? In my opinion his PCP is not doing his/her job. We need to be educated and understand what our test indicators mean in our situation. I hope going forward you and your husband read up on what his doctor's treatment protocol means because in prostate cancer there are multiple options and often time patient needs to participate in selecting the best option to fit his situation.

When I slept, I hung my large bag inside a large cleaning bucket sitting on the floor beside my chair or bed. Also, I asked the hospital discharge nurse to give me my hospital gown and wore it at home. I only walked inside my house and only ventured out on the day of the catheter removal. That was also the only time I used the leg bag. It is very easy to irritate the tip where the catheter comes out. To avoid infection, clean the tip with clean cold water (distilled water if available) frequently and apply Neosporin once a day. Do not wash it with alcohol or other disinfectants for they may cause more irritations.",

High PSA and MRI showed mass are not definitive diagnosis. MRI could showed a mass due to other causes. It is good to get prepare just in case but do not jump the gun. If you already have a positive biopsy, it is important to know the clinical pathology results before deciding on a treatment plan. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I am very sorry about your husband's situation. I don't have any personal experience to help answer your questions and you really need to get it from his physicians. However, please give the treatment time to work. Ductal is a very rare form and there are not a whole lot of information available. There were conflicting reports as to whether it was more or less aggressive than the usual kind. Recent findings did indicate it to be more aggressive. If it is organ confined, the cure rate and survival rate are quite good. One recent study (2010) quoted ~80% at 10 years. However, once it escapes it is more aggressive and tend to metastasize to soft organs like lung and liver. Researchers seemed to indicate it should be treated aggressively in order to minimize spread and prolong survival. There is a case presented indicating a treatment of surgery and radiation kept it at bay for a long time and when it came back, it was treated with a 4-round chemo. The patient had a 10 year clinical history since first diagnosed. Hopefully your husband will have as much time if not more. The question you need to ask his physicians is what are their plan (surgery+radiation+?) and what is plan B (there has to be a plan B). If you an afford it, travel to a major cancer center for treatment for they are more likely to have more experience in treating this rare form. Good luck.",

If he is seeing his urologist, my suggestion is ask his urologist to refer him to an oncologist who specializes in treating prostate cancer. Very likely they will do a batteries of tests and scans to determine if they can find the source of the PSA/cancer and go from there. Though at this stage there are probably no curative treatments for him, there are many treatment protocols and drugs that are very effective in slowing down and controlling the spread of prostate cancer, often for years.

You are young and in good physical shape, so, recovery from surgery should be fast and easy and side effects could be minimum provided you choose a good surgeon, one that has, hopefully, done 1,000 prostatectomies or more. Another point, with a PSA of 19.9, your urologist needs to make sure the cancer is still contain within the prostate by running additional tests, including an MRI and a color Doppler ultrasound if possible (in addition to the bone scan and CT you are going to do). If there is any indication of cancer escaping the capsule, surgery may not be the right treatment. As Fairwind said, very few die from a G6 prostate cancer, so good luck to you.",

What i remember is my PSA was 4.06 and that test was to confirm my first PSA test of 4.03, all in my first time testing. My gleason score was 6, margins clear and no spreading to the seminal vesicals. The level of knowledge in this forum is over my head but comforting when I read \"Been there ,done that\" regarding living in fear. At Kaiser my email for past PSA test results would show only <.01. Now the latest one shows .11 and all the bad thoughts came back. Is a result, that high, a reason for SRT even if a re-test shows <.1 again? I am 53 years old. My Doctor told me the biopsy showed 1 bad sample which i was told pre-op that it was 5% cancerous. I am currently looking forward to an appointment with my Doctor who put me at ease before and was very positive in the past. Thanks Ajuar2, Never based a treatment decision on one PSA #. Get a retest. Good luck",

What is not known is if the problem will recur so, there will be a discussion among my physicians as to what are the going forward plans. This is certainly one of the risks that many surgeons down played and rightly so since the chance of an infected lymphocele is <1% overall but non zero none the less. This put into focus many of the discussions about risks of radiation, risks of surgery as neither are risks free so each of us has to assess our risk tolerance level and to decide for ourselves. The good news for me is after 3 years my PSA is undetectable, I have no incontinence and no ED so I do have a few things to celebrate in spite of the hospitalization.",

You are young and in good physical shape, so, recovery from surgery should be fast and easy and side effects could be minimum provided you choose a good surgeon, one that has, hopefully, done 1,000 prostatectomies or more. Another point, with a PSA of 19.9, your urologist needs to make sure the cancer is still contain within the prostate by running additional tests, including an MRI and a color Doppler ultrasound if possible (in addition to the bone scan and CT you are going to do). If there is any indication of cancer escaping the capsule, surgery may not be the right treatment. As Fairwind said, very few die from a G6 prostate cancer, so good luck to you.",

Can any of you regular posters point me to a previous post that might help me look ahead to where I\u0092m headed? Brenden, My heart goes out to you and sincerely hope you will be around a lot longer. Also, as the other posters said, you have not exhausted all the available treatments yet so I hope you will continue your treatment. As to your question, to me, one member that stood out was sequoiaranger who posted until the very end just before he passed away and never gave up. His courage, kindness and helpfulness were what stood out and had my utmost respect. He inspired me to want to continue and share my experiences with others. During his final days his challenge was constant pain, even with pain medication so I would say if you are suffering from pain, getting pain management right is your first priority. There is also a website www.yananow.com that published many personal stories of those suffering from prostate cancer, in their own words, with some writing until the very end. You can gain some insights there. Often time, the reason many seek additional treatment is not to prolong life but to reduce pain. For example, the new radiation drug Xofigo was found to prolong life and reduce bone pain. My Dad died from cancer (prostate? spread to other organs) and in his last few months he was given lots of pain medications to make him comfortable and pain free. He passed away peacefully. Best wishes.",

Should I be concerned with this increase? I haven't talked to the surgeon yet; don't want to bother if its no big deal. Thanks Two questions: 1. Were they done by the same lab on the same machine. If not, there could be machine differences. 2. Were there < signs before any of the numbers? If there are no < before the .03 and the machine's resolution is .01, yes you need to worry and prepare for just in case. My suggestion is to retest in a month or two and see if the PSA settles down or continue to increase. Good luck.",

I'm dry at night but wake up a dozen times feeling like I need to urinate. When I get up hardly anything comes out. Hi PDV, Looks like you are one of the success stories of no incontinence right after removal of the catheter. Your surgeon did a great job. As Pratoman said, getting up frequently at night after catheter is out is quite normal, should get less frequent as time passes and eventually will go away. As a non professional, I read that sometimes, scar tissues formed, sometimes sites of the stitches got a little inflamed and the passage is semi-blocked. Another aspect for those of us with BPH is the enlarged prostate constantly pressing on the bladder causing bladder wall thickening and needs time to get back to normal. One side benefit of surgery is once back to normal, you will urinate like when you were 18 years old. Best wishes.",

Normally with aggressive prostate cancer, its effective period is shorter. That means if he moves to the second lines of hormones like Zytiga and/or combination with chemo he can continue to control his cancer. And if that starts to lose its effectiveness, there are others that his oncologist can put him on later (Xtandi for example). Some oncologist would also ask to spot radiate the bone metastatic sites if there are only a few spots and that prolongs the effectiveness of hormone even further.

      "Content": "Mary, Welcome and good luck to you on your Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma treatments. As for your husband, like Highlander said, he had already survived 15 years so very likely his cancer is not too aggressive and he will most likely not die of prostate cancer. From your post it looked like he had surgery and salvage radiation but did not have hormone or other types of treatments. If so he could start hormone and slow down his cancer growth. We don't have any information on him so cannot give you any of our opinions. However, in general, his doctor can observe his PSA doubling time (how fast is his PSA rising, or doubling), can do some scans to see if there are bone mets or other organ involvements and decide if any treatment is warranted. For example if his current PSA is single digit and his doubling time is greater than 12 months, he could go another 4 - 5 years and be 90-91 years old before treatment becomes necessary. Give us more details and we can be more specific. Hormone will buy him time but comes with side effects and risks especially cardiovascular and stroke risks so his doctors will be careful and check him out before getting him on hormone. I am a layperson so this is just a non professional opinion. Best of luck to the two of you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by robthirty Hello all I am new to site but my uncle was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer and was under going chemo therapy but apparently it is not helping him and he is now going for radiation treatment as the cancer has spread. Any suggestions? We are not healthcare professionals so cannot offer medical advices. However, we have a lot of experiences to share. The folks on this site have a range of experiences from those with early stage to those with late stage like your uncle. Many with late stage prostate cancer are able to survive for many years with treatments that ranged from radiation to hormone to chemo. You should also know that just within the past few years, there are a number of new treatments (Zytiga, Xtandi, Provange...) approved by the FDA and a few new ones are in clinical trails and likely to be approved soon. So, your uncle should have a lot of options to keep him around for many years. Good luck to you and your uncle.",

      "Content": "Fairwind, You are quite correct. Lymphocele is not uncommon if the surgeon took out some lymph nodes since the lymphatic fluids need to go someplace and if they cannot find a path, form a pocket call lymphocele. For most patients, they go away after a while or stay harmless if not infected. For me this one stayed dormant for three years until it was infected recently by staph infection. Fortunately, I also have the \"garden variety\" staph. I had both abdominal ultrasound and ct and the radiologist said lymphocele was the most likely cause but he had never seen one came on three years after surgery. After discharge, I will have to go through the same drill you went through. I posted this to share with fellow surgery members that this could be another minor bump on the road to recovery. Best to all.",

      "Content": "Ronald007, Welcome again. There are a number of posts here discussing treatment options, surgery vs radiation. Instead of repeating, let me just say that in my opinion you should consult a radiation oncologist and consider radiation as a treatment option. You being a \"big guy\", have what is considered aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason 4+4) and your cancer is quite extensive, radiation could be a better choice. In these cases, from what I read, radiation gives you better odds. And, go find the best practitioner, whether it is surgery or radiation. You have one shot to do it right so you do not want to be someone's training patient. Prostatectomy is a very complicated surgery, do you want to add complexity by doing tummy tuck in addition? In my opinion, if he finds it difficult to perform, he should not do it and risk your life by adding tummy tuck. Good luck.",

If you are an optimist, you say wow, the incidence of cancer decreased and even though the incidence of aggressive cancer increased, there were no increases in mortality, so this is great. If you are a pessimist, you say, wow, the medication did not reduce the incidence of cancer mortality, so why are we taking it?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Brenden The reason for my post is that I\u0092m looking for an honest rundown on what I can expect my life to be like during my final few months. Can any of you regular posters point me to a previous post that might help me look ahead to where I\u0092m headed? Brenden, My heart goes out to you and sincerely hope you will be around a lot longer. Also, as the other posters said, you have not exhausted all the available treatments yet so I hope you will continue your treatment. As to your question, to me, one member that stood out was sequoiaranger who posted until the very end just before he passed away and never gave up. His courage, kindness and helpfulness were what stood out and had my utmost respect. He inspired me to want to continue and share my experiences with others. During his final days his challenge was constant pain, even with pain medication so I would say if you are suffering from pain, getting pain management right is your first priority. There is also a website www.yananow.com that published many personal stories of those suffering from prostate cancer, in their own words, with some writing until the very end. You can gain some insights there. Often time, the reason many seek additional treatment is not to prolong life but to reduce pain. For example, the new radiation drug Xofigo was found to prolong life and reduce bone pain. My Dad died from cancer (prostate? spread to other organs) and in his last few months he was given lots of pain medications to make him comfortable and pain free. He passed away peacefully.

Stains for high molecular weight cytokeratin andP63 are positive in a patchy fashion in some of the glands. I-K) HPIN Looks like hubby needs another biopsy. First path report had G at a Gleason 6 and H atypia The majority cases of atypia lead to a cancer diagnosis in subsequent biopsy. Often HGPIN also leads to a cancer diagnosis in subsequent biopsy (I know because those were the results of my third biopsy). So the two pathologists are not contradicting each other, just a slight different interpretations of the same thing. At this stage he is a good candidate for AS and careful monitoring. Good luck.",

Brenden, My heart goes out to you and sincerely hope you will be around a lot longer.

As to your question, to me, one member that stood out was sequoiaranger who posted until the very end just before he passed away and never gave up. His courage, kindness and helpfulness were what stood out and had my utmost respect. He inspired me to want to continue and share my experiences with others. During his final days his challenge was constant pain, even with pain medication so I would say if you are suffering from pain, getting pain management right is your first priority. There is also a website www.yananow.com that published many personal stories of those suffering from prostate cancer, in their own words, with some writing until the very end. You can gain some insights there. Often time, the reason many seek additional treatment is not to prolong life but to reduce pain. For example, the new radiation drug Xofigo was found to prolong life and reduce bone pain. My Dad died from cancer (prostate? spread to other organs) and in his last few months he was given lots of pain medications to make him comfortable and pain free. He passed away peacefully.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by worriedabouthubby Congratulations on your good news. I hope you get a great post-surgery blood work report. My husband is scheduled for a DaVinci procedure in 2 weeks. though his initial numbers are much worse than yours were, I hope he has as smooth an experience as you. He is really dreading the catheter (he almost chose NOT to have surgery just because of it). Additionally, he is deathly afraid of needles (nurse broke one off in his arm as a child- and he has VERY small veins and they roll and colapse easily...). He is starting to get really nervous- but won't talk about it- just acts grouchy and tells me not to mind him! I hope things continue to go well for you. Dear worriedabouthubby, Good luck to you and your husband. It is quite normal to be nervous. We all were, especially just before our date with the robot. For me, the day before was the worst. I almost cancelled my surgery if not for my wife's encouragement.",

      "Content": "I hope you do not get offended. I used your psa history from 2009 to today and calculated your doubling time to be 10 months. It is fast enough that in my opinion needs to be treated asap. I am surprised your urologist did not recommend any treatment especially after Oct 09. After all, you did have positive surgical margins indicating some cancer cells could be left behind and indeed with BCR after Oct 09, some cancer cells were left behind. For someone with positive surgical margins, salvage radiation actually has a high success rate of curing BCR (Dr. Walsh's book). Perhaps salvage radiation is still an option if you do not like ADT and I would ask for a second opinion from a radiation oncologist. I am just a layperson and it is just my opinion. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV I'm wearing a pad during the day and have tiny squirts when I stand up suddenly or cough.(I'm not sure anything even comes out but it feels like it does.) I'm dry at night but wake up a dozen times feeling like I need to urinate. When I get up hardly anything comes out. Hi PDV, Looks like you are one of the success stories of no incontinence right after removal of the catheter. Your surgeon did a great job. As Pratoman said, getting up frequently at night after catheter is out is quite normal, should get less frequent as time passes and eventually will go away. As a non professional, I read that sometimes, scar tissues formed, sometimes sites of the stitches got a little inflamed and the passage is semi-blocked. Another aspect for those of us with BPH is the enlarged prostate constantly pressing on the bladder causing bladder wall thickening and needs time to get back to normal. One side benefit of surgery is once back to normal, you will urinate like when you were 18 years old. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Ronald007, Welcome again. There are a number of posts here discussing treatment options, surgery vs radiation. Instead of repeating, let me just say that in my opinion you should consult a radiation oncologist and consider radiation as a treatment option. You being a \"big guy\", have what is considered aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason 4+4) and your cancer is quite extensive, radiation could be a better choice. In these cases, from what I read, radiation gives you better odds. And, go find the best practitioner, whether it is surgery or radiation. You have one shot to do it right so you do not want to be someone's training patient. Prostatectomy is a very complicated surgery, do you want to add complexity by doing tummy tuck in addition? In my opinion, if he finds it difficult to perform, he should not do it and risk your life by adding tummy tuck. Good luck.",

You are young and in good physical shape, so, recovery from surgery should be fast and easy and side effects could be minimum provided you choose a good surgeon, one that has, hopefully, done 1,000 prostatectomies or more. Another point, with a PSA of 19.9, your urologist needs to make sure the cancer is still contain within the prostate by running additional tests, including an MRI and a color Doppler ultrasound if possible (in addition to the bone scan and CT you are going to do). If there is any indication of cancer escaping the capsule, surgery may not be the right treatment. As Fairwind said, very few die from a G6 prostate cancer, so good luck to you.",

      "Content": "langcole, Welcome. I am not an expert on MRI, so my interpretation could be wrong: 1. First the good news: The MRI indicated the cancer is organ confined, no seminal vesicle and lymph nodes involvements and no EPE. 2. Looks like you had a torso coil 3.0 T MRI and not a transrectal MRI (endorectal coil), so the resolution of the images are around 5mm. Transrectal MRI can provide somewhat higher resolution. 3. The lesions 1 & 3 could be from the same tumor since they were from adjacent images: image 14 and 15 of series 7. My understanding is MRI takes images in slices, so I assumed image 14 and image 15 of series 7 are from adjacent locations. If so, they were from the same tumor. I would like to link this to the second positive core of your biopsy (20% positive as each biopsy sample is about 10 to 15 mm in length so a 20% could be 2 to 4 mm). It would be interesting to compare locations of the positive core of the biopsy with the location of lesion 1 & 3 location - peripheral midgland. So, you might ask your urologist about the location of the two positive cores to see if they confirmed the MRI. I would not be too concern at this time unless another biopsy indicates a Gleason upgrade (from 6 to 7 for example). Good luck.",

      "Content": "This was how the doctor explained Perineural Invasion to me: There are nerves running within the prostate, they tend to have empty spaces that cancer cells sometimes like to move into and in that case the pathologist would call out Perineural Invasion. Most likely it has no significance. However, there are cases that the cancer cells follow the nerves and move outside the prostate. During surgery, we will be careful to see if the cancer affects the nerve bundles and if so, we may not be able to save the bundles. Your Second Opinion Summary: 6 of the positive biopsy are G(3+3), 2 are G(3+4) and they are not that extensive, ranging from 5 to 40% of the tissues. I would say intermediate risk (due to the 2 G7) and moderately extensive cancer (8 of 12 cores ranged from 5% to 40%), so, there is a good chance your cancer is still organ confined. I use the Memorial Sloan-Kettering nomogram to calculate your odds using PSA of 5.6 from your first post on this thread: Extent of Disease Probability Indolent Cancer N/A Organ Confined Disease 69% Extracapsular Extension 33% Seminal Vesicle Invasion 3% Lymph Node Involvement 2.4% Primary Treatment Outcome Progression Free Probability after Radical Prostatectomy 5 Year 90% 10 Year 86% Probability of Cancer-Specific Survival 10 Year 99% 15 Year 99% Your odds of organ confined are actually better than mine. Your survival odds are also excellent. Of course this is just a fellow sufferer's non professional opinion. Best of luck to you.",

And you are correct, once metastasized, cancer can only be controlled and not cured. However, often it can be controlled for a very long time, sometimes for over a decade. At this stage, the cancer is castrate resistant with PSA doubling time of about 4 months, so unless some other medications can slow it down, it will progress rapidly. Regards,",

When my PSA reached 8.4 within a couple of years from 5+, I had a negative biopsy but showed some atypical cells. The urologist wanted to do an immediate repeat biopsy but I opted to wait a year. My rationale was that an immediate biopsy most likely would show the same outcome whereas if I truly had cancer, waited a year would allow the cancer to grow a little and became easier to detect. Cancers were detected in the biopsy a year later @ 1 core 5%.",

To this end can anyone share with me what I should expect as the cancer progresses, what things I can do to remain \"operational\", at what point I'll no longer be \"operational\", and how long between that occurs and when death occurs? DNR, I am very sorry to hear about your situation and wish you the best in your journey. There is a website call You Are Not Alone Now: www.yananow.net where patients shared their experiences. Some of them endured end stage prostate cancer and passed away but described their experiences during the end stage processes. You can get a sense of what to expect after you read their account. I also know folks who died from end stage prostate cancer. Let me just say that if I have a choice, I would choose the side effects of treatment and prefer to die of something else less painful. That said, we are all different and we make our own choices. My urologist did tell me that modern pain management can greatly reduce the pains of bone met and organ failures so it can be \"manageable\" if someone is in hospice under competent care.

      "Content": "Any time post op PSA became detectable (without the < sign before the number) is a concern, even after 6 1/2 years but the good news is yours goes up slowly. Based on two data point your PSA doubling time is 18 months. A number of studies indicated PSADT is a good predictor of cancer specific survival. Folks with PSADT > 12 months usually had a good chance of surviving prostate cancer recurrence. Here is a review paper on this subject: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624708/ Some highlights of the article: 20\u009640% of patients undergoing RP and 30\u009650% of patients undergoing RT will experience biochemical recurrence within 10 years. So, recurrence is not uncommon. One of the strongest predictors of metastasis and death is the PSA doubling time (PSADT), a mathematical determination of the length of time (in months) needed for the PSA level to double in a given patient. BCR patients with a PSADT greater than 9 months, for example, have a high probability of long-term, metastasis-free survival and overall survival. In addition, among patients with a slow PSADT, radiographic evidence of metastatic disease is likely to be discovered before patients experience clinical symptoms from their metastatic disease. Your doubling time based on two data points is 18 months, good news. But you really need at least another PSA test to confirm the PSADT number. Significant reduction in all-cause mortality was associated with salvage radiation in both patients with a PSADT less than 6 months (HR, 0.35; P=.042) and a PSADT greater than 6 months (HR, 0.60; P=.04), but the reduction in all-cause mortality was nearly 60% greater in the patients with PSADT less than 6 months Meaning for folks with PSADT >6 months, SRT improved survival by 40% (HR=0.6). You should be concern but I won't lose any sleep over it at this time. The old saying: \"preparing for the worst but hope for the best\" applies here. Good luck and best wishes.",

Radiation vs surgery vs AS. Since you already had surgery, there is no need to ask this question. 2. His view and recommendation regarding adjuvant radiation treatment vs salvage radiation treatment in your case, since you have fairly aggressive cancer: Clinical G7 and G9 post Op. 3. Should you do combination hormone + radiation in case you need to do radiation. 4. Radiation to prostate bed vs pelvic area + Lymph nodes.... 5. What about combining radiation vs hormone vs chemo.... 6. What type of machine is he using? Fairwind had a good recommendation of what type of machine is state of the art (Varian RapidArc?) and perhaps best. Good luck",

The radiologist who read the scan looked for all abnormalities and not just the area that the physician wanted to look. It is a very good practice as the radiologist will let you know if everything is OK or may find something else allowing in many cases early detection of other problems. Cysts in liver, kidney and pancreas are quite normal so there may no be any issues but checking them out for peace of mind is good. Good luck.",

When my PSA reached 8.4 within a couple of years from 5+, I had a negative biopsy but showed some atypical cells. The urologist wanted to do an immediate repeat biopsy but I opted to wait a year. My rationale was that an immediate biopsy most likely would show the same outcome whereas if I truly had cancer, waited a year would allow the cancer to grow a little and became easier to detect. Cancers were detected in the biopsy a year later @ 1 core 5%.",

      "Content": "This was how the doctor explained Perineural Invasion to me: There are nerves running within the prostate, they tend to have empty spaces that cancer cells sometimes like to move into and in that case the pathologist would call out Perineural Invasion. Most likely it has no significance. However, there are cases that the cancer cells follow the nerves and move outside the prostate. During surgery, we will be careful to see if the cancer affects the nerve bundles and if so, we may not be able to save the bundles. Your Second Opinion Summary: 6 of the positive biopsy are G(3+3), 2 are G(3+4) and they are not that extensive, ranging from 5 to 40% of the tissues. I would say intermediate risk (due to the 2 G7) and moderately extensive cancer (8 of 12 cores ranged from 5% to 40%), so, there is a good chance your cancer is still organ confined. I use the Memorial Sloan-Kettering nomogram to calculate your odds using PSA of 5.6 from your first post on this thread: Extent of Disease Probability Indolent Cancer N/A Organ Confined Disease 69% Extracapsular Extension 33% Seminal Vesicle Invasion 3% Lymph Node Involvement 2.4% Primary Treatment Outcome Progression Free Probability after Radical Prostatectomy 5 Year 90% 10 Year 86% Probability of Cancer-Specific Survival 10 Year 99% 15 Year 99% Your odds of organ confined are actually better than mine. Your survival odds are also excellent. Of course this is just a fellow sufferer's non professional opinion. Best of luck to you.",

DNR, I am very sorry to hear about your situation and wish you the best in your journey. There is a website call You Are Not Alone Now: www.yananow.net where patients shared their experiences. Some of them endured end stage prostate cancer and passed away but described their experiences during the end stage processes. You can get a sense of what to expect after you read their account. I also know folks who died from end stage prostate cancer. Let me just say that if I have a choice, I would choose the side effects of treatment and prefer to die of something else less painful. That said, we are all different and we make our own choices. My urologist did tell me that modern pain management can greatly reduce the pains of bone met and organ failures so it can be \"manageable\" if someone is in hospice under competent care.

With my biopsy history, I was mentally preparing for the worst and was preparing to go aggressive as I wanted to gain the advantage of time against cancer spreading. I had surgery less than two months after the positive biopsy. If my PSA turned out to be detectable six weeks after surgery, or my pathology report was really bad, I probably would go ART/SRT a lot sooner than most. Good luck to you and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Any time post op PSA became detectable (without the < sign before the number) is a concern, even after 6 1/2 years but the good news is yours goes up slowly. Based on two data point your PSA doubling time is 18 months. A number of studies indicated PSADT is a good predictor of cancer specific survival. Folks with PSADT > 12 months usually had a good chance of surviving prostate cancer recurrence. Here is a review paper on this subject: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3624708/ Some highlights of the article: 20\u009640% of patients undergoing RP and 30\u009650% of patients undergoing RT will experience biochemical recurrence within 10 years. So, recurrence is not uncommon. One of the strongest predictors of metastasis and death is the PSA doubling time (PSADT), a mathematical determination of the length of time (in months) needed for the PSA level to double in a given patient. BCR patients with a PSADT greater than 9 months, for example, have a high probability of long-term, metastasis-free survival and overall survival. In addition, among patients with a slow PSADT, radiographic evidence of metastatic disease is likely to be discovered before patients experience clinical symptoms from their metastatic disease. Your doubling time based on two data points is 18 months, good news. But you really need at least another PSA test to confirm the PSADT number. Significant reduction in all-cause mortality was associated with salvage radiation in both patients with a PSADT less than 6 months (HR, 0.35; P=.042) and a PSADT greater than 6 months (HR, 0.60; P=.04), but the reduction in all-cause mortality was nearly 60% greater in the patients with PSADT less than 6 months Meaning for folks with PSADT >6 months, SRT improved survival by 40% (HR=0.6). You should be concern but I won't lose any sleep over it at this time. The old saying: \"preparing for the worst but hope for the best\" applies here. Good luck and best wishes.",

And you are correct, once metastasized, cancer can only be controlled and not cured. However, often it can be controlled for a very long time, sometimes for over a decade. At this stage, the cancer is castrate resistant with PSA doubling time of about 4 months, so unless some other medications can slow it down, it will progress rapidly. Regards,",

The most recent clinical trial in the US indicated doing combined chemo and hormone early extended survival by about 40%. Also, with bone metastasis and lymph nodes positive, why radiation? With cancer already spread outside the prostate, radiation to kill the cancer within the prostate is kind of futile? 2. Going forward, find out how many bone met spots he has, if < 5, maybe they can spot radiate to kill off the cancer. Some oncologists here (Dr. Myers, e.g.) believe one can sometimes get durable remissions from spot rad if <5 spots (the term is oligometastasis). Same with lymph nodes, if only one or two and if they are outside the prior radiation field. 3. He has what is called castrate resistant prostate cancer, meaning his cancer is now immuned to testosterone and bicalutamide. If he does not do chemo, he can try Lupton with bicalutamide or move to second line hormones like Zytiga and/or Xtandi, or try immunotherapy like Provenge. However these are expensive treatments (here in the U.S. anyway). 4. He needs to do something or things can turn bad fast. With appropriate treatment hopefully cancer can be controlled and he can lead a normal life a long time. If it were me I would do chemotherapy but that is an opinion from a layperson. So please consult his oncologist. Good luck and best wishes.",

Here, I would like to ask one more question that, Is PSA below 4.0 ng/ml to be considered as normal?? Also whether this increases in multiplication (e.g. 2 to 4, then 8,16,32,64,128 etc.) or any other base & with what kind of time gap? Thanks alot dear friends. Ganesh, Thank you for answering my question regarding chemo. PSA below 4 is consider normal for folks without treatment. In your Dad's case, based on the PSA you provided, I calculated his PSA doubling time to be about 4 months (latest reading was .99 and in 4 months will be about 2). Please consult his physician to see what else can be done. Regards,",

No extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicles free of tumor, 11/11 lymph nodes negative. No lymph or vascular invasion. Perineural invasion present. Margin involved by invasive carcinoma, focal right apex (Gleason 4), without extraprostatic extension (inked margin within prostate tissue) There is no EPE meaning the cancer was all contained within the prostate but the pathologist found a positive margin at the apex. My layperson's interpretation is your surgeon cut too close at the apex and missed cutting everything out. However, I would not worry too much and all is not lost: The positive margin is indeed very tiny, only <200 nm (<.2mm) and you need a microscope to see it!! Since in Da Vinci, the surgeon use a \"heat knife\" most likely the act of surgery killed the remaining cancer cells so you should have undetectable PSA going forward, and even if PSA comes back some time later, salvage radiation should take care of it since you know where the source of PSA comes from in your case. Good luck and take care.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LILDOG I have questions about the meaning of these positive margins in particular . 1. APEX: Positive , focal , right side. What does focal mean with this margin ? 2. PERIPHERAL: Positive , right lateral toward apex in area of capsular incision. What does capsular incision mean with this margin ? Could this positive margin be an artifact ? First, let's try to decipher the languages: 1. As HighlanderCFH said, focal means a single spot and according to a number of posters here, PM at the apex is more common. I don't know why. 2. PM on the right side, again near the apex. So, could be from the same general prostate cancers in or around the apex location. What were missing were descriptions of the sizes of the positive margins (pathologist uses mm to describe PM) and what Gleason grades and were there benign prostate tissues left behind. It is important because if there were benign tissues left behind no harm no foul. Also, if the PM is minor/small, the act of cutting could kill off the cancer cells (Read Dr. Walsh's book) and you can still be cancer free. So, ask your doctors to give you more details and ask for the full pathology report. It is yours and you have the rights to it. Your first PSA test will give an indication of the above. If the PMs are minor, PSA should be undetectable and perhaps will stay undetectable for a long time like some of us. If the post Op PSA is not undetectable, then you need to prepare for plan B unless they were caused by benign tissues. I won't worry about it for the time being, you should enjoy and focus on your recovery. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by traveler Thank you all for your feedback. I didn't get Medicare part B cause I've been living in Hong Kong the last 30 years. Hong Kong does have relatively free medical but long waiting lists and I'm not sure of their proficiency. I've heard mixed info - some good some bad. I've just spent the last year and a half in the States mostly visiting my two daughters - one in New York one in Missouri. Our funds are low but my PT daughter in NY helps out occasionally. So I've got options as to how to proceed. I'll keep you all posted and thanks again for all your great comments. I'm back in Hong Kong right now. If you qualify for Medicare part A and if you have low income, part B could be free or you could qualify for Medicaid which should be free to you. However, Medicare and Medicaid would not pay for your bill if you seek treatment outside of the US. My suggestion is to come back to Missouri or New York, apply for part B or Medicaid. The costs with US Government subsidy should be lower than out of pocket payment in HK. And you will get better quality care here in the US. With a PSA of 65, and symptoms of cancer (ED, frequent urination, etc.) if I were you, I would not ignore it. If you come back now, the enrollment time is before year end and you have time to seek treatment starting 1-1-2015. For prostate cancer that time frame is not unreasonable. Good luck.",

I've told him that I think two weeks might be a little optimistic. If his job does not require physical exertion, two weeks might be fine if there are no complications. However, if the surgical sites or other problems show up, or if he needs to take pain or other medications, it might be a no no for a pilot. Even with a catheter I was able to do desk work and trade stocks online and I drove home after they removed the catheter. There might be FAA rules regarding the physical conditions of a flight pilot, e.g., in case of emergency as he is responsible for the lives of many in flight. He should really take a more cautious approach and check with his employer and with authority. Best wishes.",

Here, I would like to ask one more question that, Is PSA below 4.0 ng/ml to be considered as normal?? Also whether this increases in multiplication (e.g. 2 to 4, then 8,16,32,64,128 etc.) or any other base & with what kind of time gap? Thanks alot dear friends. Ganesh, Thank you for answering my question regarding chemo. PSA below 4 is consider normal for folks without treatment. In your Dad's case, based on the PSA you provided, I calculated his PSA doubling time to be about 4 months (latest reading was .99 and in 4 months will be about 2). Please consult his physician to see what else can be done. Regards,",

Non of the images showed evidence of spread and up till now I have only had IMRT. When I was first diagnosed, I researched both options and even at that time all indications were the cure rates were about the same for localized cancer. For cancers that were more advanced (high risks - high Gleason, high psa...) radiation was actually better. It came down to personal choice and biases. More recently, I came across a number of studies that indicated hormone + radiation produced fewer BCR and longer survival. Another study, indicated for radiation, low psa nadir predicted much better outcome in terms of BCR and survival. So, your particular stats are actually very encouraging, G7, low nadir, etc. If I were you, I would discuss with my oncologist about combination therapy to see if that is an option for me or should I just wait it out.

For high risk cases with high PSA and a potential of extraprostatic extension, radiation + hormone is the new gold standard. I had found studies that said for initiating treatment, neoadjuvant hormone + radiation gave significant survival advantage vs radiation alone. However, neoadjuvant hormone + surgery conferred no advantage vs surgery alone. Good luck.",

I've told him that I think two weeks might be a little optimistic. If his job does not require physical exertion, two weeks might be fine if there are no complications. However, if the surgical sites or other problems show up, or if he needs to take pain or other medications, it might be a no no for a pilot. Even with a catheter I was able to do desk work and trade stocks online and I drove home after they removed the catheter. There might be FAA rules regarding the physical conditions of a flight pilot, e.g., in case of emergency as he is responsible for the lives of many in flight. He should really take a more cautious approach and check with his employer and with authority. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "rooster, Welcome back. Looks like he has excellent outcome even with the positive margins (two undetectable PSA post-op). Quite often, positive margins do not mean some cancer cells are left behind. Quite a few people had positive margins but were cancer free for years. In Dr. Walsh's book, he explained the reasons for that in some details. First a couple of questions: 1. Did his surgeon put him on hormone therapy right after surgery? If not, the two undetectable PSA's after surgery were very good news as they indicated good surgical outcome and that the fear of metastasized cancer in your prior posts was unfounded. 2. Even with positive margins, for his age and stats, often time if post-op PSA's are undetectable, physicians tend to wait before taking adjuvant treatments. Why did his physician put him on hormone and wanted to start radiation? There must be a reason and you need to ask the doctor, or better seek a second opinion from an oncologist. So, something does not add up here. In any case, from your post, his surgery appeared to be successful, scans were clear and there was no upgrade of aggressiveness from the post op pathology report, so, he and you should not worry too much.

      "Content": "Since no one responded so let me give it a try. However, I am a lay person and not a radiologist so my interpretation may be all wrong. First of all, MRI is like X-ray, you get images of your organs and only an experience radiologist can interpret the results based on looking at many many images of cancer and normal tissues. And in MRI, there are several types of images for the radiologist to look at. You mentioned \"with and without contrast agent\", so one discriminant is to look at the differences between an area with and without contrasting agent. This is call DCEI. Another is to look at the shades and is call DWI. A third is call T2WI which uses a different signal. Even then, the outcome is not certainty but probability. So, in all cases, imaging is for a preliminary diagnosis and biopsy is for a definitive diagnosis. The diagnosis is actually very encouraging: The bad - You do have one spot that looked suspicious. The radiologist believed there was a 50% probability of cancer based on the image characteristics (one out of three parametric criteria, probably DWI or diffusion weighted imaging, was positive). The good - There is no evidence of tumor getting out of the prostate, the seminal vesicles are clear, the lymph nodes look fine, there are no bone met and bladder invasion. Overall, even if it were positive for cancer, it looked very localized and early stage. Please consult your doctor. Good luck.",

Side effects are so bad some days I can't hardly drag myself off the couch, it's usually after a nite of having to hit the bathroom 7-8 times besides the flushing and I swear some days I ache in every joint in my body. Add to that the feeling of being lower than whale poo. I feel for you but you may want to think twice about doing orchiectomy. From what I read, all the issues and side effects you are having with hormone shots will be there with orchiectomy. And it is not reversible so if the side effects are unbearable with hormone shot you at least have the ability to stop if you really want to but with orchiectomy you are lock-in forever. There maybe medications, activities (exercise for example) you can take to reduce the side effects. Your doctors can advise you on that. Find a different physician if yours are not responsive to your sufferings. Good luck.",

He is now trying to get off all grains, all proteins and carbs. heal1949, I wasn't going to respond to your post because I just don't see any benefits of the so call Budwig protocol. I was unable to find any clinical evidences (clinical trials, studies in medical journals...) that it has any benefits. But since you posted your father's case history, I thought it maybe helpful for me to give you my layperson's opinions. First of all I am very surprised that with a post op PSA of .46 his MD, instead of adding additional medications wanted him to get off hormone and do what? If the answer is Budwig, he needs to run and find another MD to help him with his cancer recurrence. There are lot's of options including salvage radiation, combining hormone with chemo, etc., if he is willing to go that route. Second, as for diet supplements, there may be others but the only supplements/diets I am aware of that had gone through clinical trials and showed some promises were pomegranate juice and a supplement combining pomegranate, broccoli, green tea and turmeric extracts. But even there, the evidences were not strong. A recent clinical trial of pomegranate extract vs placebo showed no evidence that pomegranate extract did anything different than the placebo pills. So, my advice is go get a second opinion from another oncologist who specializes in treating prostate cancer, eat a healthy diet and exercise to keep him fit so he can take on the rigor of treatment protocols. He is in a fight and needs to be healthy to keep cancer at bay. Good luck and best wishes to your dad.",

From discussions with my surgeon and reading studies, it seemed debulking the cancer did offer benefits to some patients regarding increased survival but it depends on how extensive the cancer and the health and age of the patients. Here are a couple of of the studies I read: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22313515 http://www.researchgate.net/publicat...rostate_cancer If your Dad is in his forties, healthy and fit perhaps surgery to get the prostate and all the lymph nodes out may provide benefits but at his age I suspect focusing on managing the cancer is a better way to go.

      "Content": "You asked an excellent question and there is really no good answers. From discussions with my surgeon and reading studies, it seemed debulking the cancer did offer benefits to some patients regarding increased survival but it depends on how extensive the cancer and the health and age of the patients. Here are a couple of of the studies I read: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22313515 http://www.researchgate.net/publicat...rostate_cancer If your Dad is in his forties, healthy and fit perhaps surgery to get the prostate and all the lymph nodes out may provide benefits but at his age I suspect focusing on managing the cancer is a better way to go. However, I am not in healthcare so please discuss it with his oncologist. Good luck.",

Also, the normal relation between PSA and prostate size indicated if all the PSA is due to BPH, you would have a huge prostate of over 300 cc, and certainly your doctor should be able to feel it with a DRE and told you so. Second, a year ago PSA was 2.1 and a year later 18.7. It had a doubling time of less than 4 months and the only logical explanation are either an infection or cancer. The good news is two weeks later it was 14.9, if it is cancer, it is unlikely to drop by almost 4 points. Your doctor should: 1. perform a DREto see if he/she can detect any abnormality, 2. prescribe a course of antibiotics to see if he/she can drive the PSA down, before sending you to a urologist. Anyway, good luck and let's hope it is infection and we can reject your membership application.",

BPH...I don't have trouble peeing or typical symptoms of BPH so I doubt its that, but can a person have an infection in the prostate that survives 10 days of cipro and not have a fever or other symptoms of infection? Looks like I either have an infection or a seriously fast growing cancer...if the latter, it means a PSA doubling each 4 months....so how urgent is treatment. HighlanderCFH gave you some very good answers. Here let me just add a couple of comments to his response: 1. Sometimes infections and especially chronic inflammation of the prostate are difficult to get rid of even with antibiotics. Some infections are resistant to Cipro too. So it is always possible a 10 day course of Cipro will not get rid of it. 2. The good news with prostate cancer, if there is such a thing as good news, is that even with the so call aggressive type, it is not that fast growing so you should have time to deal with it. The important thing after biopsy is, if positive, understand the extend and Gleason scores. If aggressive G7+, don't wait too long and deal with it as soon as practical. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Short answer is yes. If you are organ confined or localized, 10 year cancer specific survival today is almost 100% due to better understanding of treatment combinations, improved surgery techniques and especially great advances in radiation technology. New hormone treatments, immunotherapy and chemo all helped with survival. If you are already metastasized at detection, the outcome improvement is better but not as significant. That is why many of us advocate PSA testing to give us as much of a fighting chance as possible through early detection. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Notpretty PSA 18.7 and 14.9 over a two week period. Notpretty, First of all, PSA increases due to BPH do not go up as rapidly as yours indicated. Also, the normal relation between PSA and prostate size indicated if all the PSA is due to BPH, you would have a huge prostate of over 300 cc, and certainly your doctor should be able to feel it with a DRE and told you so. Second, a year ago PSA was 2.1 and a year later 18.7. It had a doubling time of less than 4 months and the only logical explanation are either an infection or cancer. The good news is two weeks later it was 14.9, if it is cancer, it is unlikely to drop by almost 4 points. Your doctor should: 1. perform a DREto see if he/she can detect any abnormality, 2. prescribe a course of antibiotics to see if he/she can drive the PSA down, before sending you to a urologist. Anyway, good luck and let's hope it is infection and we can reject your membership application.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman I got my PCa3 results today and it came back at a 26. The nurse told me, as a different nurse did 2 years ago, that the cutoff is 25, so i am on the cusp. Two years ago, it was 13. She also told me its not necessarily an indication of cancer, its a test that shows whether i have inherited the PC gene, much like the gene for Breast Cancer . I thought it was a test for presence of a genetic material given off by cancer cells, WHEN THEY ARE PRESENT. So i am confused. Because 1. i was pretty sure that i was right regarding what it showed, but the nurse seems pretty knowledgeable 2. from what i've read online, and what i got from a member of another forum, the normal cutoff is 35 not 25, but two nurses told me it was 25. Anybody know the right answers? If this is high, combined with a jump in my PSA from 3.1 to 4.3 over 6 months and a %fPSA of 12, i think i am screwed. Biopsy is tomorrow. I already have it in my mind to get appointments with Samadi and Tewari. UGH NYC GMAN and you are smarter than your nurse. Is this the same nurse that told you your prostate volume was 22cc? LOL. I believe the accepted cut off is 35, i.e., most doctors worry if the number is above 35. At 25 it is 50/50.",

Studies after studies indicated a good surgeon not only had better cancer outcome but could also minimize having side effects.

I have had this pain, for about a decade, but never asked anyone. - I smell ammonia/chemicals, most of the day. The smell is in my nose. Anyone heard of this, or better yet, does this tie into the prostate at all? - PSA of 10.1, at 26 years old, do I need to be mentally preparing myself for some really bad news? Thanks! Sorry you are here but I don't think you will join our rank anytime soon. Your symptoms could be another bad case of prostatitis again. Or some other problem, like bladder or kidney.... I have been reading up on prostate cancer for several years and have not come across anyone having it at the young age of 26. There are three things that can cause a high PSA: enlarged prostate (due to old age), infection and cancer. Oh, also, if you had sex, a DRE, irritated the prostate in any way like riding a bike for a long time prior to PSA test, your PSA would go up. Anyway, your urologist should be able to sort it out for you. Good luck and do not worry too much.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster0330 Does this mean it metastasized? His first post op PSA came back less than 0.01. His doctor is not all the concerned , he will start radiation as soon as he gains control of his bladder, he has started hormone therapy though. My question is about whether it has metastasized or not and if that PSA post op means anything Rooster0330, Welcome. The good news is based on his post op pathology (though a little skimpy from your post) and PSA, most likely he has localized, organ confined prostate cancer. The only negative is his surgeon left a little behind hence the \"positive margins\". Quite often, the act of surgery will kill those cancer cells that were left behind (according to Dr. Walsh's book). As lancepeace said, his doctor wanted to start adjuvant radiation and hormone to ensure that nothing is left to chances. However, not all oncologists agree that adjuvant radiation/hormone is the way to go in this case when the post op PSA is undetectable. It is worthwhile for your dad to seek a second opinion. If you like, you can post a more detail write up of his pathology report as there maybe some other factors that caused his doctor to want to start adjuvant treatments, also so that some others can make additional comments and share their experiences. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I do have a couple of comments: 1. Come to think of it, after surgery I had no incontinence but my urinary frequency was quite high, about once every 1 to 2 hours but the stream was very strong. That gradually lengthened to where it is now easily 5 to 6 hrs and I can sleep through the night without getting up. This compared with prior to surgery where I had to get up several times at night and urinate every hrs during the day and each time took several minutes with very weak stream. So, your physician is correct, your bladder will get more \"elastic\" after removing years of constraints from the prostate, and things will improve. 2. Don't know if bowel habits would change due to surgery but it can certainly change due to antibiotics killing off your gut bacterias and new types taking root inside. If I were you, I would buy some probiotics to repopulate your gut with \"good' bacterias. I did after surgery and noticed better bowel habits since. Good luck.",

That said, I agree with Highlander that you might as well complete your appointment with the robotic surgeon before you finally decide. By the way, Dr. Grimm, D.O., has published many articles on brachy therapy and is a well respected radiation oncologist. His results were peer reviewed and are credible. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Julie, Welcome. You asked some very excellent questions. Let me give you my thoughts. First of all, for advanced aggressive cancer, hormone is an accepted treatment option and often in the hands of an experienced oncologist, can keep the cancer under control for a long time. Second, as you may have already realized, it is not curative but palliative. Finally, I think radiotherapy (and/or surgery) on the other hand can be curative for local, locally advanced or even some that spread to local adjacent organs. It is unusual for physicians not to prescribe radiation therapy if the patient requests it. Usually it is because of age, physical limitations, health issues or they think radiotherapy would not help. And, normally for G8 and PSA of 9, radiation + hormone should be a very viable option and studies showed to be superior compared to just radiotherapy alone. I am sure that is why you are asking all these questions. Your father needs to raise the issue with his physician and also seeks a second opinion from an experienced radiation oncologist. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Tazz, Welcome. Sorry you are here but we are fellow sufferers and can share our experiences with you to make your journey easier. Here are three main points: 1. First of all, you need to get an accurate clinical staging of your cancer. The two clinical reports of your biopsy samples are too different. The reading and staging (Gleason scores) are very subjective and if a pathologist had not seen too many prostate cancer slides, he might not be calling them correctly. Usually pathologists at academic institutions are better so you may want to send the samples/slides to U Penn, U Pittsburg or Johns Hopkins for a third read. 2. Once you know if you are a G6 or a G7, you can then start to look at treatment options. If G6, you might wait and do AS otherwise, radiation or surgery. If you are technically inclined, you can start drawing up a decision tree and eventually arrive at the path you are most comfortable with. In the US, you are the decision maker, not your urologist. 3. As for good surgeons or good radiation oncologists, you won't find any published rating system so mostly it is through word of mouth, look at how many surgeries the surgeon or the rad onco had done (should be >300-500 in both cases), talk to their patients.... I attended a few sessions of my local cancer support groups to listen in on their issues and find out who their doctors were. Some seeked out surgeons that published their results in academic journals as many of them reported outstanding results. Good luck.",

Your PSA history is actually very similar to mine. Your family history of prostate cancer is also very similar to mine. So, your chance of getting prostate cancer could be similar. However, no two cases are alike, so, I may be all wrong. 2. But, like Mikla, I calculated your PSA doubling time to be ~3 years, meaning if the trend continues, your PSA will be ~20 in another three years, so even if you have cancer you have time to catch it and treat it. 3. Even with a large prostate, ~95cc, your PSA attributable to normal prostate cells is ~ 6, so there are ~ 4 units due to something else. That could be infection/inflammation, or cancer. But just like in mine case, a persistent increase could be cancer whereas infection/inflammation sometimes showed erratic behaviors tends to go up and down. Mind you, these are just my lay person's view. 4. As another poster stated, with such a large prostate, a 12 core could miss a lot of real estates so perhaps if your biopsy comes back negative again, next year you should go for a saturation biopsy to get a better picture of what your situation is. 5. And, perhaps take a course of antibiotics to see if your PSA would go down and attribute your excess PSA to infection/inflammation. Good luck and best wishes.",

I can Quote Dr. Grimm's excellent results and I can also quote Dr. Walsh's excellent results in the same sentence because both are top physicians in their own field and both get you the best possible outcome with their treatment methodology.

I collected and studied numerous medical publications on prostate cancer treatments and can cite publications after publications to support both positions.

In terms of side effects, Dr. Walsh was able to achieve ~85% potency (for men that were potent prior to surgery) and 98% continence.

MSK gave about the same odds. John, these are the ~90% cure rate that you are looking for. Prostate cancer is a complicated disease and until definitive tests can be done to precisely determine what we have cancer wise, choosing treatment is still a gamble. The good news for Fauntleroy is that his cancer is most likely still localized and that both options presented him with good odds of coming out OK, provided he pick a good practitioner!

So, my opinion is that your radiation oncologist's plan is a good one for your case, but I would add hormone to the mix as studies indicated that if you want to take the route of radiation, adding hormone to the mix improves survival and reduces BCR (biochemical recurrence). That said, I agree with Highlander that you might as well complete your appointment with the robotic surgeon before you finally decide. By the way, Dr. Grimm, D.O., has published many articles on brachy therapy and is a well respected radiation oncologist. His results were peer reviewed and are credible. Good luck.",

At this stage it is a waste of money, rather I would listen to my oncologist who should know how to keep the cancer at bay for as long as possible. I would encourage him to go ahead and do chemo especially since he is very healthy and can withstand the rigor of chemo. Numerous recent studies found the combination of early chemo and hormone prolonged survivals by over 40%, so it will significantly increase the control of his cancer. At this stage his cancer cannot be eradicated but can still be managed for a long time with the right sequencing and combination of drugs. Good luck and best wishes.",

Same thing with prostate cancer, if caught early, it is also highly curable. Gleason 4+4 is fairly agressive and should be treated as soon as possible. Only 2 cores positive, so hopefully it is organ confined and he caught it early. Both surgery and radiation are equal in treatment outcome. However, since he just had a nephrectomy, perhaps radiation (brachy + IMRT) is a better choice? Please consult a radiation oncologist and a surgeon for their recommendation. Good luck to you and your husband.",

A PSA of .005 after triple blockade is very good news. It indicates your PSA nadir is extremely low and most if not all of your cancer cells are sensitive to hormone. Someone with your case should enjoy many years of good results. Furthermore, if your PSA was .005 in May of this year, not likely that a bone scan will detect bone mets. Usually unless PSA is over 5-10 bone scan should be clear, even if mets does exist, they will be too small to show up. Good luck, be happy and enjoy life.",

Like us most likely he tested his PSA every three months for the first year so he should have at least 4 to 5 PSA readings. Do you have his PSA history? If you do you can calculate his doubling time using EXCEL curve fit software. The MSK nomogram would not estimate doubling time for any number less than .1 since it is known that small PSA numbers (<.1) tend to bounce around a lot and are not reliable predictors. However, to play devil's advocate, using just the two number you provided, and assumed a linear increase, the doubling time is >12 month which, even if the cancer is coming back, is very good news as doubling time of >12 months predicts very good outcome. Of course I am not a physician and my opinion is just a layperson's opinion. Good luck.",

      "Content": "TL, Since your husband works overseas and probably cannot afford a long absence, you may want to consult with a radiation oncologist who practices SBRT (a relatively new radiation approach). The advantage of SBRT is the number of treatments are down to 4 or 5 instead of the 40 to 50 sessions of IMRT and Proton. According to a recent study, it has finally accumulated enough data to indicate equal/better(?) outcome when used as a first line treatment. There seemed to be less side effects too. Good luck.",

It is like saying they could not find or identify any cancer in the sample. My pathologist and the report used \"not identified\" and not \"negative\" to describe the results.

Do you have that information that I could read. I have a 6 and, as you can see by my history, although a negative margin, a microscopic amt got into the periprostatic fat. The following is the pathology result: Gleason Score 6(3+3) Tumor Quantitation 5-7% Extent of Invasion pT3a Regional Lymph Nodes Cannot be assessed Distant Metastasis Cannot be assessed Periprostatic Fat Invasion: Present (a microscopic focus of adenocarcinoma is seen to extend beyond the prostate capsule into periprostatic connective tissues-Block 4 There are medical studies stated that G6 never metastasized. For example: http://www.aua2013.org/abstracts/pri...cts.cfm?id=339 Well, Never is a very strong word. If you read the article carefully, you will find the picture not as clearcut. They stated that they examined 857 G6 men underwent prostatectomy and only 23 had BCR (biochemical recurrence). They then argued that with the exception of two, all were \"cured\" by SRT. Only two failed SRT and those two they reexamined the specimen and they upgraded them to G7. Therefore, some \"G6\", a very small percentages, did escape the capsule. We will never know if they would metastasized to distant organ since they were cured by SRT. Some then said those that metastasized were not \"true G6\". If that is true, the challenge is: How do we know we are \"true G6\" vs the \"not true G6\" if even post op pathology could not differentiate them? If you are technically inclined, there are scientific articles that supported both sides of the arguments: G6 can metastasized by mutating to G7, G8, G9... And those that stated G6, G7, G8... had different genetic makeup so they evolved differently. The bottom line IMHO is the jury is still out on this subject. Your case is one that showed G6 can spread to adjacent tissues and you are been classified as a T3a even though you are a G6 from a pathological point of view. The good news for G6 is that no matter whether G6 can metastasize, the long term survival of G6 is excellent. Both sides found that 10, 15 and even 20 year cancer specific survival of G6 who underwent prostatectomy were excellent. A 30 years Johns Hopkins study found ~95% cancer specific survival for those G6 that underwent prostatectomy at Johns Hopkins. What is interesting is this 30 years study indicated some G6 in their database did metastasize but we don't know if they are \"true G6\". For you, the statistics that matter is the high 30 year survival, whether G6 can spread or not is not as important. Take care and best wishes.",

Like us most likely he tested his PSA every three months for the first year so he should have at least 4 to 5 PSA readings. Do you have his PSA history? If you do you can calculate his doubling time using EXCEL curve fit software. The MSK nomogram would not estimate doubling time for any number less than .1 since it is known that small PSA numbers (<.1) tend to bounce around a lot and are not reliable predictors. However, to play devil's advocate, using just the two number you provided, and assumed a linear increase, the doubling time is >12 month which, even if the cancer is coming back, is very good news as doubling time of >12 months predicts very good outcome. Of course I am not a physician and my opinion is just a layperson's opinion. Good luck.",

Surgeon said his experience indicated taking 5 mg Cialis helped and he prescribed 90 days supply. I actually only took them for a week. Finally, yes, luck played a role too. Some patients in my cancer support group reported it took some time but things improved over time. I also think a lot depends on individual situations, cancer stage, skill of the surgeon and luck. In my case the cancer was organ confined but was actually extensive, worst than the biopsy report. My surgery took longer than normal but both bundles were saved. Timothy, I don't think keeping sexual function after robotic surgery is that rare. Many of the patients in my support group recovered. joedublin, I do not know about cryosurgery. In fact I was always curious as how the doctor preserved the nerve bundles during cryosurgery.

Dont want to increase Flomax as Im on 2 drugs for high bp. Have not passed any seeds, but feel like Im sitting on a deflated tennis ball when I sit anywhere anyone else having these same symtoms? Maybe I should have had the darn thing removed instead. Hope this is helpful. Best of luck in the future! SkipO, Welcome. Don't second guess yourself, you are only one month from having your procedure and it is still early. I hope and believe things will get better for you too. For us surgery guys, it was not a walk in the park either. The thing to remember is that whatever we chose, it was a major procedure and would take time for the body to heal. Good luck.",

I really appreciate all the input given here. The outcome will be about equal and it depends on which treatment you feel comfortable with. What is more important is to choose the best surgeon or radiation oncologist once you decide on the treatment. For surgery, in the hand of an outstanding surgeon like Dr. Patel, the side effects can be minimized. For radiation treatment (for example brachy), in the hand of an outstanding radiation oncologist like Dr. Grimm, the side effects can also be minimized. If you looked at their published outcome on side effects, both were excellent. Of course, every case is different and your situation often dictates the outcome.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by LenM Greetings - I'm the guy who recently posted with the 2 PSA tests that were in the 570 range (five hundred seventy). Subsequent CT scans showed nothing. Bone scan showed nothing. I just got home from the biopsy where he collected samples everywhere from the prostate. Ultrasound did show a localized mass on the right side. He still cannot understand the crazy PSA number and the fact that things are not much worse. He did say I could have a raging infection, but I would have symptoms. I do not have any. He has never seen or heard of anything like my case. By the way, I'm supposed to have blood in my urine today from the biopsy. Well, I've gone twice and there's no blood. What the heck is going on with me? There are some areas of the prostate that are difficult for the biopsy needle to reach and can be missed. I remember one poster had many negative biopsies even after PSA went up to over 40. Turned out the cancer was hiding in areas difficult for the biopsy needle to reach. One person I know had all negative biopsies but cancer was found in the transition zone and was discovered when he did a TURP The other possibility is like all others said, a massive infection or chronic inflammation. But over 500 and no cancer would be the first I have read. Good luck.",

What you will find is most of us were actually in situation very similar to yours: I had never ever been in a hospital in my life until my operation. You will be antsy especially the few days before your operation and the day of your operation. Rest assure, you will go in, before you know it, you will go to sleep and wake up in the recovery room. You won't remember or feel a thing. The recovery is usually speedy, most of us were discharged after a two days stay. As for Gleason score, it usually starts at 6 and can go up to 10, 6 being the least aggressive. Your 3+4=7 means your cancer is not too aggressive and a cure is quite likely.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by NavyChief I did have a PSA in May and it was 13.05. Biopsy came back as follows I had a 12 core done. All six cores on the right side were 3+4 90% and two on the left were 3+4 at 15% I saw a Dr Kamat down there who is a Surgeon and I went and got a consult from a radiation Dr. After those coversations I more or less decided on going the RP route. His notes since I hate typing so much Genitourinary exam: Digital rectal exam, he has a 3 x 3 x 3 cm prostate gland. Both lobes are firm and consistent with a clinical T2C exam. Outside hospital PSA 10/18/12 was 14.6. Outside hospital creatinine on 09/18/12 was 0.8. Outside hospital pathology report, left lateral apex 3+ 4, 15%; left lateral mid 3+ 4, 15%; right lateral apex 3+ 4, 95%; right lateral mid 3+ 4, 75%, right lateral base 3+ 4, 95%; right medial apex 3+ 4, 80%; right medial mid 3+4, 80%; right medial base 3+4, 90%. I must say that MD Anderson is definitely quick. I had a Bone Scan the same day as my appointment and then an MRI the next day. BONE SCAN RESULTS IMPRESSION: No active osseous metastases. MRI RESULTS Comparison: Bone scintigraphy, 11/14/2012. There is suggestion of minimal extraprostatic extension bilaterally, image 21 through 23, right greater than left, including in the region of neurovascular bundle. There is no evidence of seminal vesicle involvement, however. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. There are nonspecific mildly prominent bilateral iliac lymph nodes identified, image 22 through 25. These are most likely reactive lymph nodes, considering their size and appearance. There is indeterminate T1 hypointense, slightly heterogeneous lesion identified in the right iliac bone in the region of the sacroiliac joint, image 13, series 2. This is not seen on any other sequence. This lesion is not covered within the field of view of other sequences. No other suspicious bony lesion is evident. This lesion in the right iliac bone is not showing any uptake on bone scintigraphy from 11/14/2012. IMPRESSION: 1. Multifocal prostatic disease with minimal extraprostatic extension in the region of neurovascular bundles, right greater than left. 2. No evidence of seminal vesicle involvement. 3. Indeterminate abnormality within the right iliac bone without corresponding increased uptake in the bone scintigraphy. Plain radiographs can be obtained of this region to further evaluate. Old imaging comparison if available of this region would be helpful. Rick NavyChief, Sorry you are joining our rank but welcome! I included part of your post as reference for my comments: Wow, it is unfortunate that you have prostate cancer at such a young age, but it is very fortunate that someone tested your PSA and you catch it now instead of when symptoms start to appear and the cancer spreads to other locations. As it is, your cancer seemed quite extensive within the prostate. The bone scan came out clean which is good news. The MRI showed a couple of concerns (see bold underlined) one indicating cancer just started to grow outside of the capsule but fortunately no seminal vesicle involvement. The other suspicious finding by the MRI of the right iliac bone is not supported by bone scan so may not be significant. I think you catch your prostate cancer early enough that getting rid of it is very possible. I also believe both surgery and radiation are effective treatments but with cancer very close to the apexes and probable extraprostatic extension, perhaps radiation (brachy+IMRT+hormone) is a better option. Please consult your doctor and get a second opinion from a radiation oncologist. Good luck brother.",

Yes you should be very concern about the 0.28 as it says you still have cancer in you and after two years without taking action, God knows where they are now. IMHO, don't wait, move into plan B right away to make sure cancer that is outside the prostate does not spread further. I am kind of upset with your doctor who is really not doing his job and not taking good care of you. As soon as the post op PSA is not undetectable, he should send you to an oncologist and together plan a course of attack. You should fire him and find a good oncologist to move forward. Good luck.",

      "Content": "CKrem, The best persons to answer your post are JohnT and Fairwind. I hope they can sign in and give you their perspectives. Since I chose surgery, I do not have any experience to share. However, I went back to the notes I took when I was researching options two years ago: 1. PSA bounce after radiation treatment is common, perhaps 40% experiences that. 2. PSA can take as long as two years to settle down after radiation, and often, after initial treatment, the value sometimes \"bounce\" up after going down. This usually occurs within two years. 3. Failure is defined by radiation oncologists as PSA = nadir + 2. 4. If the PSA begins to rise after treatment and never settles into a nadir and if doubling time is short, treatment probably failed. Your case seems worrisome to me. I would consult a radiation oncologist and/or an oncologist asap for peace of mind. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gyndavid Just want to thank all of you for responding. I will keep you updated, but at present I do have appts to see a radiation oncologist and Dr Patel. I really appreciate all the input given here. The outcome will be about equal and it depends on which treatment you feel comfortable with. What is more important is to choose the best surgeon or radiation oncologist once you decide on the treatment. For surgery, in the hand of an outstanding surgeon like Dr. Patel, the side effects can be minimized. For radiation treatment (for example brachy), in the hand of an outstanding radiation oncologist like Dr. Grimm, the side effects can also be minimized. If you looked at their published outcome on side effects, both were excellent. Of course, every case is different and your situation often dictates the outcome.",

Surgeon said his experience indicated taking 5 mg Cialis helped and he prescribed 90 days supply. I actually only took them for a week. Finally, yes, luck played a role too. Some patients in my cancer support group reported it took some time but things improved over time. I also think a lot depends on individual situations, cancer stage, skill of the surgeon and luck. In my case the cancer was organ confined but was actually extensive, worst than the biopsy report. My surgery took longer than normal but both bundles were saved. Timothy, I don't think keeping sexual function after robotic surgery is that rare. Many of the patients in my support group recovered. joedublin, I do not know about cryosurgery. In fact I was always curious as how the doctor preserved the nerve bundles during cryosurgery. I was able to find information on how they could saved the urethra by worming it but no one mentioned how to warm the nerves or did anything to protect them during cryosurgery.",

What you will find is most of us were actually in situation very similar to yours: I had never ever been in a hospital in my life until my operation. You will be antsy especially the few days before your operation and the day of your operation. Rest assure, you will go in, before you know it, you will go to sleep and wake up in the recovery room. You won't remember or feel a thing. The recovery is usually speedy, most of us were discharged after a two days stay. As for Gleason score, it usually starts at 6 and can go up to 10, 6 being the least aggressive. Your 3+4=7 means your cancer is not too aggressive and a cure is quite likely.

Your wife is an RN, not a doctor. You should have followed your rad onc's advice and do ADT prior to IMRT. It is the standard practice nowadays unless you have other health issues. Studies after studies indicated the outcome and survival are much better when combining IMRT with ADT. It is still not too late to start ADT. However, I am just a layperson so please discuss this with your rad onc. Peace.",

      "Content": "35coupe, A few comments: 1. If you had atypia, (asap - atypical small acinar proliferation) you have a better than even chance of having prostate cancer. I had that diagnosis on my third biopsy and according to my urologist, a 60% chance. 2. On the other hand, at 69, with a PSA of 5.9, AS could turn out to be a good option for you. 3. Even with a positive diagnosis, you will live a long time since there are so many options available to treat. 4. We can share our experiences and show you how we each arrived at our decisions but what you choose to do is a matter between you and your physician and we should not push you in any direction.

      "Content": "To add to what Fairwind said, for some people, the initial Lupron shot could cause a PSA flare-up (spike) and often oncologists add Bicalutamide (Casodex) to keep PSA down until the flare-up goes away or keeping the Casodex for the duration. It is referred to as double blockage. Some oncologists also add Avodart to enhance the effectiveness even further. It is called triple blockage. If the effectiveness wears off, there are a bunch of new medications at your disposal. For someone like you who has survived prostate cancer a long time, the new hormone treatments should be effective if the current ones lose their effectiveness. One of my former coworkers has been on hormone for 15 years and still going strong. Good luck",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 Since none of the procedures come with a penis warranty, maybe you could let me know your thoughts on what best option is for ED and incontinence issues. If you have ED now, you will have ED after surgery. If you do not have ED, the best chance to avoid it, either surgery or radiation is to find the best practitioners in the business, surgeons or radiation oncologists, which ever your choice. The ED side effect due to surgery is immediate and many improved/recovered over time. Radiation on the other hand has delayed ED effect for some, sometime in the future after the treatment. There were claims that the chances of ED was less for radiation treatment but I have not seen any side by side comparisons. As for incontinence, nowadays it is actually rare. Most (~90-95%?) will recover after a period of time. Also, I have some concern about running to some of the famous cancer centers for fear that someone other than the doctor I choose will be performing the procedure. I certainly welcome any comments!! If you ask the surgeon to not let someone other than him/her operates on you he/she will comply, if not you move to the next candidate. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Sounds like doctors can give prostrate sizes with either way. When asking my surgeon at Mayo how large the tumor was compared to the prostate. He replied by saying my prostate was about 98 grams and the tumor was about 2 grams. So, I think both ways are used, perhaps depending on the particular aspect being discussed at the time. Highlander, I think after surgery, they have the specimen so they can weigh and determine the weight. Before surgery, with ultrasound, they only have the dimensions (X cm by Y cm by Z cm) so cc is more likely. But, as I said, I don't know, they can convert cc into gm easily.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tim1029 Can anyone help me. I just was diagnosed at age 44 with very early stage 1 Gleason score 6 prostate cancer. My Doctor told me the standard for someone my age is to have a radical prostectomy to give me the best shot of a long life. My concern is how will my sex life be after the surgery. I hear many conflicting storys ranging from you will be able to have erections a couple weeks after surgery to, forget it you'll never be able to have sex again. Please is there anyone out there that could possibly give me some straight answers to what to exspect with the surgery. Also maybe a little advice on possible other options. Welcome. As mentioned in prior posts, you do have a lot of options beside surgery. However, if you decide on surgery, like some of us on this site, then I cannot emphasize enough about finding a competent surgeon to do the operation. Published results of the \"best in class\" are quite a bit better than the overall population of surgeons. You have one shot to do it right and there is no do-over. When you interview surgeons, do ask how many operations have they done, the rate of positive margins, the rate of incontinence and the rate of ED. They should be willing to answer those questions. If not, you should find someone else. If you read Dr. Walsh's book, in it he shared his statistical outcome on positive margins, incontinences and ED. The surgeon you select should have comparable results. Good luck.",

      "Content": "dk6 & Fairwind gave you the 1 min version. Let me give you the 10 min version. It has been one and a half years ago so it is from distant memory: First of all, the surgeon, his nurse and the hospital should run you through pre-op checks, by him, her and the hospital. Also, run some tests to make sure you can be operated on. One of them, usually your doctor's office should give you instructions on what to do, pre and post op, what to do in case of complications post op, etc. The instructions should include how to deal with the catheter, clean the areas, emptying the bag, disinfect the bag... The morning of the surgery, I checked into the hospital at 5am, by 6:30am they prepared me, wheeled me into the staging area, the anesthesiologist greeted me, put the IV in my arm and explained the process. My surgeon came in next all dressed and I said Hi. I did not even remember what he said, the next thing I knew, I was in my room, I saw the wall clock in the room said 1:30pm and saw my wife looking and smiling at me. I did not feel any pain but started noticing the catheter bag and the compression sleeves they put on my legs pumping (to prevent blood clogs). The nurse got me up that evening to walk around. I was supposed to be discharged the next afternoon but because I did not pass gas (indication of bowel movement, which is important after surgery to indicate everything in your system is getting back to normal), they kept me till the morning of the third day when I passed gas. During discharge, the nurse went through the catheter care and handling again. So, this is a good time for you to ask as many questions regarding the catheter as you can. Best to have someone with you and take note or you might forget. There were no pain. I did not take any pain medication except some Tylenol the first day at home to ease the sore throat that Fairwind mentioned, that was caused by the breathing tube. The catheter was not painful, just not comfortable, especially when I accidentally tugged on it. the tip where it came out got irritated after a couple of days because I walked too much. Called the doctor and he told me the best treatment was to washed the area regularly with clean warm water and applied Neosporin occasionally. Mobility was not any problem, I used the big bag for indoor and leg bag for outdoor. As for clothing, Fairwind was spot on. You won't be able to run but any walking at a normal pace should not post any problem. Sleeping was a little uncomfortable the first night because I was afraid to press on the tubing and did not \"turn\", just stayed on my back all night. Slept through the rest of the nights and did not even notice the tube. There were some blood clots and some bleeding but they told me those were normal. So, don't be too alarm if the urine collection looks pink. Do drink plenty of fluid. Best part as dk6 said, for the first time in years I did not have to get up multiple times to urinate at night. You need to watch your bowel movement and make sure to take stool softener. For the first few weeks, I took Colace and drank prune juice and had no problem with bowel. It is very bad for your incision sites if you strain too much. Straining could also cause irritation to your bladder and might cause the catheter to leak. When you laugh or cough, best thing is to press a pillow on your tummy so as not to stress the incisions. Be careful, the incisions could come apart if you stress them too hard. That is also why for a few weeks you should not lift anything heavy. I was amazed with the whole experience with regard to the lack of pain and discomfort and how quickly I recovered. My friend went through open and had to stay in the hospital for 4 days and he was in quite a bid of pain after he went home. It is not a walk in the park for sure but overall I had a good experience and was happy I selected the treatment and selected my surgeon. Best of luck to you and please share your experience after you are on the other side. Cheers.",

Leg cramps/pain is apparently one of the side effects if you have the above conditions either caused by Zytiga or pre-existing. According to their website: ZYTIGA® may cause serious side effects including: High blood pressure (hypertension), low blood potassium levels (hypokalemia), and fluid retention (edema). Tell your healthcare provider if you get any of the following symptoms: Dizziness Fast heartbeats Feel faint or lightheaded Headache Confusion Muscle weakness Pain in your legs Swelling in your legs or feet Talk to your oncologist, especially if you have hypertension, etc. Maybe by controlling your blood pressure, etc. the side effects can be minimized.

As for the statement that \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment\" it is a carefully crafted statement. Notice it did not state testing did not save life. Numerous studies, especially one from Europe indicated testing and treatment saved lives, just that over treatments often caused unwanted side effects and that all these testing and treatment were very expensive and perhaps our healthcare systems cannot afford it. I think the main issue is not testing but after tested positive, what do you do? Many cases can be treated with AS (Active Surveillance) to avoid cost and bad side effects.",

Posters like Fairwind are clearly more knowledgeable in the area of SR plus HT and I must defer to him. Others should also be chiming in shortly. Best of luck. Jim Here is one study indicating HT helped reduced recurrence for folks that had RP and RT. http://www.redjournal.org/article/S0...075-4/abstract In this study, they found that each additional month of ADT reduced the chance of recurrence. With 6 months, the chance was reduced by a factor of 1.8. With 24 months, the chance was reduced by a factor of 9.8. Seemed to indicate a HT of at least 24 months is warranted. Regards,",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rooster0330 He is 69 but in excellent health, eats right, works out every morning, he was told about a year ago that he has the body/health of a 49 year old!!! Late stage is considered what on the gleason scale or is it the PSA? I suggest he seeks a second read from another radiologist and perhaps consult an oncologist also. Hot spots sometimes can be caused by other events like arthritis and injuries and a good radiologist always wants to know about his past medical histories. PSA of 7.9 is not too high and G7 is considered intermediate risk prostate cancer, so, even if the cancer already spread, there are many treatments that can keep the cancer at bay for many many years and very likely he will not die from prostate cancer. Good luck and best wishes to your father.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman DP, i have to say i find it odd, that a physician, who has followed many Prostate Cancer patients, would come to an internet forum for advice from a group of laymen With that said, there is always possibility of a lab error, as you probably know. I had 3 consecutive undetectable PSAs after surgery with very favorable pathology and similar results on the MSKCC Nomogram as your dads. And then my fourth PSA test came back at 3.88!!!!! I had it retested at another lab, it came back undetectable, and the first lab then confirmed that after retesting the same blood they too got an undetectable. So yes, its possible that its a lab error, get a retest. Pratoman, He may be a physician but with his Dad's situation, he is just like us, seeking support and some help and we may be all laypersons but with our collective experiences perhaps we could offer some comfort to him and his family. That said, I don't think his case is lab error: His post-op PSAs were: April 2015 PSA = 0.003 August 2015 PSA = 0.005 Oct 2015 PSA = 0.007 Jan 2016 PSA = 0.16 (done in middle east at a different lab from his usual labs) The PSA was detectable from the get go and there is a monotonic increase so the only possible error is the magnitude and not the increase. Bottom line is the surgery failed. In addition since all margins, nodes are negative. I worry the cancer may have gone systemic but lets hope it is still local so SRT can kill them all. The question really is how aggressive he wants to take the next step and a consultation with an oncologist with expertise in prostate cancer is in order. To the op, you should know that it is not a death sentence for your Dad. If the Gleason score is not too aggressive, the cancer can be managed and life span of decades is very likely. Take care.",

      "Content": "dk6 & Fairwind gave you the 1 min version. Let me give you the 10 min version. It has been one and a half years ago so it is from distant memory: First of all, the surgeon, his nurse and the hospital should run you through pre-op checks, by him, her and the hospital. Also, run some tests to make sure you can be operated on. One of them, usually your doctor's office should give you instructions on what to do, pre and post op, what to do in case of complications post op, etc. The instructions should include how to deal with the catheter, clean the areas, emptying the bag, disinfect the bag... The morning of the surgery, I checked into the hospital at 5am, by 6:30am they prepared me, wheeled me into the staging area, the anesthesiologist greeted me, put the IV in my arm and explained the process. My surgeon came in next all dressed and I said Hi. I did not even remember what he said, the next thing I knew, I was in my room, I saw the wall clock in the room said 1:30pm and saw my wife looking and smiling at me. I did not feel any pain but started noticing the catheter bag and the compression sleeves they put on my legs pumping (to prevent blood clogs). The nurse got me up that evening to walk around. I was supposed to be discharged the next afternoon but because I did not pass gas (indication of bowel movement, which is important after surgery to indicate everything in your system is getting back to normal), they kept me till the morning of the third day when I passed gas. During discharge, the nurse went through the catheter care and handling again. So, this is a good time for you to ask as many questions regarding the catheter as you can. Best to have someone with you and take note or you might forget. There were no pain. I did not take any pain medication except some Tylenol the first day at home to ease the sore throat that Fairwind mentioned, that was caused by the breathing tube. The catheter was not painful, just not comfortable, especially when I accidentally tugged on it. the tip where it came out got irritated after a couple of days because I walked too much. Called the doctor and he told me the best treatment was to washed the area regularly with clean warm water and applied Neosporin occasionally. Mobility was not any problem, I used the big bag for indoor and leg bag for outdoor. As for clothing, Fairwind was spot on. You won't be able to run but any walking at a normal pace should not post any problem. Sleeping was a little uncomfortable the first night because I was afraid to press on the tubing and did not \"turn\", just stayed on my back all night. Slept through the rest of the nights and did not even notice the tube. There were some blood clots and some bleeding but they told me those were normal. So, don't be too alarm if the urine collection looks pink. Do drink plenty of fluid. Best part as dk6 said, for the first time in years I did not have to get up multiple times to urinate at night. You need to watch your bowel movement and make sure to take stool softener. For the first few weeks, I took Colace and drank prune juice and had no problem with bowel. It is very bad for your incision sites if you strain too much. Straining could also cause irritation to your bladder and might cause the catheter to leak. When you laugh or cough, best thing is to press a pillow on your tummy so as not to stress the incisions. Be careful, the incisions could come apart if you stress them too hard. That is also why for a few weeks you should not lift anything heavy. I was amazed with the whole experience with regard to the lack of pain and discomfort and how quickly I recovered. My friend went through open and had to stay in the hospital for 4 days and he was in quite a bid of pain after he went home. It is not a walk in the park for sure but overall I had a good experience and was happy I selected the treatment and selected my surgeon. Best of luck to you and please share your experience after you are on the other side. Cheers.",

So for someone with a family history, early detection is the key since early detection and treatment are in most cases curative. Early PSA testing for his sons, perhaps even as early as 35 to establish a baseline is smart. Because of family history, I started monitoring my PSA quite early. Unlike breast cancer and ovarian cancer (Angelina Jolie) there is currently no policy/recommendation for preventative prostate surgery even if genetic testing indicated they carried the BRCA mutations because prostate cancer surgery still carries a lot of risks for bad side effects.

      "Content": "Welcome. After prostatectomy if his PSA was 3, that means a), the cancer had already spread beyond the prostate before surgery or b), cancer had not spread but the surgery left some prostate tissues (benign or cancerous) behind around the prostate. If it is b), salvage radiation to the prostate bed and around the pelvic area should kill off the cancer. CAT and Bone scans are clear is good news, that means no major metastasis or spread but there still could be micro-metastasis that is not detectable. His doctor should also track his PSA velocity (how fast the PSA rises and sometimes call PSA doubling time) to get a sense of how rapidly things change. If his PSA changed from 3 six months ago to 4.7 now, the doubling time is about a year, which is moderate, but needs to be dealt with (if the doubling time is 2 to 3 years perhaps doing nothing could be a strategy). Typically, in this situation oncologists will recommend hormone therapy and salvage radiation. In many cases that should cure the cancer. In my layperson's opinion, your father is healthy, radiation to the pelvis area should not be too harmful, many here had this treatment with very little side effects and were effective in curing their remaining cancer. Hormone therapy does have side effects but not too bad for most. What else can you do? First of all, read Dr. Walsh's book on Guide to Survive Prostate Cancer to be an informed patient and patient advocate. Understand his pathology, especially his Post Op Pathology Report to get an idea if some cancer cells were left behind (positive margins, etc.) and to see the type of cancer he has (Gleason scores indicate if the cancer is aggressive or not). Second, provide him with moral and emotional support to improve his quality of life. Some of us were depressed and needed emotional support. Third, get a second opinion and Fourth, get him to improve his diet and perhaps take supplements like pomegranate extracts... Your father should enjoy many more years of living, so do not be too stressed.",

At the time of surgery they checked the surrounding area, nodes included and everything came back clear. I don't think radiation is a good idea since he's older, I think it would cause more problems than good. Are there any medications that might help? We're not necessarily looking for a cure, just more healthy years of life. Thank you Chuck! If everything was clear after surgery, his PSA of 3 after surgery indicated the cancer already spread beyond the prostate at the time of surgery. Get a second opinion regarding treatment options. In this case salvage radiation may not be effective. Just my layperson's opinion. Good luck.",

      "Content": "If you choose surgery, you may want to ask your surgeon to remove as many of the lymph nodes as possible. This has two benefits: 1. If the nodes are clean, you know you have a good chance that the cancer stays within the prostate. 2. If not, you still have a chance that the cancer may only escape to the nodes and by removing them, there is a chance you can be cancer free. But as Fairwind said, there could be complications with the lymph nodes removal. Some of us ended up with abdominal infection due to the lymphatic fluids accumulated in the abdominal cavity.",

So what if the kids have a reduced inheritance or there is lien against the house at probate. That's what money is really for right...a rainy day! Asks, Your budget is way off. Without insurance, a typical surgery costs >$75K (I was going to pay out of pocket at one time), IMRT >$100K, proton >$150K, a course of new hormone, Provenge... costs >$100K per year.... I think after you add them all up for someone going through surgery, SRT, hormone, Provenge, chemo, etc. you are off by at least a factor of 10. My back of the envelop calculation showed that if we go back to the 1975 situation, no PSA testing, wait until symptoms show up and cancer is terminal (1/3 of cases then), it is a lot cheaper to insurance and Medicare.",

      "Content": "MKEvman, Welcome. Your case demonstrates why in many cases PSA tests save lives. If your doctor follows the new guideline and forgoes PSA testing, your cancer will probably not be curable after symptoms appear. You are very fortunate your doctor tracked your PSA and both he and the urologist went for a biopsy. Another good news is no lymphatic or perineural invasion which means cancer has not found a path to escape yet. A cure/full remission for you! Take your time to research and decide on a treatment that you are comfortable with. The most important choice is to choose the right physician (surgeon if you choose surgery or radiation oncologist if you choose radiation). You have one shot to do it right and outcome is very physician dependent. - especially side effects of the treatment. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Don't know if you are still reading this thread, I am sorry your husband is joining our club but welcome. Do not panic, he will be around for a long long time since his diagnosis indicate early stage. He is lucky his is detected early. My opinion is since he is very young (40) and assuming he is physically fit and the cancer is organ confined, surgery is the best option for him. The key is to assess if the cancer is organ confined. For someone with a PSA of 4.5, 5 of 12 cores positive and G6 the chance of organ confined is very high. If I were you guys, I would go ahead and ask for the tests JohnT recommended to find out. Studies of radiation vs surgery indicated up to 20 years, radiation and surgery are equally effective. But your husband should want to be around for 30 or 40 more years and comparison is not available. In my opinion, the real unknown is the so call \"Secondary Primary Cancer\": The effect of radiation on adjacent organs 30 to 40 years later is not known. Even though modern radiation techniques are very precise, some leakage is unavoidable and no one knows for sure if they are OK after 30 to 40 years. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "A PSA increase of 50% in six months is a concern. If you look at the anatomy of where the prostate is relative to the rectum and where the needle biopsy can sample, you will see that there are places where it is difficult for the needle to access to get samples so a normal biopsy could miss the cancer. You either get a saturation biopsy or use some other method like color Doppler Ultrasound to see if you can get a more accurate picture. One poster here (JohnT) had similar problem with multiple negative biopsies until he had a CD Ultrasound. Second, if you look at Fairwind's signature, you will notice he took Proscar and his PSA was reduced by half. Later, when his PSA started to increase even though he was on Proscar, his urologist was worried. That is because if there were no cancer, Proscar should keep his PSA at about half indefinitely. When it increased, it could indicate cancer. In fact there were a number of posts on this site some time ago discussing this topic and there were a number of medical articles on this subject. I am a lay person and have no formal training in medicine so I could be all wrong and you should seek professional help.",

I have been unable to find any meaningful long term outcome studies (large population, >10 years) for proton therapy. In addition, in one population studies published in 2012 using Medicare and SEER data (out of 12,976 patients for IMRT and 1,368 patients for proton) comparing proton, IMRT and conformal radiation therapy and the outcome for side effects were interesting: proton therapy had worst gastrointestinal complication than the other two: 17.8 incidences per 1,000 vs 12.8 per 1,000 for IMRT. In another large population study also using Medicare and SEER database published in 2011 looking at long term (5 years) gastrointestinal complications also found proton had worst outcome compare to the other radiation protocol (20.1 incidences per 1,000 person year vs 5.3 incidences per 1,000 person year for brachy and 8.9 incidences per 1,000 person year for IMRT). The good news is there were no differences in other side effects. Perhaps with the high costs and without head to head comparison to show superiority insurance company are beginning to have second thoughts about covering proton therapy.",

Originally Posted by wish full What I'm really concerned about is the prostate covering the Apex and being high grade. I see this as a possible apex margin due to the amount and being high grade. Sorry we have to welcome you to our club. Mikla gave you good advice and you should take him up on his suggestions. To answer your specific questions: Yes, high Gleason scores mean higher risks. However, risks also depend on staging, i.e., how extensive the cancer is and whether it has spread to other organs. Since you have one score of 3+4, it is moderately aggressive. 3+4 means most of your cancer is grade 3, the least aggressive type, but there are some grade 4 which is more aggressive. Looking at your biopsy pathology report, your cancer is at exactly where the radiologist said it was - left mid and left base (near the bladder, not apex). So, you had a very good radiologist read your MRI. The other good news are the biopsy did not detect any spread and more important, the MRI report showed no evidence of spread. All in all, looks like an organ confined case and if you take action to seek treatment, you should be fine. Good luck.",

Looking at some of the recent clinical trials, quite a few of them are for combination therapies. This is consistent with the trends of other cancer treatments and HIV treatments. I know because my wife was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer and her surgeon/oncologist went all out with a very aggressive treatment protocol involving surgery, adjuvant radiation, two separate and different combination courses of chemo medications for over six months, and finally tamoxifen for five years. She is still in remission after 10 years. Best of luck to your husband.",

      "Content": "Since you had such good results with continence right after surgery, I suspect you did not need to do a lot of Kegel exercises to regain continence. Since you only have the external sphincter muscles to control your urethra often time they need to be trained and over time they could be weaken or relaxed. I suggest you start to do Kegel again to see if controls can be tighten up. All else fails, there are implants that can fix incontinence. As for ED, there are a lot of remedies including injection and implant if that is important to you. Life is precious and I would not trade 10 years for ED and some leakage. I am not trying to minimize your bad situations, just some suggestions in case you want to take actions and be proactive to improve your conditions. Peace and best wishes.",

This is why I am posting this thread the cocktail of influences in my life and the destruction of my intimate life because of prostate surgery diabetes high blood pressure low T and more cause a burden that is difficult to lift every day. I am 46 never married no children and now have real difficulty in justifying a close relationship with women particularly near my age. My intent is to keep pushing to this forum to hopefully one open ear so that this energy goes out to the universe and doesn't keep burying into my psyche like a screw. My current prospect is living alone with my dogs until they inherit my house. Get some psychological help and try Trimix injection. Trimix should take care of your impotence and allows normal relaationship with your partner. Good luck and cheers!",

Urologists trained 5 to 6 years on doing surgery and spend very little time on reading ultrasound yet they perform ultrasound guided prostate biopsy? I had three negative biopsies performed by urologists. Finally, the fourth biopsy was performed by a radiologist at a hospital. He read the ultrasound in real time and directed the tech to get samples from where he had concerns. He found the cancer.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ChiliDog His MRI result is that he has \"1.5 cm mass in the peripheral zone of the right mid gland and apex with likely extracapsular extension, which abuts the right neurovascular bundle.\" Next step is a biopsy done by the young guys with fancy equipment. That will happen later in December. He will then will go before a committee for treatment recommendations. The good news is there were no mentioned of other areas of involvements (e.g., lymph nodes, seminal vesicles...) so it is very likely organ confined and he has a high probability of a cure. Also, MRI cannot be a definitive diagnosis as the mass could be inflammations or other issues. The biopsy will be definitive if positive. The one area of concern is the mass is very close to the nerves on the right so very likely the surgeon, if surgery is the treatment chosen, will have to cut out that nerve bundle resulting in higher probability of ED. For major cancer centers, the current practice is to form a \"Cancer Board\" to review the diagnosis and recommend treatment. This is to reduce \"treatment bias\" of the physicians (the old saying: Surgeons like to cut). In this case if Ed is an important issue to you, perhaps radiation is a better approach. Best wishes.",

It is a well known but seldom mentioned consequence of radiation treatment: Initial side effects are minimal but for some people they show up long after treatment is over, up to five years later. This is contrary to surgery where side effects, if any, are immediate but for many people they diminish as time passes. You may have to adjust and retrain your system, just like right after surgery. Highlander gave you very good advice and perhaps you should try them. Best wishes.",

Incontinence is hard to live with but there are many ways to treat ED, first of all, he should consult an ED doctor to get all the latest on rehab and to guide him. By the way, in Dr. Walsh's book he said it might take up to two years for ED to fully recover so your guy needs more time. I am one of the fortunate ones without ED and I am not a healthcare professional so really I should not be giving advices. But, I did some research prior to surgery just in case I had to deal with it: Usually our surgeon starts us on low dose Cialis right after surgery for a few months, he/she also can prescribe full strength Viagra, etc. He/she may also tell us to try the pump and finally to try injections like Trimix. My doctor told me injection should work every time with the right dose which your guy has to experiment with (make sure he gets advices and guidance from his ED doctor) and once the correct dose is used, he should be better than his old self. Good luck to both of you.",

Perhaps the new urologist will ask for an MRI to see if indeed the cancer is extensive. 1 core out of 8 positive does not explain the 39 PSA #. Maybe his cancer is extensive and aggressive or maybe not. It is possible that his high PSA # could be due to a combination of cancer and infection. Did his urologist prescribe a course of antibiotics to see if that brings down the PSA. Since cancer is already diagnosed, it is done to see how extensive is the cancer, perhaps, just perhaps it is not as extensive as the PSA # indicated. In that case the treatment protocol may be different. In any case, if he is more comfortable with the non surgery approaches (some forms of radiations), the cure rate is about equal to surgery so he should proceed without worry.

My understanding is that for radiation treatment without hormone, PSA drop tends to be more gradual. The treatment protocol of radiation + hormone showed better outcome and is now almost a standard protocol for radiation treatment, especially for someone with your PSA and staging of T3a.

The perineural invasion (or infiltration, same meaning) is common (many of us including me had it too), it just means the they found the cancer in the nerve channels within the prostate. Good luck to his recovery and let's hope for a complete cure.",

Robert, I sent you a Private Message and hope to keep in contact with you. I asked Dr Sanda what he would do with all of his knowledge about Prostate cancer. He said if I were you and with all the information that you have given me I would go with the brachytherapy. I asked Dr. Sands if there was a problem could I go back and have the Prostate taken out and he said, no problem. He said with my MRI and a biopsy of 40 cores there should be no surprises. Anybody else out there have any advise on this? I still have not called my decision in. Here is an article on how the former Chairman of Intel, Dr. Andy Grove arrived at his decision to choose brachy: http://www.phoenix5.org/articles/Fortune96Grove.html And the techniques of performing brachy have improved a lot since he did his. But like everyone said, find the best practitioner to perform brachy and you won't go wrong. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "I am sorry no one responded to your post. Let me welcome you to our corner of the world and the club no one wants to join. First of all, buy or borrow from the library the book written by Dr. Patrick Walsh on Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer. This is a complicated disease with a lot of treatment options that are sometimes very confusing. Knowledge is power, without knowledge, it is difficult to decide what to do or discuss with doctors on treatment options. Second, I am very surprised his doctor would not order a bone scan and a CT scan. For someone going through adjuvant or salvage radiation, that is almost unheard of. Where do you folks live? Third, looks like your partner's cancer could have escaped the prostate and could be systemic and that was why radiation after surgery. He needs to consult an oncologist who specializes in treating prostate cancer for a second/third opinion and to give him an assessment of whether to start hormone at the same time. Studies indicated combining hormone and salvage/adjuvant radiation improved survival. Finally, under the care of good and competent doctors, even if the cancer has spread, he can keep the cancer at bay for a long time with medications. Good luck to you and your partner and do not give up hope.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Friendly A couple years ago I had several bad days with Vertigo. I mentioned to the doctor that the Vertigo never seemed to go away and recently he did a MRI of my inner ears and found nothing. Did or does anyone ever experience an unsteadiness with Prostate Cancer as a symptom? A month ago they found my blood count is double digits. I had a Bone Scan and Kat Scan after a needle biopsy. They found 70 percent of the needle biopsy had cancer. My unsteadiness seems to be getting worse, could the cancer be attacking something that has made me this way? THANK YOU.[/SIZE][/B][/SIZE] Friendly, Welcome to this site. You should thank your wife for insisting you take a blood PSA test and let's hope you catch yours in time for a \"cure\" or as some other posters would prefer to say \"full remission\". Let me quote from Wikipedia: Vertigo is caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including: lesions caused by infarctions or hemorrhage, tumors present in the cerebellopontine angle. So unless your prostate cancer metastasizes to your brain, your vertigo is most likely caused by something else. By the way vertigo is quite common and many of my otherwise healthy friends have this problem. You need to find out: 1. Your doctor should tell you what is your PSA number. He was irresponsible if he just told you it was double digit. 2. Your doctor needed to give you the full biopsy report and explained/summarized the results for you and your wife. If I were you, I next time you see your doctor, you should have your wife with you to take note. 3. The most important information from the biopsy report are: The type of prostate cancer, perhaps adencarcinoma or something else, # of core positive and % of positive, Gleason scores of each positive core, any other information like perineural invasions, prostate size, etc. would also be helpful. The treatment options and assessment of how serious your situation is depends on the biopsy outcome as described above. Fortunately, even with serious cases there are a lot of options and treatments to keep you around for a long long time. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BeeMan Any advice about active surveillance vs. beginning a treatment plan for VERY EARLY stage prostate cancer? Age 65 when diagnosed (now 66). Gleason 6 (3 & 3) Last PSA: 6.44 last done on 9/10/2012 (every 3 months) PCA3 Neg (14.5) Biopsy: 1 (7%) core positive out of 12 Considering IMRT if treatment needed. BeeMan I agree with lancepeace, it is a very personal decision only you can make. However, your cancer appeared to be very early stage, so AS is a good option to consider for someone who is 66 years old. One piece of information missing from your posts is your PSA doubling time. You have been monitoring your PSA for sometime, if your PSA increase is slow, AS is an excellent choice, if it is fast, treatment is probably needed soon. For example, if the doubling time is 3-4 years, in 15-20 years, your PSA will be about 170. On the other hand, if PSA doubles every year, within 5 years your PSA will reach 170 meaning sooner or later you have to treat, in that case, the earlier you treat it the better the outcome. From your prostate volume, normal PSA should be around 3, so, it is possible your cancer is more extensive than indicated (read my signature, I had G6, 1 core positive 5%, after surgery, pathology indicated extensive cancer and some Grade 4 cancer inside). Read Dr. Walsh's book on treatment options, he discussed all the pros and cons. However, be aware he is biased toward treatment. He did say for folks older than 65 and slow growing cancer, AS is a good option. Good luck and best wishes.",

Starting 9/30/2008 @ a PSA of 2.4, PSA started to creep up, so I re-do the calculation starting from that PSA #, and the answer is: PSA doubling of ~3 years.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BeeMan Any advice about active surveillance vs. beginning a treatment plan for VERY EARLY stage prostate cancer? Age 65 when diagnosed (now 66). Gleason 6 (3 & 3) Last PSA: 6.44 last done on 9/10/2012 (every 3 months) PCA3 Neg (14.5) Biopsy: 1 (7%) core positive out of 12 Considering IMRT if treatment needed. BeeMan I agree with lancepeace, it is a very personal decision only you can make. However, your cancer appeared to be very early stage, so AS is a good option to consider for someone who is 66 years old. One piece of information missing from your posts is your PSA doubling time. You have been monitoring your PSA for sometime, if your PSA increase is slow, AS is an excellent choice, if it is fast, treatment is probably needed soon. For example, if the doubling time is 3-4 years, in 15-20 years, your PSA will be about 170. On the other hand, if PSA doubles every year, within 5 years your PSA will reach 170 meaning sooner or later you have to treat, in that case, the earlier you treat it the better the outcome. From your prostate volume, normal PSA should be around 3, so, it is possible your cancer is more extensive than indicated (read my signature, I had G6, 1 core positive 5%, after surgery, pathology indicated extensive cancer and some Grade 4 cancer inside). Read Dr. Walsh's book on treatment options, he discussed all the pros and cons. However, be aware he is biased toward treatment. He did say for folks older than 65 and slow growing cancer, AS is a good option. Good luck and best wishes.",

At the appointment before the surgery, Dr Samadi told me he will perform a surgery himself. I have very strong belief that one of Dr.Samadi's residents practiced on me. You cannot know certainly when you are unconscious under anesthesia. Boris, It is unethical for a surgeon who said he would perform the surgery and had a resident done it. Are you sure that is the case? I am truly sorry to hear of your incontinence and it is a bad case of incontinence. I have never encountered anyone after robotic surgery having as bad a situation as yours and I have attended support groups, have many friends and relatives who had robotic surgeries. Most recovered nicely. You had your surgery in 2011 and after almost 4 years with no improvement it probably won't go away. My suggestion is to look into installing an artificial sphincter and to stop the incontinence so you can lead a normal life. This forum also have a few posts discussing that and/or installing a sling. You can also visit other forums to seek advices on the same subject. Life is miserable if this is not fixed. If I were you, I would focus on moving forward and seek a better solution for a better future. Good luck and best to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bobkeenan 1. Does this sound like early stage? 2. Will the Doc likely want to run more tests? which ones? 3. what would be good questions for the first visit? 4. Any good books or other reading material that I should be reading? Fairwind and ddayglo gave you most of the answers to your questions. Let me just add my 2 cents: 1. Yes, most likely early stage. However, since you have one core G3+4 and 60%, active surveillance is not an option and treatment is in your future. However, to be sure, send your biopsy samples out for a second read by another Lab, like Bostwick to confirm the finding. 2. As Fairwind said, most likely a bone scan and a CT scan as CYA for the doctor. 3. First order of business, ask your urologist to go through the pathology report with you and explain the finding, second, ask him to send the samples out for a second opinion, third ask him what options you have regarding treatments. He is a surgeon and most likely like to operate on you, so ask him how many operations he performed and if you can talk to his patients, finally ask for a referral to see a radiation oncologist for radiation options. 4. Order and read Dr. Walsh's book. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Friendly A couple years ago I had several bad days with Vertigo. I mentioned to the doctor that the Vertigo never seemed to go away and recently he did a MRI of my inner ears and found nothing. Did or does anyone ever experience an unsteadiness with Prostate Cancer as a symptom? A month ago they found my blood count is double digits. I had a Bone Scan and Kat Scan after a needle biopsy. They found 70 percent of the needle biopsy had cancer. My unsteadiness seems to be getting worse, could the cancer be attacking something that has made me this way? THANK YOU.[/SIZE][/B][/SIZE] Friendly, Welcome to this site. You should thank your wife for insisting you take a blood PSA test and let's hope you catch yours in time for a \"cure\" or as some other posters would prefer to say \"full remission\". Let me quote from Wikipedia: Vertigo is caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including: lesions caused by infarctions or hemorrhage, tumors present in the cerebellopontine angle. So unless your prostate cancer metastasizes to your brain, your vertigo is most likely caused by something else. By the way vertigo is quite common and many of my otherwise healthy friends have this problem. You need to find out: 1. Your doctor should tell you what is your PSA number. He was irresponsible if he just told you it was double digit. 2. Your doctor needed to give you the full biopsy report and explained/summarized the results for you and your wife. If I were you, I next time you see your doctor, you should have your wife with you to take note. 3. The most important information from the biopsy report are: The type of prostate cancer, perhaps adencarcinoma or something else, # of core positive and % of positive, Gleason scores of each positive core, any other information like perineural invasions, prostate size, etc. would also be helpful. The treatment options and assessment of how serious your situation is depends on the biopsy outcome as described above. Fortunately, even with serious cases there are a lot of options and treatments to keep you around for a long long time. Good luck.",

With a PSA of over 50, it is prudent to do a DRE and biopsy to rule out cancer, especially since you already had a course of IV antibiotics. In terms of questions to ask your urologist, you might ask him if the infection that attacked your discs could cause the high PSA, and could an enlarged prostate caused a PSA of over 50. Also, what sort of special preparations and precautions you should take prior to biopsy since you did have a blood infection. Good luck and hope we can deny your club membership application.",

My PSA's are 61, 53, 40 & 47 are we definately talking cancer here or could it just as easily be something else ? If you look at the anatomy, you can see that there are places within the prostate that is difficult for a trans-rectum needle biopsy to access. So, if your cancer is not within the \"peripheral zone\" it is easy to miss in a biopsy. Even if it is within the zone, if the cancer is small, it is still easy to miss. I had quite extensive cancer yet the biopsy indicated only 1 core 5% positive. Your PSA is very high, so even with a negative biopsy, you should still be vigilant.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goatts Got a copy of my biopsy results today. Will meet with doctor on 3/5/15. I guess MRI and bone scan will be next. Any feedback from you guys who have been thru this would be appreciated. 6 cores (a thru f) show clear (all left side) g) 3+4=7 98% h) 3+4=7 90% i) 4+3=7 90% j) 3+4=7 95% k) 3+4=7 85% l) 4+3=7 95% So the right side is almost solid tumor. Perineural invasion on 2 cores, adenocarcinoma is present. My PSA is 38. I expected much worse. Based on the above, do you think it's spread beyond the prostate. Thanks Tom Tom, Sorry about your diagnosis. I took the liberty to input your biopsy results into the MSK prostate cancer nomogram and it is kind of a good news bad news situation: According to the nomogram, if you choose surgery here are the probabilities outcome: Good news: Prostate cancer specific survival - 10 yrs ~99%, 15 yrs ~97% Not so good news: 5 yrs progression free probability ~14% Meaning high probability cancer has escape the capsule but because it is G7, you can control them with medications and you will most likely not die from prostate cancer. But remember, these are just their guesses and yours may very well be organ confined. So as the others have advised find the best surgeon, radiation oncologist, oncologist and draw up a plan of attack and beat the hack out of the cancer. Good luck.",

Their results were astonishingly good - dramatic differences in PSA doubling time between placebo arm and supplements arm! The only negatives were small sample sizes and short duration (6 months) otherwise a solid piece of research work. The UCLA folks who first published their positive pomegranate results tried to organized a similar trial and last I tracked a couple of years ago, they were recruiting members for the trial and then went silent and I have not seen any write up since then.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by dirkv I'm the 'dad', and would like to know if there are cases where intermittent Lupron has proven useful. If the psa rise is partly due to Cassodex, I might consider staying off Lupron for six months. But would like to know if this drug recovers it's effectiveness after an interruption. Any experience out there ? Someone I know uses intermittent therapy: On Lupron for a period until PSA went below .1, stopped Lupron for a period and went back to Lupron after PSA started going up. This went on for over a decade. The nadir (low) was higher each successive cycle but was still lower than not taking Lupron. Don't know if this works in your case, best to consult your oncologist.",

I was afraid to ask and my regular doctor is off until jan 7. How long do guys last in my shape? Will the pain get worse? Thank you. Gimmy Hi Gimmy, Hang in there as there are still many options, though palliative, that can reduce your bone pain and keep you going a long time. If you look at the adjacent post by squoiaranger, you will find that he has been fighting metastasized prostate cancer for many years with many treatment protocols and is still hanging in there. Perhaps, you can either write him a PM, or post on his thread so he can share some of his experiences with you. Good luck and God bless you.",

      "Content": "No one responded so let me try. I am very impressed that you took the time to research the subject matter for your hubby. He is a lucky guy. I had to do all the research myself. Let me make a couple of comments: 1. The article looked to me like a review article geared towards medical education (for medical students or residents for example) and not for laypersons trying to make sense of the disease when first diagnosed. For someone without a lot of knowledge when first diagnosed, the best read in my opinion is what Fairwind posted in the Sticky: Dr. Patrick Walsh's \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\". The book is much better organized and easier to understand for a layperson. 2. Since you are very knowledgeable and technical and if you are looking for detail information, I suggest you go to the National Cancer Institute website and read up on the write up for health care professional: http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/prostate and click on health professional. I studied this write up carefully before I chose my treatment. Based on your hubby's signature, his cancer is moderately aggressive (a number of G7s) and with a PSA of over 100, it might be systemic or in danger of turning systemic. With your knowledge of statistics you can also get a sense of probability by going to the MSK website using his stats to assess probabilities. Knowledge is power and I hope by studying carefully, you and your husband can find the best path for a cure. In my opinion, he should not wait and should seek aggressive treatments to maximize his chance of a cure. Of course I am a layperson and this is not a medical opinion. Best of luck.",

So it is accelerating meaning there is cause for concern especially since recent MRI indicated cancer in both sides of your prostate now. However, before you decide to remove your prostate, you should get a second opinion and read up on the consequences, risks and side effects of prostatectomy, how to select a surgeon and investigate other treatment options like seeds or radiation. And if you plan on having kids later, bank your sperms. Good luck and best wishes",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by trinity3 Since none of the procedures come with a penis warranty, maybe you could let me know your thoughts on what best option is for ED and incontinence issues. If you have ED now, you will have ED after surgery. If you do not have ED, the best chance to avoid it, either surgery or radiation is to find the best practitioners in the business, surgeons or radiation oncologists, which ever your choice. The ED side effect due to surgery is immediate and many improved/recovered over time. Radiation on the other hand has delayed ED effect for some, sometime in the future after the treatment. There were claims that the chances of ED was less for radiation treatment but I have not seen any side by side comparisons. As for incontinence, nowadays it is actually rare. Most (~90-95%?) will recover after a period of time. Also, I have some concern about running to some of the famous cancer centers for fear that someone other than the doctor I choose will be performing the procedure. I certainly welcome any comments!! If you ask the surgeon to not let someone other than him/her operates on you he/she will comply, if not you move to the next candidate. Good luck.",

Here is the infromation 10/15/2012 <0.05 standard assay , 01/15/2013 <0.05 standard assay , 04/30/2013 0.028 ultrasensitve assay , 07/01/2013 0.030 ultra , 09/05/2013 0.030 ultra , 11/12/2013 .040 ultra , 12/26/2013 .033 ultra , 02/10/2014 0.038 ultra , 04/10/2014 .044 ultra , 06/10/2014 .042 ultra , 08/11/2014 .047 ultra and the latest was 10/07/2014 .055 same lab except for the first 2 standard assays ! At what point should salvage radiation be considered ? Here are the computations for doubling time: 1. 18.91 months using 10 points starting 4/30/2013 2. 18.48 months using 9 points starting 7/1/2013 3. 17.87 months using 8 points starting 9/5/2013 4. 19.83 months using 7 points starting 11/12/2013 5. 14.84 months using 6 points starting 12/26/2013 6. 17.06 months using 5 points starting 2/10/2014 7. 17.67 months using 3 points starting 4/10/2014 8. 10.08 months using 3 points starting 6/10/2014 9. 8.26 months using 2 points starting 8/11/2014 There is definitely a trend of PSA increasing so chances are you have a recurrence. You can see that the doubling time bounced around some (probably due to machine sensitivity) but were consistent, until the last three tests when it accelerated. Of course two to three points are not as accurate but the acceleration in doubling time is unmistakable. When to pull the trigger on SRT is a question only you and your physician can answer as there are no consensus among physicians, but there is a guideline that your physician follows. By the way, did your pathology report indicated positive margins, or any other abnormal findings? Do your research, interview radiation oncologist, oncologist and prepare for action once the PSA number reaches a threshold. Consult an oncologist to see if a combination of hormone and radiation is right for you. We can give you our opinions but they are non professional opinions. Personally, I would go aggressive and start early the rationale being even if prostate cancer is slow growing, I want to minimize the chances of cancer turning systemic. Good luck.",

The nurse used all of the numbers to arrive at the 18 month doubling time. You need to watch things carefully because if we use the more recent numbers, the doubling time seemed to be shorter.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by vaom8 Unfortunately I cannot find the data today, but I did have a spike in the PSA test from 3 to 9 and the biopsy found the 3-4 Gleason level (I am not sure is that is a correct statement). The decision is made I will have the surgery and I will like to Know about how to prepare for it and recover. No Da Vinci , regular .Hopefully nerve saving surgery. Please Advice. As mentioned by HighlanderCFH and others, the outcomes between open and da vinci are not that different as long as you have an experienced surgeon operating on you. As for preparation, your surgeon's office should have a list of things for you to do prior to and after surgery and a list of stuff you should have prior, during and after. Before you know it, it will be over and we are ready to welcome you to join us on the other side. One thing usually not mentioned is your physical condition. The recovery, complications and even side effects depend very much on how fit are you prior to surgery. So, my advice is use the period between now and surgery to get yourself in shape, meaning, exercise, eat right, reduce weight.... I used the two months from diagnosed to surgery for vigorous exercise/boot camp. Of course if you have not exercised and want to start, you better consult your doctor before you start. Good luck.",

I wonder if this may be associated with my prostate cancer. mickcee, If your blood vessels inside your nose are exposed or too closed to the surface, bleeding can happen due to dryness or irritations. Have you asked your ENT if you have that condition and if so, to cauterize the blood vessels inside your nose? This problem often runs in the family and cauterization may help. Otherwise, apply Vaseline using a Qtip to the affected area once or twice a day may also help. Nose bleed is probably not related to your prostate cancer. Again, just a layperson's and not a medical profession's opinion. The other folks gave you good advices on your prostate cancer issues so I won't repeat. Good luck and best wishes.",

Without knowing the name of the drug, we are just guessing. However, since 2010, there were six new drugs/treatments approved by the FDA for treating prostate cancer. 2010: Sepuleucel-T (Provenge an immuno-therapy) - prolong survival 2010: Cabazitaxel (Jevtana - Chemo) - prolong survival 2010: Denosumab (Xgeva for skeletal related event) 2011: Abiraterone (Zytiga for mCRPC, failed chemo) - prolong survival 2012: Enzalutamide (Xtandi - mCRPC, failed chemo) - prolong survival 2012: Abiraterone (Zytiga - mCRPC expanded to pre chemo) - prolong survival 2013: Radium-223 Dichroide (Xofigo - bone met) - prolong survival I am not aware of any new treatment after Radium-223 but there are a lot of options available to him.

      "Content": "A couple of comments: 1. Fairwind made an excellent point, in a standard radiation treatment, PSA does not go to undetectable immediately so your .02 PSA is most likely caused by the hormone. However, if hormone is what caused the PSA to be undetectable, then from what I read and from many of the posts here, PSA should stay low for some time and not rising immediately after it stops. Maybe you stopped too soon? 2. Most of the literatures I read about adjuvant hormone in radiation treatment started with hormone prior to radiation and usually continued for 6, 12 to 18 months after radiation. To stop right after radiation seemed unusual? 3. If you did not have adjuvant hormone therapy, PSA usually drops slowly and won't reach nadir for sometime, perhaps 12 to 24 months. So, my recommendation is to seek another opinion or perhaps get back to hormone. Best wishes.",

I am very happy for you that your treatment is very successful and I agree today's radiation treatment is \"not your father's radiation treatment\". RW744, Reading your biopsy and diagnostic reports again, I see your cancer seemed to be pushing the edge (capsule), I would consult your doctor to see if that could be a risk factor for Cyberknife. A very precise beam is both good and bad. If the cancer is pushing the edge, there may be potential misses or damaging adjacent tissues (if the doctor is too aggressive with the beam coverage).

So what if the kids have a reduced inheritance or there is lien against the house at probate. That's what money is really for right...a rainy day! Asks, Your budget is way off. Without insurance, a typical surgery costs >$75K (I was going to pay out of pocket at one time), IMRT >$100K, proton >$150K, a course of new hormone, Provenge... costs >$100K per year.... I think after you add them all up for someone going through surgery, SRT, hormone, Provenge, chemo, etc. you are off by at least a factor of 10. My back of the envelop calculation showed that if we go back to the 1975 situation, no PSA testing, wait until symptoms show up and cancer is terminal (1/3 of cases then), it is a lot cheaper to insurance and Medicare.",

I had 3 consecutive undetectable PSAs after surgery with very favorable pathology and similar results on the MSKCC Nomogram as your dads. And then my fourth PSA test came back at 3.88!!!!! I had it retested at another lab, it came back undetectable, and the first lab then confirmed that after retesting the same blood they too got an undetectable. So yes, its possible that its a lab error, get a retest. Pratoman, He may be a physician but with his Dad's situation, he is just like us, seeking support and some help and we may be all laypersons but with our collective experiences perhaps we could offer some comfort to him and his family. That said, I don't think his case is lab error: His post-op PSAs were: April 2015 PSA = 0.003 August 2015 PSA = 0.005 Oct 2015 PSA = 0.007 Jan 2016 PSA = 0.16 (done in middle east at a different lab from his usual labs) The PSA was detectable from the get go and there is a monotonic increase so the only possible error is the magnitude and not the increase. Bottom line is the surgery failed. In addition since all margins, nodes are negative. I worry the cancer may have gone systemic but lets hope it is still local so SRT can kill them all. The question really is how aggressive he wants to take the next step and a consultation with an oncologist with expertise in prostate cancer is in order. To the op, you should know that it is not a death sentence for your Dad. If the Gleason score is not too aggressive, the cancer can be managed and life span of decades is very likely. Take care.",

However, most physicians dismissed the evidences that the FDA cited as not conclusive and thought the FDA over reacted. As for treatment options, it is really up to you as both surgery and radiation are equally effective. The only advice we can give is whatever you decide, go find the best practitioner to do it for you. That has more bearing than which treatment type you choose. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tim1029 Can anyone help me. I just was diagnosed at age 44 with very early stage 1 Gleason score 6 prostate cancer. My Doctor told me the standard for someone my age is to have a radical prostectomy to give me the best shot of a long life. My concern is how will my sex life be after the surgery. I hear many conflicting storys ranging from you will be able to have erections a couple weeks after surgery to, forget it you'll never be able to have sex again. Please is there anyone out there that could possibly give me some straight answers to what to exspect with the surgery. Also maybe a little advice on possible other options. Welcome. As mentioned in prior posts, you do have a lot of options beside surgery. However, if you decide on surgery, like some of us on this site, then I cannot emphasize enough about finding a competent surgeon to do the operation. Published results of the \"best in class\" are quite a bit better than the overall population of surgeons. You have one shot to do it right and there is no do-over. When you interview surgeons, do ask how many operations have they done, the rate of positive margins, the rate of incontinence and the rate of ED. They should be willing to answer those questions. If not, you should find someone else. If you read Dr. Walsh's book, in it he shared his statistical outcome on positive margins, incontinences and ED. The surgeon you select should have comparable results. Good luck.",

He replied by saying my prostate was about 98 grams and the tumor was about 2 grams. So, I think both ways are used, perhaps depending on the particular aspect being discussed at the time. Highlander, I think after surgery, they have the specimen so they can weigh and determine the weight. Before surgery, with ultrasound, they only have the dimensions (X cm by Y cm by Z cm) so cc is more likely. But, as I said, I don't know, they can convert cc into gm easily.",

Originally Posted by wish full What I'm really concerned about is the prostate covering the Apex and being high grade. I see this as a possible apex margin due to the amount and being high grade. Sorry we have to welcome you to our club. Mikla gave you good advice and you should take him up on his suggestions. To answer your specific questions: Yes, high Gleason scores mean higher risks. However, risks also depend on staging, i.e., how extensive the cancer is and whether it has spread to other organs. Since you have one score of 3+4, it is moderately aggressive. 3+4 means most of your cancer is grade 3, the least aggressive type, but there are some grade 4 which is more aggressive. Looking at your biopsy pathology report, your cancer is at exactly where the radiologist said it was - left mid and left base (near the bladder, not apex). So, you had a very good radiologist read your MRI. The other good news are the biopsy did not detect any spread and more important, the MRI report showed no evidence of spread. All in all, looks like an organ confined case and if you take action to seek treatment, you should be fine. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Fairwind gave you an excellent unbiased review. I might add that in addition to selecting a skill surgeon, outcome depends on a number of other factors and is very personalized. If the cancer is too close to the nerves, nerve sparing could be difficult and potency could be a challenge. If it is too close to the bladder neck, apex or urethra, it might affect continence, etc. So, in the end, it also depends on your situation. Based on a number of posts I read here and elsewhere in the past six months, it seemed for surgery, in general most eventually were able to achieve continence. ED seemed more of a challenge. In the end many required medications or aids to function but were able to function. Folks that had done radiation mostly reported only minor short term side effects. However, there were not too many long term outcome reported. I don't know, maybe because there were none to report? Discuss all options with your doctor. In the end, it is your choice. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Half life for PSA in the body is between 2 to 3 days. With your PSA#, at one month after surgery, PSA should be <.1 Since it is .1 and not <.1, it could indicate that the positive margins did leave some cells behind and that is why your surgeon is advocating adjuvant radiation. The good news is that in people with positive margins, if there is biochemical recurrence, salvage radiation's success rate is much higher than people with negative margins. In a way your surgeon was between a rock and a hard place when he operated on you: Some of your cancer cells were at the apex, if he cut too wide, you would certainly have bad incontinence and if he cut too colse he left some cells behind. I believe in your case salvage or adjuvant radiation should give you a good chance of a \"cure\". You and your radiation oncologist should determine the best course of action in your particular case. Good luck.",

The good news is his PSA was undetectable for three years and his doubling time is not too aggressive so a lot can be done to control his recurrence and he will most likely not die from it. He may want to consult a radiation oncologist, as often time, with slow growing cancer like what he has, the cancer may still be localized in and around the prostate bed and radiation may kill them all. Also, he should see an oncologist specializing in treating prostate cancer who can help design a treatment protocol for him. Best wishes and good luck.",

I do not know for sure but must assume that the cancerous cores were from the nodule ? I did not verify or ask the urologue at the time (in shock I guess). Many thankls in advance for your advice. +++ kinghorne, Sorry you are here but welcome to the club no one wants to join. Good news: Looks like you have been monitoring your PSA and catch your cancer early enough that a \"cure\" is definitely possible. Also, the cancer is a Gleason(3+4), so not too aggressive. Another good news is you are i/d as a T2a, meaning the cancer is in less than half of one side. There is also no indication of spread based on PSA #, biopsy and DRE. Wait & Monitor (AS) is probably not the right path for you because you are a G7 and not a G6 and your PSA has gone up quite fast in the past two years. As to the types of treatment, my opinion is both surgery and radiation are appropriate and it is more a personal choice than effectiveness in your case. One more thing, even though DRE detected a nodule, more often, prostate cancers are multifocal and very likely in more places than one nodule. Good luck and best wishes.",

However, chances are even if you ended up having cancer, you will still be around for a long time like all of us here as prostate cancer is one of the most treatable cancers for men and there are many options available to treat. A PSA of 113 is very high and not likely due to an enlarge prostate. However, it is still possible that infection/inflammation of the prostate can cause such high PSA. Usually urologist will prescribe antibiotics to rule out infection before sending you to have a biopsy done. Biopsy is the one definitive diagnosis for cancer if it is positive. Negative scan/x-ray and negative DRE are both positive signs for you and hopefully you have infection instead of cancer. Best of luck to you.",

If your doctor follows the new guideline and forgoes PSA testing, your cancer will probably not be curable after symptoms appear. You are very fortunate your doctor tracked your PSA and both he and the urologist went for a biopsy. Another good news is no lymphatic or perineural invasion which means cancer has not found a path to escape yet. A cure/full remission for you! Take your time to research and decide on a treatment that you are comfortable with. The most important choice is to choose the right physician (surgeon if you choose surgery or radiation oncologist if you choose radiation). You have one shot to do it right and outcome is very physician dependent. - especially side effects of the treatment. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "MKEvman, Welcome. Your case demonstrates why in many cases PSA tests save lives. If your doctor follows the new guideline and forgoes PSA testing, your cancer will probably not be curable after symptoms appear. You are very fortunate your doctor tracked your PSA and both he and the urologist went for a biopsy. Another good news is no lymphatic or perineural invasion which means cancer has not found a path to escape yet. A cure/full remission for you! Take your time to research and decide on a treatment that you are comfortable with. The most important choice is to choose the right physician (surgeon if you choose surgery or radiation oncologist if you choose radiation). You have one shot to do it right and outcome is very physician dependent. - especially side effects of the treatment. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Life returned to normal and prostate cancer became a distant memory until I learned yesterday that a former business associate and friend of mine died from prostate cancer a couple of days ago. Our cancers were discovered at about the same time in 2010. My friend never tested his PSA until 2010, for the very first time and unfortunately his PSA at the time was already over 100. So, by the time his was detected, it already spread to adjacent organs. Curative procedures were no longer possible for him. He went through most of the medications including MDV3100. Each time the medication worked for a short time and then stopped working. With bone met, his last two years of life was very painful and uncomfortable. He told me if he could rewind, he would have tested his PSA when he turned 50 and would gladly trade complications from surgery/radiation for his painful/uncomfortable existence. The USPSTF is doing men a disservice by recommending no PSA testing. Logic and statistics from the National Cancer Institute's SEER database simply do not support the USPSTF's position. They arrived at their position by examining specially designed trials instead of looking at real world data. Those in research know that trials can be misleading and flawed. I reviewed the SEER database which went back to the 1960/70. It clearly indicated a dramatic reduction of prostate cancer death rate and dramatic increase in survival rate after PSA testing was implemented. May my friend rest in peace.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tomnan24 1st Opinion. PSA 5.6, biopsy May 2013 gleason 6, 8 of 12 positive. He said it probably wouldn't kill me for 10-15 years. Had CT scan in February 2013. Doctor said from this that Cancer was contained in prostate so I would be a candidate for hormone therapy to delay surgery/seeds til next year when I will have insurance. Got a second opinion to be safe from a respected doctor. He said I am not a candidate for hormone therapy and in addition said I will need another CT scan for staging in order to have surgery/seeds. Can anyone make sense of these differing comments? 2nd doctor was not that easy to discuss things with. I'll probably talk to the first doctor again, but may get a 3rd opinion. Any thoughts? I'm bummed out. One option is to do hormone therapy for a year and then do radiation therapy. This combination actually will provide superior outcome compare to radiation alone. A number of studies in medical journals reported some better outcome with a combination hormone/radiation compare to radiation only. Also, there are some inexpensive generic hormone medications available so that those without insurance will not break their piggy bank. The only issue I see is most hormone prior to radiation only go for 6 months so some expert advices are needed to go hormone for one year. The suggestion of consulting with a radiation oncologist and an oncologist is an excellent one. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Kazzie61, I agree with the other posters. The biopsy results are not bad. He has a very good urologist who called for an MRI and was able to detect the potential SV involvement. The biopsy was then able to confirm that suspicion. That is tremendously helpful to the surgeon and/or radiation oncologist when they start treatment. As to whether it is a G7(3+4) or G7(4+3), often that depends on the pathologist's judgement. The first # represents the majority of cancers in that core and the second # the next most prevalent. Often whether it is 3+4 or 4+3 in a core is a judgement. Also, if overall the were more G3 than G4, the overall diagnosis is G7(3+4). Looking at the percentage of cancer in each core, it looks like they ranged from 30 to 100% indicating cancers are quite prevalent and not incidental thus calling for immediate treatment. After surgery there is often another # call tertiary Gx which is the third most prevalent cancers in the specimen (see my signature). Seminal Vesicle involvement and PNI are additional risk factors but can still be classified as localized cancer with a high cure rate. I had PNI in my final pathology report and I was worried. I then researched and read medical studies that indicated PNI did not increase recurrence rate and my surgeon said so himself. His physicians wanted to be aggressive, which is very good as they wanted a cure. Good luck and we look forward to him takes the plunge and joins us on the other side.",

      "Content": "As a non healthcare person but with technical training, I researched HIFU and cryosurgery and thought HIFU was similar to cryosurgery, effective for focal cancer that was localized but it might be difficult to treat multifocal cancers that were all over the prostate and the control for side effects could be difficult because the precision of ultrasound was difficult to maintain so there might be more collateral damages to adjacent tissues and nerves during HIFU and cryosurgery (ED for example). However, medical science progresses rapidly, so like radiation, it maybe ready for prime time now as opposed to 5 years ago.",

      "Content": "As a non healthcare person but with technical training, I researched HIFU and cryosurgery and thought HIFU was similar to cryosurgery, effective for focal cancer that was localized but it might be difficult to treat multifocal cancers that were all over the prostate and the control for side effects could be difficult because the precision of ultrasound was difficult to maintain so there might be more collateral damages to adjacent tissues and nerves during HIFU and cryosurgery (ED for example). However, medical science progresses rapidly, so like radiation, it maybe ready for prime time now as opposed to 5 years ago.",

      "Content": "Welcome mom2two. As Fairwind said, G8 is aggressive so treatment is needed to get rid of the cancer. However, there are a number of positives in his favor: 1. Looks like the cancer is only confined in the area of the positive DRE and has no sign of spread (no ECE,no PNI, no seminal vesicles involvement, no lymph/vascular invasion...), i.e., cancer is organ confined. 2. The histologic type is acinar, which is the most common type and treatments are normally effective. Statistics for his case is in his favor if he seeks treatment. It is highly likely that he can achieve a cure using either radiation or surgery. Best wishes and good luck.",

Since you only have the external sphincter muscles to control your urethra often time they need to be trained and over time they could be weaken or relaxed. I suggest you start to do Kegel again to see if controls can be tighten up. All else fails, there are implants that can fix incontinence. As for ED, there are a lot of remedies including injection and implant if that is important to you. Life is precious and I would not trade 10 years for ED and some leakage.

The full pathology report came today, if I put the report here (I don't know the implications of much of it) again I would appreciate feedback/advice however hard hitting it is. A radical prostatectomy specimen weighing 42g Fibrofatty tissue measuring 20x10x10 A1. adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+3,3.5cm2 right and left side,specimen confined tumour extends beyond the gland for 2mm at right lateral but is clear of the circumference inked surgical limit. Apical inked limit shows tumour for 1mm. A2. adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+3 (with focal Gleason 5) 3.1cm2 right and left side,tumour extends beyond the gland and is seen at an extraprotastic inked surgical limit for 1mmat right posterior. A3. adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+3,2.5cm2 right and left side,tumour extends beyond the gland for 1mm at right lateral but is clear of the circumferential inked surgical limit. A4. adenocarcinoma Gleason 3+4,2.5cm,right and left side,specimen confined,tumour extends beyond the gland for 4mm at right posterior but is clear of the circumferential inked surgical limit. A5. adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+3, 1.9cm2,right and left side,specimen confined,tumour extends beyond the gland for 10mm at right posterior but is clear of the inked surical limit. Tumour infiltrates extensivelyinto right SV and focally into left SV muscle coats( stage pT3b). Basal inked limit and vasal limits are free of tumour. B. Sections show pre-prostatic fat is free of tumour. No lymph nodes are seen. There are good news and concerns in this pathology report. The good news is even though there were two positive margins, they were small and even if the post op PSA is not undetectable, radiation should provide him with a cure. The bad news is what was not reported: The surgeon did not take out any lymph nodes! You are smart to ask for the report. I think the reason the surgeon kind of refused to provide one is because it showed he was somewhat irresponsible. With seminal vesicles involvement and EPE, surgeons should take out at least a few lymph nodes and examined them to make sure they were negative. It is really very easy to do in both open and robotic surgeries. Instead none was taken out (No lymph nodes are seen). Maybe it was a misprint if so I apologize but this is an important point to ask him. If the lymph nodes were taken out and were negative, he has an excellent chance of a cure with adjuvant radiation or salvage radiation. Even if some lymph nodes were positive, taking them out sometimes cure the cancer if they were localized within those nodes. In adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy, the RO should consider irradiating those nodes. Hopefully, there is still a chance of a cure for him. Your husband is lucky to have you looking after him and protecting his health.",

      "Content": "dk6 & Fairwind gave you the 1 min version. Let me give you the 10 min version. It has been one and a half years ago so it is from distant memory: First of all, the surgeon, his nurse and the hospital should run you through pre-op checks, by him, her and the hospital. Also, run some tests to make sure you can be operated on. One of them, usually your doctor's office should give you instructions on what to do, pre and post op, what to do in case of complications post op, etc. The instructions should include how to deal with the catheter, clean the areas, emptying the bag, disinfect the bag... The morning of the surgery, I checked into the hospital at 5am, by 6:30am they prepared me, wheeled me into the staging area, the anesthesiologist greeted me, put the IV in my arm and explained the process. My surgeon came in next all dressed and I said Hi. I did not even remember what he said, the next thing I knew, I was in my room, I saw the wall clock in the room said 1:30pm and saw my wife looking and smiling at me. I did not feel any pain but started noticing the catheter bag and the compression sleeves they put on my legs pumping (to prevent blood clogs). The nurse got me up that evening to walk around. I was supposed to be discharged the next afternoon but because I did not pass gas (indication of bowel movement, which is important after surgery to indicate everything in your system is getting back to normal), they kept me till the morning of the third day when I passed gas. During discharge, the nurse went through the catheter care and handling again. So, this is a good time for you to ask as many questions regarding the catheter as you can. Best to have someone with you and take note or you might forget. There were no pain. I did not take any pain medication except some Tylenol the first day at home to ease the sore throat that Fairwind mentioned, that was caused by the breathing tube. The catheter was not painful, just not comfortable, especially when I accidentally tugged on it. the tip where it came out got irritated after a couple of days because I walked too much. Called the doctor and he told me the best treatment was to washed the area regularly with clean warm water and applied Neosporin occasionally. Mobility was not any problem, I used the big bag for indoor and leg bag for outdoor. As for clothing, Fairwind was spot on. You won't be able to run but any walking at a normal pace should not post any problem. Sleeping was a little uncomfortable the first night because I was afraid to press on the tubing and did not \"turn\", just stayed on my back all night. Slept through the rest of the nights and did not even notice the tube. There were some blood clots and some bleeding but they told me those were normal. So, don't be too alarm if the urine collection looks pink. Do drink plenty of fluid. Best part as dk6 said, for the first time in years I did not have to get up multiple times to urinate at night. You need to watch your bowel movement and make sure to take stool softener. For the first few weeks, I took Colace and drank prune juice and had no problem with bowel. It is very bad for your incision sites if you strain too much. Straining could also cause irritation to your bladder and might cause the catheter to leak. When you laugh or cough, best thing is to press a pillow on your tummy so as not to stress the incisions. Be careful, the incisions could come apart if you stress them too hard. That is also why for a few weeks you should not lift anything heavy. I was amazed with the whole experience with regard to the lack of pain and discomfort and how quickly I recovered. My friend went through open and had to stay in the hospital for 4 days and he was in quite a bid of pain after he went home. It is not a walk in the park for sure but overall I had a good experience and was happy I selected the treatment and selected my surgeon. Best of luck to you and please share your experience after you are on the other side. Cheers.",

      "Content": "You have a positive DRE, i.e., the urologist felt a nodule, so, ignoring this issue is not wise. As for the statement that \"Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment\" it is a carefully crafted statement. Notice it did not state testing did not save life. Numerous studies, especially one from Europe indicated testing and treatment saved lives, just that over treatments often caused unwanted side effects and that all these testing and treatment were very expensive and perhaps our healthcare systems cannot afford it. I think the main issue is not testing but after tested positive, what do you do? Many cases can be treated with AS (Active Surveillance) to avoid cost and bad side effects.",

      "Content": "MKEvman, Welcome. Your case demonstrates why in many cases PSA tests save lives. If your doctor follows the new guideline and forgoes PSA testing, your cancer will probably not be curable after symptoms appear. You are very fortunate your doctor tracked your PSA and both he and the urologist went for a biopsy. Another good news is no lymphatic or perineural invasion which means cancer has not found a path to escape yet. A cure/full remission for you! Take your time to research and decide on a treatment that you are comfortable with. The most important choice is to choose the right physician (surgeon if you choose surgery or radiation oncologist if you choose radiation). You have one shot to do it right and outcome is very physician dependent. - especially side effects of the treatment. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by julie bell Firstly he was perscribed bicalutanide which did not lower the psa sufficiently so he went on to get the hormone injections (Monthly). This successfully reduced his PSA and about a year and a half ago he had a course of radiotherapy. Since then his PSA has remained at an undetectable level and he continued to have the injections along withTamoxifen and Bicalutanide. Now after 1.5yrs the consultant has stopped the injections and the 2 medications mentioned above. I would like to know, in your experience - is this usual practice? Julie (Anxious daughter!!) x Agree with Fairwind, I believe it is a standard treatment protocol: Radiation Therapy sandwich between 36 months of hormone treatment. It looks like the treatment is working since his PSA is undetectable. Stop now and hopefully the PSA will remain undetectable. Good luck.",

      "Content": "From UPI, an interesting study by UC San Francisco: Men with non-metastatic prostate cancer who replaced some carbohydrates and animal fat with vegetable fat had lower risk of dying, U.S. researchers say. Erin L. Richman of the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues examined fat intake in men after a diagnosis of prostate cancer in relation to lethal prostate cancer and all-cause mortality. The study included 4,577 men diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer from 1986-2010 who were enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The study, published in the journal Internal Medicine, found after a midpoint follow up of 8.4 years, there were 315 lethal prostate cancer events and 1,064 deaths. Replacing 10 percent of calories from carbohydrates with vegetable fat was associated with a 29 percent lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and a 26 percent lower risk of death from all-cause mortality. \"In this prospective analysis, vegetable fat intake after diagnosis was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and all-cause mortality,\" the study authors wrote in summing up their work.

      "Content": "edmcc, Welcome. You are only one month post surgery so things have not settled down yet. Give yourself a few more months and incontinence should be gone. Usually recovery from ED takes longer. There were studies that indicated taking 5mg Cialis and pump helped with ED rehab so you should follow your doctor's instructions. Even though there were indications that cancer cells might have escaped the capsule, lets hope your surgeon had taken them all out by taking adjacent tissues out (that was how the pathologist noted microscopic cancer cells in surrounding tissues) . So strictly speaking you might not have positive margins and should have undetectable PSA when the next test comes around. Good luck.",

My impulse is to get that prostate outta here, but it's not my body. Actually all the recent studies indicated modern radiation techniques and surgery produced almost the same cancer outcome but radiation seemed to give better outcome on ED in the short term. The main differences between surgery and radiation are the side effects of surgery are immediate and most get better over time whereas radiation side effects are few at the beginning but over time some may get worst. There are also side effects of radiation that surgery does not have like bowel and bladder irritations....and side effects that surgery has but not radiation like lymphedema....",

      "Content": "My two years anniversary date with Da Vinci is coming up on August 23rd and I am happy to report I have undetectable PSA since surgery and no incontinence or ED. A while back I decided I was going to stay away from posting or reading prostate cancer forums and \"move on\". Life was good. However, about a month ago, I posted that a friend and former business associate passed away due to prostate cancer two years after he was diagnosed. Right after that, a classmate of my brother in law also passed away after several years of fighting the disease. In quick succession, a relative was diagnosed with stage T2 and a friend who had surgery and SRT in early 2000s found out his PSA was rising rapidly and doubling about every 6 months after being dormant for 8 years. The two that are alive checked their PSA every year prior to diagnosed. The two that died did not and had advanced disease when diagnosed. Since coming back and getting involved again, I am impressed with the number of new medications being tested recently. There will be more weapons available to fight prostate cancer in the near future. So, to those that are new, do not panic, relax and try to gain as much understanding of the disease and treatment options as you can. There are many options available but choose carefully for you have one chance to get it right.",

And if I removed the first reading of 3.53 in Jun 12, your PSA has not change over almost three years! Meaning your PSA is actually very stable, unlike when cancer is present where mostly PSA increases monotonically. I suspect you either have a chronic inflammation of the prostate or an enlarged prostate? Perhaps if you get another negative biopsy, you may want to ask your urologist about it. In addition it might make sense to send your biopsy slides to JH or Mayo for a second read. Most negative biopsies that leads to eventually a positive one have some abnormal cells present like HGPIN, or atypical cells (look at Ray61's signature and mine). Also, did you have any symptoms of BPH or infections and did your urologist prescribed a long course of antibiotics to see if the PSA would come down? Best wishes and hope we can reject your application for membership. Cheers.",

      "Content": "Samie, Sorry you have to be here but welcome. I have a few thoughts: It is a good idea to get a second opinion from another urologist. Perhaps the new urologist will ask for an MRI to see if indeed the cancer is extensive. 1 core out of 8 positive does not explain the 39 PSA #. Maybe his cancer is extensive and aggressive or maybe not. It is possible that his high PSA # could be due to a combination of cancer and infection. Did his urologist prescribe a course of antibiotics to see if that brings down the PSA. Since cancer is already diagnosed, it is done to see how extensive is the cancer, perhaps, just perhaps it is not as extensive as the PSA # indicated. In that case the treatment protocol may be different. In any case, if he is more comfortable with the non surgery approaches (some forms of radiations), the cure rate is about equal to surgery so he should proceed without worry. Another point we all like to make is this is not a death sentence by any means. Even if the cancer is aggressive, there are lots of options for him to keep him around for a long time, so, do not interrupt your plan for a wonderful retirement.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FredS Post surgery report 11/30/12: Sections show extensive mixed pattern adenocarcinoma (Gleasons 4+4) present in all four quadrants of the prostate. The tumor is comprised primarily of acinar-type glands that exhibit a gleasons 4+3 pattern. Some areas of ductal adenocarcinoma (Gleasons's 4+4) are also identified. Adenocarcinoma is seen focally at the apex margin and focally on the right capsular margin. Tumor is fairly extensively present at the bladder neck margins. Seminal vesicles are negative. Lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion is not identified. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Marie & Fred, Sorry you have to be here but welcome. Let me try to interpret the pathology report from what I know: 1. The pathologist identified two types of prostate cancer cells: acinar adenocarcinoma and ductal adenocarcinoma. The first type is the most common, most of us have it. The second type is less common and it is in the ductal area of the prostate gland (he said \"some areas\", didn't say extensive which is good). Ductals are more aggressive. 2. There are three positive margins identified, at the apex and on the right capsule edge and near the bladder neck. The good news is those are adenocarcinoma, the less aggressive type. So, if there is escape due to the positive margins, it is the less aggressive type. 3. The other good news is no seminal vesicles and lymph node involvement and no perineural invasion. I interpret the no lymph node invasion identified as your surgeon did take the lymph nodes out. The no perineural invasion is good as cancers usually follow the nerves to escape the prostate capsule. Because of the ductal adenocarcinoma, if I were you, I would do adjuvant radiation and hormone therapy early, even if the post op PSA is undetectable, to nip the positive margins before they expand somewhere else. I would not wait and will consult a radiation oncologist and fine the best oncologist I can find who specializes in treating prostate cancer to discuss adjuvant hormonal treatment. I was at a cancer support meeting and listened to a prominent oncologist discussed treatment options. She said \"Hormonal treatment is often an art, sometimes the oncologist can try different combinations, start and stop and can keep a patient's cancer under control for many many years, but you need to start early.\" Best of luck to you two.",

      "Content": "The good news is your guy has no incontinence. Incontinence is hard to live with but there are many ways to treat ED, first of all, he should consult an ED doctor to get all the latest on rehab and to guide him. By the way, in Dr. Walsh's book he said it might take up to two years for ED to fully recover so your guy needs more time. I am one of the fortunate ones without ED and I am not a healthcare professional so really I should not be giving advices. But, I did some research prior to surgery just in case I had to deal with it: Usually our surgeon starts us on low dose Cialis right after surgery for a few months, he/she also can prescribe full strength Viagra, etc. He/she may also tell us to try the pump and finally to try injections like Trimix. My doctor told me injection should work every time with the right dose which your guy has to experiment with (make sure he gets advices and guidance from his ED doctor) and once the correct dose is used, he should be better than his old self. Good luck to both of you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Friendly A couple years ago I had several bad days with Vertigo. I mentioned to the doctor that the Vertigo never seemed to go away and recently he did a MRI of my inner ears and found nothing. Did or does anyone ever experience an unsteadiness with Prostate Cancer as a symptom? A month ago they found my blood count is double digits. I had a Bone Scan and Kat Scan after a needle biopsy. They found 70 percent of the needle biopsy had cancer. My unsteadiness seems to be getting worse, could the cancer be attacking something that has made me this way? THANK YOU.[/SIZE][/B][/SIZE] Friendly, Welcome to this site. You should thank your wife for insisting you take a blood PSA test and let's hope you catch yours in time for a \"cure\" or as some other posters would prefer to say \"full remission\". Let me quote from Wikipedia: Vertigo is caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to vertigo including: lesions caused by infarctions or hemorrhage, tumors present in the cerebellopontine angle. So unless your prostate cancer metastasizes to your brain, your vertigo is most likely caused by something else. By the way vertigo is quite common and many of my otherwise healthy friends have this problem. You need to find out: 1. Your doctor should tell you what is your PSA number. He was irresponsible if he just told you it was double digit. 2. Your doctor needed to give you the full biopsy report and explained/summarized the results for you and your wife. If I were you, I next time you see your doctor, you should have your wife with you to take note. 3. The most important information from the biopsy report are: The type of prostate cancer, perhaps adencarcinoma or something else, # of core positive and % of positive, Gleason scores of each positive core, any other information like perineural invasions, prostate size, etc. would also be helpful. The treatment options and assessment of how serious your situation is depends on the biopsy outcome as described above. Fortunately, even with serious cases there are a lot of options and treatments to keep you around for a long long time. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by FredS I've been wondering if I should have more tests since the pathology exam after surgery indicates ductal adenocarcinaoma. I'm reading online articles that appear to say that ductal cancer is worse than other cancers. Thanks for any help. Fred First of all, congratulations for an undetectable first post op PSA reading. Hopefully, your surgeon was able to remove all of the prostate cancers from your body. Second, I don't think you should worry too much at this stage. From the medical journal articles I read, the overall survivals of ductal prostate cancer were no different from the \"garden variety\". The pathology community does as a matter of policy, assign a Gleason grade 4 to ductal cancer and as a g4 it is no different in aggressiveness than the garden variety adenocarcinoma grade 4. Third, if it spreads, whatever treatments that work for adenocarcinoma also work for ductal. I do want to mention that since it is quite rare, there are conflicting articles, some said ductal are more aggressive, others actually said they found longer survival. However, a number of articles did say that if they metastasized, they sometimes went to organs like lung and liver instead of bones. So, monitor your situation carefully and hope for the best. Good luck and welcome to the zero club and hope you stay there a long time. Please note that I am just a layperson and my opinions are not from any formal healthcare trainings.",

      "Content": "Samie, Sorry you have to be here but welcome. I have a few thoughts: It is a good idea to get a second opinion from another urologist. Perhaps the new urologist will ask for an MRI to see if indeed the cancer is extensive. 1 core out of 8 positive does not explain the 39 PSA #. Maybe his cancer is extensive and aggressive or maybe not. It is possible that his high PSA # could be due to a combination of cancer and infection. Did his urologist prescribe a course of antibiotics to see if that brings down the PSA. Since cancer is already diagnosed, it is done to see how extensive is the cancer, perhaps, just perhaps it is not as extensive as the PSA # indicated. In that case the treatment protocol may be different. In any case, if he is more comfortable with the non surgery approaches (some forms of radiations), the cure rate is about equal to surgery so he should proceed without worry. Another point we all like to make is this is not a death sentence by any means. Even if the cancer is aggressive, there are lots of options for him to keep him around for a long time, so, do not interrupt your plan for a wonderful retirement.",

      "Content": "Chief, Looks like you are recovering well, especially in the ED department! As I said before, for most, the JP drain stayed for only a couple of days and they usually took it out before we left the hospital. But no two of us are the same and it is better they err on the safe side and keep it in a little longer. As for bowel movement, did your doctor tell you to take a stool softener and prune juice to make sure you have \"smooth\" bowel movements so as not to strain your bladder and catheter? If not you should take them and make sure your stools are soft. As for the catheter, it is actually very simple to take it out, just drain the fluid and it will slide out easily. The other side (inside the bladder) of the catheter has a fluid fill (water) balloon that sits inside the bladder neck and prevent it from slipping out. Once you let out the fluid, it should slide out easily. However, it is advisable to let the nurse/doctor do it in their office so as to make sure there is no stricture or other complications. Usually they want you to empty your bladder (check stricture) and also check for incontinence before letting you go. And, for most of us the catheter stayed in for about a week as it usually took only a few days for the stitches connecting the urethra and bladder to heal. Good luck.",

If it was, say, G9, but it all came out, why would it matter? Is it just the concern that maybe a little bit escaped that we don't know about? A couple of comments: grade 4 is relevant because the higher the grade the higher the chance of microscopic escape (micro-metastasis), even with a clean pathology report. As far as pathology report, looks like it is all clean. The part about lymphatic vessel (not lymph nodes, just the ducts that carry the lymphatic fluids) is good, said they were free of cancer. He identified some fatty tissues that looked like a lymph node and it was also clean. Frankly I don't think your surgeon took out any lymph nodes and that was why the statement: cannot be assessed. Usually in a surgery, the surgeon will take out/clean some surrounding fatty tissues and the pathologist will read them. Did you have a JP drain? Usually with lymph nodes dissection, the surgeon had to install the JP drain to drain off excessive fluids. If not he most likely did not remove any nodes. Best wishes.",

However, that is probably not relavent as the early years' PSA were very stable so they should not be used. Starting 9/30/2008 @ a PSA of 2.4, PSA started to creep up, so I re-do the calculation starting from that PSA #, and the answer is: PSA doubling of ~3 years. AS can be a good option if you would like to consider AS. Hope that helps.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BeeMan Any advice about active surveillance vs. beginning a treatment plan for VERY EARLY stage prostate cancer? Age 65 when diagnosed (now 66). Gleason 6 (3 & 3) Last PSA: 6.44 last done on 9/10/2012 (every 3 months) PCA3 Neg (14.5) Biopsy: 1 (7%) core positive out of 12 Considering IMRT if treatment needed. BeeMan I agree with lancepeace, it is a very personal decision only you can make. However, your cancer appeared to be very early stage, so AS is a good option to consider for someone who is 66 years old. One piece of information missing from your posts is your PSA doubling time. You have been monitoring your PSA for sometime, if your PSA increase is slow, AS is an excellent choice, if it is fast, treatment is probably needed soon. For example, if the doubling time is 3-4 years, in 15-20 years, your PSA will be about 170. On the other hand, if PSA doubles every year, within 5 years your PSA will reach 170 meaning sooner or later you have to treat, in that case, the earlier you treat it the better the outcome. From your prostate volume, normal PSA should be around 3, so, it is possible your cancer is more extensive than indicated (read my signature, I had G6, 1 core positive 5%, after surgery, pathology indicated extensive cancer and some Grade 4 cancer inside). Read Dr. Walsh's book on treatment options, he discussed all the pros and cons. However, be aware he is biased toward treatment. He did say for folks older than 65 and slow growing cancer, AS is a good option. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by scratch The PSA screening is applied to all men over a certain age, and a good screening test should be sensitive so as to not miss many cancers and have enough specificity so minimize the amount of invasive testing. PSA does not do that very well but so far it is the best we have. Totally agree. There are some newer imaging techniques that may provide better diagnostics but only time will tell if they will be adopted. I think the good doctor Ablin said it correctly, PSA is a measure of risk. A low PSA (say 1) only means the risk of cancer maybe low and a high PSA (say 1000) only means the risk of cancer maybe higher. A good urologist will go through the process of elimination to arrive at an answer. If positive, then comes a process of assessing the risks of aggressiveness then and only then comes the decision of treatment and most of the time it is the individual (in the US anyway) who must decide. In the US, the number of prostate cancer death kept going down; in 1975 there were 31 death per 100,000 and in 2010 it went down to 21.8 death per 100,000 ~ 30% drop. If the death rate remained the same, there would have been 10,000 more men died of prostate cancer in 2010. Is it worth it? I frankly don't know if spending $3B to save 10,000 lives is a good deal.",

The answer is it depends, depends on the individual, on his age, etc., it depends very much on the skill of the surgeon. The results quoted by Dr. Walsh (open surgery) of his own patients: \"79% are wearing no pads at 3 months, 88% at 6 months and 98% at 12 months\". I don't think all surgeons can achieve those results but in my prostate cancer support group, very few has continence problem after one year. I was told robotic does not improve continence rate or continence recovery time.",

However, in many cases there were some fluids accompanying the orgasms that came from the Cowper's gland which was not removed.

I am very happy for you that your treatment is very successful and I agree today's radiation treatment is \"not your father's radiation treatment\". RW744, Reading your biopsy and diagnostic reports again, I see your cancer seemed to be pushing the edge (capsule), I would consult your doctor to see if that could be a risk factor for Cyberknife. A very precise beam is both good and bad. If the cancer is pushing the edge, there may be potential misses or damaging adjacent tissues (if the doctor is too aggressive with the beam coverage).

Usually recovery from ED takes longer. There were studies that indicated taking 5mg Cialis and pump helped with ED rehab so you should follow your doctor's instructions. Even though there were indications that cancer cells might have escaped the capsule, lets hope your surgeon had taken them all out by taking adjacent tissues out (that was how the pathologist noted microscopic cancer cells in surrounding tissues) .

      "Content": "I had surgery so do not have experience with Cyberknife. I believe it was FDA approved around 2001, about the same time robotic prostatectomy got popular so there are really not enough very long term study on either. Based on what I read, it should be as good as any other forms of modern radiation treatment. To shorten treatment time and because it is a very precise beam, the radiation is quite intense. As a result if a mistake is made (misalignment for example), the side effect can be severe. So, make sure your Cyberknife team is very experience. Good luck and happy new year.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BeeMan Any advice about active surveillance vs. beginning a treatment plan for VERY EARLY stage prostate cancer? Age 65 when diagnosed (now 66). Gleason 6 (3 & 3) Last PSA: 6.44 last done on 9/10/2012 (every 3 months) PCA3 Neg (14.5) Biopsy: 1 (7%) core positive out of 12 Considering IMRT if treatment needed. BeeMan I agree with lancepeace, it is a very personal decision only you can make. However, your cancer appeared to be very early stage, so AS is a good option to consider for someone who is 66 years old. One piece of information missing from your posts is your PSA doubling time. You have been monitoring your PSA for sometime, if your PSA increase is slow, AS is an excellent choice, if it is fast, treatment is probably needed soon. For example, if the doubling time is 3-4 years, in 15-20 years, your PSA will be about 170. On the other hand, if PSA doubles every year, within 5 years your PSA will reach 170 meaning sooner or later you have to treat, in that case, the earlier you treat it the better the outcome. From your prostate volume, normal PSA should be around 3, so, it is possible your cancer is more extensive than indicated (read my signature, I had G6, 1 core positive 5%, after surgery, pathology indicated extensive cancer and some Grade 4 cancer inside). Read Dr. Walsh's book on treatment options, he discussed all the pros and cons. However, be aware he is biased toward treatment. He did say for folks older than 65 and slow growing cancer, AS is a good option. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Welcome. Based on your signature and introductions, you are a very good candidate for AS. However, if you choose that route, make sure to have a second read of your biopsy slides by another pathologist, e.g. send them to Johns Hopkins to make sure the G3+3 stays 3+3. One issue with AS is while on it, most likely your doctor won't prescribe TRT and your \"energy level\" will continue to remain low during this time. With treatment, after your PSA becomes undetectable, your doctor might restart TRT to improve your \"energy level\". If you choose treatment, with your stats, all the treatment options including surgery are good and what you choose is mostly your preference and your doctor's recommendation. Good luck.",

In the hands of an inexperience group, mistakes can often happen and with radiation there is no do over and the damages will not be apparent until it is too late. So, if I were you I would go with a center where there are lot of patients and the radiation oncologists and radiation techs are well trained. You see, how they map the site, where to aim, dosage to where/which... all need to be determined by the radiation oncologist and each and every oncologist can interpret differently. Good luck.",

So it is accelerating meaning there is cause for concern especially since recent MRI indicated cancer in both sides of your prostate now. However, before you decide to remove your prostate, you should get a second opinion and read up on the consequences, risks and side effects of prostatectomy, how to select a surgeon and investigate other treatment options like seeds or radiation. And if you plan on having kids later, bank your sperms. Good luck and best wishes",

It is a double blind test with the endpoint of cancer progression. The outcome was that if you were on AS and took Deutasteride, you had a 38% chance of progression at 3 years and those that took placebo had a 48% chance of progression at 3 years. There were no mention of the aggressiveness of cancers detected at progression. A second clinical trial from Canada found only 18% progressed to treatment for the Deutasteride group vs 38% for the placebo group but again, they were silent on the aggressiveness of the cancer at time of progression: http://www.onclive.com/publications/...e-Surveillance I am happy that Deutasteride helped reduced the incidences of cancer progression for folks on AS but am disappointed both trials remained silent and did not report the aggressiveness of the cancer at progression. So, to me the issue of aggressive cancer incidences from the PCPT and REDUCE trials remains a question mark. Readers should draw their own conclusions on this issue.",

This is not as serious as state IIIc in breast cancer. First order of business for you and your husband is to obtain a copy of his pathology report and get a better understanding of the outcome. But from what you stated from the surgeon's comment, it is actually very good: Only 15% of the gland is cancerous so it is quite an early stage. She said there were clear margins (I assumed she meant negative margins, meaning she cut outside of the capsule so she got all of the cancers out). As for perineural invasion, I had that too and did quite a bit of research to see if that should be a concern. I found a number of studies indicating it not to be a predictor of recurrence. All in all, a good outcome, so please focus on healing and just watch his psa periodically. By the way, my wife is also a breast cancer survivor. She was stage III with lymph nodes involvement. She is cancer free for 12 years now. Good luck and best wishes to both of you.",

      "Content": "Dr. Albin made several comments in the interview. Let me summarize some of his comments that are of interest to me: 1. He was against mass PSA testing. He did admit that though PSA did not detect cancer it was a \"measure of risk\" of prostate cancer. 2. PSA was first approved by the FDA for detecting prostate cancer recurrence after treatment in 1986 but was rapidly used off label for prostate cancer detection. 3. FDA officially approved its use for mass detections in 1994 and the rest is history. He was pessimistic and very discouraged that his invention was \"wrongly\" used and that PSA should not be use for detection as he cited that of men between 60-69, 65% had prostate cancer but most were not aggressive. To me the statement that PSA is a \"measure of risk\" is a true representation of the value of the test. It must be and are always followed up with more definitive tests like biopsy, etc. No one in my recollection solely used PSA as a detection tool to treat prostate cancer. The other significant fact is that the majority of men over 60 probably has some prostate cancer in his body and the key is to determine who are likely to have the aggressive types and need to be treated. Otherwise over treatment is inevitable. This led to the USPSTF's position that no men should take PSA test unless there was evidence that it was needed. So, we are really on our own to determine whether we should be treated once we have tested positive for cancer, and it is especially true for the G6 types which many stated should not be treated and AS is appropriate not withstanding that many G6 turned out to be G7 and higher after final pathology report. I like to present some interesting statistics from the National Cancer Institute's SEEER data: 1. Let's compare prostate cancer 5 year relative survival: In 1975 it was 69.2% by 2001-2007 it was 99.4% that means in 1975 if you were diagnosed, the chance of dying within 5 years of detection was very high and in 2001-2007 it was very low. 2. In the 2001-2007 time frame, if you were detected when the cancer was localized, the 5 year survival was virtually 100% but if it was metastasized, even with modern treatment protocol, the 5 year survival was only 28.7%. As a matter of comparison, today, the overall 5 year relative survival of colorectal cancer was 64.7%, i.e., metastasized prostate cancer is much worst than colorectal cancer. 3. If I extrapolate the 2001-2007 data back to 1975, it means in 1975, before PSA, 40% of those detected in 1975 had metastasized cancer by the time cancer was detected. In 2001-2007 that number was 4%! 4. Comparing 1975 and today, the number detected per 100,000 remained about the same which means we are not really getting more detections, just that we are detecting them early giving many patients the opportunity to fully recover instead of too late and cancer metastasized. 5. What was more telling was also today, the worst survival age group was actually those under 45 years of age: 96.4% vs 99.5% for those over 65. I think that is because they represented the group least likely to be given PSA tests. Most doctors won't request PSA tests unless you are over 50. My opinion is that if we get rid of PSA testing without a better replacement, we are doing a great disservice to prostate cancer patients.",

      "Content": "Dr. Albin made several comments in the interview. Let me summarize some of his comments that are of interest to me: 1. He was against mass PSA testing. He did admit that though PSA did not detect cancer it was a \"measure of risk\" of prostate cancer. 2. PSA was first approved by the FDA for detecting prostate cancer recurrence after treatment in 1986 but was rapidly used off label for prostate cancer detection. 3. FDA officially approved its use for mass detections in 1994 and the rest is history. He was pessimistic and very discouraged that his invention was \"wrongly\" used and that PSA should not be use for detection as he cited that of men between 60-69, 65% had prostate cancer but most were not aggressive. To me the statement that PSA is a \"measure of risk\" is a true representation of the value of the test. It must be and are always followed up with more definitive tests like biopsy, etc. No one in my recollection solely used PSA as a detection tool to treat prostate cancer. The other significant fact is that the majority of men over 60 probably has some prostate cancer in his body and the key is to determine who are likely to have the aggressive types and need to be treated. Otherwise over treatment is inevitable. This led to the USPSTF's position that no men should take PSA test unless there was evidence that it was needed. So, we are really on our own to determine whether we should be treated once we have tested positive for cancer, and it is especially true for the G6 types which many stated should not be treated and AS is appropriate not withstanding that many G6 turned out to be G7 and higher after final pathology report. I like to present some interesting statistics from the National Cancer Institute's SEEER data: 1. Let's compare prostate cancer 5 year relative survival: In 1975 it was 69.2% by 2001-2007 it was 99.4% that means in 1975 if you were diagnosed, the chance of dying within 5 years of detection was very high and in 2001-2007 it was very low. 2. In the 2001-2007 time frame, if you were detected when the cancer was localized, the 5 year survival was virtually 100% but if it was metastasized, even with modern treatment protocol, the 5 year survival was only 28.7%. As a matter of comparison, today, the overall 5 year relative survival of colorectal cancer was 64.7%, i.e., metastasized prostate cancer is much worst than colorectal cancer. 3. If I extrapolate the 2001-2007 data back to 1975, it means in 1975, before PSA, 40% of those detected in 1975 had metastasized cancer by the time cancer was detected. In 2001-2007 that number was 4%! 4. Comparing 1975 and today, the number detected per 100,000 remained about the same which means we are not really getting more detections, just that we are detecting them early giving many patients the opportunity to fully recover instead of too late and cancer metastasized. 5. What was more telling was also today, the worst survival age group was actually those under 45 years of age: 96.4% vs 99.5% for those over 65. I think that is because they represented the group least likely to be given PSA tests. Most doctors won't request PSA tests unless you are over 50. My opinion is that if we get rid of PSA testing without a better replacement, we are doing a great disservice to prostate cancer patients.",

Perineural Invasion means the cancer appeared to spread to the space surrounding the nerves. If they were found around nerves outside the capsule it is not good. If found only within the prostate, some believed it was easier for cancer cells to follow those nerves out of the capsule and invaded other sites. However, a number of studies indicated no correlation between PNI and recurrence.",

I second what njs said as you have an aggressive case and selecting the right physician and right treatment plan are important to maximize your chance of success. Sloan is one of the top cancer centers in the east coast and you won't go wrong going there. However, there are brilliant individual practitioners around you who might be as good and you might feel more comfortable with them. So research and interview a few more before you decide. Perhaps you should also use njs' criteria and questions while you interview the physicians. Finally as Fran said, get Dr. Walsh's book, read and study it to gain as much knowledge as you can about your disease. It might be depressing to read but can help you formulate your plan of attack. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by BeeMan Any advice about active surveillance vs. beginning a treatment plan for VERY EARLY stage prostate cancer? Age 65 when diagnosed (now 66). Gleason 6 (3 & 3) Last PSA: 6.44 last done on 9/10/2012 (every 3 months) PCA3 Neg (14.5) Biopsy: 1 (7%) core positive out of 12 Considering IMRT if treatment needed. BeeMan I agree with lancepeace, it is a very personal decision only you can make. However, your cancer appeared to be very early stage, so AS is a good option to consider for someone who is 66 years old. One piece of information missing from your posts is your PSA doubling time. You have been monitoring your PSA for sometime, if your PSA increase is slow, AS is an excellent choice, if it is fast, treatment is probably needed soon. For example, if the doubling time is 3-4 years, in 15-20 years, your PSA will be about 170. On the other hand, if PSA doubles every year, within 5 years your PSA will reach 170 meaning sooner or later you have to treat, in that case, the earlier you treat it the better the outcome. From your prostate volume, normal PSA should be around 3, so, it is possible your cancer is more extensive than indicated (read my signature, I had G6, 1 core positive 5%, after surgery, pathology indicated extensive cancer and some Grade 4 cancer inside). Read Dr. Walsh's book on treatment options, he discussed all the pros and cons. However, be aware he is biased toward treatment. He did say for folks older than 65 and slow growing cancer, AS is a good option. Good luck and best wishes.",

Starting 9/30/2008 @ a PSA of 2.4, PSA started to creep up, so I re-do the calculation starting from that PSA #, and the answer is: PSA doubling of ~3 years.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by scratch The PSA screening is applied to all men over a certain age, and a good screening test should be sensitive so as to not miss many cancers and have enough specificity so minimize the amount of invasive testing. PSA does not do that very well but so far it is the best we have. Totally agree. There are some newer imaging techniques that may provide better diagnostics but only time will tell if they will be adopted. I think the good doctor Ablin said it correctly, PSA is a measure of risk. A low PSA (say 1) only means the risk of cancer maybe low and a high PSA (say 1000) only means the risk of cancer maybe higher. A good urologist will go through the process of elimination to arrive at an answer. If positive, then comes a process of assessing the risks of aggressiveness then and only then comes the decision of treatment and most of the time it is the individual (in the US anyway) who must decide. In the US, the number of prostate cancer death kept going down; in 1975 there were 31 death per 100,000 and in 2010 it went down to 21.8 death per 100,000 ~ 30% drop. If the death rate remained the same, there would have been 10,000 more men died of prostate cancer in 2010. Is it worth it? I frankly don't know if spending $3B to save 10,000 lives is a good deal.",

I believe it was FDA approved around 2001, about the same time robotic prostatectomy got popular so there are really not enough very long term study on either. Based on what I read, it should be as good as any other forms of modern radiation treatment. To shorten treatment time and because it is a very precise beam, the radiation is quite intense. As a result if a mistake is made (misalignment for example), the side effect can be severe. So, make sure your Cyberknife team is very experience. Good luck and happy new year.",

Another factor is you could have a weaken immune system after surgery which put you at risk so you may want to ask your doctor to check your immune system.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by glock19 I'm 9 days post op from RALP. 5 of the 6 openings are healing nicely. They used a lot of glue and strips. However, the top incision (think it's the one used for the CO2) keeps opening and leaking fluid. That was the one opening that didn't show any residual glue or tape. There is still quite a bit of swelling behind that point. I mentioned it at my post op visit and was told everything was healing nicely. It almost looks like a hernia has developed at that point. I say this because I had a hernia repaired w/ mesh about 15 years ago and that's very close to the bottom edge of the mesh. Just wondering if anyone else has experience this kind of leakage and what outcome did you have. Since he took out some lymph nodes, that \"hole\" that was not taped/glued could be where the JP drain came out of. If that is the case, some drainage at this stage could be quite normal. If you still worry, wait a few more days and if it does not stop, call your physician again to see if something can be done to speed up the healing. Best wishes.",

I have read about trials combining Samarium with other treatments and got improved results, so I am happy to see your physician gave you the combinations. If this combinations work, I wonder if Alpharadin (assume it gets approved next year) in combination with other treatments might work even better? Alpharadin emits alpha particles, which is short range and should work better than Samarium which emits beta particles. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Interesting replies.. So, someone with a Gleason 6 (or a 3+4) should really check where the positive core(s) are located. If they are on the outer edge of the prostate, or at the Apex, that is something to consider before deciding on \"active surveillance\"..... And, if positive core is by the bladder neck, that could be a data point to be considered as part of the radiation-vs-surgery decision. (I hope I got this right) Would really be interesting for everyone to ask their urologist/radiologist about this... Remember, this is just one man's opinion and a non medical one, just your typical engineer's \"logic\". A real life case: No family history, slow rise in PSA to 4.5 last year. dx with 3 cores G6 <5% each core, all in the middle. Urologist said probable indolence and he chose AS. Fast forward a year, G6 -> one G3+4 and now 6 cores positive with two near the bladder. Surgery, found evidence of bladder neck invasion and was forced to cut deep there. Post Op: Bad incontinence, cancer extensive, positive margins at bladder neck and several places. One lymph node positive (1 mm), Gleason is now G4+3. Cancer is now metastasized. We will never know if his cancer was organ confined a year ago but we could speculate that surgery or radiation a year ago probably would produce better outcome. My own case was similar except I did not choose AS. Good luck to you.",

Drug companies also charge many times more for the same cancer drugs in the US as compare to Canada or UK for example. Patients without insurance and has to pay out of pocket are often time better off get treatments from other countries like Singapore, Taiwan or Korea where medical facilities are as good but cost 10 times less. When my HMO refused to allow me to select the surgeon I wanted, I was going to pay out of pocket until I found out that the hospital would charge me $100K for a Da Vinci. I fortunately could change my insurance to use the same hospital and same surgeon (who by the way would charge me the same without insurance as he would charge the insurance carriers) with a final bill of $15K.

I second what njs said as you have an aggressive case and selecting the right physician and right treatment plan are important to maximize your chance of success. Sloan is one of the top cancer centers in the east coast and you won't go wrong going there. However, there are brilliant individual practitioners around you who might be as good and you might feel more comfortable with them. So research and interview a few more before you decide. Perhaps you should also use njs' criteria and questions while you interview the physicians. Finally as Fran said, get Dr. Walsh's book, read and study it to gain as much knowledge as you can about your disease. It might be depressing to read but can help you formulate your plan of attack. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by n2hawgs Within the past couple days, I found out I have prostate cancer and all my details. Most biopsies are fully involved with high Gleason. Scans were negative but it is an aggressive cancer. I am just looking for others experiences and information. I have read many posts and found them very helpful. Thanks for help! n2hawgs n2hawgs, Sorry you are here but welcome to the club no one wants to join. Normally, we advice folks to take their time to understand what is going on and then carefully choose their treatment path from a large number of options. Here, because of the aggressive nature of your biopsy results, I would advise you to move quickly while that is still a chance of a cure - before the cancer escapes the prostate. Speaking as a layperson, I waited 8 weeks from biopsy to surgery but if I had your biopsy results, I would not have waited and would choose radiation plus hormone as my first line of treatment right away. However, that is just me and not a professional opinion, so please consult your physicians. You are very fortunate to have your cancer detected now instead of later when symptoms appear, so your cancer may still be organ confined. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ddayglo Interesting replies.. So, someone with a Gleason 6 (or a 3+4) should really check where the positive core(s) are located. If they are on the outer edge of the prostate, or at the Apex, that is something to consider before deciding on \"active surveillance\"..... And, if positive core is by the bladder neck, that could be a data point to be considered as part of the radiation-vs-surgery decision. (I hope I got this right) Would really be interesting for everyone to ask their urologist/radiologist about this... Remember, this is just one man's opinion and a non medical one, just your typical engineer's \"logic\". A real life case: No family history, slow rise in PSA to 4.5 last year. dx with 3 cores G6 <5% each core, all in the middle. Urologist said probable indolence and he chose AS. Fast forward a year, G6 -> one G3+4 and now 6 cores positive with two near the bladder. Surgery, found evidence of bladder neck invasion and was forced to cut deep there. Post Op: Bad incontinence, cancer extensive, positive margins at bladder neck and several places. One lymph node positive (1 mm), Gleason is now G4+3. Cancer is now metastasized. We will never know if his cancer was organ confined a year ago but we could speculate that surgery or radiation a year ago probably would produce better outcome. My own case was similar except I did not choose AS. Good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Welcome but I am sorry you are joining our club. A Gleason (3+4) is very different from a Gleason (4+3). The Gleason score is a combination of two Gleason grades, first one identifies the predominant cancer type and the second the next most common type. Gleason grades run from 1 to 5, 5 being the most aggressive. If your physician said the more aggressive end he might mean a G(4+3). You did not say what your PSA was. If you have very high PSA, say >20, hormones, radiation & seeds is probably a better choice as high PSA indicates a higher probability of cancer growing outside the prostate and radiation will catch them if they are still in the prostate bed, otherwise either of them are good options. In these day and age, it is what you are comfortable with more than which one is better. I selected surgery because I was physically fit with no other health issues and was more comfortable with \"getting them out\" than \"zapping them inside\". And by the way, either way you choose, the most important thing is to find a physician that has done at least >250 surgery (or seeds) as skills/experiences trump everything. You should read the book by Dr. Patrick Walsh on \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" and then you will be able to make an informed decision. Good luck.",

      "Content": "A couple of comments: 1. Fairwind made an excellent point, in a standard radiation treatment, PSA does not go to undetectable immediately so your .02 PSA is most likely caused by the hormone. However, if hormone is what caused the PSA to be undetectable, then from what I read and from many of the posts here, PSA should stay low for some time and not rising immediately after it stops. Maybe you stopped too soon? 2. Most of the literatures I read about adjuvant hormone in radiation treatment started with hormone prior to radiation and usually continued for 6, 12 to 18 months after radiation. To stop right after radiation seemed unusual? 3. If you did not have adjuvant hormone therapy, PSA usually drops slowly and won't reach nadir for sometime, perhaps 12 to 24 months. So, my recommendation is to seek another opinion or perhaps get back to hormone. Best wishes.",

Normally, we advice folks to take their time to understand what is going on and then carefully choose their treatment path from a large number of options. Here, because of the aggressive nature of your biopsy results, I would advise you to move quickly while that is still a chance of a cure - before the cancer escapes the prostate. Speaking as a layperson, I waited 8 weeks from biopsy to surgery but if I had your biopsy results, I would not have waited and would choose radiation plus hormone as my first line of treatment right away. However, that is just me and not a professional opinion, so please consult your physicians. You are very fortunate to have your cancer detected now instead of later when symptoms appear, so your cancer may still be organ confined. Good luck.",

      "Content": "bigbrad2008, Appreciate your comments. Actually, I found 7 Phase III randomized controlled trials addressing the role of adjuvant ADT with radiation for high risk patients. All showed survival benefits for ADT. In addition, some addressed durations of ADT ranged from 4 months to three years. Better survivals were recorded for longer duration ADT. Up until recently, the standard for ADT duration seemed to be 36 months but in a more recent Canadian Phase III trial, the outcome indicated the 36 months could be reduced to 18 months without any increase in mortality. If you are not in the high risk category, then perhaps the duration can be shorter. I am not a doctor, just reporting from what I read. Please consult your oncologist for better clarity. Best wishes.",

But, intuitively, I don't see how having combined external radiation and HDRT would change the conclusion of the length of ADT treatment and from a risk/reward point of view, a few more months' ADT may not be that bad? However, you know your body and did more researches than I so you know better. Another point, the increases in PSA after you stopped ADT could be a normal timeline of radiation treatment as most reports said you won't reach nadir for up to 12-24 months.

      "Content": "Jim is a straight shooter and is usually blunt but gave very good advice. Here are some comments from me: Your prostate is large but not huge and the PSA # is consistent with a 68 cc prostate but with suspicious MRI and DRE a biopsy is a reasonable next step. Taking Cardura and Avodart since mid-July, currently with good success. Flow is better than its been in many years. That is great but you may want to discuss with your urologist this FDA warning label on a class of drugs call 5-ARI which Avodart belongs. I know many urologist disagree with the FDA and I really don't know who is right but it is better safe than sorry. http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/S.../ucm258529.htm Unfortunately, the machine was a Siemens 1.5T (and not a 3T) but (thankfully) no ERC was used. You should have asked for the ERC. Though unpleasant it increases the resolutions quite a bit and is almost as good as having the 3T without ERC. The radiologist said findings were compatible with BPH and a PI-RAD score of 2 for the transition zone. However, there was a small focal abnormal signal intensity in the left lateral peripheral zone measuring 1.0x0.6cm, compatible with a PI-RAD 3 lesion. The lesion was mapped for a potential fusion biopsy. (The radiologist notes that this suspicious area is only seen on a single image and no discrete lesion is visible on post-contrast images.) Like Jim if it were me I would go ahead and do a biopsy. But it is a non professional opinion. Good luck and best to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by northrancher I have a few numbers that I hope will be useful in getting input from the group: PSA: 9 Biopsy: positive; two nodules, one on each side Gleason: 7 (3+4) Grade: T2C Number of positive cores: 11 out of 12 Thanks in advance for your help. You should try to get the full biopsy report and read it. There should be more information on the report. For example, the size of his prostate, the detail of the 11 positive cores (e.g., % cancer, Gx+y for each core), whether there are indications of seminal vesicle involvement, whether there are EPE (extraprostatic extension) etc. It maybe counter intuitive but a large number of positive cores in this case is good news as it is consistent with a PSA of 9 and so hopefully cancer is organ confined. If you look at my case, I had a PSA of 10.7 but only 1 core <5% positive. I worried my cancer was systemic but fortunately post op they found lots of cancer all over but within the prostate which explained the PSA of 10.7. Good luck.",

      "Content": "bigbrad2008, Appreciate your comments. Actually, I found 7 Phase III randomized controlled trials addressing the role of adjuvant ADT with radiation for high risk patients. All showed survival benefits for ADT. In addition, some addressed durations of ADT ranged from 4 months to three years. Better survivals were recorded for longer duration ADT. Up until recently, the standard for ADT duration seemed to be 36 months but in a more recent Canadian Phase III trial, the outcome indicated the 36 months could be reduced to 18 months without any increase in mortality. If you are not in the high risk category, then perhaps the duration can be shorter. I am not a doctor, just reporting from what I read. Please consult your oncologist for better clarity. Best wishes.",

Walt, not trying to argue with you but I can find many many articles that demonstrated testosterone is the main source to provide growth for prostate cancer. Dr. Charles Higgins won the 1966 Nobel Prize for demonstrating that depriving prostate cancer cells of hormone (testosterone) will stop the cancer growth. In fact castration (either surgically or chemically) will stop the growth and kill off non CRPC, whether they are G6 or G10. So, unless I am absolutely sure I am free of prostate cancer, I would be very cautious about using TRT.",

However, it sometimes could be infection or inflammation so the doctor could give him a course of antibiotics to see if PSA will drop. I remember one of the posters here had a PSA of ~100 which turned out to be infection and not cancer. However, if it persists, a biopsy is usually the next step. Let's hope it is not cancer and he need not join our club. Good luck to him.",

Your cancer is the \"garden variety\" adenocarcinoma, G(3+4) which is less aggressive than a G(4+3). With your PSA of 5.3, your cancer is most likely confined within the prostate and you have an excellent chance of cancer free after treatment, whether you choose surgery or radiation. With your #, you do have to seek treatment and cannot practice Active Surveillance. I know what I would do if I were you but you are the one that have to decide for yourself. Welcome to the twilight zone of prostate cancer treatment. Peace be with you and have yourself a good holiday.",

What about killing metasthases?? please help!!! When you said bowel are you referring to the rectum? The prostate is very close to the rectum wall, so it is one of the common metastasis sites. If your partner truly has metastatic prostate cancer and is having pain, he needs to get hormone treatment immediately if he has not already done so. Hormone will shrink the cancer and relieve pain, especially bone pain. For many, the pain went away after hormone treatment. Of course hormone treatment is not a cure as the cancer will eventually come back but for many it takes years or even decades before that happens. If he has not done so, he should consult a prostate cancer oncologist. Best of luck.",

Walt, not trying to argue with you but I can find many many articles that demonstrated testosterone is the main source to provide growth for prostate cancer. Dr. Charles Higgins won the 1966 Nobel Prize for demonstrating that depriving prostate cancer cells of hormone (testosterone) will stop the cancer growth. In fact castration (either surgically or chemically) will stop the growth and kill off non CRPC, whether they are G6 or G10. So, unless I am absolutely sure I am free of prostate cancer, I would be very cautious about using TRT.",

      "Content": "Carol, Let me give you a rather lengthy response as this is a hotly discussed topic here. This topic was discussed in a few threads recently and there were two schools of thoughts. One cited studies that indicated AS for low risk cases did not result in higher mortality. Both Johns Hopkins and UC San Francisco conducted clinical trials on this. The other point of view were from some of us who believed we were individuals and not statistics; and how could we make sure we were not at the 3-sigma (outliers) statistical distribution and how could we be sure since the diagnostics were not 100% definitive or correct. So, we would rather have treatments early. Of course the problem is treatments have their own risks and side effects so often you are trading peace of mind for side effects. I am still in the early treatment camp. Please note that I am a layperson and I do not have direct statistical studies to back me up. General survival statistics (from SEER) that I studied seemed to favor early treatment but they were not clinical trial results so it was not clear what were the underlaying causes. There were a few posters here discussing and practicing AS and seemed to be doing fine. In that regard, your love one's stats indicated AS is a good option irregardless of his age. You and him should study the options carefully, seek out advices from physicians from both camps and make your own decision. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by northrancher I have a few numbers that I hope will be useful in getting input from the group: PSA: 9 Biopsy: positive; two nodules, one on each side Gleason: 7 (3+4) Grade: T2C Number of positive cores: 11 out of 12 Thanks in advance for your help. You should try to get the full biopsy report and read it. There should be more information on the report. For example, the size of his prostate, the detail of the 11 positive cores (e.g., % cancer, Gx+y for each core), whether there are indications of seminal vesicle involvement, whether there are EPE (extraprostatic extension) etc. It maybe counter intuitive but a large number of positive cores in this case is good news as it is consistent with a PSA of 9 and so hopefully cancer is organ confined. If you look at my case, I had a PSA of 10.7 but only 1 core <5% positive. I worried my cancer was systemic but fortunately post op they found lots of cancer all over but within the prostate which explained the PSA of 10.7. Good luck.",

Thank you If the PSA came back from 0.0 while you were still on Eligard, then, likely you have a recurrence. If the PSA came back after you stopped Eligard for some time, there is a chance your PSA of 0.05 could be due to radiation PSA bounce. In any case most likely your oncologist will demand at least another PSA test to confirm the results. Discuss with your oncologist and research treatment options are perhaps your best path going forward for now: Preparing for the worst and hope for the best. Regards,",

One option for him is to do a combined hormone and radiotherapy to keep his cancer at bay. Studies showed this to be the most effective treatment after a failed surgery. Most folks with his statistics should easily be around for years. He should has time to see his daughter graduate from college and getting married. Tell him to stay positive. Best of luck to you and your brother.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Actually, I believe it is very unlikely that PC would spread to the rectum or the bowel. Here is a link to one article I just found on Google that discusses one particular case: http://www.wjso.com/content/9/1/56 HighlanderCFH, You are correct that normally PC does not spread to the rectum. Your article described one case where it did so it does happen. I think whether it does or not depends on the location and aggressiveness of the cancer . The prostate sits next to the rectum at the back so if the cancer is near the capsule wall next to the rectum, it can spread to the rectum. The poster already stated the partner has metastasized prostate cancer spread to the bones and \"bowel\" so I assumed it did attack the rectum. In any case, it is important he seeks treatment/hormone or other means ASAP to shrink the cancer and relieve the pain. From the post, he may not be living at a place where oncological help is available if so it is important he goes to a place where a competent oncologist can provide care. Best wishes and peace.",

Good to know that there are still many treatments out there if it ends up being in this stage of cancer. He really had no known health issues and had regular check-ups. Odds are in his favor that he will not die of prostate cancer, so relax, go through the process and then decide what to do. For a 85 year old, Active Surveillance is a very viable option.

      "Content": "Jim is a straight shooter and is usually blunt but gave very good advice. Here are some comments from me: Your prostate is large but not huge and the PSA # is consistent with a 68 cc prostate but with suspicious MRI and DRE a biopsy is a reasonable next step. Taking Cardura and Avodart since mid-July, currently with good success. Flow is better than its been in many years. That is great but you may want to discuss with your urologist this FDA warning label on a class of drugs call 5-ARI which Avodart belongs. I know many urologist disagree with the FDA and I really don't know who is right but it is better safe than sorry. http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/S.../ucm258529.htm Unfortunately, the machine was a Siemens 1.5T (and not a 3T) but (thankfully) no ERC was used. You should have asked for the ERC. Though unpleasant it increases the resolutions quite a bit and is almost as good as having the 3T without ERC. The radiologist said findings were compatible with BPH and a PI-RAD score of 2 for the transition zone. However, there was a small focal abnormal signal intensity in the left lateral peripheral zone measuring 1.0x0.6cm, compatible with a PI-RAD 3 lesion. The lesion was mapped for a potential fusion biopsy. (The radiologist notes that this suspicious area is only seen on a single image and no discrete lesion is visible on post-contrast images.) Like Jim if it were me I would go ahead and do a biopsy. But it is a non professional opinion. Good luck and best to you.",

      "Content": "For some reason I could not respond to your post over there, so let me answer it here: I want to emphasize this is just a layperson's interpretation and I maybe all wrong. Starting with the most important, One of three lymph nodes was positive This trumps the negative margins. I assumed the one positive node is the first sentinel node. I assumed the surgeon stopped at three since the following two were clean otherwise many more nodes would have been removed. The cancer already spread. This is an invasive ductal carcinoma, NOS with a micropapillary component. Tumor emboli show micropapillary features and involve small and larger lymphovascular spaces in the peritumoral area and well away from the main mass, they are also seen very close to multiple resection margins and transected at the posterior and the revised inferior margins IDC, NOS is the most common form of breast cancer (like adenocarcinoma in prostate cancer), survival rate is very high. However, the micropapillary component is a more aggressive feature so is not as good. Also, the lymphovascular involvement means the cancer is growing inside the lymphatic vessels so the risk of spread outside is high (e.g. to the lymph nodes). They are also very close to the margins meaning microscopic cancer cells could be outside. All in all I think she needs additional treatments like chemo and possibly radiation to the breast and surrounding area, and if her genetic make up is correct, she could take tamoxifen to further reduce her risk of recurrence. Don't panic, folks I know who had similar pathology went through the multiple treatments and are doing very well after many years. Good luck.",

You have plenty of time to watch and monitor to see if your cancer is indolent and if so no treatment is needed. You also want to get a couple of books , e.g., Dr. Walsh's book, on prostate cancer to gain some additional insights so you will become an informed patient. The other thing you should do is to send the biopsy slides to a prominent lab, e.g. Johns Hopkins, for a second opinion since the G(3+3) is often the judgement of the pathologist who examined your slides.

However, it sometimes could be infection or inflammation so the doctor could give him a course of antibiotics to see if PSA will drop. I remember one of the posters here had a PSA of ~100 which turned out to be infection and not cancer. However, if it persists, a biopsy is usually the next step. Let's hope it is not cancer and he need not join our club. Good luck to him.",

Plan for the worst but hope for the best. Don't know what your pre-op PSA was, but if it was less than 10-20, at 6 week PSA should be undetectable. So, yes, you should start looking for plan B but do not pull the trigger until after another PSA confirmation test at 12 weeks. Suggest you make an appointment to see a rad oncologist and an oncologist to see what options you have going forward if plan B is needed. With a G9 and positive seminal vesicle invasion, if cancer is outside, you want to get a jump on the cancer ASAP. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the article. Perhaps that is why some prostate cancers are indolent and some are not - those that have the SPDEF gene are indolent, independent of their G scores. Unfortunately, knowing why is just a first small step. From discovery to treatment is a long road, first, other scientists have to be able to duplicate the results, publish the results through peer review papers, then someone will have to find how to correct this condition and then get a treatment methodology establish. Then go on phase I, phase II and finally phase III clinical trial and then apply for FDA approval... Each of the steps takes time even if they fast track the process. So we could be talking about a decade at least. But there is hope and why we need to hang on for as long as possible for new treatments to come our way.",

      "Content": "Look at it this way: Cancer already spread to one node, so even if the margins of the lumpectomy are clear, likely there are microscopic cancers within the breast (with the other features indicated), so radiation is a must to mop-up those. If one node is involved cancer is likely outside and in the lymphatic fluids so chemo is necessary. We can imagine a scenario that the only cancer is contained within the lumpectomy and only got into one node and nowhere else so no other treatment is needed. But we don't know and the probability seems low to me and to based treatment on that scenario is risky. My opinion is, instead, think of the best treatment options to get a cure based on the worst case scenario. And that is achievable in her case! Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hey SW! Looks like Oshguy has provided an excellent opinion about your recent #s to which I fully concur. Re: \"however, i noticed there were three areas that were out of range:\" MCH was 26.9 Ref Range = 26.6 - 33.0 PG Yours is in range MCHC was 31.3 Ref Range = 31.5 - 35.7 g/dl Yours is barely below RDW was 15.9 Ref Range = 12.3 - 15.4% Yours is slightly above 2 of these are just slightly out of range and would not concern me in the least. Definitely ask your MD about these at your upcoming appointment. Meanwhile, make a running list of questions and get them answered. On that question list be sure to ask: \"How often should I monitor my PSA?\" Also, I suggest again that you get a copy of the actual pathology lab report from your biopsy and keep it for your records. The last time we communicated, your Urologist sent you his written interpretation of the lab report but not the actual lab report. Good luck SW! In my \"non medical expert\" opinion, I believe that you have had a scare but most likely do not have PC and should not be worrying about it. Simply stay vigilant. If me, I would be inclined to monitor my PSA again in 3 / 9 / 18 months. Hope your PSA returns to the normal range quickly and all of your urologic issues resolve permanently! Keep us updated! MF +1 Good luck SW.",

      "Content": "I am posting this as my understanding of a confusing subject and not to stir up debate so please don't get mad at me. Many of the new comers had not read some of the prior posts on PSA half life discussions so let me summarize it here; 1. Half life is defined as the time for the PSA in the body (measured as blood PSA) to reduce by half if there is no new replenishment from the prostate. 2. My research notes indicated typical half life is between 2 to 3 days. One example of the studies: Serum half-life time determination of free and total prostate-specific antigen following radical prostatectomy\u2014a critical assessment Edgar Brändle, Oliver Hautmann, Max Bachem, Klaus Kleinschmidt, Hans Werner Gottfried, Adolf Grünert, Richard E Hautmann Department of Urology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany; Department of Clinical Chemistry, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany Urology (Impact Factor: 2.42). 05/1999; DOI:10.1016/S0090-4295-98-00593-7 3. The finding by these guys was a half life of 2.7 days. 4. Using 3 days as half life, for someone with a pre-op PSA of 10, at 6 weeks (42 days) post-op his PSA should be down to 10/2^14, or ~.0006. Using 2 days as half life, the 6 week PSA should be ~.000005. In both cases, PSA is undetectable. 5. Many urologists (mine included) wanted to get a jump in case surgery failed and thus advocated a 6 week test, others thought it did not matter and op for 3 months. 6. A detectable PSA does not mean failed surgery. There were many cases where some benign prostate tissues were left behind and they never caused BCR (I remembered one poster here had that happened to him). Small detectable PSA could also mean a little cancer cells were left behind locally and SRT should take care of that (many here had successful SRT) and jkeyt might be in either category. Best wishes to all.",

From 11/2014 to 9/2015 was only 10 months and for prostate cancer to progress from 3 cores of very little G6 to so many cores of G7 and G8 with no mentioned of any rare forms of prostate cancer is very puzzling.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by gsteve I have have been reading my brains out trying to decide between rp and brachy. I have read many many stories about bad rp , almost no disappointments with brachy. Im i correct in this thinking? I think there are indications that an experienced RO performing brachy has less side effects, especially ED than a normal surgeon's outcome. On the other hand, an experienced surgeon like Dr. Walsh also gave excellent results including ED. What I am trying to say is whatever you choose is not as important as who you choose to do the treatment. Another factor is the side effects of surgery are immediately so most of us would find out very quickly if we had side effects and posted them in forums. Brachy on the other hand had delayed side effects, so immediately after treatment, most of the reports were good. Sometimes 4 to 5 years or ever many years later problems might show up and I am guessing people who have problems 5 to 10 years after treatment do not normally come back and post here. Just like I don't see too many 5-10 year surgery guys posting here either. Good luck.",

You really don't know if those remaining cells were cancer or benign or if they were within the prostate or elsewhere. The fact that you have 13 years of low PSA seemed to indicate the 4.5 PSA, if caused by cancer, is probably still local. Hopefully there are radiation or other means of catching them. It would be helpful if you can tell us your recent PSA history so we may be able to give you additional opinions. Good luck.",

Does this mean I have aggressive cancer? We had some spirited discussions some time back where some posters said G6 would never metastasize or lived outside of the prostate.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jenni63 if they suspected cancer to be in the lymph nodes would they have removed them with the prostate Jenni63, Some surgeons always remove lymph in prostatectomy while others always leave them intact. The arguments: For: Like breast cancer, if you take out the positive lymph nodes, you could be cancer free, or even if it spreads, it might slow the cancer spread. Besides, it is no big deal to take them out while you are on the operating table and it will give a definitive answer of whether the cancer is organ confined. Against: Prostate cancer is different, once cancer is in the lymph nodes, it already spread and taking it out is futile. Also, by taking out the lymph nodes, you increase your chance of lymphoceles (lymph fluids collected inside the abdomen) and cause infection, or worst sepsis. The debate goes on. My personal layperson observation: I have seen many patients with positive lymph nodes taken out, had undetectable PSA for years. My choice: I would like them taken out. Good luck to your hubby and brother in law. By the way, with G6 and PSA of 18, it should not be not too aggressive and he should enjoy many years of productive life. The question is what is in his post op pathology report. He sould get a copy and study it or share it here.",

I am not a doctor but there seemed to be many occasions, even before his procedure when they could find out more about his situation instead of letting things slide. It started with his doctor getting him regular PSA testings and properly examining his symptoms to eliminate cancer before recommending the procedure. Also, when physicians do any prostate procedures like TURP or laser to relieve urinary symptoms from an enlarged prostate, they usually do a PSA test and that should detect his high PSA and sent him to a biopsy. And if they performed TURP, they always sent the sample to a pathologist and that would most likely show caner. Thank you for sharing your story as this will help those that come after to be more vigilant.",

Good to know that there are still many treatments out there if it ends up being in this stage of cancer. He really had no known health issues and had regular check-ups. Odds are in his favor that he will not die of prostate cancer, so relax, go through the process and then decide what to do. For a 85 year old, Active Surveillance is a very viable option. Good luck.",

I do not have any experience with Jevtana so I have no personal experience to share. However, in \"preparing for the worst and hope for the best\" I have been reading up on some of the new treatment options to treat BCR (biochemical recurrence) and metastasized prostate cancer and here is what I found: Taxotere and Jevtana are two chemo drugs under a class of drugs called microtubule inhibitors which cause cell death by inhibiting cell functions especially when they divide (fast growing cancer cells). (My wife's breast cancer chemo soup contained Taxotere as one of the ingredients. It certainly was not a walk in the park for her, in fact she had a rough time.) Jevtana was recently approved by the FDA after a successful Phase III clinical trial. I believe it acts on a different pathway as microtubule inhibitor than Taxotere so patients that failed Taxotere often got positive result from Jevtana. However, the toxicity of this new drug is quite high so those who takes it requires careful monitoring. Side effects are mainly myelosuppression (the reduce ability of the bone marrow to produce blood cells), anemia, diarrhea and cardiac problems. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "regress, Removing lymph nodes while going through robotic surgery is very easy and many surgeons do that as a matter of practice. However, I have not seen any studies that compare outcomes with or without lymph nodes removal. One thing for sure is once they are removed and examined and are positive, then cancer has most likely spread and thus one should plan for plan B immediately. One risk that is seldom mentioned is removing lymph nodes sometimes causes lymphocele, the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the body cavity. By itself, if asymptomatic, it will not cause any problem but sometimes they get infected, leading to abscess and could be life threatening. I am aware of three posters on this site that had such happened to them after surgery. Fortunately, all recovered fully after additional treatments. Good luck.",

      "Content": "You asked a very good question. I worried about this too since I had 4 biopsies before they found cancer. I did some search prior to my second biopsy and in general the risks for prostate biopsy seemed small. Here is one article I found at the time: J Urol. 1991 May;145(5):1003-7. Needle biopsy associated tumor tracking of adenocarcinoma of the prostate. Bastacky SS, Walsh PC, Epstein JI. Department of Urology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland They found about 2% of cases had evidences of positive tracking. I believe newer needles have \"trap door\" to close the needle opening to prevent/minimize tracking. Another more recent publication in 2008 which I found just before my 4th biopsy, from U Penn is even more positive and here is the quote: Pennsylvania School of Medicine, responds: I looked at the website, medicalnewstoday.com, and the article is based on a press release from a clinic in Sarasota, Florida, where the author talks about \u201cseeding\u201d the needle track with tumor cells. The problem with this is that while seeding is well described in tumors of the lung, biliary tract and some other sites, there are fewer than 100 cases reported of this happening with prostate cancer. Think about it: 225,000 cases/yr x 15 yrs of PSA screening and biopsy when needed, which means about 100 cases is a relatively small number. Most of the described cases of seeding involve neuroendocrine tumors of the prostate, which are <1% of prostate tumors and don't make PSA, so PSA levels are not elevated.",

Since your PSA is >10, I would also ask for an MRI. MRI and CT are somewhat redundant but MRI is better in certain circumstances. At this stage you want as much information as you can get.

We're lucky we still have him. Still can't find much on this new chemo- jevtana. Hoping it works. I'm new to this so I did'nt understand the PM or posters you suggested. Thanks for the help. stenberg12, I found a thread as one of the threads discussing Jevtana. I restart the thread, you can go there, read it and click on the posters' names to send him/her/them a PM (private message) and see if they will answer you. Good luck and hope you will find the answer you are looking for.",

You have plenty of time to watch and monitor to see if your cancer is indolent and if so no treatment is needed. You also want to get a couple of books , e.g., Dr. Walsh's book, on prostate cancer to gain some additional insights so you will become an informed patient. The other thing you should do is to send the biopsy slides to a prominent lab, e.g. Johns Hopkins, for a second opinion since the G(3+3) is often the judgement of the pathologist who examined your slides. You want to make sure the 3+3 is not a 3+4. Good luck.",

      "Content": "regress, Removing lymph nodes while going through robotic surgery is very easy and many surgeons do that as a matter of practice. However, I have not seen any studies that compare outcomes with or without lymph nodes removal. One thing for sure is once they are removed and examined and are positive, then cancer has most likely spread and thus one should plan for plan B immediately. One risk that is seldom mentioned is removing lymph nodes sometimes causes lymphocele, the accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the body cavity. By itself, if asymptomatic, it will not cause any problem but sometimes they get infected, leading to abscess and could be life threatening. I am aware of three posters on this site that had such happened to them after surgery. Fortunately, all recovered fully after additional treatments. Good luck.",

After a year I had another PSA done and was at 6. No Biopsy done since 1st one was clean. 3rd year PSA of 13 another biopsy again 32 samples and all clean. Just got this years results of a whopping 21. Does anyone have any idea of what could possibly cause this. Prostate has been slightly enlarged since the first time and have done the antibiotic regiment to no avail. Just looking for answers. Any help or ideas will be appreciated Ask for a copy of the biopsy reports and see if there were the followings found: chronic inflammation (not infection), PIN (low or high grade) and/or ASAP. They are not classified as cancer but will all raised PSA readings. Often, antibiotics won't get rid of chronic inflammation. Other tests like PCA3, color doppler, etc. unfortunately are not definitive. If they are all negative, you might want to have the sample re-read by a different pathologist or get someone else to do another biopsy. Often, finding cancer depends on chance and the skills of the person taking the biopsy (or reading the slides) after all even with saturation biopsy you are only sampling a very small portions of the prostate. Took a radiologist instead of my urologist to find my cancer on the fourth try, even though post op pathology showed extensive cancers. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KELLY41 It's been 6 years since I was diagnosed with very serious prostate cancer with a PSA of 95 and a gleasen score of 9. I had 38 radiation treatments and have done well till this year. In Jan PSA was 3, March was 3.6,June was 5 and September it is 10.15. My urologist prescribed Finasteride and Bicalutamide as I can not take the shot due to side effects. My oncologist prescribed an MRI of the hips and back. Nothing was found. The oncologist says the cancer has definitely come back but has not been found yet. I go back in 3 weeks.Can anyone give me advise on how to proceed? Kelly41, The other folks have given you excellent comments and suggestions. Let me add mine and I like to start from the beginning: First I have a bunch of questions you may want to answer: When your cancer was diagnosed, with a PSA of 95 and G9, how did you ended up with a radiation treatment? Did your urologist recommended it and did you consult an oncologist? Did your urologist do a bone scan, ct scan and an MRI? With a very high PSA and aggressive G9, there could be indications of spread prior to treatment and you need to know. Also, you can use that as a baseline to compare any new scans and get a better sense of where are the likely locations of the cancer. And, what was the lowest PSA you achieved (PSA nadir) after radiation? Second, modern radiation protocol often involves a course of hormone before, during and after radiation treatment to enhance effectiveness and increase cure rate. Did your urologist/oncologist provide you with that? Perhaps when you said you could not take shot due to side effects that was the hormone shot they gave you? If so, there are still a number of other hormones you could have taken (like what lancepeace mentioned) did your oncologist give you a substitute? Third, if you can ask for some of the new more sensitive scans. Be able to find out where the cancer hides can be helpful to devise a treatment plan. Fourth, I am not a healthcare professional but from what I read, the Finasteride and Bicalutamide (Casodex) combo is kind of unusual. Maybe you should get a second opinion on treatment options. Fifth, you mentioned reduced stream. It could be urethra stricture, a delayed side effect of the radiation treatment. However, you had a cystoscopy and it was normal? My friend had salvage radiation and six years after had the same problem. His was cured by a simple procedure to remove the stricture. You should consult your urologist. Yes, it is possible (but unusual) for the cancer to attack the bladder muscle. And finally, if you can, go find a cancer center (e.g. The U of Mississippi) and consult with the experts there because your case may be different than the \"run of the mill\" prostate cancer and you want the best oncologists on your team. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ezhelp712 Hi JohnT and thanks for the reply, As posted earlier, a meeting with the Radiation Oncology Specialist is scheduled. This is exactly the topic the urologist and surgeon have concerns - cancer is not contained. Therefore, they suggested the seed therapy. Do you know if the seed therapy is ALWAYS accompanied with hormone therapy? Thank You. If I were you, I probably would choose radiation + hormone as the treatment plan and shoot for a cure. Your enlarged prostate maybe too large for seed therapy, and in that case the radiation oncologist could prescribe hormone therapy to shrink the prostate to make seeds more effective. He should also add IMRT to ensure he gets all of your cancer. There were numerous studies indicating hormone enhances the effectiveness of radiation and increase survival. Good luck to you.",

Since you no longer have a prostate, it should not matter. The only things that will cause you to have a non zero PSA are: Some benign prostate tissues were left behind or cancer cells were left behind. Also, your doctor should prescribe low dose Cialis to help your little buddy. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Don B Yes, Fran... That's why I'm trying to find out how extensive that procedure is. My preference for radiation is due to just recently adjusting to living alone after 46 years of marriage, and I have concerns about recovering on my own. But, to your point, if getting a sample to biopsy the node is a big deal, then I may as well just go for the surgery. Thanks for your humble opinion, Don It is not too complicated but still it takes a skilled radiologist to do it. I think it is not routinely done for prostate cancer because when in doubt most physicians op for radiation which by its nature casts a wider net and can aim at both the prostate and the suspected lymph node area to kill the cancer there. The cure rate for surgery and radiation are about equal so there is no disadvantage in going for radiation except perhaps the cost of radiation is higher to the insurance company. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Being the pessimist among members here, I worry a little if there is no < sign in front of your 6 weeks PSA #. To add to what Michael F said, there are several possibilities: Lab error; you started out with extremely high PSA; some benign tissues were left behind; some cancer cells are still there. Let's hope it is the first three and not the last. In any case a repeat PSA in the near future makes sense to me. Many surgeons order a PSA test 3 months after surgery, mine wanted a PSA test at 6 weeks and his rationale was he wanted to get a jump on the situation if something was not right. So, the question is: Is 6 week enough time for PSA to be undetectable? The scientific answer is yes and here is the computation: Numerous studies confirmed normal PSA half-life is between 2 to 3 days meaning if there is no replenishment, blood PSA will be down by half in 2 to 3 days. At 6 weeks (42 days), if your are on the slow side, your PSA should be down by 14 half-lives and if yours is fast it should be down by 21 half-lives. If your pre-op PSA was 10, it should be at 0.0006 with a 3 days half-life and would be 0.000004 with a 2 days half-life. I hope your case is just like Michael F's. So, it is too early to worry but to be on the safe side, if I were you I would take the pathology report and get a second opinion from an oncologist just in case. Good luck and let's hope the others are correct.",

Has anyone here knew someone who was going through the same ordeal?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Thanks Sarg. I was looking more for something like, is there some kind of online registry or website that give info on stats of surgeons in general. This Patel guy does sound like the real deal. If i was in the Florida area, i would def consider him, if i needed to. There is no online registry that gives info on surgeons' stats. As for Dr. Patel, you can go to the Global Robotic Institute website and see a list of his publications some had outcome statistics. The negative for me at the time was that he was too \"famous\" and seemed to do a lot extracurricular activities (so how he kept his skills sharp and how he could perform all the surgeries himself). You really have to do your own homework and pick someone you trust as there are a lot of good ones (and some not so good ones) out there. My surgeon practices in a community hospital but I knew he was (is) among the very best in Cali and I knew his stats. I also talked to many of his patients at a prostate cancer support group, not patient names that were given by a doctor's office, which you usually get when ask for references. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Don B Yes, Fran... That's why I'm trying to find out how extensive that procedure is. My preference for radiation is due to just recently adjusting to living alone after 46 years of marriage, and I have concerns about recovering on my own. But, to your point, if getting a sample to biopsy the node is a big deal, then I may as well just go for the surgery. Thanks for your humble opinion, Don It is not too complicated but still it takes a skilled radiologist to do it. I think it is not routinely done for prostate cancer because when in doubt most physicians op for radiation which by its nature casts a wider net and can aim at both the prostate and the suspected lymph node area to kill the cancer there. The cure rate for surgery and radiation are about equal so there is no disadvantage in going for radiation except perhaps the cost of radiation is higher to the insurance company. Good luck and best wishes.",

Effectively, if the cancer is already outside, taking the prostate out will not stop the cancer, at best, it only \"de-bulk\" the cancer and slow it down somewhat. Standard surgery will always remove the seminal vesicle and most surgeons, especially those doing robotic (my surgeon told me that it was very easy to take lymph nodes out during da vinci) often will remove some lymph nodes for pathology examination to ensure they are OK.",

      "Content": "Pratoman, Why don't you do what some of us did: Schedule your surgery 2 months after your biopsy which pushes the earliest you can go to January. The reason you need 2 months for the earliest surgery is surgeon won't cut if the prostate is still full of needle holes not yet heal. Use the two months to get your second opinion regarding AS, surgery or radiation. To me the most critical decision point is between AS and treat. Once you get pass that, it is mostly a matter of personal preference and finding the best practitioner in whatever you choose to do. So in that regard, the MSK mid Dec consult is within the time frame. No loss of time, unless you decide to cancel the surgery date and start over with another surgeon. I think radiation scheduling is usually easier than surgery dates so if you choose radiation, you should be able to schedule within the two months. In engineering they advice against \"paralysis by analysis\" too much analysis and agonizing over everything and not taking action sometimes is worst than get up and go. Best regards,",

      "Content": "Thanks for the link. Some of the outcome don't make sense to me, for example: 1. The prostate cancer specific survival is worst for low risk patients than for intermediate risk patients and the difference I believe is statistically significant based on the number of patients and the difference. 2. Adjuvant ADT had a negative effect on survival, counter to quite a number of other published studies. It is also interesting to compare the results to the 30 years Johns Hopkins prostatectomy outcome study published in 2012: For JH: From 1992-2011 (similar period), out of 3385 patients, 51 died of prostate cancer (1.5%). Patient classification based on the D'Amico Risk Group: Low 2224, Intermediate 1034 and High 121. The median years followed-up: 8.6 (range 1 to 19). For Mount Sinai (Brachy): From 1990-2007, out of 1669 patients, 37 died of prostate cancer (2.2%). Your article did not break out the risk group and population in each risk so comparison is difficult. I must say the results are excellent except for the two points I mentioned and the difference between surgery and Brachy is really very minor. So folks should be comfortable choosing Brachy. Another interesting point from JH is the survival outcome was much worst in the pre-PSA era of 1982-1991. That can be accounted for by the Risk grouping: Only 38% were diagnosed with low risk pre-PSA as compared to 66% in the post-PSA era. Best wishes.",

That is a good sign since it means they still think there is a chance the cancer, even though already escaped are localized and can be removed by surgery. Typically, in aggressive cases (G8 and escaped), they also add adjuvant radiation and hormone. So the short answer is it is treatable and many with his conditions were in remission/cured.

      "Content": "Without drilling down to compare treatment modalities, the study is not very helpful to us prostate cancer patients. There are numerous studies within the prostate cancer treatment communities on comparing secondary cancer risk from various treatment methods. The findings (I can go back and dig those studies out if someone is interested) I remembered when I was searching for treatment options were: 1. For surgery, colorectal and bladder cancer risks were no different from the general population. 2. For brachy, the colorectal and bladder cancer risks were only slightly higher than the general population. 3. For external beam radiation, they about double the risk of the general population, but if you looked at the absolute number, i.e., case per 100,000, it was still a very small number and comparable to the risk of death/complications due to surgery. But remember, the outcome for radiation was taken over a long time (years if not decades) and the technology in external radiation has improved so much that I am sure the risks are much smaller nowadays. And, I think that was the reason many doctors recommended surgery for very young prostate cancer patients as they still have decades to live and cancer risk due to radiation goes up in time after treatment. So, it is correct that we should watch out for the possibility of secondary cancer, it is not a risk high enough that those needing treatment should stop getting treatment. Specifically, those that were treated with external radiation should not lose any sleep. Others should perhaps just follow the guidelines for the general population. Peace, just want to add my comments and not try to create a fight.",

Since you no longer have a prostate, it should not matter. The only things that will cause you to have a non zero PSA are: Some benign prostate tissues were left behind or cancer cells were left behind. Also, your doctor should prescribe low dose Cialis to help your little buddy. Good luck.",

Mike Mike, I also noticed from your signature that you have Ductal Adenocarcinoma of the prostate. It is rare and aggressive. I suggest you seek out one of the major cancer centers and find an oncologist who specializes in treating this form of prostate cancer to treat you. From your location, you are closest to MD Anderson, so perhaps you can ask your urologist to refer you there. Good luck and best wishes.",

If you choose surgery, you do not need to do hormone as studies found no benefits of adding hormone prior to surgery and in some cases might affect the \"feel and appearance\" of the cancer and confused the surgeon. On the other hand, studies indicated adding hormone treatment prior to radiation enhanced the cure rate and survival. Both radiation and surgery are good options in your case. The patient should have the final say, so, you do have to decide and push for the treatment you want. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Thanks Sarg. I was looking more for something like, is there some kind of online registry or website that give info on stats of surgeons in general. This Patel guy does sound like the real deal. If i was in the Florida area, i would def consider him, if i needed to. There is no online registry that gives info on surgeons' stats. As for Dr. Patel, you can go to the Global Robotic Institute website and see a list of his publications some had outcome statistics. The negative for me at the time was that he was too \"famous\" and seemed to do a lot extracurricular activities (so how he kept his skills sharp and how he could perform all the surgeries himself). You really have to do your own homework and pick someone you trust as there are a lot of good ones (and some not so good ones) out there. My surgeon practices in a community hospital but I knew he was (is) among the very best in Cali and I knew his stats. I also talked to many of his patients at a prostate cancer support group, not patient names that were given by a doctor's office, which you usually get when ask for references. Best of luck to you.",

He had 40 radiation treatments also is getting a calcium infusion every 4 to 8 weeks to strengthen bones current PSA is 0.1 age 74 Doctor said his stage was T2b......but I thought since the cancer is not confined to the prostate...it was stage 4 ???? He feels fine with very few side effects. I know this is bad....but how bad? What should we expect? Unless the two spots are old wounds and not metastasis? And the positive lymph nodes are false positives? You really need to clarify these with his urologist for it could make a lot of differences. Usually with distant metastases they don't advocate radiation treatment. One other thought, with only 2 suspected spots and suspected lymph nodes, you might want to ask about spot radiating the spots. Dr. Myers and some other oncologists thought that could cause a durable remission. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Pratoman, Why don't you do what some of us did: Schedule your surgery 2 months after your biopsy which pushes the earliest you can go to January. The reason you need 2 months for the earliest surgery is surgeon won't cut if the prostate is still full of needle holes not yet heal. Use the two months to get your second opinion regarding AS, surgery or radiation. To me the most critical decision point is between AS and treat. Once you get pass that, it is mostly a matter of personal preference and finding the best practitioner in whatever you choose to do. So in that regard, the MSK mid Dec consult is within the time frame. No loss of time, unless you decide to cancel the surgery date and start over with another surgeon. I think radiation scheduling is usually easier than surgery dates so if you choose radiation, you should be able to schedule within the two months. In engineering they advice against \"paralysis by analysis\" too much analysis and agonizing over everything and not taking action sometimes is worst than get up and go. Best regards,",

If you choose surgery, you do not need to do hormone as studies found no benefits of adding hormone prior to surgery and in some cases might affect the \"feel and appearance\" of the cancer and confused the surgeon. On the other hand, studies indicated adding hormone treatment prior to radiation enhanced the cure rate and survival. Both radiation and surgery are good options in your case. The patient should have the final say, so, you do have to decide and push for the treatment you want. Good luck.",

From my research, the incidence of ED after surgery if there is ED is immediate and may improve with time. With brachy, it mostly won't show up until later. Looks like it is happening to you. You should go back to your radiation oncologist, they usually have seen a lot of cases and probably is in a better position to give you advices.

Let me answer question #2 first. Since he already had his prostate biopsy and the doctor immediately started Hormone therapy indicating he has cancer, so the first task is to assess how aggressive is his cancer. You do that by asking the doctor to go through his biopsy report with you: how many cores were taken, how many of which were positive with cancer and what % of each core had cancer. Next, what is the Gleason scores (range from 6 to 10, 6 being less aggressive). A psa of 300 with high Gleason score means the cancer is aggressive and requires aggressive treatments. Hopefully his Gleason score will be below 7 meaning cancer could be the slow growing type. Ask the doctor to order not just a bone scan, but also a ct scan to see if there are soft tissues involvements, i.e., lymph node, bladder, seminal vehicles, etc. Some doctor will also order a MRI scan which gives better resolution than ct. If his cancer has escaped the prostate, he needs to consult an oncologist specializes in treating prostate cancer to maximize his chance of long term survival. With some many different drugs available, it takes an expert to get the right sequence and combinations right. Prostate cancer, even the aggressive ones allows us to live a long time so your Dad won't go away soon. How long depends on the results of the diagnostic tests and the right treatments he receives. Many of my friends who were diagnosed with high pas are still around after 10 years. As for question #1, there is no miracle diets that can cure cancer, just make sure that going forward he maintains a healthy diet. Others on this forum will add more pointers. Good luck to your father.",

Like HighlanderCHF said, they are likely small but normally the pathology report should say e.g. < x mm focally positive for example. Small positive margins will sometimes not be a problem as Dr. Walsh said in his book that the act of surgery usually kill off the cancer cells at the margin if there are only a small amount at the margins.

Prostate cancer, even the aggressive ones allows us to live a long time so your Dad won't go away soon. How long depends on the results of the diagnostic tests and the right treatments he receives. Many of my friends who were diagnosed with high pas are still around after 10 years. As for question #1, there is no miracle diets that can cure cancer, just make sure that going forward he maintains a healthy diet. Others on this forum will add more pointers.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Mimi711 Here is the language from DH's post-op pathology report: Margins: Focally positive left posterior mid and superior pseudocapsular resection margin. All other margins negative for tumor. Yes, two spots had positive margins: One @ left posterior mid and one @ superior pseudo capsular resection (cut). Otherwise, pathology report is excellent. Like HighlanderCHF said, they are likely small but normally the pathology report should say e.g. < x mm focally positive for example. Small positive margins will sometimes not be a problem as Dr. Walsh said in his book that the act of surgery usually kill off the cancer cells at the margin if there are only a small amount at the margins. Good luck.",

Let me answer question #2 first. Since he already had his prostate biopsy and the doctor immediately started Hormone therapy indicating he has cancer, so the first task is to assess how aggressive is his cancer. You do that by asking the doctor to go through his biopsy report with you: how many cores were taken, how many of which were positive with cancer and what % of each core had cancer. Next, what is the Gleason scores (range from 6 to 10, 6 being less aggressive). A psa of 300 with high Gleason score means the cancer is aggressive and requires aggressive treatments. Hopefully his Gleason score will be below 7 meaning cancer could be the slow growing type. Ask the doctor to order not just a bone scan, but also a ct scan to see if there are soft tissues involvements, i.e., lymph node, bladder, seminal vehicles, etc. Some doctor will also order a MRI scan which gives better resolution than ct. If his cancer has escaped the prostate, he needs to consult an oncologist specializes in treating prostate cancer to maximize his chance of long term survival. With some many different drugs available, it takes an expert to get the right sequence and combinations right. Prostate cancer, even the aggressive ones allows us to live a long time so your Dad won't go away soon. How long depends on the results of the diagnostic tests and the right treatments he receives.

Otego, you made some very good points. Let me add a slightly different spin: If I were to use the last three PSA numbers, which I think is a better representation, the doubling time is about 2.5 years, though still quite slow, seemed to be speeding up. So, as all of you were saying, as PSA doubling time is speeding up and with a G7, AS is probably not a good long term option. DanF, good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by heypapa I have a few questions to ask : 1) is there any food or drink that he can't eat/consume? oily fried meat etc.../ coffee? 2) what should I ask when we went back to the doctor on 23 dec? what information do I need to know? actually in my heart, i only want to know how many more years can my dad live. thank you from a worried son. heypapa, Sorry you have to visit our club but welcome. Let me answer question #2 first. Since he already had his prostate biopsy and the doctor immediately started Hormone therapy indicating he has cancer, so the first task is to assess how aggressive is his cancer. You do that by asking the doctor to go through his biopsy report with you: how many cores were taken, how many of which were positive with cancer and what % of each core had cancer. Next, what is the Gleason scores (range from 6 to 10, 6 being less aggressive). A psa of 300 with high Gleason score means the cancer is aggressive and requires aggressive treatments. Hopefully his Gleason score will be below 7 meaning cancer could be the slow growing type. Ask the doctor to order not just a bone scan, but also a ct scan to see if there are soft tissues involvements, i.e., lymph node, bladder, seminal vehicles, etc. Some doctor will also order a MRI scan which gives better resolution than ct. If his cancer has escaped the prostate, he needs to consult an oncologist specializes in treating prostate cancer to maximize his chance of long term survival. With some many different drugs available, it takes an expert to get the right sequence and combinations right. Prostate cancer, even the aggressive ones allows us to live a long time so your Dad won't go away soon. How long depends on the results of the diagnostic tests and the right treatments he receives. Many of my friends who were diagnosed with high pas are still around after 10 years. As for question #1, there is no miracle diets that can cure cancer, just make sure that going forward he maintains a healthy diet. Others on this forum will add more pointers. Good luck to your father.",

The risk is if there are microscopic cancer/prostate cells still lurking around then TRT would fuel the cancer growth. I think today many urologist would be amenable to TRT after several years of undetectable PSA.",

Otego, you made some very good points. Let me add a slightly different spin: If I were to use the last three PSA numbers, which I think is a better representation, the doubling time is about 2.5 years, though still quite slow, seemed to be speeding up. So, as all of you were saying, as PSA doubling time is speeding up and with a G7, AS is probably not a good long term option. DanF, good luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Inquiring Mind Sorry for the confusion I've caused! My current situation is salvage radiation, with high risk of recurrence. Based on that study, the radiation oncologist recommended two years HT in addition to the radiation - I assume to increase the chances of the radiation being successful. This thread is hypothetical - should my slavage radiation fail and curitive options are exhausted, how early should chemo start? I hope your treatment will be successful so you do not have to face this dilemma. Since it is hypothetical, let me give you a hypothetical answer based on logic: I assumed there are a lot of similarities between different types of cancer, especially between breast cancer and prostate cancer. I am not arguing about non aggressive prostate cancer where AS seemed to be fine. I am talking about prostate cancer that are aggressive, so similar to typical breast cancers. Here are a few recent researches on delaying treatment and delaying chemo for breast cancer: http://www.mdanderson.org/newsroom/n...-negative.html http://archsurg.jamanetwork.com/arti...icleid=1681805 http://journal.frontiersin.org/artic...014.00087/full It essentially said delaying treatment and chemo reduced survival. I often stayed up at night think about \"what if's\". My conclusion, for me anyway was to throw everything at it as early as possible and with as many modalities as my body could take because a., multiple modalities reduced the chance of mutation and b., earlier gets the cancer before drug resistance or distant met. As for QOL, being cancer free >> on hormone for the rest of my life, even if I have to endure up six months of chemo and two years of hormone. I don't know if the logic makes any sense but as you said it is hypothetical. These are legitimate topics to talk over with your oncologists to see what their views are so in case you have to pull the trigger you have a plan. Regards,",

      "Content": "No one reply so let me try. Seeds is an excellent way to go for a localized cancer. However, some radiation oncologists would not recommend it if your prostate is enlarged. Most modern studies comparing radiation treatment to surgery found the outcome to be similar. Since seeds placement in the prostate is critical to ensure all the cancers are radiated, the skill and experience of the radiation oncologist who places the seeds is the most important factor to consider. As for what if cancer comes back? It is true, surgery after seeds is difficult but not impossible. More likely you can still do salvage radiation after seeds failed, just like surgery. But, don't take my word for it since I am a layperson, please consult your physicians. Good luck.",

Here is the website: http://www.healio.com/hematology-onc...rostate-cancer Here is the comments from Dr. Hudis from MSK: This is an old-dog new-tricks question. This is now a generic drug that is available more broadly than ever before with reduced costs. In prostate cancer, I\u2019m not aware of a historical study that ever offered this magnitude of improvement in survival. Quite frankly, across all of solid tumors, this is almost an unprecedented improvement in median survival. This is the kind of thing that can be transformative for people. The issue of toxicity is a big one, which leads us to the next chapter of our attempt to move to less toxic, even more effective therapies. Clifford A.

Also given that the CT scan was negative, wouldn't that also show bone metastisi? thanks for all you help! Let me give it a try: CT scan can mostly detect abnormalities in soft tissues/organs and are not too sensitive in detecting bone metastasis. A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer that acts similar to calcium and will be taken up by bones where things are active, like cancer sites, injury sites, arthritis, etc. The tracer has very short radioactive life and will be excreted by the body afterwards. It takes about 3 hours after injecting the radio-tracer for them to be picked up at the cancer sites, so the 3 hour wait. A camera that can detect those radioactive tracer is use to detect active areas. Good luck to your husband.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by tomseeley I'm totally new here. No clue at all what to expect or what to do. My PCP told me my PSA has risen suddenly, from 4-something to 7-something in 3 months. So he has referred me to the urology firm in town that he typically refers people to. I have no idea at all if they're competent or not. But today I checked their web page and found out the \"doc\" I'm going to see for my initial consultation later this week is not an M.D., he's a D.O. I've Googled that term also, but I still have no clue at all if I'm being sent to a real doctor I can trust or to some guy with webbed feet. All I know for sure is that 60 years ago, a D.O. almost killed my grandmother because he didn't know what the **** he was doing and what was wrong with her. When my dad found out (after he came down from hitting the roof) he pulled his mom out of the hospital where she was and got her an M.D., and in a very short time she was fine and back home. So my one data point with a D.O. is not a good one. Should I be concerned? If I am, and the urology firm does have other doctors who are in fact M.D., what should I do? One of the best, if not the best brachy radiation oncologists, Dr. Grimm is a DO. They received the same training and many attended the same residencies as MD, so I do not believe there are any differences between an MD and a DO. I would not hesitate to be treated by a US trained DO and if I choose brachy therapy, I would probably travel to Seattle to be treated by Dr. Grimm. As for your psa, a jump from 4 to 7 in three months probably is not cancer but infection. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by D&K Our Docs jumped into action upon receipt of the PSA: immediate bone scan & (MRI?) were scheduled, moved from Urology who did hormone shot; to Oncology. Next met with Oncology to get the scan results && off and running with chemo. It all went VERY fast! Because we were already in lymph nodes & bone we are 'automatically' stage 4. Now fighting!! D&K, Looks like his oncologist is on top of things. With that combination of chemo and hormone, he can expect to have his cancer under control for a long time. Sometimes, to make him feel that he is proactive, you may want to investigate changing his diet to be more anti-cancer friendly, like more fruits and veggies, a Mediterranean diet... Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mom2two Can you please explain how the bone scan is done? We were told he'd get an injection then have to wait three hours before having the scan. Also given that the CT scan was negative, wouldn't that also show bone metastisi? thanks for all you help! Let me give it a try: CT scan can mostly detect abnormalities in soft tissues/organs and are not too sensitive in detecting bone metastasis. A bone scan uses a radioactive tracer that acts similar to calcium and will be taken up by bones where things are active, like cancer sites, injury sites, arthritis, etc. The tracer has very short radioactive life and will be excreted by the body afterwards. It takes about 3 hours after injecting the radio-tracer for them to be picked up at the cancer sites, so the 3 hour wait. A camera that can detect those radioactive tracer is use to detect active areas. Good luck to your husband.",

      "Content": "No one reply so let me try. Seeds is an excellent way to go for a localized cancer. However, some radiation oncologists would not recommend it if your prostate is enlarged. Most modern studies comparing radiation treatment to surgery found the outcome to be similar. Since seeds placement in the prostate is critical to ensure all the cancers are radiated, the skill and experience of the radiation oncologist who places the seeds is the most important factor to consider. As for what if cancer comes back? It is true, surgery after seeds is difficult but not impossible. More likely you can still do salvage radiation after seeds failed, just like surgery. But, don't take my word for it since I am a layperson, please consult your physicians. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SamInToronto Six core biopsy in June was Gleason 3+4 in 3 of 6 samples. Second biopsy in September grade was 3+3 (and they also reviewed previous biopsy and downgraded it to 3+3). After reading everything everybody else here has read, I felt that brachy was the best option and I am scheduled for the procedure in mid-November. But I just got results of the second biopsy and I now think that AS might be a good option. So, like many others have done before me, I welcome your collective insight, guidance and suggestions. Thanks! I beg to disagree. The first biopsy's G3+4 is still in your prostate and is not going away. The second biopsy's G3+3 only means they sampled different areas of your prostate and not where the first G3+4 was located. If you want to do AS, I suggest you ask your urologist to send the first set of slides to a reputable pathologist like at Johns Hopkins or Bostwick Lab and get a second read. If it is downgraded to a G3+3, I would be more comfortable to go AS, otherwise, IMHO you still need treatment, after all you are young. Good luck.",

The near term course of action could be just watching your PSA closely and maybe it will stay at .1 a lot longer. There is another possibility: Very slow rise in PSA post op could be due to benign prostate cells instead of cancer cells that were left behind. Good luck.",

      "Content": "No one reply so let me try. Seeds is an excellent way to go for a localized cancer. However, some radiation oncologists would not recommend it if your prostate is enlarged. Most modern studies comparing radiation treatment to surgery found the outcome to be similar. Since seeds placement in the prostate is critical to ensure all the cancers are radiated, the skill and experience of the radiation oncologist who places the seeds is the most important factor to consider. As for what if cancer comes back? It is true, surgery after seeds is difficult but not impossible. More likely you can still do salvage radiation after seeds failed, just like surgery. But, don't take my word for it since I am a layperson, please consult your physicians. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago Well, I hope I can see the actual study instead of only the abstract. The abstract said \" When adjusted for age and prostate weight, ASI men still had a greater probability of having GS 7 or greater PCa \" But the world prostate cancer statistics you refer to only include diagnosed cases and/or death rates from PCa, potentially leaving out a large number of the men in this study who, but for death from other causes, might never be diagnosed or have died from prostate cancer. I don't know the details, but screening for PCa in Japan is far lower. Thus naturally you'll have much lower incidence of PCa being reported. It may be that Russian and Japanese rates of screening are roughly comparable. Rates of new diagnosed cases per 100,000 (back in 2002) were similar in both Russia and Japan. http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11 ;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=6;ti= 2002$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1ji MAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuy j3qX39HWaQjEg;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwc NAVuyj2vXUZJKI0XHA;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=C ATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=377;dataMax=7 5860$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=-2.3805;dataMax=135$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$i nds=i110_t002002,,,,;i184_t002002,,,, And in this chart, you can also compare. http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content...3/F3.large.jpg Interesting. Lots of factors involved. I'd like to see the entire study with the details. It may be that genetics or especially the lifestyle of Japanese men forestalls their PCa from advancing to the point of obvious symptoms (diagnosis) or death. Gleason 6's and 7's may not advance so rapidly in those who have lived and eaten differently for their entire life. Of question is whether Western men, changing their diets after age 50, or after diagnosis will make a significant change in progression. I've completely altered my diet for over 7 years now but have no great faith it will do much more than perhaps delay my genetics. Thus far, no positive biopsy, but PSA still poking along at 3.5 to 3.8 (with some worrying leaps up here and there). That is why I watch and wonder about these types of reports. How come Japanese men can have considerable rates of PCa ongoing, yet have a mortality rate half of ours. You made some excellent points, so I went to the UN WHO world prostate cancer statistics database to see the incidence and mortality rate for Russia and Japan: For the year 2008: Japan, incidence rate 22.7/100,000; mortality 5/100,000 Russia, incidence rate 26.1/100,000; mortality 10.8/100,000 So, incidence rate is about the same but death in Japan is only half of Russia. Since Japanese men live the longest, we cannot explain away that they died of something else. The article's biopsy results showing Japanese men had more aggressive prostate cancer but they didn't die from it is still a mystery to me.",

      "Content": "No one reply so let me try. Seeds is an excellent way to go for a localized cancer. However, some radiation oncologists would not recommend it if your prostate is enlarged. Most modern studies comparing radiation treatment to surgery found the outcome to be similar. Since seeds placement in the prostate is critical to ensure all the cancers are radiated, the skill and experience of the radiation oncologist who places the seeds is the most important factor to consider. As for what if cancer comes back? It is true, surgery after seeds is difficult but not impossible. More likely you can still do salvage radiation after seeds failed, just like surgery. But, don't take my word for it since I am a layperson, please consult your physicians. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SamInToronto Six core biopsy in June was Gleason 3+4 in 3 of 6 samples. Second biopsy in September grade was 3+3 (and they also reviewed previous biopsy and downgraded it to 3+3). After reading everything everybody else here has read, I felt that brachy was the best option and I am scheduled for the procedure in mid-November. But I just got results of the second biopsy and I now think that AS might be a good option. So, like many others have done before me, I welcome your collective insight, guidance and suggestions. Thanks! I beg to disagree. The first biopsy's G3+4 is still in your prostate and is not going away. The second biopsy's G3+3 only means they sampled different areas of your prostate and not where the first G3+4 was located. If you want to do AS, I suggest you ask your urologist to send the first set of slides to a reputable pathologist like at Johns Hopkins or Bostwick Lab and get a second read. If it is downgraded to a G3+3, I would be more comfortable to go AS, otherwise, IMHO you still need treatment, after all you are young. Good luck.",

The new nanotechnolgoy therapies and also the new antibody drug conjugate therapies target these chemo poisons preferentially in the cancer cells and might avoid corrupting the tissue micro-environment. Hopefully they are discovering solutions to these problems. Yes, a number of recent studies have positive results using nanoparticle as vector to deliver chemo more effectively and directly to cancer cells and avoid the \"chemo damage\" to good cells that Sequoiaranger was talking about. One such nano carrier is BIND-014 which is entering clinical trial. Sequoiaranger, you started Taxotere in April. Is everything OK? Perhaps you should ask your doctor about BIND-014 or something similar just in case Taxotere stops working for you? Just a thought and best of luck to you.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jim215 I agree with Chuck. A biopsy is indeed warranted. It's only a diagnostic test, not open-heart surgery and while we can choose to identify instances that rarely occur (deadly infection, please!!), only a biopsy will give an accurate picture. One question does come to mind: Why bother going to a doctor -- any doctor -- if you already decided what you were or were not going to do based on your 2,000 pages of reading on the subject? And it sounds like since you have all of the answers, why bother coming to a website where thousands of patients are willing to share their actual experiences? I will not comment on a 63-year-old male who ejaculates daily. But not for me to say. It sounds like you have a good \"grip\" on the subject. +1 However, if his urologist had also done a DRE and it was normal, he is asymptomatic with the size of the prostate consistent with the number, his position is not unreasonable. The risk of course is he could end up with an aggressive cancer and he may have given up the chance of early detection and a possible cure. Personally, I have not seen a single case of biopsy gone wrong among all my friends and relatives but have witnessed friends and relatives suffered pains and died from prostate cancer so my view is biased. Like everything in life, we all take risks so to each his own, especially since he is doing it with his eyes wide open. I do wish the best of luck to the poster and hope we can reject his application to join our club.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by rivtrail My Psa was 6 and rising (up from 3 a couple years ago, then 5+, then 6+ a few weeks later). Doc seemed optimistic after my biopsy and didn't mention any major concerns (I'm 56). Also, my CRP was high (2.9) on my most recent blood test. My concerns are these: 1) the freak show that is my semen (pure blood, after about five days). Been afraid to see it since then and am uncertain how to normalize. Should I be regularly ejaculating to empty things out or refrain? Everything else (urine, bowel) has checked out with no blood. 2) if no cancer was found, then what the heck else could be going on to make those numbers so bad? 3) what sort of special supplements, protocol should I be following? Thanks, in advance. rivtrail, Welcome to the twilight zone of prostate cancer. First of all, did your physician gave you a DRE? If so, did he detect anything abnormal? Second, blood in the semen is very common after a biopsy and will go away after a few weeks. It is harmless mostly unless you have consistent pain, etc. Third, if the biopsy is positive, you will be applying for membership here. However, if it is negative, it could mean you are cancer free, or that the biopsy missed the cancer this time. Remember, the needle biopsy only sampled a small fraction of your prostate. Prostate cances are usually multifocal and happen in multiple small spots instead of a big node. As for the third question, if you referred to what to take after the biopsy, most likely your physician prescribed an antibiotic that you should take. Other than that, take it easy for a few days and you should be fine. Good luck and seasons greetings to you and your family.",

I watched a number of Da Vinci prostatectomy videos and noticed differences in surgical techniques of different surgeons....What you need now is an expert prostate cancer oncologist to help guide your treatment plan. If you have not already done so, you should ask your urologist and radiation oncologist to recommend someone to you....If his PSA changed from 3 six months ago to 4.7 now, the doubling time is about a year, which is moderate, but needs to be dealt with (if the doubling time is 2 to 3 years perhaps doing nothing could be a strategy). Typically, in this situation oncologists will recommend hormone therapy and salvage radiation....That said, your clinical pathology indicated cancer is intermediate risk but quite extensive so perhaps radiation(IMRT and/or brachy)+hormone could be your best bet as suggested by JohnT. But, please consult with your doctor as we are not health care providers, just fellow sufferers like you....PSA half life in your body is between 2 to 3 days which means with an initial PSA of 10, within 30 days, it should be down to .01 or less. I suggest you consult an oncologist and a radiation oncologist to plan you next attack and hopefully the cancer is still local, in the prostate bed and can be eradicated....Finally, I think radiotherapy (and/or surgery) on the other hand can be curative for local, locally advanced or even some that spread to local adjacent organs. It is unusual for physicians not to prescribe radiation therapy if the patient requests it....With aggressive cases, one should prepare for the worst but hope for the best. Hopefully everything will work out for him but ask his urologist about his views on adjuvant vs salvage radiation and if he recommend going ahead with adjuvant, would he also recommend adding hormone therapy prior/during/after adjuvant radiation....If you have not already done so, you should ask your urologist and radiation oncologist to recommend someone to you. At this stage, whether it was T2a or T2c whether you had positive margin, PNI etc. do not matter but the G7 does....Testosterone is fuel for prostate cancer so it is not advisable to take T unless you are sure the cancer is completely eliminated. With surgery, if you have undetectable PSA for a few years, some doctors would prescribe T. For brachy, sometimes PSA does not reduce to undetectable due to benign cells remaining in there....You really need to clarify these with his urologist for it could make a lot of differences. Usually with distant metastases they don't advocate radiation treatment....But remember, these are just their guesses and yours may very well be organ confined. So as the others have advised find the best surgeon, radiation oncologist, oncologist and draw up a plan of attack and beat the hack out of the cancer....Even with metastatic cancer, there may be hope for a \"cure\" if the spread is limited to only a few spots (<5 for example). Some oncologists like Dr. Myers advocate spot treating the metastatic spots with radiation in addition to hormone therapy....With surgery, if you have undetectable PSA for a few years, some doctors would prescribe T. For brachy, sometimes PSA does not reduce to undetectable due to benign cells remaining in there. When that happens taking T is not smart....And, I think that was the reason many doctors recommended surgery for very young prostate cancer patients as they still have decades to live and cancer risk due to radiation goes up in time after treatment. So, it is correct that we should watch out for the possibility of secondary cancer, it is not a risk high enough that those needing treatment should stop getting treatment....This is exactly the topic the urologist and surgeon have concerns - cancer is not contained. Therefore, they suggested the seed therapy....Based on that study, the radiation oncologist recommended two years HT in addition to the radiation - I assume to increase the chances of the radiation being successful. This thread is hypothetical - should my slavage radiation fail and curitive options are exhausted, how early should chemo start?...Hi, not trying to play doctor, just curious and want to learn why his oncologist doesn't recommend radiation for the prostate area and spot radiation to kill off the metastasized cancers since my recollection was he only had a few spots? However I am very happy that everything is working out great for the two of you....I suggest you consult an oncologist and a radiation oncologist to plan you next attack and hopefully the cancer is still local, in the prostate bed and can be eradicated. No lymph node involvement is a good sign....But remember, the outcome for radiation was taken over a long time (years if not decades) and the technology in external radiation has improved so much that I am sure the risks are much smaller nowadays. And, I think that was the reason many doctors recommended surgery for very young prostate cancer patients as they still have decades to live and cancer risk due to radiation goes up in time after treatment....It is a very hard decision for him. A combined HT/RT/HT had a far superior outcome than no HT, so much so that all oncologist and radiation oncologist recommend this....If I were you, I probably would choose radiation + hormone as the treatment plan and shoot for a cure. Your enlarged prostate maybe too large for seed therapy, and in that case the radiation oncologist could prescribe hormone therapy to shrink the prostate to make seeds more effective....Let me add mine and I like to start from the beginning: First I have a bunch of questions you may want to answer: When your cancer was diagnosed, with a PSA of 95 and G9, how did you ended up with a radiation treatment? Did your urologist recommended it and did you consult an oncologist?...However, I believe some doctors do prescribe Viagra prior, during and post radiation treatment. Jose, some others maybe able to help you if you do what Highlander suggested, post your statistics and history so others can give you some advice....So as the others have advised find the best surgeon, radiation oncologist, oncologist and draw up a plan of attack and beat the hack out of the cancer. Good luck....Typically, in this situation oncologists will recommend hormone therapy and salvage radiation. In many cases that should cure the cancer....Hopefully everything will work out for him but ask his urologist about his views on adjuvant vs salvage radiation and if he recommend going ahead with adjuvant, would he also recommend adding hormone therapy prior/during/after adjuvant radiation. There were studies that indicated for very high risk cases, adjuvant radiation plus hormone offers better odds of getting rid of the cancer....My current situation is salvage radiation, with high risk of recurrence. Based on that study, the radiation oncologist recommended two years HT in addition to the radiation - I assume to increase the chances of the radiation being successful....Chuck Chuck, I had never heard of urologist prescribed Viagra prior to surgery. However, I believe some doctors do prescribe Viagra prior, during and post radiation treatment....Some oncologists like Dr. Myers advocate spot treating the metastatic spots with radiation in addition to hormone therapy. They reported some complete remissions from that treatment protocol....2. Most surgeons recommend not start radiation right away when positive margins are < a few mm as they may not cause BCR. 3. I watched a number of Da Vinci prostatectomy videos and noticed differences in surgical techniques of different surgeons. Most surgeons used a combination of Thermal Dissection and Athermal Dissection....Your enlarged prostate maybe too large for seed therapy, and in that case the radiation oncologist could prescribe hormone therapy to shrink the prostate to make seeds more effective. He should also add IMRT to ensure he gets all of your cancer....Sail on! Hi, not trying to play doctor, just curious and want to learn why his oncologist doesn't recommend radiation for the prostate area and spot radiation to kill off the metastasized cancers since my recollection was he only had a few spots?...However, some radiation oncologists would not recommend it if your prostate is enlarged. Most modern studies comparing radiation treatment to surgery found the outcome to be similar....It is unusual for physicians not to prescribe radiation therapy if the patient requests it. Usually it is because of age, physical limitations, health issues or they think radiotherapy would not help....Seeds is an excellent way to go for a localized cancer. However, some radiation oncologists would not recommend it if your prostate is enlarged....A combined HT/RT/HT had a far superior outcome than no HT, so much so that all oncologist and radiation oncologist recommend this. The only debate is the HT duration after RT....",
