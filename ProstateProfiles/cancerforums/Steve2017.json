      "Content": "Thanks Jim. I have been taking generic Flomax since 2014. It is becoming less efficient recently possibly due to prostate increased 20% in size in the last few months from 40 to 50 gm. I don't believe urine flow decreased due to PC. My father was diagnosed with PC at about age 80. He took one $1000 pill that gave him hot flashes so he stopped any further treatment. He had to catheterize for the last several years of his life until he was 89. His bladder was fine. One of my brothers had a radicle open prostatectomy 15 years ago. He goes for his last PSA test next month. He has been in the zero club since surgery. My other brother had radiation last year. Seems to be doing ok. This prostate cancer thing is becoming burdensome to me so I am leaning toward robotic removal before the end of the year. I freaked out when first diagnosed in 2014. This Forum helped me enormously.
