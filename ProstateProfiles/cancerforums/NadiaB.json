      "Content": "Thank you all for your comments and very helpful information. Yes, they initially found the elevated psa and enlargement during his physical exam this April. The urologist had said after the last psa that either way we would have to go for the biopsy to know for sure. He initially mentioned the MRI but then said we really didn't have to do it since we were planning in doing the biopsy anyway. DH and I had said when he stepped out that since we have the insurance and it's non-invasive just let's do it. SO HAPPY we did, otherwise we would not have the information for the nodule and the regular could maybe have missed it altogether? Could the nodule itself cause the prostate to become enlarged and raise the levels if it is benign? I guess we will know more after the 12th. I will keep you posted after the biopsy and try to remain positive. If it does turn out to be PC, we will tackle it head on. Thank you again and God bless you all. This is a wonderful forum. Nadia",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. What a wonderful forum, chock full of info and beautiful support. A little about me. My DH, 46, is scheduled for a biopsy on 9/12/17. I am beyond scared that he may have prostate cancer. No history of prostate cancer in the family. This is what has happened on our journey so far: 2012 psa 1.8 4/17 psa 4.7, slightly enlarged prostate, no nodules felt 5/17 psa 2.9 5/31 - urologist appt, no nodules felt, possibly an enlarged prostate, not sure 7/17 - psa 3.6 8/17 - 3T MRI which showed a nodule The urologist explained that the nodule found was approximately 1/2 inch, which sounds so big, and they graded it a \"3\" on a scale from 1-5. After the MRI, the urolgist changed the biopsy from an in office standard needle biopsy to a MRI guided biopsy at a surgicenter facility. Did they already find a Grade 3 cancer and are just going to biopsy to confirm these findings? Is even possible that this nodule can still be benign? We are worried but are putting our faith that we will tackle whatever comes head on. Thank you to everyone for this wonderful forum in advance. Nadia",
