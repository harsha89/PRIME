      "Content": "All, After several years of lurking, i have decided to join. Right now i am in PSA purgatory. After my last PSA of 6.1, urologist wants another biopsy. He refused to entertain any discussion of alternative testing or waiting. I decided to get a second opinion from a world renowned urologist at the University of Miami. After performing a very very thorough DRE and looking at the below numbers, he seemed unconcerned and recommended i do nothing at this time. He advised to come back in year. I told him i would be more comfortable with 6 months, and he said OK to that. I just wanted to get some input from the folks here as you have been a great source of real time information and support over the last three years. thanks, Eric",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your advice, input and suggestions. It's wonderful to hear from the guys in the trenches! As a \"Refusenik\", it is very difficult to accept ongoing random biopsies, so the suggestion for a more advanced method is greatly appreciated. A close friend of mine, ran down my history with his urologist, and while not happy with the family history, rising PSA, he was OK with a 6 month wait. My GP concurred as well. Irregardless of whether or not i meet in person with a third urologist, i will probably have another biopsy should the PSA go up again the next time it is checked. As for my father, I do not have many details from the 1996 time frame as i think PSA testing was new at the time. The only thing i found out from the treating urologist is that my father had a moderately differentiated cancer and that the BT was going to cure him. His PSA stayed at .01 for the rest if his life. In these days and times would they even had tested/treated him at his age? Anyways, i have a lot to think about, so thank you all. eric",
