      "Content": "Hi everyone, Looking for some support/information here. My grandfather, who is 85 years old, has been visibly healthy as long as I've known him. He still lives on his own, takes no medications, drives, etc. The past 2 weeks, he's had really bad lower back/leg pain. He also had trouble urinating. After a blood test, it was determined he had a PSA level of around 11. We're now waiting for him to get an appointment with a urologist. Nothing is confirmed, but from what we've been told, it looks like it might be prostate cancer that spread to his bones. From what I've read, this is generally stage 4 prostate cancer. What is the prognosis on this? Do people usually get better with treatment? Thanks.",
