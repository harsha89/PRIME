      "Content": "Have been reading your insights since I was diagnosed last month, am impressed and confused! I have to make the decision between surgery and RT, and although I've met with Oncologists and Prostate Surgeons, I'm as unsure as ever as to what to do. By the numbers: I'm 64 with T2a. Gleason left - 6(3+3) in 2/6 cores 10%, right - 7(4+3) in 4/7 cores 10% PSA scores have gone from 2.59 in 2010 to 12.83 on 6/1/17 (big gap in testing), 14.42 on 6/8/17, and 16.9 on 7/13/17. Besides the obvious Surgery vs. RT question, I have other \"factors\" to think of. I'm with Kaiser and not that impressed with their surgical staff. I turn 65 in October so I can move into the Medicare and supplemental insurance group in a couple of months. Because of my reluctance to have Kaiser do the surgery (I felt good about their RT people), I have priced out self pay and as you all know, it's crazy expensive (but I could do it if I had to). I know my PSA scores and its upward pace is concerning, but the rise could be attributed to lots of things (a fair amount of sex, countless prostate exams, the biopsy that was done on 6/22) Based upon those factors, the two surgeons I've met with out of the Kaiser network felt that I could wait until Medicare kicked in in October, but it's not their life. Also, if there is anyone out there from Denver, I would certainly love to hear recommendations. I have met with a Dr. Mark Jones, who I like but can't find anything out there about him. Obviously, I'm pretty confused, so any suggestions would be well received!",
