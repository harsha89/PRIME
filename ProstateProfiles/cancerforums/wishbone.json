      "Content": "Here's another option: HIFU. I had surgery scheduled but once I read about HIFU, I cancelled. I had PCa only on one side, and chose to have only that side ablated. Recovery was quick with essentially zero urinary or sexual issues. Also there is some good info out there about diet and supplements as related to prostate cancer. I was able to drive my PSA from 6.3 to 1.8 or so with diet and supplements only. The guru, in my opinion, is Charles Myers in Charlottesville, VA. He is a former cancer researcher, MD, had PCa himself, now devotes himself solely to men with PCa. He has a lot of good info on his web site and a new book on diet. Better yet, go see him if you can afford it- he doesn't take insurance. Educate yourself, and choose what fits you best. Good luck.",

      "Content": "I went thru the same mental anguish as you in trying to decide which treatment would be best. Surveys show that doctors will overwhelmingly recommend what they do, ie, surgeons will normally recommend surgery. So, you have to decide what is best for you. I had surgery scheduled, but cancelled after hearing and learning about HIFU. Side effects were very minimal, and I am following Dr. Charles Myers' advice on diet and supplements in great hope of minimizing recurrence in the half of my prostate that was not ablated. Diet and supplements really drove my PSA down before my treatment so I feel they are having a significant impact. Only time will tell, but if my PSA stays stable, I will know I made the right choice. If it returns, I'll probably have to look at radiation. At this short period after treatment, I'm delighted with my decision. Best wishes for wisdom and peace in your decision making process.",

      "Content": "There are so many side effects from having a prostate procedure that I would encourage you to do what you can to preserve a healthy prostate. I have become a follower of Dr. Charles Myers, himself a prostate cancer survivor, and now operates a clinic for men with PCa. Read his bio at this website. You can also subscribe to his newsletter, and even apply to be admitted as a patient if you want to travel to VA. As a former cancer researcher, he is able to sift thru studies that look at different supplements and even has an opinion on Avodart as a means of helping to prevent prostate cancer. Best wishes for a long, cancer-free life! Originally Posted by RobO I am 33 years old, and I was diagnosed with BPH at age 26. There is family medical history on my mother's side of prostate cancer, which ultimately killed her father (age 71) and brother (age 50). Additionally, I have done genetic screening through the website 23andMe.com, and there is states I have a 11.2% higher risk of developing prostate cancer between the ages of 35 - 79 than the average male population. Basically, I have begun to look at prostate cancer as a mater of 'when', not 'if.' I have had my PSA levels tested 3 times in the last 3 years, with a rise of only 1 point (last level was 1.3); however, I do not have complete faith in PSA screening. I've read recent articles on the validity of PSA testing, showing they may not be as useful as once thought. I've talked with my doctor about these studies, and he agrees with them, but suggests that I continue screening because, \"at least it's something.\" My concern (and his as well) is that once someone shows outward signs and symptoms of prostate cancer it may have already began to spread to other parts of the body, decreasing survival rates. The alternative is periodic invasive biopsies, which I fear insurance companies will not support unless there is due cause. My question: Is there such a thing as preemptive prostate removal? I completely understand the risks of incontinence and impotence associated with this major surgery and do not take this lightly, but these concerns are not nearly as important to me as living a longer life. Knowing my chances of developing cancer, I feel like I'm playing with fire and, statistically speaking, I will eventually get burned. If I addressed my concerns to a doctor and laid out my case, would preemptive removal be something I could get a doctor to consider? Thanks for reading.",

I would give the world for her and I am a very empathetic person so this has hit me also. I have begun to research things about it and seeing how she is a doctor she uses a lot of words I don't know what they are. I am trying to learn more about it so I can continue to be there for her without her having to explain everything to me. I know that the cancer has metastisized and he hasopted to take the drugs and not do the castration. I really just need to get educated and learn what's the best way to be there for my friend. I know this will be one of the worst things she will ever have to go through and neither one of us really believe in god so I want to be there for her. What are some of the treatments and what will the meds do to him? How do I respond when she talks to me about her dad not being there anymore? what are some nice things I can do? I know I will still invite her to things and treat her like my friend but there is no ignoring what's going on. What are some do's and don't's? Any help that anyone can give me would be great and I appreciate it. Adam",

Check out his bio; he is a former cancer researcher, and only recommends what he finds to be proven in studies. He also had PCa himself. Being on his diet and supplements caused my PSA to crash before I had HIFU. It didn't cure the cancer, obviously, but from the PSA results, really slowed it down. If you can afford to see him (he doesn't take insurance) talk to his office about an appt. Best wishes for 2013.",

You can also subscribe to his newsletters for a nominal cost, or order back issues of interest. I spent hours on the internet trying to learn more when I was first diagnosed, and have come to regard him as the best, most objective advice out there. He is a former Natl Inst of Health researcher and had PCa himself. His clinic only handles PCa patients, I believe. If you can afford to see him, new patient cost is $1500-2500, I have been told. He seems to be especially knowledgable around advanced PCa cases. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Jerseyguy Dave, Since you are considered low risk, take your time and do as much research as possible. When I was diagnosed two years ago my Dr. wanted me to decide on a treatment in a week. I decided on radiation (IMRT). Luckily I changed my mind last minute and boy am I glad. Over the last 2 years I have monitored my PSA and had two MRI's. Just this week I had a MRI guided biopsy which takes a biopsy sample from the suspicious tumor. This increases the accuracy of the biopsy, no guessing if they missed a higher grade cancer. I bring this up to point out you have to be your own advocate and educate yourself. I agree 100%. Many doctors want to do to you what they are good at, surgery or radiation. And they don't make money by keeping you healthy and away from their favorite procedure. Educate yourself, the longer you can avoid having to act on possible PCa, the longer you can avoid the side effects.",

      "Content": "Don't panic, just do lots of reading to educate yourself so you can make the best decision possible for you two. Here is reading I would recommend: buy Dr. Charles Myers' NEW book on diet and PCa. And visit his website. He has a PCa clinic in VA, is a former medical researcher, and PCs survivor himself. You can watch videos free at his site, and he offers a newsletter you can subscribe to or buy back issues of. My opinion is he has the most unbiased info out there on PCa, and has some definite opinions on what can help and what won't. I did hours of reading, and after finding his website, pretty much decided he is the source of what I do to keep the remaining half of my prostate healthy. Take a deep breath, and concentrate on becoming a PCa expert. Remember that doctors will usually recommend what they are familiar with- if they do RP, they will recommend RP. If they do seed, they will often recommend seeds. A recent study I saw found that, it wasn't an original idea of mine. Here is a quote from his book: \"There is a natural tendancy for all of us to blindly accept a doctor's advice. The idea is that you have put yourself in the hands of a highly competent professional whom you trust to make appropriate decisions about your health. This is not a good idea. There are many options....no one physician is an expert in the full range of possibilities. There is also a real tendancy for physicians to favor the particular approach they use; they are proud of their skills.\" Best of luck.",

      "Content": "I also had surgery scheduled, but was scared of the side effects. After hearing about HIFU and reading about it, I chose that route and have had no side effects. I also decided to change my diet, exercise more, and take supplements that I had good confidence in, ones that were recommended by doctors I trusted. MRI is more definitive for diagnosing PCa than ultrasound if that helps. My recommendation is to adopt the diet as outlined in Dr. Myers newer (just out) book on diet and PCa, exercise, take doctor-recommended supplements you have confidence in from reading, and thoroughly educate yourself before making a decision that you will live with forever- there are several posts here from men who are miserable after treatments because of the side effects. Visit Dr. Charles Myers website and watch some of this videos on PCa. Best wishes!",

Do doctors who do HIFU push more HIFU than surgeons push surgery? Probably not. And surgeons have close financial ties to surgery- that's how they make a lot of their money. To each his own.",

      "Content": "I have become a big fan of Dr. Charles Myers- retired cancer researcher, MD, had prostate cancer himself, now has a PCa-only clinic in VA. Visit his website and buy his newest book on nutrition, \"The New Prostate Cancer Nutrition Book\". Unfortunately he does not discuss supplements in the book. I subscribed to his newsletter after I was diagnosed last spring, and have found them to be very informative. His practice does not take insurance, so if you can afford a visit there, and want what I consider to be the most well-rounded information available, contact his office. I have read that 80% of his patients fly in- that should give some insight into his wisdom. Best of luck.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by oatmealnut A friend had a test in July when his PSA went from 2 a couple of years ago to 10. He cleaned out his diet and started on a regiment of herbs and this week his PSA results are 6.38. Any ideas as to what this could mean? He is considering to have a biopsy. Can anyone suggest a good doctor in Charlotte NC or Duke University area? Or Atlanta, GA? Thank you After I changed my diet and started taking a few supplements recommended by Dr. Charles Myers, my PSA went down more than that, %_wise. I don't think the combination can cure prostate cancer but I believe being healthy and taking some carefully selected supplements can slow progression. Dr. Myers has an impressive resume, has gone thru prostate cancer himself, and the only patients he sees are prostate cancer patients. He has posted a LOT of info on his website.",
