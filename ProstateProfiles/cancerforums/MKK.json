    "Content": "Carol-Tom started Jevtana 2 cycles and ago and side effects are different (was on taxotere for 8 cycles before this). Original diagnosis two years ago was stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. We get our first psa test since Jevtana next week. thus, no definitive results as of yet to review. He is having pains in areas that he didn't before, like shooting pains down his legs. He does seem to rebound more at the end of the cycle compared to taxotere where fatigue was worse. He has upped his pain meds significantly in last couple of weeks. When Tom was on taxo, we did reduce down the dose a bit with little change in his PSA.",
