      "Content": "Hello, I came back with some update on my father's case. After the MRI and Bone scan and a new round of biopsy we went to consult our urologist. Here is a brief summary of the situation: 1. MRI shows that tumor in prostate is definitely present and it has enlarged to the point that it presses against rectum (thus my father feel frequent urge to pass stool but every time only be able to pass a little bit) 2. Bone scan shows he is clean of bone met, as of now. 3. additional biopsy rules out transitional cell carsinoma, but confirms ductal carsinoma. The doctor says ductal carsinoma is rare (as some of you have pointed out), and in his career he has only handled less than 10 cases. Although he is a top surgen in Urology, he recommend not to perform radical prostatectomy since the tumor is so enlarged pressing against rectum and surgery will very likely lead to damage of the rectum. He indicated that ductal carsinoma does not respond to Hormone therapy very well, so he will start with a course of Chemo, complimented by HT. The chemo drug used is Docetaxel. At this point I do not know what to feel. Is Chemo therapy generally considered more damaging (side effects) than other type of treatment? Is my father going to suffer serious side effects from Docetaxel? From NCCN guide this seems to be the most recommended drug for chemo. Anyone who went through Chemo can share the experience?",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am back again, on topic of my father's diagnosis. After reading the biopsy more carefully and studied a bit more from Pat Walsh's book (thanks to our board monitor Highlander), I now understand that biopsy shows my father has Ductal adenocarcinoma and Transitional cell carcinoma present (doctor also did not exclude the most common type of prostate tumor, Acinar adenocarcinoma). Both of above are usually aggressive and thus get a high gleason score of 5/4=9. I read from literature that Transitional cell carcinoma usually comes from bladder, which means my dad might have bladder cancer. But the doctor said according to biopsy indication, my father's case is more likely that TCC is the result of influence from Ductal adenocarcinoma, so hopefully my dad does not have bladder cancer. My question: 1. how does these two types of cancer cells affect our treatment option? while typical Prostate cancer can be treated by Radiation Therapy or surgery, would these two type of cells limit my option? 2. Can TCC really be the result of influence from Ductal adenocarcinoma? How do we know he is safe from Bladder cancer for now?",

      "Content": "Hi Highlander, Perhaps it is worthwhile to explain how the PC was discovered (or suspected). My dad's initial symptom was difficulty in urination (and with past history of blood in urine, for about a year). Doctor performed TURP on him. It was during the TURP, through the transurethral scope, doctor saw the tissue block (almost 2-3 cm in diameter) hanging and blocking the urethral. Thus the primary result of the TURP procedure was to remove this block of tissue, and subsequently biopsy was performed on this piece of tissue. I even have a picture of the tissue block doctor observed at the time of the TURP. I am posting it down below: (will take it down if it violates forum rules or considered too disturbing) YUP, PHOTOS ARE NOT ALLOWED, SO I HAD TO DELETE IT. SORRY 'BOUT THAT. --CHUCK",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I joined this site on behalf of my father (71), who has recently be diagnosed with Prostate Cancer (maybe). During a TURP procedure doctor sliced off tissue from his prostate (it is actually hanging out of prostate, blocking the urethra) and did a biopsy. The biopsy shows a Gleason score of 9 so doctor immediately asked for him to go through MRI (scheduled to be done on 29th Dec) and bone-scan(ECT) (Scheduled to be done on 13th Jan 2017). However, he has a fairly low PSA of 2.28. My questions are: 1. even if the tumor grade is indeed aggressive (I am seeking a second opinion on the biopsy right now), does the low PSA value usually indicate bone metastasis has not happened yet? (or the other way round, that bone metastasis usually would cause a higher PSA?) 2. The bone scan (ECT) was scheduled to be done 2 weeks from now. Is it too late? should we race with time and get the bone scan done as soon as possible? Thanks a lot for everyone who read this and appreciate if you can share your opinion and views.",

      "Content": "Thanks a lot to all who replied! What worries me a lot is the high Gleason score. I am hoping the second opinion on biopsy will give me different results. Some of the question I still have in mind: 1. Is there any positive relation between high Gleason score and increased chance of bone metastasis? 2. The biopsy was conducted on a piece of tissue growth that is literally hanging down from prostate (near the exit of bladder) and blocking urethra, (very much like uvula hanging from throat). Is the biopsy of such tissue a reliable diagnosis of PC and its grade? Would doctor advise a transrectal biopsy to confirm? Thanks again to everyone!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi firemana! Congrats! It appears that IMRT has achieved the objective and has knocked out approx 99.7% the PSA producing cells. Your dad started out with a PSA of 2.28 and is now 0.006 ng/ml. While we're not qualified to guess if any or how many remnant Ductal PC cells may persist, we hope that subsequent chemo will destroy them. Others with experience with Chemo following radiation will chime in. Other Forum members have commented previously about anti nausea medications to accompany chemo and the importance of getting them on board prior to each chemo session. Your MO will provide solutions. Best wishes getting over this next hurdle with a soft landing! MF Hi Michael, thanks for the encouragement. Actually, my question is more about if there is any danger of postponing the chemo and monitor the tumour growth via MRI for a while first. The primary reason being apprehension of side effects of cisplatin (not only highly vomit inducing, but also highly toxic to kidney). In fact my father decided to get another MRI after a month, then decide if it is necessary to go for Chemo. I am seriously torn whether I should support his decision or not.",

      "Content": "Hi Michael and all, Thanks for the valuable information. Since my last update, my father decided not to proceed with Chemo immediately after IMRT. That was around June 2017. Since then a lot happened. From June 2017 to June 2018, time passed peacefully. He went for quarterly MRI to monitor the tumour site and the tumour was no longer growing. near end of June, he started to feel nausea and loss of balance. We went for an MRI of the brain and found a tumour inside his brain (left cerebellum area). Surgery was not an option after evaluation, and we went back to the same radiology doctor that treated his prostate tumour. Of course at this time doctors were quite certain this is the result of metastasis, and he was sent for gamma ray surgery. The surgery was very successful, all symptom immediately gone, and almost no side effects. Merely 2 months later, in September 2018, he developed persistent cough, and went for CT scan. Scan shows several sites of lymph node enlargement in the lungs. Doctor's assessment was that there is metastasis in the lung. Finally he had to start Chemo treatment. Doctors told me there were not much proven knowledge on what kind of chemo drug is effective against Ductal Prostate cancer, and after they scanned known literature in international medical research journals, they chose to use a combination of Gemcitabine and Lobaplatin. After two weeks of injection (once a week), he took a 3 week break. Now he has started the second round. The side effects were quite minimal, vomited only once or twice in the two weeks of treatment. White blood cells and platelet were quite heavily suppressed but climbed back after 3 weeks break. The best news is, a recent CT scan shows the affected lymph nodes were all reducing in size, and he is no longer coughing. He is feeling great, physically and mentally. So we keep our fingers crossed, and hope for the best. Meanwhile, we wish to send message to all who is struggling with Ductal PC, there is hope and hang in there.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I am back again, sharing with you on my dad's Ductal PC treatment. He went through 30 sessions of IMRT, which ended 24th April, and in May 16th he did blood tests and MRI. The blood test shows PSA level at 0.006, and MRI shows tumor size shrunk to about 1/6 of original size. Doctor has recommended to follow up with chemo in order to prevent metastasis. Since he did not respond to Taxotere earlier, doctor is inclined to recommend cisplatin or other platin type chemo drug. We are worried if he can battle the side effects of cisplatin since it is highly vomit inducing. Meanwhile we want to seek an option if we can monitor the current situation and see if the tumor is stabalised (non growing). I was hoping he can have some rest time before going into chemo or he can avoid chemo at all. So right now, my focus question is, is PSA level a good indicator to monitor ductal PC tumor growth (although I know ductal PC often produce normal level PSA) or is it more appropriate to monitor via MRI, say maybe MRI after every month?",
