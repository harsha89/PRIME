    "Content": "Hello to everyone here! My father-in-law has metastatic prostate cancer. He is 60 and has been diagnosed one year ago based on biopsy which revealed a Gleason 9 (5+4) score and a whole body scintigraphy which showed multiple bone metastasis. He started Diphereline (HT) and Zometa (zolendronic acid) and after treatment initiation the bone pains disappeared and he started to get better. The PSA was 59 at diagnose time and after 9 months of treatment dropped to 3 which is in range for his age. The bone pains came back and I am afraid that the disease is still progressing despite normal PSA value. Because the medical system in my country is crappy no MRI was done at diagnose time. If we had an initial MRI we could see if the metastases progressed inspite of a normal PSA level and good blood work. Does bone pain relapse means that the metastasis are progressing? Does that mean that in the bones, cancer cells that no longer secrete PSA are thriving? Is chimio the next step? If someone has gone through this situation before please answer. Doctors don't care much. He told his doctor that he is in a great deal of pain and the answer was... \"It will pass\". I am not a native english speaker so please excuse my inaccuracies.",
