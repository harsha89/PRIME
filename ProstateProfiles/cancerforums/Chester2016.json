      "Content": "Originally Posted by yolli71 I just had my first PSA test done last week after I had robotic surgery on Nov. 12 (3 months ago). Gleason ended up being 3+4 after surgery (biopsy said 3+3). I was supposed to meet with my urologist to discuss it tomorrow, but unfortunately we expect to get some bad weather here tomorrow (DC area) so my urologist cancelled my appointment. That being said, my PSA score was still recorded in my online medical records and it showed my PSA as: <0.100 ng/mL This has me a little alarmed as everything I've been reading says the first PSA test should be around 0, or at worst. .01 - .09. I called and left a message for my urologist but have yet to hear back from him. Does this mean the surgery was unsuccessful? Is it possible the test was inaccurate? Or should I not be concerned with .1 even though that sounds a little high (to me)for just having surgery 3 months ago? Any advice would be appreciated! Request an uPsa. A single digit psa test after RP doesn't provide the required info. But you have a good pathology and the \"<\" sign so you're fine. Celebrate.",

      "Content": "I've too have exhausted my curative options, so the uPsa is probably no longer needed. But my uro still uses it. And I also would prefer to decide for myself whether or not to have anxiety. For those of us who've had adverse pathology factors after surgery, i.e. positive margins, high volume involvement, EPE, LN, etc. the likelihood of needing additional treatment is much higher. The uPsa helps to establish earlier whether there is an upward trend. Earlier response with secondary treatment seems to have better results, (I've been told). But after SRT, there probably isn't any benefit to using a uPsa for a regular test.",

My uro and RO indicated that a BCR was likely inevitable. And it seems to be currently unaffected by the SRT. There could be a delayed reaction to the SRT, or the PSA could remain stable, which would be fine with me. In any case, at this point it seems the SRT may have been done needlessly.

And the RO was perplexed and advised that it should've dropped by 3 months. Needless to say, the past 3 months waiting has been stressful. Hopefully the trend will continue. In any case, it seems that radiation can take longer than 3 months for initial results, as per the encouraging words from you fellas. I'm just a bit puzzled why my RO wouldn't have advised me the same and been a bit more positive. It would've eliminated a lot of anxiety. But all is better now, (at least for another 3 months).",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Hello All; Looks like I'm heading for salvage radiation. My PSA 3 months ago was .03 and yesterday it is .05. I had surgery by a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic but that doctor apparently left the clinic a few months ago and now I can't even message him. They made me a followup appointment with a Certified Nurse Practitioner for 3 months from now and I can't even message her to have questions answered because apparently you can only message doctors through Mychart. How do I find a Radiation Oncologist ? Are there world class radiation oncologists like there are world class doctors? How do I find one? Should I receive treatment at the Cleveland Clinic or should I travel somewhere ? I really want to do something as soon as possible because .03 to .05 is quite a big jump. If I wait even 3 months, it may jump to .07. Tim You have time for analysis and researching SRT options. But that time is now. I used a RapidArc machine at MDAnderson with no ADT and no lymph node involvement. There are other options, i.e. proton, added ADT, LN included, etc. With your low psa it's questionable whether ADT or LN would be necessary.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Hello All; Looks like I'm heading for salvage radiation. My PSA 3 months ago was .03 and yesterday it is .05. I had surgery by a doctor at the Cleveland Clinic but that doctor apparently left the clinic a few months ago and now I can't even message him. They made me a followup appointment with a Certified Nurse Practitioner for 3 months from now and I can't even message her to have questions answered because apparently you can only message doctors through Mychart. How do I find a Radiation Oncologist ? Are there world class radiation oncologists like there are world class doctors? How do I find one? Should I receive treatment at the Cleveland Clinic or should I travel somewhere ? I really want to do something as soon as possible because .03 to .05 is quite a big jump. If I wait even 3 months, it may jump to .07. Tim You have time for analysis and researching SRT options. But that time is now. I used a RapidArc machine at MDAnderson with no ADT and no lymph node involvement. There are other options, i.e. proton, added ADT, LN included, etc. With your low psa it's questionable whether ADT or LN would be necessary.",

      "Content": "I've too have exhausted my curative options, so the uPsa is probably no longer needed. But my uro still uses it. And I also would prefer to decide for myself whether or not to have anxiety. For those of us who've had adverse pathology factors after surgery, i.e. positive margins, high volume involvement, EPE, LN, etc. the likelihood of needing additional treatment is much higher. The uPsa helps to establish earlier whether there is an upward trend. Earlier response with secondary treatment seems to have better results, (I've been told). But after SRT, there probably isn't any benefit to using a uPsa for a regular test.",

      "Content": "Just received my 6 month post-SRT Psa. Relieved to see it has dropped to 0.009. Down from 0.023. My 3 month post-SRT Psa showed little or no reduction. And the RO was perplexed and advised that it should've dropped by 3 months. Needless to say, the past 3 months waiting has been stressful. Hopefully the trend will continue. In any case, it seems that radiation can take longer than 3 months for initial results, as per the encouraging words from you fellas. I'm just a bit puzzled why my RO wouldn't have advised me the same and been a bit more positive. It would've eliminated a lot of anxiety. But all is better now, (at least for another 3 months).",

My 1st psa about 3 months after SRT was effectively unchanged, from .023 prior to .020 after. The RO had expected a bigger drop. The uro says that it could take a while for results to show. At this point there is nothing left to do other than wait for the 6 month SRT. Does anyone have experience with a slow resulting SRT, or is this an early sign of failure?",

      "Sample": "Originally Posted by yolli71 I just had my first PSA test done last week after I had robotic surgery on Nov. 12 (3 months ago). Gleason ended up being 3+4 after surgery (biopsy said 3+3)....Gleason ended up being 3+4 after surgery (biopsy said 3+3). I was supposed to meet with my urologist to discuss it tomorrow, but unfortunately we expect to get some bad weather here tomorrow (DC area) so my urologist cancelled my appointment....And I also would prefer to decide for myself whether or not to have anxiety. For those of us who've had adverse pathology factors after surgery, i.e. positive margins, high volume involvement, EPE, LN, etc. the likelihood of needing additional treatment is much higher....",
