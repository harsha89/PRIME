      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi NH, Welcome to the forum with a big hope that you will not need to join the actual Prostate Cancer forum. It is possible that your dad's elevated PSA is caused by a double combination of things: 1- the potential infection that he has been taking anti-biotics for 2- enlarged prostate Either of those conditions can elevate the PSA which, in your dad's age group, should be no higher than 4.5. Thus, dealing with BOTH conditions could further elevate the PSA as opposed to having just one of them. The key to the immediate future will be that next PSA test. If he prefers not to return to the previous lab, he should seek another lab that uses exactly the same assey method, otherwise the results may not match. The same methodology needs to be performed on PSA tests. If his PSA is down significantly, much of the previous PSA reading could be attributed to infection. BPH (enlarged prostate) also elevates the PSA, although I don't know if it would go as high as 15.9. Please let us know what his new PSA reading shows. The negative aspect of your information is the free PSA. While fPSA cannot diagnose or confirm prostate cancer (ONLY a biopsy can do this), it can be a suggestive hint. A general rule of thumb is that the higher the percentage the better -- anything under about 15% is suggestive of POSSIBLE prostate cancer. A great fPSA reading would be 25% or higher. Here is a link to one article on free PSA: https://www.healthline.com/health/pr...ee-psa#purpose Right now, I would not be overly concerned and would also congratulate your dad for staying on top of this. Please let us know how things are going -- and best of luck to him! Chuck Hi Chuck, just a question - is it possible for a cancer to be Stage III even if nothing was felt during the DRE? Just an update - Dad got his MRI done and it came clean. Will probably get his PSA checked out later and see the doctor again. But I believe the MRI coming clean is a good sign right?.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, My dad (age: 65) just got a routine test done recently and his PSA came to 15.9 and free PSA ratio is .093. He had no symptoms before the test and checked his PSA only because the hospital staff mentioned it. But after the test results came out, we did some research and he said that over the last year or so while urinating, he had some minor issues emptying. He said that the flow was obviously not the same as when he was young, but he attributed it to ageing. Said when he thinks hard about it, maybe on some days when he didnt drink enough water, he felt some burning after the urination was over (not during as mentioned on various websites). Rest everything in the blood work is normal. He went to see a urologist who did a digital rectal examination and said the prostate feels fine and its possible some infection/inflammation which caused the PSA to rise. Put him on anti-biotics (Levofloxin - drug class: Fluoroquinolone) for two weeks and asked to get the PSA tested after that. Dad says that after two days of anti-biotics the burning has completely disappeared. (He is a bit of a hypochondriac like me, so I am not sure how much to read into it) This whole episode has left all of us a little concerned. He has been on Blood Pressure medication for almost 40 years now, but apart from that is absolutely fit and still works and runs his own business. We do have have a family history of enlarged prostate, and my grandfather and his brother have had their prostate removed around the age of 70, but no family history of any cancer whatsoever. Anything to be concerned about? Would be grateful if anyone can shed some light on this. Thanks",

My dad spoke a doctor (not a urologist) friend of his who suggested an MRI which he plans to get done in the next couple of days. He said there is no harm in getting the MRI done so I guess that would definitely give a better indication of the current scenario if there is any sign of prostate cancer. Will keep you updated.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone, My dad (age: 65) just got a routine test done recently and his PSA came to 15.9 and free PSA ratio is .093. He had no symptoms before the test and checked his PSA only because the hospital staff mentioned it. But after the test results came out, we did some research and he said that over the last year or so while urinating, he had some minor issues emptying. He said that the flow was obviously not the same as when he was young, but he attributed it to ageing. Said when he thinks hard about it, maybe on some days when he didnt drink enough water, he felt some burning after the urination was over (not during as mentioned on various websites). Rest everything in the blood work is normal. He went to see a urologist who did a digital rectal examination and said the prostate feels fine and its possible some infection/inflammation which caused the PSA to rise. Put him on anti-biotics (Levofloxin - drug class: Fluoroquinolone) for two weeks and asked to get the PSA tested after that. Dad says that after two days of anti-biotics the burning has completely disappeared. (He is a bit of a hypochondriac like me, so I am not sure how much to read into it) This whole episode has left all of us a little concerned. He has been on Blood Pressure medication for almost 40 years now, but apart from that is absolutely fit and still works and runs his own business. We do have have a family history of enlarged prostate, and my grandfather and his brother have had their prostate removed around the age of 70, but no family history of any cancer whatsoever. Anything to be concerned about? Would be grateful if anyone can shed some light on this. Thanks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi NH, Welcome to the forum with a big hope that you will not need to join the actual Prostate Cancer forum. It is possible that your dad's elevated PSA is caused by a double combination of things: 1- the potential infection that he has been taking anti-biotics for 2- enlarged prostate Either of those conditions can elevate the PSA which, in your dad's age group, should be no higher than 4.5. Thus, dealing with BOTH conditions could further elevate the PSA as opposed to having just one of them. The key to the immediate future will be that next PSA test. If he prefers not to return to the previous lab, he should seek another lab that uses exactly the same assey method, otherwise the results may not match. The same methodology needs to be performed on PSA tests. If his PSA is down significantly, much of the previous PSA reading could be attributed to infection.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by po18guy Sorry to hear of your worries. What does dad think? After all, it's his life. Virtually all prostates enlarge - it is an extremely common, natural process. Have a read: https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-...s/syc-20370087 Two key points: 1. The DRE was good. 2. The situation improved with antibiotics. It would be far more concerning if it did not improve with antibiotics. A re-test for PSA would be proper, but pre-test instructions must be followed for an accurate test. As well, the same methodology and testing lab must be used for the results to have any meaning. Thank you for the reply. Dad is slightly concerned, but is definitely a lot less stressed than I am. He seems to think its an inflammation/infection and should be okay after the medication. The doctor didnt mention anything regarding BPH etc, actually according to my dad, the doctor was extremely cool, relaxed and didnt talk much except at the end while giving instructions about the medication and that it seems like some inflammation/infection. Another thing was that BPH might cause high PSA but it also increases the free PSA there by increasing the ratio - which isnt the case in my dad's report. He is supposed to travel abroad in two weeks, so he feels he will get the PSA test done after 1 week to see if there is any modification in the result. He did not have a very pleasant experience with the lab the last time, so he might choose a different one this time. Fingers crossed.",
