At your age, you also have a higher risk of bladder cancer and other complications down the road if you choose brachy or radiation; a thought worth considering. The side effects of hormone treatment therapy, usually prescribed with radiation, are also worth looking into. The bottom line is no one can predict with complete accuracy what the cancer is doing once you've found it. Until final pathology after a radical procedure it's still an estimate. My initial diagnosis of GS 3+3 turned out to be a GS 4+3 and 15% of the gland was involved. It was comforting to know the extent of the cancer once I decided to have it removed completely as it reinforced that my final decision was valid. Best of luck with whatever you decide. Bill",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Shinytop Dr did dre first, said all was normal. Did the ultrasound, said normal prostate is about 30 grams, mine was 140. He commented that may be the reason for the upturn in PSA. Now the wait for the biopsy, 12 cores, results. When I was discussing biopsy results with my surgeon he talked about the size of the prostrate with respect to the percentages of cancer found in the cores. He stated that if the the percent discovered in each core of a biopsy from a small prostate were the same as that of a large prostate, and an equal number of cores were sampled; then it MAY indicate a more severe case of cancer with the large prostate because there is more tissue to work with and less tissue taken as a percentage of the whole gland. This made sense since I had normal DRE and my prostate was a normal size at 28 grams. Stated differently: If my prostate were 140 grams they'd have to take 5 times the cores for an equivalent sampling. Not sure if this is ever considered, but worth a brief discussion when determining the extent of cancer that MAY be present. This was discussed without regard to the fact that enlarged prostates more often cause increased PSA results. Bill",

At your age, you also have a higher risk of bladder cancer and other complications down the road if you choose brachy or radiation; a thought worth considering. The side effects of hormone treatment therapy, usually prescribed with radiation, are also worth looking into. The bottom line is no one can predict with complete accuracy what the cancer is doing once you've found it. Until final pathology after a radical procedure it's still an estimate. My initial diagnosis of GS 3+3 turned out to be a GS 4+3 and 15% of the gland was involved.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RickRed52 In Aug one month prior to prostate cancer awareness month I tried to get our local newspaper to do a story about prostate cancer. They wouldn't do it. I tried three other times, each time I failed. For months I'd read the paper and be annoyed at the number of stories I felt were much less important than the story I wanted our paper to print. So last month I sent an e-mail directly to the Modesto Bee Editor. I was shocked within a week I'd been contacted by a reporter. This is a link to the story that appears on the front page of the Modesto Bee on 12/16/13. There was much more I'd hoped they print, but I was pleased with the article: http://www.modbee.com/2013/12/15/309...-prostate.html Congratulations, Rick, great idea. I live in Reno now, but left mine in Burlington, VT.",

Has anyone taken any medication or natural remedy that is effective? Spasms of the bladder and urinary tract can be caused by irritants & inflammation and manifest themselves as urinary frequency or urgency. Brachytherapy or seeds release their radiation over time and one of the major side effects is a burning and a feeling of urgency. Ditropan or Ditropan XL (generic name: Oxybutynin) is an effective antispasmodic used to treat spasms of the bladder and may give you some relief. You my want to discuss the duration of release of the radiation from the seeds with your Radiologist and ask him if that may be the reason for your discomfort; and whether this is a valid treatment for what you're experiencing.",

      "Content": "Fran, I was doing the AS and since I had no history of PSA prior to 63 years old I was at a disadvantage. When PSA doubles in one year or less it's problematic. Since my core samplings were so slight, PSA below 10, DRE normal with no irregularities, and Gleason 6 they wanted to watch my numbers for developments. When the PSA jumped from 8.4 to 12.4, coupled with a family (father) history of the disease and positive diagnosis everything was accelerated. In retrospect, I could have acted earlier, but the initial results from my surgeon and the post-op pathology is that I acted soon enough. On another front, I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of RRP patients and it makes me wonder at all about the validity of AS. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had RRP found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be asking my urologist/surgeon about, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer will give you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This would contradict the validity of AS altogether. To answer your question: I relied on all the crap statistics, including those articles in media releases from the NY Times and others, that minimized DRE & PSA for all age groups based on morbidity and mortality rates vs un-tested and untreated subjects. My cousin fell within the timeframe when this controversy was at its height. His physician did not inform him of either a nodule on DRE or increasing PSA values happening for 2 years, and once he had the RRP found it had spread outside the gland. His life has changed for the worse as he continues with treatment and issues.

      "Content": "Fran, Quite frustrating. I did find it much more convenient to sleep with the male urinal. As soon as I become erect I have no control and cannot make it to the bathroom. Tried holding my penis, but the pressure caused it to act like a wild hose before I reached the toilet so the urinal gives me some sanity and sleep. I've been walking 5-6 miles during the day and can't retain anything, but doing a kegel while sitting down allows me to trickle once I reach the toilet provided I don't wait too long. I guess it's baby steps.

      "Content": "Fran, I was doing the AS and since I had no history of PSA prior to 63 years old I was at a disadvantage. When PSA doubles in one year or less it's problematic. Since my core samplings were so slight, PSA below 10, DRE normal with no irregularities, and Gleason 6 they wanted to watch my numbers for developments. When the PSA jumped from 8.4 to 12.4, coupled with a family (father) history of the disease and positive diagnosis everything was accelerated. In retrospect, I could have acted earlier, but the initial results from my surgeon and the post-op pathology is that I acted soon enough. On another front, I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of RRP patients and it makes me wonder at all about the validity of AS. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had RRP found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be asking my urologist/surgeon about, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer will give you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This would contradict the validity of AS altogether. To answer your question: I relied on all the crap statistics, including those articles in media releases from the NY Times and others, that minimized DRE & PSA for all age groups based on morbidity and mortality rates vs un-tested and untreated subjects. My cousin fell within the timeframe when this controversy was at its height. His physician did not inform him of either a nodule on DRE or increasing PSA values happening for 2 years, and once he had the RRP found it had spread outside the gland. His life has changed for the worse as he continues with treatment and issues.

I have absolutely no bladder control, dribble constantly, and without using a male urinal during the evening, would be wetting everything every night. I did Kegel prior to surgery and am doing them now, but don't seem to be making any progress. I have not asked my surgeon about the sphincters yet, but will do so next week at my appointment.

      "Content": "Fran, I was doing the AS and since I had no history of PSA prior to 63 years old I was at a disadvantage. When PSA doubles in one year or less it's problematic. Since my core samplings were so slight, PSA below 10, DRE normal with no irregularities, and Gleason 6 they wanted to watch my numbers for developments. When the PSA jumped from 8.4 to 12.4, coupled with a family (father) history of the disease and positive diagnosis everything was accelerated. In retrospect, I could have acted earlier, but the initial results from my surgeon and the post-op pathology is that I acted soon enough. On another front, I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of RRP patients and it makes me wonder at all about the validity of AS. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had RRP found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be asking my urologist/surgeon about, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer will give you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This would contradict the validity of AS altogether. To answer your question: I relied on all the crap statistics, including those articles in media releases from the NY Times and others, that minimized DRE & PSA for all age groups based on morbidity and mortality rates vs un-tested and untreated subjects. My cousin fell within the timeframe when this controversy was at its height. His physician did not inform him of either a nodule on DRE or increasing PSA values happening for 2 years, and once he had the RRP found it had spread outside the gland. His life has changed for the worse as he continues with treatment and issues.

      "Content": "Fran, I was doing the AS and since I had no history of PSA prior to 63 years old I was at a disadvantage. When PSA doubles in one year or less it's problematic. Since my core samplings were so slight, PSA below 10, DRE normal with no irregularities, and Gleason 6 they wanted to watch my numbers for developments. When the PSA jumped from 8.4 to 12.4, coupled with a family (father) history of the disease and positive diagnosis everything was accelerated. In retrospect, I could have acted earlier, but the initial results from my surgeon and the post-op pathology is that I acted soon enough. On another front, I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of RRP patients and it makes me wonder at all about the validity of AS. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had RRP found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be asking my urologist/surgeon about, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer will give you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This would contradict the validity of AS altogether. To answer your question: I relied on all the crap statistics, including those articles in media releases from the NY Times and others, that minimized DRE & PSA for all age groups based on morbidity and mortality rates vs un-tested and untreated subjects. My cousin fell within the timeframe when this controversy was at its height. His physician did not inform him of either a nodule on DRE or increasing PSA values happening for 2 years, and once he had the RRP found it had spread outside the gland. His life has changed for the worse as he continues with treatment and issues.

      "Content": "Thanks, everyone, for your responses. After reading some entries to another blog I thought I was alone in my short recovery period. Glad to know I am in the ballpark. I actually was able to perform 5 or 6 kegels while standing over the toilet today and expel some fluid each time. I also read several varying stories about how many to do or not to do. I'm concentrating mostly on doing one and gingerly trying to make it to the toilet after sitting down for a period. It makes me feel more normal if I can at least get there and expel some, regardless of how much, knowing I'm on the right track.

      "Content": "Fran, Quite frustrating. I did find it much more convenient to sleep with the male urinal. As soon as I become erect I have no control and cannot make it to the bathroom. Tried holding my penis, but the pressure caused it to act like a wild hose before I reached the toilet so the urinal gives me some sanity and sleep. I've been walking 5-6 miles during the day and can't retain anything, but doing a kegel while sitting down allows me to trickle once I reach the toilet provided I don't wait too long. I guess it's baby steps.

      "Content": "Fran, Quite frustrating. I did find it much more convenient to sleep with the male urinal. As soon as I become erect I have no control and cannot make it to the bathroom. Tried holding my penis, but the pressure caused it to act like a wild hose before I reached the toilet so the urinal gives me some sanity and sleep. I've been walking 5-6 miles during the day and can't retain anything, but doing a kegel while sitting down allows me to trickle once I reach the toilet provided I don't wait too long. I guess it's baby steps.

      "Content": "Fran, I was doing the AS and since I had no history of PSA prior to 63 years old I was at a disadvantage. When PSA doubles in one year or less it's problematic. Since my core samplings were so slight, PSA below 10, DRE normal with no irregularities, and Gleason 6 they wanted to watch my numbers for developments. When the PSA jumped from 8.4 to 12.4, coupled with a family (father) history of the disease and positive diagnosis everything was accelerated. In retrospect, I could have acted earlier, but the initial results from my surgeon and the post-op pathology is that I acted soon enough. On another front, I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of RRP patients and it makes me wonder at all about the validity of AS. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had RRP found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be asking my urologist/surgeon about, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer will give you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This would contradict the validity of AS altogether. To answer your question: I relied on all the crap statistics, including those articles in media releases from the NY Times and others, that minimized DRE & PSA for all age groups based on morbidity and mortality rates vs un-tested and untreated subjects. My cousin fell within the timeframe when this controversy was at its height. His physician did not inform him of either a nodule on DRE or increasing PSA values happening for 2 years, and once he had the RRP found it had spread outside the gland. His life has changed for the worse as he continues with treatment and issues.

I actually was able to perform 5 or 6 kegels while standing over the toilet today and expel some fluid each time. I also read several varying stories about how many to do or not to do. I'm concentrating mostly on doing one and gingerly trying to make it to the toilet after sitting down for a period. It makes me feel more normal if I can at least get there and expel some, regardless of how much, knowing I'm on the right track.

      "Content": "Fran, Quite frustrating. I did find it much more convenient to sleep with the male urinal. As soon as I become erect I have no control and cannot make it to the bathroom. Tried holding my penis, but the pressure caused it to act like a wild hose before I reached the toilet so the urinal gives me some sanity and sleep. I've been walking 5-6 miles during the day and can't retain anything, but doing a kegel while sitting down allows me to trickle once I reach the toilet provided I don't wait too long. I guess it's baby steps.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Gabka Hello there, Straight after surgery our urologist said he is confident that everything went well and cancer was removed tumor was pressing on the wall of the prostate. Gabka, Unfortunately, you're resigned to sit and wait for the PSA result as nothing more can be done to determine the success of your husbands operation. My final pathology accelerated to a 4+3 from a 3+3, and I was elated that I had reacted when I did to have a radical. As it turns out, I've followed up with some good numbers which hopefully you'll get in time. My surgeon gave me a similar synopsis post-op and told me we'd have to wait for the numbers to confirm it. I would say, from the quotes I noted, you're in pretty good shape, so since you have to do the waiting game, stay positive and deal with what's at hand. Pressing on the wall is not going through it!! Best wishes for those chips falling the right way. Bill",

At .2 I decided to undergo 37 treatments of radiation at a clinic in Sylva N.C. I waited 3 mos ,went & got my psa checked & this was the result. They must have used some new super duper testing apparatus . I thought they could`nt detect any psa below a certain level. I sure hope it lasts for awhile. My next test will be in 3 mos I guess. My clinician told me that if the PSA reading is preceded by '<' then that is as low as the test can accurately determine the reading to be. That is a reading of <0.01 means in essence zero and would indicate the ultra sensitive PSA test was performed.",

I found out that the Internal Sphincter (closest to the bladder) was probably the one I was isolating pre-op and since that is now removed I have to rely on the Exterior Sphincter which was not my main control mechanism before my radical prostatectomy. I was also given a schedule of kegals for 8 weeks starting after the operation. It was twice per day and increased in intensity as time went on. It is a muscle, and it only makes sense that you can fatigue it, but also train it. Squeezing yur buttocks does not isolate the sphincter of the urethra which is what you want to control. I believe the easiest way to feel this sphincter is during urination and then practicing contracting it once you have isolated it. I leaked continually while with the catheter and up until the present. I'm 6 weeks out and only now am seeing slight results, but you'll find that is quite individualized. My best advice, as obtained from the many supportive entries here, is be a patient patient. Best of luck. Bill",

I may have been able to put off the inevitable for a few more months. I played the AS game and hit the wall as time ran out with surgery being my option of choice. Best of luck to all in the club, I hope my numbers and results can be helpful to those of you wrestling with decisions.

The discomfort was not bothersome, but the bleeding seemed unnatural. I was scoped and my surgeon showed me the micro bleeding that was occurring around my sutures that he said were designed to dissolve in 3-4 months. Only running caused bleeding and at 13 weeks it abruptly stopped. Could the sutures possibly be causing the stress and discomfort?",

      "Content": "Centsible, You're at the start of your journey, but know that you'll have improvement and it will take time. I am 10 months out and still wear pads. I saw my surgeon last week and he said that active individuals have the most difficulty regaining continence and potency. One study I read showed 95% recovery after 1 year, 67% after 6 months, and 33% after 3 months. I am a runner and biker and had the most difficulty when I exercised and actually had bleeding from the disposable stitches until 13 weeks when they finally dissolved. Pads are still in my life. My surgeon explained that the interior sphincter is heavily involved in the prostate gland and integrated into the pelvic floor so its removal and weakening the surrounding tissue is a given. Best wishes, we here on the forum hope you have a speedy and uneventful recovery from symptoms, but focus on the big picture and being cancer free. Bill",

      "Content": "Centsible, You're at the start of your journey, but know that you'll have improvement and it will take time. I am 10 months out and still wear pads. I saw my surgeon last week and he said that active individuals have the most difficulty regaining continence and potency. One study I read showed 95% recovery after 1 year, 67% after 6 months, and 33% after 3 months. I am a runner and biker and had the most difficulty when I exercised and actually had bleeding from the disposable stitches until 13 weeks when they finally dissolved. Pads are still in my life. My surgeon explained that the interior sphincter is heavily involved in the prostate gland and integrated into the pelvic floor so its removal and weakening the surrounding tissue is a given. Best wishes, we here on the forum hope you have a speedy and uneventful recovery from symptoms, but focus on the big picture and being cancer free. Bill",

      "Content": "Not sure if this helps, but I am the poster boy for bleeding. I'm 3 months out and still have bleeding. It happens only when I run, which I do on a regular basis. My surgeon wanted to be sure it wasn't a severe problem as he told me I could do whatever I was comfortable with, so he went in with a scope last week to make sure. The bleeding was located around or near the self dissolving sutures which he said were in the process of deteriorating. They are designed to last 3-4 months. Everything else looked perfect and he said I should notice improvement once they dissolve fully. He was never concerned and told me the bleeding was proportional to activity and since the incision was healed it was only a 'minor inconvenience' that will correct in time. The cytology that was done 2 weeks post op and prior to catheter removal was the determining factor in showing proper healing. After 6 weeks I was released to do physically whatever I was comfortable doing.",

      "Content": "I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of over 700 RRP patients to try to determine the optimal time patients undergoing radical prostatectomies should be monitored. The results make me wonder about the validity of AS once cancer has been discovered. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had undergone RRP, found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be discussing with my urologist/surgeon, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer gives you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This seems to contradict the validity of AS altogether. I went this route, had a higher Gleason on post-op pathology (a common occurrence), and wonder if I am now at risk of falling into the higher risk group later in life.",

I did them religiously and think I only ended up strengthening the sphincter that they removed as I had and still have very little control. Not sure I could isolate the external sphincter while the other one was doing the work, but now I work kegels daily hoping to get better control. I'm at the 6 week mark and have past the first step only-ie. I am able to get through the night without wetting a pad by using a male urinal when I become erect. Otherwise I have very limited control. I walked in the hospital, and after the catheter was removed (2 weeks post-op) regularly walked 6 miles per day, but not sure it has helped with the urinary control although I feel great otherwise. Best of luck with your procedure, each day after is another growing curve.",

      "Content": "Brian, I was in a very similar situation and waited for 2 years before treatment. I originally considered Brachytherapy, but when my PSA jumped over 10 it was no longer an option. I was not enthused about the long term side effect prospects of radiation so eventually decided on a radical. I was relieved in the end as the final pathology determined I had a more aggressive form than originally thought. Also, don't underestimate the psychological effects on those close to you if you decide to go the AS route. Best of luck with whatever decision you make. It seems that you caught it early enough and should have a positive outcome. Bill",

Unfortunately he has been incontinent for 20 months (He is 75). Has anyone experienced incontinence this long and had something done to help the situation.? Thanks in advance B I'm 6 months out and still having problems. Things have improved gradually, but I still leak throughout the day. I am able to control the major urination for the most part. I read a statistical study from a Urologist with well over 1000 patients who quoted continence levels at 3 months, 6months, and 1 year and noted 66% and 95% for the latter two. I place myself on the other side of the 66% category and hope for a full recovery in the near future, but am told to be patient. My cousin had the same surgery and is over 2 years out with a similar problem. He has been prescribed a month of active Kegel exercising before he is referred to a specialist to explore options; one of which would be the artificial sphincter. Bill",

      "Content": "I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of over 700 RRP patients to try to determine the optimal time patients undergoing radical prostatectomies should be monitored. The results make me wonder about the validity of AS once cancer has been discovered. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had undergone RRP, found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be discussing with my urologist/surgeon, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer gives you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This seems to contradict the validity of AS altogether. I went this route, had a higher Gleason on post-op pathology (a common occurrence), and wonder if I am now at risk of falling into the higher risk group later in life.",

My RARP will be 4 weeks this Monday. I have no bowel control, but otherwise am pretty good. I am curious about activity at this point. I do a follow-up with my surgeon on Monday and hope to be released for activity. I've been walking 5-6 miles daily since the catheter was removed after 2 weeks. Any thoughts?

      "Content": "Don't worry about not doing the kegels pre-op. I did them religiously and think I only ended up strengthening the sphincter that they removed as I had and still have very little control. Not sure I could isolate the external sphincter while the other one was doing the work, but now I work kegels daily hoping to get better control. I'm at the 6 week mark and have past the first step only-ie. I am able to get through the night without wetting a pad by using a male urinal when I become erect. Otherwise I have very limited control. I walked in the hospital, and after the catheter was removed (2 weeks post-op) regularly walked 6 miles per day, but not sure it has helped with the urinary control although I feel great otherwise. Best of luck with your procedure, each day after is another growing curve.",

      "Content": "I found a survey that looked at long term follow-ups of over 700 RRP patients to try to determine the optimal time patients undergoing radical prostatectomies should be monitored. The results make me wonder about the validity of AS once cancer has been discovered. In the study the results after 18.6 years of watching PSA values of individuals 65 years old or higher, who had undergone RRP, found that those with Gleason 6 scores had 4% incidence of recurring PSA while those with Gleason 7 scores had 45% incidence. My thought, which I also will be discussing with my urologist/surgeon, is that waiting for treatment after positive diagnosis of cancer gives you a higher probability of increasing Gleason score thus a higher probability of cancer returning. This seems to contradict the validity of AS altogether. I went this route, had a higher Gleason on post-op pathology (a common occurrence), and wonder if I am now at risk of falling into the higher risk group later in life.",

The psoas muscle is one of the largest ones in the body and starts at the spinal column and runs through the hip and into the groin. It supports most all of the movements of the upper body and as such is susceptible to all sorts of strains and sprains. When it is injured it can cause lower back pain, hip pain, and/or groin pain. Lower back pain is a very common issue and can be caused by any number of activities. Not so sure prostate issues start there and the burning urine should indicate some sort or treatment or inquiries.",

The results make me wonder about the validity of AS once cancer has been discovered.

      "Content": "JD1969, Here's a copy of an email I sent Fran who was interested in my progress: It's over & I survived. The race was a 196.2 mile 6 person relay race from Saratoga Springs,NY to Lake Placid,NY through some pretty rough mountainous terrain. It took us 29.5 hours from Friday morning to Saturday afternoon. We each ran 6 legs ranging from 3-9 miles. Average distance varied per person from 30-38 miles. We actually took 12 minutes off our time from last year when we won the 40 an under age group. (One guy under 40 puts us in that bracket!) Not sure of the final results this year as it takes a few week to tabulate. I am still relatively incontinent and remain so, but that was part of the experiment. As you may remember, I bleed during every run, regardless of distance and did so through the first 4 of my 6 legs. The last two had little, if any blood and only slight urine as I became somewhat dehydrated. I did use way more pads than I had predicted which was natural given the circumstances. As far as conditioning: I was in great shape going into the operation on July 16th and was not able to start training again in ernest for 6 weeks post-op. (2 weeks of catheter, 2 weeks of normal recovery and 2 weeks of 'trying' to regain composure with walking/very light jogging led me to the 6 weeks.) I feel I regained over 90% of my fitness before the race which was 11 weeks post op including my last week of tapering. I would have liked 1-2 more weeks as I only recently felt I was getting back to full strength As far as rehab: I am now taking 1-2 weeks off to see if the running hampered my recovery from incontinence. I will try to monitor it and be more vigilant with kegal exercising. In retrospect, I feel that the event helped me focus and try to put the post-op symptoms on the back burner of my life. I function pretty well with pads and have been able to resume a normal life style considering the trauma of cancer and major surgery. Hope this wasn't too lengthy, but that's the way it unfolded for me. Stay the course. Bill p.s. My two surgeons are both distance runners and told me to do whatever I was comfortable with. They said the bleeding would not hurt me as I had healed at the incision. I was able to get to 35+ miles per week running and they told me it was OK to bike at 8 weeks although I stayed off the bike. Since you're a month behind me and much younger I'd say get out and go for it-It's time",

      "Content": "JD1969, Here's a copy of an email I sent Fran who was interested in my progress: It's over & I survived. The race was a 196.2 mile 6 person relay race from Saratoga Springs,NY to Lake Placid,NY through some pretty rough mountainous terrain. It took us 29.5 hours from Friday morning to Saturday afternoon. We each ran 6 legs ranging from 3-9 miles. Average distance varied per person from 30-38 miles. We actually took 12 minutes off our time from last year when we won the 40 an under age group. (One guy under 40 puts us in that bracket!) Not sure of the final results this year as it takes a few week to tabulate. I am still relatively incontinent and remain so, but that was part of the experiment. As you may remember, I bleed during every run, regardless of distance and did so through the first 4 of my 6 legs. The last two had little, if any blood and only slight urine as I became somewhat dehydrated. I did use way more pads than I had predicted which was natural given the circumstances. As far as conditioning: I was in great shape going into the operation on July 16th and was not able to start training again in ernest for 6 weeks post-op. (2 weeks of catheter, 2 weeks of normal recovery and 2 weeks of 'trying' to regain composure with walking/very light jogging led me to the 6 weeks.) I feel I regained over 90% of my fitness before the race which was 11 weeks post op including my last week of tapering. I would have liked 1-2 more weeks as I only recently felt I was getting back to full strength As far as rehab: I am now taking 1-2 weeks off to see if the running hampered my recovery from incontinence. I will try to monitor it and be more vigilant with kegal exercising. In retrospect, I feel that the event helped me focus and try to put the post-op symptoms on the back burner of my life.

      "Content": "Not totally sure about radiation, having had surgery, but do recall a few points in researching my options. I was told by my radiologist that Brachytherapy releases the same amount of radiation as is given by Beam Therapy, only it is released from the seeds over time. Either choice can damage surrounding tissue which is why the symptoms and long term effects of radiation are one of the down sides of this treatment. Radiation also destroys the prostate tissue, but this too happens over time which is probably why the PSA readings should be more accurate after the treatment. Sorry I can't answer your question since I'm not sure what that time-frame is.",

      "Content": "I've often seen advice that bike riding should not be done prior to taking PSA tests as it could affect the results. I've discussed this with my urologist and surgeon, and searched the internet for confirmation, but cannot verify the validity of the suggestion. Personally, I tried either riding and not riding before my tests and the PSA showed a relatively linear increase regardless. Obviously, I know this is not a scientific conclusion, but my simple observation. It would make sense that sex prior to drawing blood for the test could affect the results since the prostate produces seminal fluid and emits it during ejaculation. Logic would dictate there could be an increase since the gland is traumatized through contraction. Again, I couldn't find a valid study where this is problematic. The validity for not performing a DRE prior to testing postulates that trauma to the prostate may render increased PSA results. Not sure if this has been determined scientifically either, but most doctors practice it. There was a survey sent to a running club and a biking club in Boston to try to determine the effect of biking &/or running on male impotence and the results came back inconclusive and statistically insignificant. This was not a true scientific study, but I believe over 500 recipients from each group responded. It was an effort to discover whether further study could or should be conducted for this purpose. What I'm suggesting is we shouldn't be offering false hope for high PSA results to readers of this blog without scientific evidence. Correct me if I'm wrong or off task here, or at least let this be a thread for discussion. Bill",

I also read that a resume for a robotic surgeon including several years of performing the open procedure would be a plus. I'm not sure about this, but from a small segment of people I know who have had the open procedure the incontinence issues were less than those that had the robotic procedure. You may want to ask your surgeon if he is more likely to spare the internal sphincter if it is an open procedure. The reality is that nearly 85% of prostatectomy procedures use the robot which probably has an economic element as well as the promotion that they can more easily spare the nerves responsible for erections. Either way, the surgeon is the limiting factor. If you're looking for the least traumatic procedure, and the one that you'll be able to handle with no outside help you should consider radiation, but that brings up more issues that surely will be answered at your program.

My urologist said 'active' individuals have more difficulty regaining continence, but encouraged me to exercise at whatever rate I was comfortable with. I did stay off the bike for 8 weeks, which my surgeon wanted, because of the proximity to the operation, but find that now I have less difficulty biking than running with respect to leakage. I was walking the day after surgery and continued doing it regularly until 5 weeks out when I began running again. Bill",

My urologist said 'active' individuals have more difficulty regaining continence, but encouraged me to exercise at whatever rate I was comfortable with. I did stay off the bike for 8 weeks, which my surgeon wanted, because of the proximity to the operation, but find that now I have less difficulty biking than running with respect to leakage. I was walking the day after surgery and continued doing it regularly until 5 weeks out when I began running again. Bill",
