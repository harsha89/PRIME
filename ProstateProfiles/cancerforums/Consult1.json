      "Content": "I can understand not wanting to believe that there is a problem when he is otherwise feeling fine. Unfortunately that's what makes this disease so insidious. Catch it early and there are a lot of options and prognosis is usually good. I guess it wouldn't be that bad if he wanted to take another PSA test as long as he were to agree that if it was similar to the last one that he then goes for a biopsy. Maybe it would delay things by only a week or so, which usually isn't significant and the out of pocket cost of the PSA blood test can't be expensive. Good luck!",

Catch it early and there are a lot of options and prognosis is usually good. I guess it wouldn't be that bad if he wanted to take another PSA test as long as he were to agree that if it was similar to the last one that he then goes for a biopsy. Maybe it would delay things by only a week or so, which usually isn't significant and the out of pocket cost of the PSA blood test can't be expensive. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer I was told by my urologist that there can be small amounts of detectable PSA from saliva. Here is one study about it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11096235",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer I was told by my urologist that there can be small amounts of detectable PSA from saliva. Here is one study about it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11096235",

      "Content": "First PSA follow up is 6 weeks post surgery, give or take a few days. I do ok when I'm coughing, getting up from sitting, etc., but when I stand or walk I am prone to leaking semi-regularly. None of them is a large volume, but they do add up over the course of a day. I was a semi-gym rat prior to the surgery, and a 6 week moratorium is difficult. I even did special kegel routines lying on the floor that I found on youtube pre-surgery. My doc doesn't want me to do more than a few kegels at the end of the day (he wants me to incorporate kegels into normal activity) which is similar to what Mayo Clinic recommends. This is opposite of what the physical therapy group that specializes in incontinence recommends. This reminds me of eggs are bad for you, no- eggs are good for you, butter is bad for you, no- it's good for you, etc. Yesterday I noticed blood in my urine, but today there hasn't been a second occurrence. I would gladly take your results so far especially since it hasn't even been two weeks post catheter for you. I'm not frustrated yet, but it's not easy regressing to being 3 years old again. I've also had penile shrinkage which is another humbling result. I know that living a full life trumps the side effects.",

      "Content": "Msr. DaVinci and I were supposed to meet at 7:30 AM on Sept. 25. Got the call I didn't want informing me that the time had been changed to 10:30. Go to the hospital to get prepped by 9:45, sitting and waiting to get called. Finally at 12:15 my surgeon walks in and says it's going to be in about 15 minutes. In the meanwhile my BP has been setting a new Guinness record. Get positioned on the table and at the other end of the room I see the robot, and the next thing I know I'm in recovery about 3.5 hours later. First night started out ok but I must have had a reaction to the anesthesia as I got clammy, dizzy, and nauseous so they gave me something to help. Had my first walk around 10 PM- not too bad. I'm not sure when it started, but as the gasses in my stomach kept building, the pressure and pain in my abs kept getting worse. The pain when I coughed (which happened all too frequently) was very bad. I work out core at least 2 times a week out of 6 and it felt like nothing I had experienced. I tip my hat to those that didn't experience that. My doc came in the room the day after surgery after one of my coughing spells and I told him I wasn't ready to leave. Stayed one more night which was less than restful but about an hour before I was to be released the next day I passed gas and the pain wasn't quite as bad. They also gave me and abdominal binder which is worthwhile. Allowed me to be able to get in and out of the car decently well and reduces pain when coughing. Coming back home was a challenge trying to get comfortable and dealing with my new friend Mr. Catheter. Decided to use my mother's old walker to hang the bag to keep it nice and low. It's an irritant but not all that bad. Takes some new tricks to be able to get dressed. They didn't give me any cream or recommend anything, but I can tolerate the feeling for now. The good part (so far) is that there is no blood in the urine and after the home care nurse took off the 6 outside dressings, the wounds are healing well. Sounds like the nerves were spared but the doc is very reluctant to give out much information until he sees pathology other than things went well. Hope the tumor behind the bladder didn't intrude elsewhere. I got on the scale today and for some unknown reason I gained 6 lbs since the day before my prep. So after eating jello and pop sickles on Sunday, ice chips on Monday, clear liquids on Tuesday, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and soup on Wednesday I gained weight. There is no justice. Going for a Cystogram Monday and if those results look OK then probably catheter removal the following day. Then a big plunge into the dark with continence and sexual function.",

      "Content": "Appreciate your interest and support. Yes, it could be that the doc had to manipulate the DaVinci more to extract the tumor. He said it was close to the prostate and had to remove the seminal vessels to get to it. Would be nice if the pain subsided some more within the next few days- either that or if it was possible, stop coughing. At the hospital they liked the fact that I was coughing to reduce the chance for pneumonia. To be honest, as of today I'm somewhat more worried about incontinence than the pathology since (according to the biopsy) I wasn't dealing with an aggressive cancer- yet.",

      "Content": "Msr. DaVinci and I were supposed to meet at 7:30 AM on Sept. 25. Got the call I didn't want informing me that the time had been changed to 10:30. Go to the hospital to get prepped by 9:45, sitting and waiting to get called. Finally at 12:15 my surgeon walks in and says it's going to be in about 15 minutes. In the meanwhile my BP has been setting a new Guinness record. Get positioned on the table and at the other end of the room I see the robot, and the next thing I know I'm in recovery about 3.5 hours later. First night started out ok but I must have had a reaction to the anesthesia as I got clammy, dizzy, and nauseous so they gave me something to help. Had my first walk around 10 PM- not too bad. I'm not sure when it started, but as the gasses in my stomach kept building, the pressure and pain in my abs kept getting worse. The pain when I coughed (which happened all too frequently) was very bad. I work out core at least 2 times a week out of 6 and it felt like nothing I had experienced. I tip my hat to those that didn't experience that. My doc came in the room the day after surgery after one of my coughing spells and I told him I wasn't ready to leave. Stayed one more night which was less than restful but about an hour before I was to be released the next day I passed gas and the pain wasn't quite as bad. They also gave me and abdominal binder which is worthwhile. Allowed me to be able to get in and out of the car decently well and reduces pain when coughing. Coming back home was a challenge trying to get comfortable and dealing with my new friend Mr. Catheter. Decided to use my mother's old walker to hang the bag to keep it nice and low. It's an irritant but not all that bad. Takes some new tricks to be able to get dressed. They didn't give me any cream or recommend anything, but I can tolerate the feeling for now. The good part (so far) is that there is no blood in the urine and after the home care nurse took off the 6 outside dressings, the wounds are healing well. Sounds like the nerves were spared but the doc is very reluctant to give out much information until he sees pathology other than things went well. Hope the tumor behind the bladder didn't intrude elsewhere. I got on the scale today and for some unknown reason I gained 6 lbs since the day before my prep. So after eating jello and pop sickles on Sunday, ice chips on Monday, clear liquids on Tuesday, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and soup on Wednesday I gained weight. There is no justice. Going for a Cystogram Monday and if those results look OK then probably catheter removal the following day. Then a big plunge into the dark with continence and sexual function.",

Clean with a was cloth, soap and water and lube the entry point twice per day using a Q-tip. All actions should be done wiping away from the opening of the penis to help prevent infection. Don't be surprised if at some point the urine in the bag ooks green. They said is was from blue dye that they used during surgery. Combine that with yellow urine and you get green.

      "Content": "Msr. DaVinci and I were supposed to meet at 7:30 AM on Sept. 25. Got the call I didn't want informing me that the time had been changed to 10:30. Go to the hospital to get prepped by 9:45, sitting and waiting to get called. Finally at 12:15 my surgeon walks in and says it's going to be in about 15 minutes. In the meanwhile my BP has been setting a new Guinness record. Get positioned on the table and at the other end of the room I see the robot, and the next thing I know I'm in recovery about 3.5 hours later. First night started out ok but I must have had a reaction to the anesthesia as I got clammy, dizzy, and nauseous so they gave me something to help. Had my first walk around 10 PM- not too bad. I'm not sure when it started, but as the gasses in my stomach kept building, the pressure and pain in my abs kept getting worse. The pain when I coughed (which happened all too frequently) was very bad. I work out core at least 2 times a week out of 6 and it felt like nothing I had experienced. I tip my hat to those that didn't experience that. My doc came in the room the day after surgery after one of my coughing spells and I told him I wasn't ready to leave. Stayed one more night which was less than restful but about an hour before I was to be released the next day I passed gas and the pain wasn't quite as bad. They also gave me and abdominal binder which is worthwhile. Allowed me to be able to get in and out of the car decently well and reduces pain when coughing. Coming back home was a challenge trying to get comfortable and dealing with my new friend Mr. Catheter. Decided to use my mother's old walker to hang the bag to keep it nice and low. It's an irritant but not all that bad. Takes some new tricks to be able to get dressed. They didn't give me any cream or recommend anything, but I can tolerate the feeling for now. The good part (so far) is that there is no blood in the urine and after the home care nurse took off the 6 outside dressings, the wounds are healing well. Sounds like the nerves were spared but the doc is very reluctant to give out much information until he sees pathology other than things went well. Hope the tumor behind the bladder didn't intrude elsewhere. I got on the scale today and for some unknown reason I gained 6 lbs since the day before my prep. So after eating jello and pop sickles on Sunday, ice chips on Monday, clear liquids on Tuesday, yogurt, scrambled eggs, and soup on Wednesday I gained weight. There is no justice. Going for a Cystogram Monday and if those results look OK then probably catheter removal the following day. Then a big plunge into the dark with continence and sexual function.",

Does anyone know anything about the Prolaris test for aggressiveness. I hope to have the results next week. I'm not as knowledgeable as those who have been dealing with this for years, but I had a similar genetic test done called OncotypeDx GPS. In my case the blind biopsy showed I had Gleason 6, so the additional test was being done to evaluate whether active surveillance might be appropriate. I don't understand the logic in your case of the additional lab test (other than perhaps a confirmation of the biopsy). You should be relieved that the bone scan was negative. Maybe I missed it, but was a 3T MRI ordered? I would think that would be more helpful in determining a course of action than the genetic test. In any event, I wish you the best!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by john4803 Thanks, MichaelF and Highlander for the encouragement! The Bone Scan was also clear. Does anyone know anything about the Prolaris test for aggressiveness. I hope to have the results next week. I'm not as knowledgeable as those who have been dealing with this for years, but I had a similar genetic test done called OncotypeDx GPS. In my case the blind biopsy showed I had Gleason 6, so the additional test was being done to evaluate whether active surveillance might be appropriate. I don't understand the logic in your case of the additional lab test (other than perhaps a confirmation of the biopsy). You should be relieved that the bone scan was negative. Maybe I missed it, but was a 3T MRI ordered? I would think that would be more helpful in determining a course of action than the genetic test. In any event, I wish you the best!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome to the forum, Stricks. Yes, prostatectomies have come a long way since 2000 and they can do things that were not possible before. It is good that some medications will still give him erections, but apparently the new one he is taking does not get him firm enough to penetrate? You have a good idea in going along with him to the uro, especially since it is a female doctor. Otherwise he could consider switching to a male uro for easier discussions. Personally, my own nerves were spared with robotic surgery in 2011. But I had a prostate that was 4x normal size. In the years prior to my PC diagnosis, the huge prostate had already been squeezing my nerves \"between a rock and a hard place.\" The effect of this was trauma to the nerves, which had neutralized my ability to get an erection. Even with nerve sparing surgery, the damage had already been done to my erectile nerves. Cialis has not worked for me and I cannot afford to give Viagra a try, so I'm kind of in \"limbo\" sexually speaking. As with you, my gf and myself do a lot of mutual oral sex whenever we decide to be intimate. One thing that can work, although I'm not comfortable with it, is a \"penis pump,\" which places the penis into a long plastic tube that creates a vacuum -- and thus bringing the penis up to full hardness as long as the seal is not broken. There are tension rings that can be rolled off the tube to the base of the penis to maintain the erection for intercourse. We tried it and it didn't work very well for me because I probably did not do it right. Takes some practice. He may want to try and one of these devices. In April, when I return to Mayo Clinic for my annual general physical, I am scheduled to receive a penile injection. These, from my understanding, are almost foolproof and will create a good erection. So he may want to look into injections. I don't know if I'll have the courage to inject myself (at Mayo they make a guy jab himself in front of the nurse) to show that I am capable of self-injecting. I suppose I'll give it a try -- and your bf may want to consider the same thing. I believe the injections are pretty expensive, but supposedly they do work. Good luck to both of you! Chuck Just wondering about your comment. How are you able to obtain Cialis for a reasonable price while Viagra is unaffordable? I have the opposite situation- I purchase Sildenafil (Viagra generic) for $30/month out of pocket, while from what I have read I would be lucky to find Cialis for $30 a pill. I'm staying away from Cialis based on cost, but I would really like to see if it might be more effective than Sildenafil. Any tips on how to cut costs for Cialis (or it's generic equivalent) would be appreciated!",

      "Content": "The other aspect which I have no frame of reference for is the lack of being able to feel like I have to urinate like I did before. Before I could rate my need to urinate from a 1-10 in terms of urgency and now I can't really tell much of a difference. The stream is weaker than I had prior to surgery. I know sexual feeling is probably at the tail end of the recovery but it seems as if things are dormant. Yes, I freely admit I am not the model patient in terms of chilling I see my doc on Friday for an incontinence update and I think his need to see me this soon for that reason drives me to think that he believes there should be enough of a potential improvement to schedule the appointment.",

However, you may find the data at least somewhat helpful if you search for Propublica/surgeons/MO/prostate removal. It will not tell you who is best, but it will give you some facts as to who has a higher than average complication rate along with a relative measure as to how many procedures are done. If it were me, I would avoid anyone in the red. If you have a local PC support group, I would contact them. Some are very helpful in sharing what they thought of the surgeons they used.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer I was told by my urologist that there can be small amounts of detectable PSA from saliva. Here is one study about it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11096235",

For those willing, would appreciate knowing how long it took you to be continent and approximately how often you did either/both informal kegel exercises or formal physical therapy. For those that didn't regain continence, did you try physical therapy? I'm going through a lot of effort as my physical therapy exercises become more numerous and more frequent (plus expensive) and would like to get a sense that there is a payoff doing that. I wonder how many do almost nothing and still regain continence which would suggest the normal healing process is the main driver of improvement. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer I was told by my urologist that there can be small amounts of detectable PSA from saliva. Here is one study about it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11096235",

I seem to do better when I'm sitting or laying down than when standing. My uneducated guess is that some of the nerves in the area of the prostate are disturbed and may take awhile before they function more like they used to. Since I'm rather cowardly, I'm still sleeping in my recliner in order to avoid having to wake up in the middle of the night to do sheets and undermine getting a good nights sleep. Hope we can both progress and put this behind us...",

      "Content": "In case you hadn't seen this, I found a link which relates to the type of surgery you mentioned. Like most newer techniques, lack of track record makes it hard to evaluate. http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(16)30530-9/abstract/partial-prostatectomy-for-anterior-cancer-short-term-oncologic-and-functional-outcomes Continence for some comes quickly, and for others it takes some time. My experience has been that it is slowly improving, but I have yet to reach what I hope that will be a successful endpoint. Some will say that the more in shape you are will be a factor in a quicker recovery of continence, but in my case I had been working out hard 6 days a week for a few years prior to surgery, yet my recovery is still a work in process. It's certainly unnerving when your PSA rises fairly quickly even with Gleason 6. Nobody can say definitively that it will never morph into anything higher. There are other treatments involving focal therapies or radiation which have their pluses and minuses. Good idea to at least evaluate those before making a decision. Some may see a clear decision after this research, others will look at it as still a menu of side effects and how long it will take for them to either develop or be overcome. Ask your surgeon as to how many of these partial prostatectomy's have been done, and how many he has done. Also, did you have a genetic test done on the sampled Gleason 6 tissue? If it's higher risk, you should probably weigh whether a partial surgery would be the optimal treatment. Good luck, and if you have more questions fire away.",

      "Content": "In case you hadn't seen this, I found a link which relates to the type of surgery you mentioned. Like most newer techniques, lack of track record makes it hard to evaluate. http://www.europeanurology.com/article/S0302-2838(16)30530-9/abstract/partial-prostatectomy-for-anterior-cancer-short-term-oncologic-and-functional-outcomes Continence for some comes quickly, and for others it takes some time. My experience has been that it is slowly improving, but I have yet to reach what I hope that will be a successful endpoint. Some will say that the more in shape you are will be a factor in a quicker recovery of continence, but in my case I had been working out hard 6 days a week for a few years prior to surgery, yet my recovery is still a work in process. It's certainly unnerving when your PSA rises fairly quickly even with Gleason 6. Nobody can say definitively that it will never morph into anything higher. There are other treatments involving focal therapies or radiation which have their pluses and minuses. Good idea to at least evaluate those before making a decision. Some may see a clear decision after this research, others will look at it as still a menu of side effects and how long it will take for them to either develop or be overcome. Ask your surgeon as to how many of these partial prostatectomy's have been done, and how many he has done. Also, did you have a genetic test done on the sampled Gleason 6 tissue? If it's higher risk, you should probably weigh whether a partial surgery would be the optimal treatment. Good luck, and if you have more questions fire away.",

A reduction in ejaculate is called retrograde ejaculation which typically isn't a sign of any significant medical issue. However, a PSA of 9.11 is high- have you had any other PSA blood tests to compare it with to see how quickly its rising? It's good that you are seeing a Uro next. Its possible he/she will recommend a biopsy. It's too early to get upset but not too early to do your follow ups and make sure that you are comfortable with your Uro. Is there any prostrate cancer in your family? That could suggest a higher risk that you might be susceptible to it.

      "Content": "I was instructed not to be in a bath tub (or any other kind of tub) for at least 3 weeks after the surgery/catheter removal. The incisions are still healing at that point and there is the possibility of bacteria entering through those incisions. Did your surgeon provide you with any such instructions? A friend I met at a prostate cancer support group had bladder spasms that were very painful for a few months on and off after surgery. Fortunately I never had any. I'm not sure why some do and some don't, but I followed the doctors post surgical instructions to the letter to avoid any side effects that I could have some control over.",

If the patient had done a little research, he would have seen red flags about allegations of concurrent surgeries being done.

Another hint- do a google search on the doctor who was doing the interview of the dissatisfied patient and see what many of his other patients are saying and what other interesting information is available. The complication rates of incontinence and ED he quoted may have been correct one week after surgery, but hardly are what most other studies indicate a year later.

      "Content": "You will get plenty of support here. You already realize you have to select a potentially curative course of action, so that narrows things down. There are several stickies above which discuss what you need to know about several treatment options including surgery, brachytherapy, and radiation. There is also a sticky which refers you to the best written books on the subject, which most believe is by Dr. Patrick Walsh. Do a lot of reading to get more in depth information. Your numbers indicate that treatment is necessary, not this month but perhaps within a few months. Having some biopsied samples with Gleason 4, your are between Gleason 3 which is the least aggressive to Gleason 5, the most. So a 4+3 is a combination of two Gleason scores. Your criteria should include the best course of action which aligns to the longest possible cure since you have a lot of years of living to go. Side effects come with the territory which are discussed. Don't be afraid to get at least one opinion from a urologist and radiation oncologist. If you aren't comfortable at any point, get a second opinion. Depending on where you live, one of the opinions could be from a mecca for urology such as Mayo or Cleveland Clinic. When you do some reading and have more specific questions, make sure you post again. Best to you going forward!",

When I was making my decision I asked several urologists whether G6 can progress to G7/higher (assuming the biopsy or pathology is spot on) and was told there is no definitive answer, but there was a likelihood it would not. The study Dj included above may have some insights, but you need to pay to read it. I did find another study that has some interesting detailed information that some may find helpful. It's small and done in Korea, but not sure how much that matters. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5419108/",

What was the relationship between their PSA and an increase in the Gleason score? For those that started with Gleason 3+4, it can be argued that the \"4\" became more prevalent which is consistent with Gleason 6 being more benign. When the Gleason 6 advances, that would be concerning to those who are basing their decision on AS that low volume Gleason 6 is very low risk.",

If I had to guess I would say the cough I had which lingered from the cold I had prior to RALP caused me to heal more slowly. At least that's my guess- why wouldn't coughing be deleterious to healing? Your PSA is better than mine also even with your Gleason 7. My last PSA was .06, up from the first one of .03. So I will be getting ready for PSA anxiety for the next blood test hoping that it doesn't go up again. My advice is to go to Black Angus and have a nice meal!",

      "Content": "First, I wish everyone the best in whichever path they take going forward. When I was making my decision I asked several urologists whether G6 can progress to G7/higher (assuming the biopsy or pathology is spot on) and was told there is no definitive answer, but there was a likelihood it would not. The study Dj included above may have some insights, but you need to pay to read it. I did find another study that has some interesting detailed information that some may find helpful. It's small and done in Korea, but not sure how much that matters. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5419108/",

      "Content": "Some basic questions arise. Of those that started with Gleason 3+3, how many advanced into Gleason 7 or higher? What was the relationship between their PSA and an increase in the Gleason score? For those that started with Gleason 3+4, it can be argued that the \"4\" became more prevalent which is consistent with Gleason 6 being more benign. When the Gleason 6 advances, that would be concerning to those who are basing their decision on AS that low volume Gleason 6 is very low risk.",

I'm still not 100% (95-98%) but I am still seeing slow improvement. One thing I would like to see if there's a correlation between how long it takes to be continent and improvement in ED.",

      "Content": "I was 0.03 after 6 weeks, 0.06 after 4.5 months, and then 0.05 after 7.5 months. My urologist tells me there are traces of PSA in saliva, so it's too early to push any panic buttons. I realize that your situation is somewhat different than mine in terms of pathology. The angst over the periodic PSA test post RALP is definitely unnerving. There's also a small margin of error as there is on most tests, and and if you dropped back 0.01 that would be a significant reduction percentage wise while perhaps not as significant in terms of the absolute number. Did they recommend you have another PSA done in 3 months instead of dropping back to 6? I would suggest that you not worry too much until you have another test to compare with the 0.06. Good luck!",

Totally painless and nothing to concern yourself about. The 3T CT scan was also easy as all you have to do is lie there without moving much. If you are very claustrophobic you might have a concern, but it was nothing compared to the old tube CT scan a generation or two of technology ago. Waiting for results is yet another story- I am a nervous Nellie but you may have a different personality. Relax!",

Are u using the uPSA, and if so what is the Uro's logic behind that, given your very low risk status? In your case it may cause more PSA anxiety than is really necessary. You are <.1 on all three tests, and with a G6 that is all u need to know. Good health to u, MM The urologist has requested the \"Bayer CIA\" PSA test. I don't know if that's uPSA or not. Another reason for my anxiety was my high genetic test score. The first urologist said he never saw a score that high with my biopsy. I've read some anecdotes when this disease doesn't follow the normal pattern expected. I realize that my situation is on the low end of the spectrum, but when it's happening to you it's always a personal thing no matter what the numbers are. Good health to you also!",

      "Content": "Saw the urologist today for my quarterly follow up. Last two PSAs were 0.03 and 0.06, so I was anxious. This time it was 0.05, which seems to stabilize things and reduce worries that a trend was beginning. I had him check a protrusion above his incision, and as I suspected it was a hernia. I had one in the groin area 20 years ago. Has anyone dealt with one in this region? He said it was up to me whether I wanted to have it repaired- no immediacy noted. Incontinence is down to a light shield without getting soaked. It's been a long haul in this regard but there has been consistent progress. ED post RALP is still ongoing, but still too early to give up hope. I wish everyone well!",

Everyone is different in dealing with health issues, stress, etc. My guess is the longer the time is between PSA checks, the easier it becomes. Every 3 months its still hard not to be guarded, but maybe when you graduate to every year you'll get a small reminder which will pass quickly with a good report.",

From what I understand, any underlying scar tissue near the hernia can make any fix more difficult. If mine could be done laparoscopically I might be more motivated to get it over and done with. But there is a good chance that the recuperation could involve 6 weeks of downtime if it can't. Let us know what the surgeon says.",

I don't know if that test is done for Gleason 9 as you unfortunately have. Another factor to consider is that prostate cancer that moves to the bone is quite painful.

Your Prolaris score seems to indicate that you are high risk also, although I admit not knowing much about Prolaris. Were you given any counseling in that regard by your urologist? Have you had a recent 3T MRI? If not, maybe it's time to discuss it. Good luck!",

But morphologically, Gleason 6 is cancer. It looks like a higher-grade cancer under the microscope. It can invade nerves and extend outside of the prostate and has all the features of local aggressiveness that you don\u2019t see with benign tumors.\"",

      "Content": "When I had my biopsy the samples were sent to do a genetic test- OncotypeDx GPS. The results included the risk of metastasis to the bone in the next 10 years and also the likelihood of death in the next 10 years. I don't know if that test is done for Gleason 9 as you unfortunately have. Another factor to consider is that prostate cancer that moves to the bone is quite painful. I am dealing with incontinence post surgery, so I understand your concerns. Hopefully it won't be a long term issue, but nobody is given any guarantees even though the odds are good in overcoming it.

      "Content": "Sorry that you're joining us here. With the stage you're in, surgery is probably not the optimal treatment, but at least get an opinion from a Radiation Oncologist and Medical Oncologist besides your Urologist. With surgery, the younger you are and the better your erections are prior to surgery give you a higher chance to regain potency as long as at least one nerve is spared (preferably both depending on what they see during surgery). You should expect at least some time period where erections would be difficult, but with optimal conditions I've seen odds being as high as 85% after a recovery period. Odds improve with the skill and experience of the surgeon. There are aids which can help things along during the recovery. Radiation can effect potency, but usually takes a longer time before that happens. Hormone therapy reduces your testosterone which has side effects, but doesn't last forever. The doctors can give you a better idea about that along with men here who have gone through these treatments. I'm sure this is a big shock, especially since you probably feel fine and this came out of nowhere. Look for the best treatment overall for you based on whatever criteria is most important to both of you. Doctors will prioritize keeping you alive as first and foremost. Good luck, don't get ahead of yourself, be hopeful and do your homework. You might want to get the latest prostate cancer book by Doctor Patrick Walsh which is listed in one of the sticky's above which addresses most everything.",

      "Content": "In hospital 2 nights- I did not want to be discharged after one night due to the high pain level. They gave me a hug buddy to clutch to my stomach every time I had to cough, and during the coughing the pain was as high as I ever have experienced. Pain started to improve 4 days after the surgery when I was passing gas and having bowel movements. Perhaps this was in part due to the extra surgery removing a tumor behind my bladder. Maybe I should have taken the more powerful pain meds but I was reluctant to do so.",

      "Content": "In hospital 2 nights- I did not want to be discharged after one night due to the high pain level. They gave me a hug buddy to clutch to my stomach every time I had to cough, and during the coughing the pain was as high as I ever have experienced. Pain started to improve 4 days after the surgery when I was passing gas and having bowel movements. Perhaps this was in part due to the extra surgery removing a tumor behind my bladder. Maybe I should have taken the more powerful pain meds but I was reluctant to do so.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer I was told by my urologist that there can be small amounts of detectable PSA from saliva. Here is one study about it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11096235",

      "Content": "First, you can't judge progress day to day. I assessed my progress month to month and found that to be a better yardstick. I went from full underwear (Depends) to pads and then to shields. At 15 months I am not declaring 100% continence as I do have minor leaks occasionally. However, I am still seeing progress in less leaking even at this stage. I did formal physical therapy incorporating kegels into my routine and while I think it's helpful, there is a certain amount of healing that needs to take place depending on the surgeon and your specific situation. My advice is not to get overly stressed about it, especially considering that you are just beginning the healing process.",

      "Content": "Sorry that you had a need to find us here. First, don't get ahead of yourself. A CT scan is painless and easy unless you can't lay fairly still for 20 minutes or so. If your urologist doesn't schedule you for a 3T MRI, ask about it and get one scheduled. Was this your first PSA? Any family history? A \"slightly\" enlarged prostate is not unusual at your age, but the feel test isn't definitive as to how enlarged it is. DREs tend to increase the PSA temporarily, but your PSA is high so you need additional testing. Depending on the CT and MRI, a bone scan may be recommended. A biopsy of your prostate is also likely. Yes, this is all disquieting but don't assume the worst but do follow up with requisite testing in order to find out what is going on and then depending, what are the options. Others will chime in also. Keep your head up!",

One urologist thought he felt something, and the biopsy was positive for some low volume Gleason 6 which was at the point where the PSA jumped. He was not going to offer nerve sparing during surgery, so I got a few other opinions. Three other urologists, including one from the Cleveland Clinic and one PA felt nothing suspicious. MRI was negative for any extension. My take is that there are some things clearly concerning, while some are a very subjective call.",

I guess that's subject to change if there is reason to do so. My blood pressure is back to a good normal (124/84) after it peaked during the process of getting several opinions to include the Cleveland Clinic- they were quite concerned of my 195/95.

      "Content": "Got my latest PSA test back and it's 0.03. That follows the first 3 checks of 0.03 (6 weeks), 0.06, and 0.05. With all the discussion about how 0.03 is suggested as a line of demarcation of possible further treatment, I'm satisfied that there is no upward trend as of yet. I visit the urologist Friday and see what he says. My continence is not 100% yet, but I don't think it's plateaued. My estimate is that I'm 95-98%. For those that state that continence should be reached by 6 months, I suggest you not make that so definitive so those who are still on the path don't get discouraged. Never had ED until the surgery but no improvement since then. Took Sildenafil until last month and then I switched over to Tadalafil once I found a pharmacy that compounds it locally and the cost is much better than I have seen elsewhere. Figure I will give it a few months more of a test before maybe switching back to Sildenafil. Thanks to those providing insights and support. I dislike it when things get chippy here in questioning peoples motives and am glad it doesn't happen a lot. Finally, my best to those in every stage of treatment. When I read some of the difficult posts my heart sinks but when others chime in with positive responses it makes me feel as this board is doing wonderful work!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider PSA stands for \"prostate specific antigen\", its a chemical that is released by only prostate cells. The test was originally designed for men who have already had prostatectomy. For those guys, the test should indicate a goose egg, they have no prostate, thus no prostate cells to create PSA. If they got a score , it means that cancerous prostate cells are creating PSA. The use of PSA for screening came afterwards. If you get a high or rapidly increasing score, the matter needs to be checked out further. BPH, prostatitis, other injury or trauma to the urinary tract can cause PSA scores to rise, sometimes dramatically. The idea of a screening PSA test result is to check it out if it looks out of sorts. Only a biopsy can definitlvely diagnose Prostate Cancer I was told by my urologist that there can be small amounts of detectable PSA from saliva. Here is one study about it. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11096235",

      "Content": "Sorry that you had a need to find us here. First, don't get ahead of yourself. A CT scan is painless and easy unless you can't lay fairly still for 20 minutes or so. If your urologist doesn't schedule you for a 3T MRI, ask about it and get one scheduled. Was this your first PSA? Any family history? A \"slightly\" enlarged prostate is not unusual at your age, but the feel test isn't definitive as to how enlarged it is. DREs tend to increase the PSA temporarily, but your PSA is high so you need additional testing. Depending on the CT and MRI, a bone scan may be recommended. A biopsy of your prostate is also likely. Yes, this is all disquieting but don't assume the worst but do follow up with requisite testing in order to find out what is going on and then depending, what are the options. Others will chime in also. Keep your head up!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by SubDenis Stress is difficult. I wish you some peace these next days. I am hearing a lot of guys saying their PSA is not necessarily a linear change, more a bouncing number. This weekend I have met many guys on AS for many years and I am choosing to look at it as delayed treatment. Maybe they will perfect things like laser ablation or invent something new. Again I wish you well. Denis Thanks for the support. I think my first URO did me no favors when he wanted me to do surgery quickly without any hope for nerve sparing based on my genetic test score. That sent me into a deep hole which took me several consultations to get my head back above water. Then when one of the consultations found an additional tumor, back down I went. I wish you the best also in making the best choice going forward!",

There is such a divergence of outcomes and there doesn't appear to be any specific factors which predict where a person will fall within that spectrum. I would think being healthy and active would help considerably, but that didn't make a difference in getting where I am today. I'm doing kegels, getting all of my meds and continence products in advance, and trying to get as much else done beforehand so I can focus on recuperation and walking. Appreciate your good wishes!",

      "Content": "I asked the urologist if I could time my latest PSA to coincide with my yearly physical blood work. I like to time my stress to get all the news in one bundle. 9/25 RALP 11/8 0.03 2/8 0.06 (hmm) 5/3 0.05 9/6 0.03 Yes, every 6 months at least for the upcoming year. I guess that's subject to change if there is reason to do so. My blood pressure is back to a good normal (124/84) after it peaked during the process of getting several opinions to include the Cleveland Clinic- they were quite concerned of my 195/95. I have white coat syndrome and after having two unsatisfactory urology consultations and an unnecessary bone biopsy I felt like I was getting nowhere fast.",

If it's sticky, then they either have take out more or do pathology during the surgery to decide (if they have the capability to do that). I rejected my first urologist based on him saying he would automatically take out the nerve bundles based almost solely on my genetic test results. I want someone who will make decisions based on the circumstances they find during the surgery- I wouldn't expect a guarantee of nerve sparing or nerve ending in advance unless there was conclusive evidence from an MRI or some other test.",

      "Content": "The first test my urologist ordered after the prostate biopsy was a bone scan. I had two cores with Gleason 6 and my PSA was 7.49. Because there was a questionable rib from the scan, I had to endure a stressful bone biopsy which was not a fun way to spend a Friday. Then more stress until the result finally was released a week later, and fortunately it was negative. Since then I have tried to determine if that course of action was appropriate or not. According to Dr. Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer, he doesn't recommend a scan unless the PSA is higher than 20, or Gleason greater than 7, or Stage T3 or greater. This criteria is similar to what Dr. Chodak recommends as he states that 13% of the scans have a questionable result which leads to a biopsy. His statistics are that only 3 of 1000 biopsy's lead to a positive finding for cancer in the bone when that criteria isn't used. Maybe this will help someone in a similar situation. From what I have read a 3T MRI should have been the first test ordered. Are there others with a different take on this? By the way, my first urologist is no longer my urologist.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Consult1! Sorry that you underwent a bone (rib) biopsy but very glad that it proved to be (-)! Did any of these MDs ever ask you: \"Did you have a previous rib injury or fracture?\" IMO, bone scans following diagnosis of PC with a PSA < 10 are of little clinical value. Bone scans certainly make lots of $ for the local hospital and helps that URO's hospital profile. As you found out, bones scans are not specific for CA. A (+) finding only leads to further investigation = Biopsy. Suggestion: Keep a record of the total billed costs encountered for: - Bone Scan Bill - Radiologist's Bill to read the scan - Rib Biopsy - Path Lab Bill and Pathologist's Bill I will \"guess\" that the total $ is substantial. And a 100% waste of time and money. Keep us updated with your new URO MDs recommendations. MF Thanks for your comments. Before I had the bone biopsy I had x-rays, which seemed to indicate that the rib \"lesion\" wasn't cancer, but they leave enough wiggle (or weasel) room such that they aren't definitive. If I had an injury I remembered I would have told them, but after 67 years of living outside of bubble wrap it's not possible to isolate any possible injury. Yes, its been a nice money maker for the health care providers, and a great way to raise my blood pressure from all the unnecessary stress. My current local urologist is in sync with the opinion I got from the Cleveland Clinic. I have a tumor (liposarcoma) behind the bladder found by the 3T MRI which needs to be removed so I will have one surgery to do both that and the prostate. If not for the OncotypeDx GPS high risk rating of my low volume Gleason 6 in two cores I would have only had the tumor taken out and done AS for the prostate with Cyberknife as my second choice. Like most I'm concerned about the side effects of prostate surgery, especially continence since I'm 100% continent now. I could stand to lose 10 lbs but I'm in the gym 6 times a week working out so hopefully that will help along with kegels I have stared. I know a lot of guys here would gladly trade their higher Gleason scores for mine, but I have always been health conscious to try and avoid any such interventions. Surgery is set for Sept 25...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigalcalbisque Doctor, decided to reschedule me to this Thursday at 12 noon, looks like I have 2 more days with Cathy & company. (UGGHH!) Just started noticing that even though Cathy is still in, I always have a slight urge to pee sensation, is that common? Everything seems to be healing nicely, just have one incision on my right side with staples that is moderately swollen, other than that I feel pretty good! Anyway, I will post my post-op stuff and comments later this week for those who would like to see my follow-up. Al I never felt a full urge to urinate, but there might have been some minor urges from time to time. Maybe you are just a little more sensitive to Cathy. As long as you don't have much pain and no bladder spasms, you are doing well. All my incisions are healing well according to 3 different nurses although I did have a lot of bruising. Staples come out with a pinching feeling, and catheter removal was the easiest part of the process so far. Keep up the good work.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wtdedula Consult1; So sorry to hear you had to go through a bone biopsy. My urologist had me go through a bone scan only because my biopsy was 3+4. He specifically remarked that if I were a 3+3, it would be a waste of money. And even with a 3+4, he also specifically remarked that with such a low psa as I (5.9), he said he highly doubted that the bone scan would be positive. In addition, when I went through the bone scan, I was a little concerned because the technician said she wanted to take a few extra pictures in case the physician ordered them - so for 2 weeks while waiting for the results, I was worried sick but only found out when I asked the doctor that there was a previous injury to my shoulder (which I didn't even know about). So even though they saw something unusual in the bone scan, the doctor apparently knew that this finding was due to an injury and not cancer. I am not sure why your urologist had you submit to a bone biopsy with only a 3+3 and such low psa (under 10) but I think I would be hesitant to keep that doctor. In my opinion, I would look for a different urologist. Tim Yes, my first urologist is my former urologist. I went to the top robotic surgeon in this area as a second opinion (over 4000 Davinci's) and wasn't impressed with his lack of knowing the basics of my case nor him not being concerned not having MRI results at that point. So I went to a 3rd urologist who probably has done around 1000, and I was impressed with his understanding of my case and a path forward. He ordered the MRI and found a liposarcoma behind my bladder. It sounded like my first urologist may have been reluctant to order an MRI because it would be more work for him to get it approved. He has impeccable credentials on paper (residence at top hospital system), but that doesn't tell the full story. Other than giving feedback to my primary care doctor who referred me, I guess the only other way I have of warning others is to post a review on Healthgrades or Vitals.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by bigalcalbisque Doctor, decided to reschedule me to this Thursday at 12 noon, looks like I have 2 more days with Cathy & company. (UGGHH!) Just started noticing that even though Cathy is still in, I always have a slight urge to pee sensation, is that common? Everything seems to be healing nicely, just have one incision on my right side with staples that is moderately swollen, other than that I feel pretty good! Anyway, I will post my post-op stuff and comments later this week for those who would like to see my follow-up. Al I never felt a full urge to urinate, but there might have been some minor urges from time to time. Maybe you are just a little more sensitive to Cathy. As long as you don't have much pain and no bladder spasms, you are doing well. All my incisions are healing well according to 3 different nurses although I did have a lot of bruising. Staples come out with a pinching feeling, and catheter removal was the easiest part of the process so far. Keep up the good work.",

      "Content": "From what I have researched, the surgeon will see how easily the tissue peels off at the edges. If it peels off easily, that typically indicates no cancer. If it's sticky, then they either have take out more or do pathology during the surgery to decide (if they have the capability to do that). I rejected my first urologist based on him saying he would automatically take out the nerve bundles based almost solely on my genetic test results. I want someone who will make decisions based on the circumstances they find during the surgery- I wouldn't expect a guarantee of nerve sparing or nerve ending in advance unless there was conclusive evidence from an MRI or some other test.",

      "Content": "After a fairly stable PSA of 4.0 (plus/minus 0.15) for 3 straight 6 month readings, it jumped up to 7.49 in May 2017. Biopsy in June revealed left and right apex Gleason 6, one less than 5% and the other core 35%. Dr. ordered an OncotypeDx GPS genetic test on the Gleason 6 cores and it came back high risk- a 43 score. Volume of prostate 50-60 cc. He wanted to schedule surgery with no nerve sparing possibility which sent me into a daze. Got a few other opinions after that, and the Dr. I felt most comfortable with (he started doing DaVinci's in 2003) ordered a 3T MRI which didn't show anything new regarding the prostate but did show a small growth behind the bladder which is probably a liposarcoma. Of the opinions I have sought, only the original Dr. seemed to feel anything unusual on the prostate. At the Cleveland Clinic the urologist said if it wasn't for the genetic test showing high risk, I would have been a perfect candidate for Active Surveillance- his opinion was that I'm a T1c. All urologists with the exception of the first think that nerve sparing is very likely. The original Dr. ordered a bone scan, which revealed one rib with a \"lesion\", which from what I can tell can mean nothing or something. I've read Gleason 6 almost never spreads beyond the prostate unless the biopsy didn't find the most aggressive portion. But my MRI didn't indicate there was more involved. So I was referred to a Ortho Oncologist and she ordered a bone biopsy (not a lot of fun) and am now waiting for the results with even more stress on top of everything. I will need at least an operation to remove the small tumor, but talked to Radiation Oncologists about Cyberknife and HDR Bracytherapy. While I'm a devout coward when it comes to surgery and at least temporary side effects, it seems to make the most sense to have one operation for both and not go through two different treatments. I'm healthy (other than my stress levels getting my blood pressure up higher than normal) and take no meds. A small aside is that I'm a stomach sleeper, which probably means I wouldn't get good quality sleep with the catheter. Any thoughts from those who have been there and done that would be appreciated. If I've missed anything I will be happy to add details.",

I strongly considered radiation, and actually might have picked it if it wasn't for the tumor behind my bladder that has to be surgically removed with general anesthesia. There are risks of side effects possible no matter which course of treatment is selected, but from my review of data the likelihood is somewhat less for radiation (at least for 10 year data). My only concern with SBRT (which was my initial preference) is that not only do they give high doses of radiation to kill off the cancer in the prostate with more precise margins, but they also expose the urethra to the same high doses.

      "Content": "Thanks for weighing in. I strongly considered radiation, and actually might have picked it if it wasn't for the tumor behind my bladder that has to be surgically removed with general anesthesia. There are risks of side effects possible no matter which course of treatment is selected, but from my review of data the likelihood is somewhat less for radiation (at least for 10 year data). My only concern with SBRT (which was my initial preference) is that not only do they give high doses of radiation to kill off the cancer in the prostate with more precise margins, but they also expose the urethra to the same high doses. Maybe that wont be an issue in the long run, but its not settled yet. Yes, I am concerned about the side effects of surgery, but it seems you pay the price up front and usually things improve (fingers crossed).",

      "Content": "Thanks. I was considering doing it at the Cleveland Clinic with the urologist that saw me, but he didn't have any more robotic surgery experience than the local urologist. Then there are logistics to consider as far as staying in the Cleveland area for at least a week or so. I'm agnostic about whether to pursue radiation or surgery- from the studies I have seen the percentages for 10 year side effects are slightly better for radiation. However, since I have to have surgery for the tumor with general anesthesia, I thought it would just be better to do them both together. I will be on edge until I get the bone scan results to finalize things. I hope you continue to progress from your surgery for a complete recovery.",

      "Content": "Thanks for weighing in. I strongly considered radiation, and actually might have picked it if it wasn't for the tumor behind my bladder that has to be surgically removed with general anesthesia. There are risks of side effects possible no matter which course of treatment is selected, but from my review of data the likelihood is somewhat less for radiation (at least for 10 year data). My only concern with SBRT (which was my initial preference) is that not only do they give high doses of radiation to kill off the cancer in the prostate with more precise margins, but they also expose the urethra to the same high doses. Maybe that wont be an issue in the long run, but its not settled yet. Yes, I am concerned about the side effects of surgery, but it seems you pay the price up front and usually things improve (fingers crossed).",

      "Content": "Been dealing with the usual incontinence for a little over 2 weeks and not near the panic button. However, between wearing the full padded underwear and the moisture that is retained both from leaks and the lack of breathing that is the nature of that type of underwear, the amount of irritation has gotten worse. Decided to switch to guards inside regular underwear today to see if that might help. It's gotten so bad that the irritation has created some small cracks where blood has been seen. Red and raw is the best description. When I walk I tend to walk like a cowboy who has been on a horse too long in order to reduce the friction. Not only has this made life miserable, but it also reduces the amount of walking I can tolerate. Plus, my ankles which had never been swollen pre-surgery are swollen a few hours after waking up- they are ok first thing in the morning. I put my feet up when relaxing. Any ideas, tricks, experiences, etc. to share would be appreciated!",

Decided to switch to guards inside regular underwear today to see if that might help. It's gotten so bad that the irritation has created some small cracks where blood has been seen. Red and raw is the best description. When I walk I tend to walk like a cowboy who has been on a horse too long in order to reduce the friction. Not only has this made life miserable, but it also reduces the amount of walking I can tolerate. Plus, my ankles which had never been swollen pre-surgery are swollen a few hours after waking up- they are ok first thing in the morning. I put my feet up when relaxing. Any ideas, tricks, experiences, etc. to share would be appreciated!",

      "Content": "I don't have a lot of answers for you, but I will share some things I learned from my caregiver experience. There is such a thing as hospital delirium, during which the person is not behaving at all like themselves. It's different than any form of dementia and is temporary in nature. Being in unfamiliar and medical surroundings seems to trigger it. It's important to encourage the person to fully participate in rehab. There are a lot of complications with your father's situation and I don't know what his baseline physical condition was, but as we age it takes longer to recover and the key to reaching your best is to trust in physical/occupational therapists. I motivated my mom to do the therapy as her goal was to try to get back to her house and said that doing the therapy was her best opportunity to do that. Falls can be either a major hit or a minor setback. Therapy should help that. If your father is a veteran there is Aid and Attendance support if he qualifies financially. Hope the best for you and your dad!",

Yes, I know you have to make a decision based on what information the medical people can provide. The liposarcoma turned out to be misdiagnosed (again, I was relieved that it wasn't cancer as expected) which was the motivation to have the surgery (two removals in one surgery) as opposed to other treatments. On the plus side, I don't have to worry about the possibility that the genetic test score was predictive for my Gleason 6 morphing into something worse. For me, the surgery was very painful for the first 6 days which seems to be worse than others who have shared. The other surprise was that the size of my prostate was double what the other tests indicated.

      "Content": "My emotional side is relieved (unless I'm missing something) from the results. My logical side is wondering if I really needed the surgery. Yes, I know you have to make a decision based on what information the medical people can provide. The liposarcoma turned out to be misdiagnosed (again, I was relieved that it wasn't cancer as expected) which was the motivation to have the surgery (two removals in one surgery) as opposed to other treatments. On the plus side, I don't have to worry about the possibility that the genetic test score was predictive for my Gleason 6 morphing into something worse. For me, the surgery was very painful for the first 6 days which seems to be worse than others who have shared. The other surprise was that the size of my prostate was double what the other tests indicated.
