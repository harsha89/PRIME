      "Content": "Thank you all. There will be many questions in the future, first is did any of you change your diet/lifestyle in response to your diagnosis? I don't smoke or drink much. I'm 25 lbs overweight and not an athlete. Stress or other illness will initiate my prostitis flares ups. This one I'm in now has gone on since July 2014. I have asked for years if removing the organ is an option to relieve the constant burning I have. Was always advised against that as a first option. Opinions please. Is there general agreement on bringing an oncologist in at this point in my journey or is that premature?",

I'm 25 lbs overweight and not an athlete. Stress or other illness will initiate my prostitis flares ups. This one I'm in now has gone on since July 2014. I have asked for years if removing the organ is an option to relieve the constant burning I have. Was always advised against that as a first option. Opinions please.

      "Content": "Thank you all. There will be many questions in the future, first is did any of you change your diet/lifestyle in response to your diagnosis? I don't smoke or drink much. I'm 25 lbs overweight and not an athlete. Stress or other illness will initiate my prostitis flares ups. This one I'm in now has gone on since July 2014. I have asked for years if removing the organ is an option to relieve the constant burning I have. Was always advised against that as a first option. Opinions please. Is there general agreement on bringing an oncologist in at this point in my journey or is that premature?",

      "Content": "Hello fellow travelers. I am 63 years old and have had many bouts of chronic prostitis since my late 20s. PSA tested was always between 2.5 and 4 depending on severity. Treated with antibiotics things would calm down and life would go on. That was until last year. Mother developed lung cancer and I Was deeply involved with getting her and my dads Life set for what was coming for them. Terrible stress level for me caused a Prostitis flare up that continues to today. I knew something was up with a 4.2 PSA that climbed to a 5.9 in 3 months. I don't know all the terms or acronyms yet but I had a 14 sample biopsy a week ago And they found in 10 % of one sample cancer on the Gleason scale 3+3= 6 I go back in 10 days to discuss this health issue. I don't know where to begin, what to ask or anything. There is a lot to learn in a short time, I'm hoping you folks can help me understand what I have coming. No one in my family has ever succumbed to cancer that I know of. My wife's grandfather, only uncle and mother all die from bone Cancer, so she's very concerned. I'm not surprised that my prostate finally gave up The fight but I need help understanding where I am and where I need to go. Thanks all.",
