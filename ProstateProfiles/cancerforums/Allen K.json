I am scheduled with my URO for a TRUS this Tuesday, but am seriously considering calling the University Medical Center to inquire. Man, so much to consider, I do not have a URO there, but have a recommendation for a good one. Perhaps it would be prudent to cancel/reschedule the current biopsy and consult with the University center regarding availability and timing. If I do nothing, then it is TRUS Tuesday at 1 pm. On the other hand, my current Urologist has good instinct, just not access to latest technology. Again, appreciate the thoughts.",
