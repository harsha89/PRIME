My current PSA is 0.018 and will have my second vacation from Lupron in May. I just want to say how great full I am. Since I started this journey I have seen 3 grandchildren born. This May I will get to walk my daughter down the isle. I wake up every morning to the most loving wife who knows that a kiss and a hug is still intimate. Yes I have side effects but to me it is worth it for the above reasons. Dr. Lam says he will get me to 70 and I told him then I will get me to 80. We both feel attitude plays a big roll in outcome. Not just in PC but in all areas. Thanks to all my brothers here who have consoled and given great advice. Keep fighting the good fight I plan on it. FIGHT ON",
