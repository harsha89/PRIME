I haven't noticed that the coffee has had any effect, but I did have a lot more trouble with getting urinary normalcy back on track during the day. Night time was fine.......up maybe three times a night for a crampy, full feeling that was relieved with a high volume, satisfying piss. Days, not so much...I think I overthought it, going too often, not emptying completely, fretting about a drop or two in my pants (like there has been all my life). Sometimes I had some burning that really confused the signals. It's getting better now - I have been pad/shield free for a week now, at Week 7.......but in hindsight, I wish I could have just learned to relax and let myself heal rather than overanalyze and fret about every squirt or dribble. On the sports, I would wait a full two months to do the twisting and running. Too much to lose if you tear something loose......... Good to hear you are doing well, friend. Best regards, DD",

All I can offer you in the way of comfort is that the vast majority of people I know from this board had RALRP, and out of those, most are coping very well with minimal or no lasting side effects. Of course there is always a risk of ED or some measure of incontinence, but in my experience that largely depends on what the surgeons finds he has to do once he's in there, and how much skill God gave him to do it. In some cases it's obvious - obviously, he can't leave behind a nerve bundle that might preserve your sexual ability if there is cancer present in or around it. You've found this forum, and that's a great benefit. There are some damn smart guys on here that have walked this road and have forgotten more about prostate cancer than some doctors will ever know, and everyone on here is pulling for you.

I haven't noticed that the coffee has had any effect, but I did have a lot more trouble with getting urinary normalcy back on track during the day. Night time was fine.......up maybe three times a night for a crampy, full feeling that was relieved with a high volume, satisfying piss. Days, not so much...I think I overthought it, going too often, not emptying completely, fretting about a drop or two in my pants (like there has been all my life). Sometimes I had some burning that really confused the signals. It's getting better now - I have been pad/shield free for a week now, at Week 7.......but in hindsight, I wish I could have just learned to relax and let myself heal rather than overanalyze and fret about every squirt or dribble. On the sports, I would wait a full two months to do the twisting and running. Too much to lose if you tear something loose......... Good to hear you are doing well, friend. Best regards, DD",

At seven weeks I have a shield (not a pad) there just in case, but I have never felt a genuinely \"wet\" one. At the same time, even at this point, I have had a few legitimate \"squirts\" and \"dribbles\". In terms of quality of life, nothing I am experiencing could not be fixed by a shield a day. To me, that is a non-issue. Good luck! DD",

      "Content": "I think that people have a tendency to want to seek out cases similar to theirs, that have had a good outcome, because it is reassuring and emotionally satisfying to read about. The problem with that is, that in the course of going to these forums and reading of different cases you are also likely to find a case with similar stats as yours that maybe didn't fare so well. The only thing I am thoroughly convinced of, as far as this disease is concerned, is that every case is different. I had a dream the other night that I was in New Orleans in the summertime. I was fourteen again, and I was riding what we used to call an \"English Racer\" bicycle on the interstate and handily passing cars travelling 60-70mph. It was in the summertime, and when the dream started it was very hot, but as it progressed a squall formed over Lake Pontchartrain and moved inland; thunder rolled, and a cold wind begin to blow as the first drops of rain hitting the hot asphalt caused steam to rise up from the rode and the smell of the summer rain hit my nostrils. At that point the raindrops stopped falling and, instead, it begin to rain small fish - maybe 2' long and shiny, silvery fish -hitting my face, bouncing off of the cars around me, slapping down on the pavement. Until now, I never told anybody about that one, for fear of being locked up...strange, indeed. Regards, DD",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PDV I am one year out and just getting back to stiffer erections with generic Viagra (sildenafil) and/or Cialis. One absolute keys is that you have to take Viagra on an empty stomach or it doesn't work. And it works pretty fast with a small (two hours?) window of opportunity. The other key is I use a hair elastic like a cock ring. That really helps because it allows the blood to flow in but not out. A third key is to have a really patient wife and --this may sound too graphic for some--but you have to take care of her first because if you do you don't need to be hard like an iron bar. Happy wife, happy sex life. Paraphrasing a lyric from Little Charlie and the Nightcats, you can lick this problem by using your head. I could not agree more. Sometimes I wonder a bit about these guys who basically are struggling with losing their intimacy and any remnant of a sexual relationship with their spouse, but to be honest, I always felt a little more sorry for my self than my partner; I never worried too much about her getting taken care of; some of us have known for a long time that there's more than one way to skin that cat. A little imagination can go a long, long, way. Finding ways to work with what you have is a great way to spend the time waiting for it all to come back. Having been around this forum for a while, I have seen my share of guys who are into their second or even third year post-op and continue to improve, so all is not lost......you might want to speak to your doctor about Muse and give it a whirl...it might put some wind in your sails to see the old boy back in action and to know that all is not lost after all......

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hms03049 You should be fine. The hard week will be the first due to the catheter. Every several hours it has the be emptied. The bed or sofa are both fine. You will want to get up and walk around the house very hour to avoid clots. The regular toilet is all you need, with the catheter #1 is taken care of and you'll be lucky to have a BM before day 3 or 4. They will prescribe a stool softener like Colace or similar, be sure to take it just as they say. Stock up on non diet jello, Gatorade, maybe Ensure. Something like Gatorade will keep your electrolytes balanced, keep you hydrated, and get you some sugar for energy should you not feel like getting up and fixing something to eat. Until your bowls start working you are not going to be eating Hot Pockets and the like. You will want a low residual diet, no whole gains, seeds, nuts, raw veggies, etc. Get off the narcotics like Percocet because it causes constipation to continue. NO alcohol while on narcotics. While on Percocet make sure you do not leave the stove on and go to sleep. Take care not to snag the catheter on anything, it doesn't take a lot to pull it out. Keep the bag lower that the bladder so nothing runs back into you. I suggest buying a garter belt to hold the bag. They are on Amazon or at a local med supply. It is much more comfortable than the tape to the leg set you leave the hospital with. Also loose fitting sweat or basket ball pants are handy when going out. Realize they actually cut the urethra to remove the prostate and reattach it to the bladder (Yikes!). This is mostly why they say take it easy and no lifting. It is also why they say no straining on the toilet. There is nothing like a blast like a tee shirt cannon from the rear due to too much fiber before the system is starting to move again or too much Colace. You can do some real damage, and it hurts. Once the catheter is out you will be over the hump and able to go shopping, drop in on friends, go out to dinner, etc. Do not drive if still on narcotics. You will need a soft cushion to set on for the first 3-4 weeks, hard surfaces, bar stools, bicycles, etc are out. You are better off with Depends pads you put in your briefs than the one piece underwear. The heavy ones will hold a full bladder and not leak. They fit in your pocket, and you do not need to get undressed to yank it out and put in a new one. Are these the ones you recommend? http://www.amazon.com/Depend-Absorbe.../dp/B004OQP3O4 Thanks!!",

Can I sleep on regular bed, use a regular toilet, etc, etc? For the first two weeks? Will I be able to walk around, heat up a can of soup, stuff like that?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Pratoman Good advice above. I would add, for the times when you are not out, especially when sleeping and using a regular catheter bag, rather than the leg bag, get a 5 gallon oval shaped bucket to hold the bag. I took the bucket into the shower with me it made things easier. Even tho I hated it I'm sorry, I'm having a hard time visualizing what you are saying.......what does the bucket do, exactly? I am assuming there is a semi-rigid catheter inserted into the penis with some tubing on it that goes to a bag? And the bucket........?? Sorry I have never seen any of this stuff, can only imagine.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by hms03049 You should be fine. The hard week will be the first due to the catheter. Every several hours it has the be emptied. The bed or sofa are both fine. You will want to get up and walk around the house very hour to avoid clots. The regular toilet is all you need, with the catheter #1 is taken care of and you'll be lucky to have a BM before day 3 or 4. They will prescribe a stool softener like Colace or similar, be sure to take it just as they say. Stock up on non diet jello, Gatorade, maybe Ensure. Something like Gatorade will keep your electrolytes balanced, keep you hydrated, and get you some sugar for energy should you not feel like getting up and fixing something to eat. Until your bowls start working you are not going to be eating Hot Pockets and the like. You will want a low residual diet, no whole gains, seeds, nuts, raw veggies, etc. Get off the narcotics like Percocet because it causes constipation to continue. NO alcohol while on narcotics. While on Percocet make sure you do not leave the stove on and go to sleep. Take care not to snag the catheter on anything, it doesn't take a lot to pull it out. Keep the bag lower that the bladder so nothing runs back into you. I suggest buying a garter belt to hold the bag. They are on Amazon or at a local med supply. It is much more comfortable than the tape to the leg set you leave the hospital with. Also loose fitting sweat or basket ball pants are handy when going out. Realize they actually cut the urethra to remove the prostate and reattach it to the bladder (Yikes!). This is mostly why they say take it easy and no lifting. It is also why they say no straining on the toilet. There is nothing like a blast like a tee shirt cannon from the rear due to too much fiber before the system is starting to move again or too much Colace. You can do some real damage, and it hurts. Once the catheter is out you will be over the hump and able to go shopping, drop in on friends, go out to dinner, etc. Do not drive if still on narcotics. You will need a soft cushion to set on for the first 3-4 weeks, hard surfaces, bar stools, bicycles, etc are out. You are better off with Depends pads you put in your briefs than the one piece underwear. The heavy ones will hold a full bladder and not leak. They fit in your pocket, and you do not need to get undressed to yank it out and put in a new one. Are these the ones you recommend? http://www.amazon.com/Depend-Absorbe.../dp/B004OQP3O4 Thanks!!",

I guess I need to have diapers and puppy pads and stuff ready for my coming home? I really don't have anyone who can stay with me...can I do this alone? Can I sleep on regular bed, use a regular toilet, etc, etc? For the first two weeks? Will I be able to walk around, heat up a can of soup, stuff like that? Will I be able to have a couple of glasses of wine in the evenings? When will I start feeling independent as far as being able to buy groceries, cook, take a shower, drive myself to appointments, etc? I want to be back to work in 3 weeks...is this a practical milestone or no? Thanks guys, DD",

      "Content": "I had a fourteen core biopsy and a T3 MRI come back as normal when I actually had cancer THE WHOLE TIME. You have to be your own advocate here - no doctor or urologist can make you do anything you don't want to do, and if quality of life is your primary concern, with zero risk of any complications from surgery, then so be it......they will treat you according to your own wishes, but it is also incumbent upon them to inform you about the statistical risks if you wish to pursue alternatives to surgery and radiation. The whole idea behind the surgery is to hopefully address the cancer before it escapes the confines of the prostate capsule. Once that happens, the situation becomes a lot more complicated. If there is evidence that it has already spread beyond the prostate, there are many doctors who would not remove your prostate at that point, anyway, because at that point there is little or no benefit. I would suggest a fusion-guided biopsy, which uses an MRI image to guide the biopsy to areas of concern instead of just random targets spread around the prostate. You really do have to start somewhere.....and if you do have a low risk, slow growing cancer, there may not be any invasive treatment at all - maybe just active surveillance - and knowing what you are dealing with is a hell of a lot better than not knowing. Good luck, DD",

So, yeah........I think it's a good idea......but those people who think instead of surgery they'll just give up red meat and eat twigs and leaves and get cured; I'm thinking that's not going to work out well. Some will read this and shake their head but, believe it or not, I got an earlier spot for my surgery because of a guy who decided at the last minute that he was just going to treat his Pca himself, with a healthy diet. Hope it worked out for him....... Regards, DD",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kathy77 Hi everyone, I joined back in around March when my father was first diagnosed. You were all so kind and helpful I took a break as it became all consuming and I think I became a little research obsessed! I'm sure you all know what I'm talking about. Anyway. Here is the latest. Dad was initially given these results: T3b plus lymph node. Psa 16 (although oncologist said it was likely to be higher owing to certain medication... That's another story!) Gleason 9 (4+5) (4+5) Was started on hormones, now on injections. Dad's recent consultation with the oncologist was both good and bad The good...he has responded well to the hormones so far and psa is down to 1.4. This has happened relatively quickly. No lymph nodes in the groin are affected, we knew this BUT... The lymph node near his tummy button is cancerous we were hoping it wasn't, during the previous appointment the oncologist was not sure and wanted to See if it reacted to the hormone injections. If it did it indicated cancer. Unfortunately it did however it has shrunk down to 1cm. The problem is, nothing can be done with this lymph node because of it's position. The oncologist said it was very unusual. Anyway, Dad starts radiotherapy in a number if weeks. He is having a strong dose, once a week. I'm afraid I don't know the exact type of radiotherapy. I'm abroad at the moment and all the information I have is by telephone. The oncologist told my family that the problem with the affected node is, when it reduces to its final cells he can't say what will happen, whether it will spread or not. Anyway... Just want to hear your thoughts. I guess... I want to know, has anybody who had lymph nodes affected ... What had been your experience? Dad's bone scan is clear by the way. I know it's not a great diagnosis at all but we are trying to remain hopeful. Hopeful that it can be controlled for a long time. I am guessing it is not curable but.. Still saying prayers. Hope you are all doing ok. Thanks for reading xx Kathy, I have (or hopefully, HAD) prostate cancer, too. The one thing to keep in mind (and it is an Absolute Truth) is this: EVERY case is different.....like a snowflake or a fingerprint....so don't think you can predict what will happen in one case based on statistics or what somebody else tells you. In the meantime, stay optimistic. Talk, love, laugh, and enjoy your life; don't let this rob you of your joy. Best regards, DD",

I told the doc about it on my first follow up and he didn't act very surprised, so I guess it is in the realm, at least, of normal - I am just surprised that it is hanging out two months post-op. Maybe it's diet; I'll have to play around with that and see. There is a deli at work and in the mornings they make a fantastic home-made biscuit with egg and sausage on the inside and I find them irresistible...so there's another common denominator. I was super gassy right after surgery but apparently they blow your abdomen up like a balloon with CO2 in order to get in there with the instruments. I remember one of my milestones was first post-op fart. I farted so long and so loud that for a few hours afterwards I couldn't even remember my birthday. Have a great Sunday, DD",

      "Content": "Hello, I am almost two months past RALRP and doing pretty well. Dry now for a week, ED is still something I am sorting out but functionality and potential is clearly there. One thing I am observing that I don't hear about much is a change in bowel \"behavior\"..... I returned to work after four weeks. I am experiencing a LOT of gas in the mornings, and my whole gut sounds like the Boston Symphony warming up to play in the mornings.....so much so that I have become very conscious of it in meetings, etc.....you can actually hear my rumblings across the room sometimes; or at the very least, in the next cubicle (\"Is that your stomach doing that?\"). What usually helps is sitting on the toilet and just relaxing (I check email) and most of the errant gas will find its way out...but some days are better than others. And also......there seems to be a relationship now between bowel function and urinary function.....an urge to empty the bowel seems to increase those \"ghost\" squirts and dribbles, and can also bring on some very uncomfortable, even painful...cramps. On the other hand, a firm and satisfying emptying of the bowel seems to get everything down there in synch hitting on the right cylinders and life goes on as if nothing ever happened. Anybody else having some of these type of issues? Thank, fellas. DD",

      "Content": "Hello everyone! I'm a white male, turned 59 today. My story starts during a pre-employment physical in November of 2013. The attending doctor called me a few days after the exam and asked if I had ever had a PSA test done, and I said I couldn't recall that I had. He told me that my PSA levels were very high and needed to be checked out. The PSA was 17.1. I was in New Orleans at the time, so I called Ochsner Hospital and considered myself very fortunate to have gotten an appointment with the head of urological oncology there. He did the DRE and an ultrasound on my bladder and said all appeared normal, but given the urgency of my needing to be cleared to work, and the level of the PSA, that a biopsy would be indicated to be absolutely sure. I said let's go..... The first doc had called me on a Friday with the PSA results, my appointment at Ochsner was the following Monday, and the Biopsy happened two days later, on Wednesday. For me personally, it was quite unpleasant and painful. The doctor took fourteen cores total. Then came the waiting........ It was almost two weeks to the day when I got the call, and the doctor told me that the biopsy was all clear - no cancer or abnormal cells. As relieved as I was, I asked about the PSA level and he said it could be a number of reasons. He wanted to put me on finasteride for six months and do a follow up. I gut the prescription filled, but after reading up on finasteride, decided against taking it.....the main reason being that it only seemed to address an enlarged prostate, and at a measure 23 grams during the biopsy, mine was not enlarged. I discussed it with my regular doc and he offered Terazosin, which is an alpha blocker used to treat hypertension (which I do) and has the side effect of...shrinking the prostate. Ultimately, I quit taking that, too - it made me feel awful, didn't help my blood pressure, and again - my prostate wasn't enlarged anyway. A year later I had not followed up and decided it might be a good idea to get checked again. This time, at home in Houston, I went to a Urologist in the Medical Center that was suggested by one of out family's doctors. He did a DRE and PSA test. Prostate exam was normal, he said. Then the PSA came back at 31. He said he wanted to do a fusion guided biopsy. He said I would do an MRI first, and it would reveal any tumor or \"areas of interest\", and that later those locations could be precisely biopsied. He went on to tell me that the MRI would be read and assigned a \"grade\" as follows: 1 for VERY likely NOT cancer 2 for likely not cancer 3 for it could go either way 4 for likely to be cancer 5 for VERY likely to be cancer He said if it came back a 1 or a 2, we would not do anything. Anything above two we would proceed with the biopsy. It came back a week later, graded a 1 - negative for any indication of any malignancy or suspicious tissue. Prostate size was normal. The doctor said he still wanted to do a biopsy, which led me to ask him...biopsy what? There is no tumor OR suspicious tissue, so biopsy what? I just wasn't really happy with his reaction to all of this, so it was the last time I ever saw him. I went straight to the phone and made an appointment at M.D. Anderson. It took about three weeks to get an appointment and get all of the medical records together. The Doc did another PSA test, a PCA3 test (an indicator of prostate cancer cell DNA), and I was DRE'd twice that day...once by the PA (a woman!) and once by the doc himself. (Not trying to be sexist or anything with that remark, it was just a little surprising to me.) He also said he was going to get HIS radiologist to re-read the MRI because she was famous for catching areas that other doctors miss. Three days later I got a call - they wanted to set up a date for a fusion guided biopsy. The radiologist had indeed found an \"area of interest\", and later, the PCA3 test came back at 40, which is actually relatively low, but still over the threshold of normal. Had the biopsy (they knocked me out with propofol; I highly recommend it) on a Friday and the doc called me on Monday. They had found cancer, Gleason 3+4. He said he wanted to see me to do the usual bone scan and abdominal CT scan, and discuss treatment options. The two he mentioned were radiation and surgery, and he seemed to lean strongly towards surgery. I asked if he felt like it might have jumped and I was surprised and relieved when he seemed confident that it had not because of size and location. Of course, you never really know until after the scans and the post op pathology I guess, but still it's nice to find the occasional candle in all of this darkness. So the appointment for the scans is Wednesday of next week and I will talk to the doc about treatment options, I would really appreciate some input from those of you who have been down this road before.

You go for your 2nd three months later and they say it's <.1 ng/ml - YAY!!! They tell you that they both meet the clinical criteria for \"undetectable\"....and leave you wondering why now ZERO is clinically the same as .09999. And what about \"doubling\"? How many times does 0.0 have to double to get .06 ? How come some doctors use ultra-sensitive assays and others don't? WHO is right? I feel so sorry for people visiting here for the first time. There are SO MANY conflicting views about this disease. Regards, DD",

      "Content": "Hello everyone! I'm a white male, turned 59 today. My story starts during a pre-employment physical in November of 2013. The attending doctor called me a few days after the exam and asked if I had ever had a PSA test done, and I said I couldn't recall that I had. He told me that my PSA levels were very high and needed to be checked out. The PSA was 17.1. I was in New Orleans at the time, so I called Ochsner Hospital and considered myself very fortunate to have gotten an appointment with the head of urological oncology there. He did the DRE and an ultrasound on my bladder and said all appeared normal, but given the urgency of my needing to be cleared to work, and the level of the PSA, that a biopsy would be indicated to be absolutely sure. I said let's go..... The first doc had called me on a Friday with the PSA results, my appointment at Ochsner was the following Monday, and the Biopsy happened two days later, on Wednesday. For me personally, it was quite unpleasant and painful. The doctor took fourteen cores total. Then came the waiting........ It was almost two weeks to the day when I got the call, and the doctor told me that the biopsy was all clear - no cancer or abnormal cells. As relieved as I was, I asked about the PSA level and he said it could be a number of reasons. He wanted to put me on finasteride for six months and do a follow up. I gut the prescription filled, but after reading up on finasteride, decided against taking it.....the main reason being that it only seemed to address an enlarged prostate, and at a measure 23 grams during the biopsy, mine was not enlarged. I discussed it with my regular doc and he offered Terazosin, which is an alpha blocker used to treat hypertension (which I do) and has the side effect of...shrinking the prostate. Ultimately, I quit taking that, too - it made me feel awful, didn't help my blood pressure, and again - my prostate wasn't enlarged anyway. A year later I had not followed up and decided it might be a good idea to get checked again. This time, at home in Houston, I went to a Urologist in the Medical Center that was suggested by one of out family's doctors. He did a DRE and PSA test. Prostate exam was normal, he said. Then the PSA came back at 31. He said he wanted to do a fusion guided biopsy. He said I would do an MRI first, and it would reveal any tumor or \"areas of interest\", and that later those locations could be precisely biopsied.

You go for your 2nd three months later and they say it's <.1 ng/ml - YAY!!! They tell you that they both meet the clinical criteria for \"undetectable\"....and leave you wondering why now ZERO is clinically the same as .09999. And what about \"doubling\"? How many times does 0.0 have to double to get .06 ? How come some doctors use ultra-sensitive assays and others don't? WHO is right? I feel so sorry for people visiting here for the first time. There are SO MANY conflicting views about this disease. Regards, DD",

The patient's surgical pathology revealed to be T3a Gleason 9, 4+5 prostatic adenocarcinoma with extraprostatic extension present, tumor present focally at the margin of resection (focal extension to the right base margin is 1 mm), microscopic bladder neck invasion present, positive node 1/36 with metastatic tumor measuring 1.0 mm with lymph node involved by the tumor is 3 mm, with extranodal extension present. This patient is here for the postop followup appointment. He is doing well. He denies having any medical complaint or problems today. He denies having any problems with his incision. His PSA today is 0.0. In regards to his urinary symptoms, he is doing Kegel exercises. He does have residual stress urinary incontinence, wearing 1 shield per day as a precautionary basis. He does have burning with urination, worse in the evening time. He denies any urgency, frequency, hematuria, hesitancy with urination. He has a good stream. He is able to empty his bladder completely. In regards to his erectile dysfunction, patient does not have a partner. However, he does have noted partial erections.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is alert and orientation x 3, no acute distress. VITALS: Temperature is 36.7, pulse is 86, respiration 20, blood pressure is 156/90. Pain scale is 0/10. HEART: Regular rate, rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. NECK: Supple, no JVD noted. ABDOMEN: Soft, nontender, nondistended, bowel sounds x 4, no organomegaly. Surgical incision sites are well-healed, no signs of infection or hernia noted. CVA is nontender to palpation. LOWER EXTREMITIES: No pitting edema noted. SKIN: Warm and dry to touch. No lesion noted. LABORATORY: PSA 0.0. ASSESSMENT: 1. Mr. Dogdollar is a 59-year-old gentleman who is status post robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection on 06/09/2015, with surgical pathology of T3a Gleason 9, 4+5 prostatic adenocarcinoma, tumor present focally to the margin of resection (1 mm), with microscopic bladder neck invasion present, positive node 1/36, with PSA of 0.0. 2. He is complaining of burning with urination worse in the evening time. 3. Residual stress urinary incontinence, wearing 1 shield per day. 4. Erectile dysfunction. PLAN: 1. Regarding his burning with urination, the patient will get a UA and a culture done today. The patient was instructed in the clinic. However, I had forgot to inform the patient to tell him to go downstairs for his urine specimen. XXXXXX, RN had left a voicemail on his cell phone number to inform him to go downstairs for his UA and culture. If patient already had a left the building then he can get a UA and culture done locally. The results will be placed on chart checklist, in case, if the patient decided to get it done here and it will be chart checked. 2. Regarding his erectile dysfunction, patient was given a vacuum erectile device. The patient was instructed he use this regularly. The patient will start the Cialis 5 mg 1 tablet daily. The patient wanted to try Cialis instead of trying the sildenafil medication. If patient does have any problem with prescription coverage issue, then he should contact our service back and we will switch the patient to sildenafil 20 mg. The patient does not have any contraindication with this medication. The side effects of the medication were explained to the patient. The prescription was sent to his local pharmacy, #30 with 3 refills. 3. Regarding his blood pressure of 156/90, patient was instructed to recheck the blood pressure at his home 2-3 times this week. If his blood pressure is greater than 140/90 he needs to follow with his primary care physician since patient is currently on 3 different blood pressure medications. 4. The patient will return to the clinic in 3 months for followup appointment with a PSA. 5. Above finding was discussed with Dr. Feelgood. He had met with the patient today. He had discussed the pathology and above plan was created by him.",

      "Content": "Jdsky, I sincerely hope that all goes well for you, and of course, there is every reason to believe that it will. Thinking back on my own RALRP (on 9 June 2015), the only real problems I had were on the second night in the hospital; my bladder was very unhappy with the catheter and I was having regular bladder spasms that were quite painful. The nurse offered morphine at one point and I gladly took her up on it...but, sadly, this is one of those situations that even morphine does little good, so I just rode it out and turned her morphine down the next time she offered (never dreamed I would do that!). Also, I was having a LOT of drainage from my JP drain (they took 33 lymph nodes) and had to take it home and drag it around for the next nine days, until that glorious day came when the catheter and the JP drain both came out. Beyond that, it was five days for me before a bowel movement occurred, although I never felt uncomfortable or bound-up or anything...I think the thing about the pain meds is the opiates really stop you up, and whatever you do you don't want to strain to pass a stool...with all of that internal stitching, it angers the trolls that live under the bridge. I took stool softeners every day and started a couple of glasses of good old prune juice on day three and at day five nature took its course. The guys here pretty much talked me into throwing down about a grand for a pimped-out La-Z-Boy (cupholders!!) and I can say with no reservation whatsoever that it was a great investment. Truth be told, I sleep on it to this day! I was lucky with continence. I had bought a pack of pads but just had the occasional pinch-and-squirt - a random drop or three - so went almost right away to shields and when they ran out I was done. So, I wouldn't stock up until you have a better feel for your situation after the catheter comes out. Well, relax and take the ride, let us know when you pop up on this side and how things went. Good luck and God bless, DD",

      "Content": "Just wanted to share this with you fellows, and you ladies who are here for your fellows (bless you)....may be a message here for those wanting to put things off for a while. I am doing well but just overwhelmed from the path report and still tired from the surgery and the weight of all of this. I'll be back to address any questions in the next few days. Right now I am enjoying a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon and boiling a hot dog LOL. My surgery was 9 June and I have been back to work since last week. As you read, keep in mind that I had a 14 core biopsy that was \"normal\" in Dec 2013, and that in Feb of 2015 I had an MRI that was \"Normal\" and showed \"no evidence of cancer\". The peter pump deal was really funny...they were all like...\"Ah HELL yeah man, your insurance pays for it..get that Peter Pump!!\" I still haven't opened it. Might make my commute a LOT more interesting LOL. Onward and upward. Very best regards, DD 07/22/2015 ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: xxxxxxxx. HISTORY OF COMPLAINT: Prostate cancer postop followup appointment. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Dogdollar is a 59-year-old male who had underwent bilateral nerve-sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection on 06/09/2015 under care of Dr. xxxxxxx, for clinical Gleason 7, 4+3 prostatic adenocarcinoma with a pretreatment PSA of 27.1. The patient's surgical pathology revealed to be T3a Gleason 9, 4+5 prostatic adenocarcinoma with extraprostatic extension present, tumor present focally at the margin of resection (focal extension to the right base margin is 1 mm), microscopic bladder neck invasion present, positive node 1/36 with metastatic tumor measuring 1.0 mm with lymph node involved by the tumor is 3 mm, with extranodal extension present.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: GENERAL: The patient is alert and orientation x 3, no acute distress. VITALS: Temperature is 36.7, pulse is 86, respiration 20, blood pressure is 156/90. Pain scale is 0/10. HEART: Regular rate, rhythm. No murmurs, rubs or gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. NECK: Supple, no JVD noted.

LOWER EXTREMITIES: No pitting edema noted. SKIN: Warm and dry to touch. No lesion noted. LABORATORY: PSA 0.0. ASSESSMENT: 1. Mr. Dogdollar is a 59-year-old gentleman who is status post robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection on 06/09/2015, with surgical pathology of T3a Gleason 9, 4+5 prostatic adenocarcinoma, tumor present focally to the margin of resection (1 mm), with microscopic bladder neck invasion present, positive node 1/36, with PSA of 0.0. 2. He is complaining of burning with urination worse in the evening time. 3. Residual stress urinary incontinence, wearing 1 shield per day. 4. Erectile dysfunction. PLAN: 1. Regarding his burning with urination, the patient will get a UA and a culture done today. The patient was instructed in the clinic. However, I had forgot to inform the patient to tell him to go downstairs for his urine specimen. XXXXXX, RN had left a voicemail on his cell phone number to inform him to go downstairs for his UA and culture. If patient already had a left the building then he can get a UA and culture done locally. The results will be placed on chart checklist, in case, if the patient decided to get it done here and it will be chart checked. 2. Regarding his erectile dysfunction, patient was given a vacuum erectile device. The patient was instructed he use this regularly. The patient will start the Cialis 5 mg 1 tablet daily. The patient wanted to try Cialis instead of trying the sildenafil medication. If patient does have any problem with prescription coverage issue, then he should contact our service back and we will switch the patient to sildenafil 20 mg. The patient does not have any contraindication with this medication. The side effects of the medication were explained to the patient. The prescription was sent to his local pharmacy, #30 with 3 refills. 3. Regarding his blood pressure of 156/90, patient was instructed to recheck the blood pressure at his home 2-3 times this week. If his blood pressure is greater than 140/90 he needs to follow with his primary care physician since patient is currently on 3 different blood pressure medications. 4. The patient will return to the clinic in 3 months for followup appointment with a PSA. 5. Above finding was discussed with Dr. Feelgood. He had met with the patient today. He had discussed the pathology and above plan was created by him.",

      "Content": "Jdsky, I sincerely hope that all goes well for you, and of course, there is every reason to believe that it will. Thinking back on my own RALRP (on 9 June 2015), the only real problems I had were on the second night in the hospital; my bladder was very unhappy with the catheter and I was having regular bladder spasms that were quite painful. The nurse offered morphine at one point and I gladly took her up on it...but, sadly, this is one of those situations that even morphine does little good, so I just rode it out and turned her morphine down the next time she offered (never dreamed I would do that!). Also, I was having a LOT of drainage from my JP drain (they took 33 lymph nodes) and had to take it home and drag it around for the next nine days, until that glorious day came when the catheter and the JP drain both came out. Beyond that, it was five days for me before a bowel movement occurred, although I never felt uncomfortable or bound-up or anything...I think the thing about the pain meds is the opiates really stop you up, and whatever you do you don't want to strain to pass a stool...with all of that internal stitching, it angers the trolls that live under the bridge. I took stool softeners every day and started a couple of glasses of good old prune juice on day three and at day five nature took its course. The guys here pretty much talked me into throwing down about a grand for a pimped-out La-Z-Boy (cupholders!!) and I can say with no reservation whatsoever that it was a great investment. Truth be told, I sleep on it to this day! I was lucky with continence. I had bought a pack of pads but just had the occasional pinch-and-squirt - a random drop or three - so went almost right away to shields and when they ran out I was done. So, I wouldn't stock up until you have a better feel for your situation after the catheter comes out. Well, relax and take the ride, let us know when you pop up on this side and how things went. Good luck and God bless, DD",

My next test will be done in 6 1/2 months just a few weeks short of my 70th birthday. I now look forward to heading to our winter home and escaping the cold Canadian winter in Oct.

      "Content": "The thing about incontinence is not quite accurate......I am at a shield a day (12 hours) and have been since the catheter came out. Have never felt a \"wet\" shield. In Houston, in the summertime there is a LOT of moisture in that area....you don't change them because they are wet...you change them because they get nasty in the heat. The bit all about the ED is a little exaggerated......have not tried it out...but it does seem to have life. Mr. Johnson keeps a bit lower profile than before, but there is definite reaction to stimuli.....so far I am reluctant to push levels to the extremes; if, for no other reason, not to blow anything up. I now have official Doc's permission to pursue this further. This may be an interesting weekend.",

      "Content": "Know what I would like to see? Percentiles of Gleason scores (6-10) in newly diagnosed cases of Pca, say for the last five years. My guess would be that 65-75%, or maybe even higher, are Gleason 6. It would be interesting to see if Gleason scores were trending down or up, though........although my guess would be they are staying about the same. With all of the other statistics out there (including remaining life calculators, where you just enter your PSA score and tumor grade LOL), I would think someone, somewhere, keeps an eye on this, but I sure can't find it on the interwebs. Just thinking out loud, fellas....if you have this info somewhere, send a brother a link. Kind regards, DD Prosit!",

I would certainly think twice about adjusting blood pressure medication as an amateur strategy to facilitate continence after RALRP. At one month out, it is not unusual for some problems with incontinence, that will likely resolve as time passes, but that requires a little patience...to try and alter the outcome by adjusting hypertension medication, especially without consulting a doctor, is, in my opinion.....NUTS. Continence doesn't do much for quality of life after a stroke. Regards, DD",

      "Content": "Almost without exception, pretty much every doctor, clinic, or hospital you ask will tell you that the gold standard for achieving continence post-RALRP is twelve months. Obviously, some do better, but quite a few take several months or every bit of a year to get there. I don't think many doctors would recommend any surgical intervention ( like the implanted valve) until that patient had had the year to heal and a true evaluation at that point can be done. I can imagine that it must be frustrating for your Dad, but he won't be the first person I've seen on here that gave it up as hopeless, then, a few months later, magically started improving! I would experiment with the kegels (it seems as though some methods work better than other for some folks) with the guidance of your doctor. Best regards, DD",

      "Content": "After my most recent follow-up, I was thinking about this whole prostate thing, and my own journey, and I got to wondering about something. I'm a big fan of the PSA test; it more than likely saved my bacon, and did the same for a lot of my friends here, too. What I am wondering about was, how, before the advent of the PSA screenings, did surgeons determine a biochemical reoccurrence without using PSA numbers as a reference? Hopefully they didn't have to wait unti there was enough tumor mass to x-ray? Anybody know? Thanks, and have a great day, DD",

      "Content": "The one thing I have learned from my journey is this: We all tend to want to compare our situation with another person's; especially when the circumstances are similar, and when their results are good and the outlook positive, and that's not a bad thing; it is human nature for us to try and provide ourselves with answers that are emotionally satisfying when our very lives or at the very least the quality of our lives, are on the table. Yes, you will see some guys what are evaluated at a 4+3, then on second opinion, downgraded to 3+3, but don't forget, it works the other way, too, and that 3+4 can turn out to be a 4+5. That being said, I think it is still the best course to err on the side of caution when deciding on a course of treatment. You can't count on the post-op pathology being consistent with what they find during a biopsy. I am no surgeon but the conventional wisdom dictates that, when (and if) necessary, radiation can follow surgery more effectively than surgery can follow radiation. That, combined with the fact that most who post here have had a considerable return to normalcy post surgery, would make a good case for surgery as a solution. Good luck, friend, and, I agree, you have stumbled upon a really great bunch of guys who will be an invaluable resource. Best regards, DD",

      "Content": "Hey guys, Had my surgery on Tuesday night....Doc said that all went well, both nerve bundles spared, he took quite a few lymph nodes but had planned on doing that anyway due to my high PSA. There was no indication to him that any were positive, but we will see when I follow up with him in six weeks to review, check levels, and strategize treatment.. Surgery was not very traumatic. Last thing I remembered was telling the anesthesiologist that my hand was burning a little at the IV site. Next thing I knew I was in recovery, and feeling pretty close to normal, chatting with the nurses. Woke up on day One felt pretty well; got up and walked around the nurse's station for a good bit, went to a catheter care class, ate some solid food. My creatinine was high and they were a bit concerned about kidney function so kept me an extra day. Day 2 was not so great...big time gas cramps and bladder spasms, unbelievable pain and not even morphine can touch it. Spasms mixed with horrible, vivid dreams all night, and no sleep to speak of. Later on after I woke up, I finally passed gas for the first time and I farted so long and so hard that I almost forgot my birthday.....that helped tremendously with the gas pains AND the bladder spasms....they are now only maybe 10% of what they were and I just grit my teeth until they pass. They let me go go home afternoon of Day 2, with both a Foley catheter AND a wound drain catheter in place, and I tell you it is a lot to manage. I took a shower yesterday and it felt wonderful but the whole ordeal took more than an hour. It is quite difficult to try and keep everything clean and sterile, but so far I guess I am doing okay. I had to re-dress the drain site after the shower and didn't have a clue what I was doing and last night the drain stopped pulling suction in the middle of the night and the fluid from the wound site ran down my leg and I woke up wet with gut juice at 3 a.m. this morning and had to go in and try to patch it all up and keep it all clean. Pain in the ass! Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know I made it out the other side - a little worse for wear but still vertical. Will write more later, have to go empty my drain. Regards, DD",

      "Content": "Hey guys, Had my surgery on Tuesday night....Doc said that all went well, both nerve bundles spared, he took quite a few lymph nodes but had planned on doing that anyway due to my high PSA. There was no indication to him that any were positive, but we will see when I follow up with him in six weeks to review, check levels, and strategize treatment.. Surgery was not very traumatic. Last thing I remembered was telling the anesthesiologist that my hand was burning a little at the IV site. Next thing I knew I was in recovery, and feeling pretty close to normal, chatting with the nurses. Woke up on day One felt pretty well; got up and walked around the nurse's station for a good bit, went to a catheter care class, ate some solid food. My creatinine was high and they were a bit concerned about kidney function so kept me an extra day. Day 2 was not so great...big time gas cramps and bladder spasms, unbelievable pain and not even morphine can touch it. Spasms mixed with horrible, vivid dreams all night, and no sleep to speak of. Later on after I woke up, I finally passed gas for the first time and I farted so long and so hard that I almost forgot my birthday.....that helped tremendously with the gas pains AND the bladder spasms....they are now only maybe 10% of what they were and I just grit my teeth until they pass.

      "Content": "Remember the old thought exercise, Schrodinger's Cat, where a cat is place in a box with a radioactive substance, a Geiger counter, a hammer, and a vial of poison? The box was rigged so that the radioactive material, which had a 50/50 chance of emitting radiation in the course of one hour, if the substance DID emit radiation it would pe picked up by the geiger counter, which in turn was rigged to drop the hammer onto the glass vile of poison and kill the cat......but, simply by observing the sealed box, tha exact state of the cat could not be determined, and so for all practical purposes, the cat was both alive and dead at the same time, until someone actually opened the box and observed the system. I find that having PCa is a lot like being Schrodinger's Cat.People, with all of their good intentions, congratulate you on being cured, because, in the here and now, you have had the cancer removed, and your PSA is non- detectable....but what the Pca patient himself deals with is the spectre of a re-occurrence, and the plain reality that no one is really a cancer survivor until the day they die of something else. Where you wind up finding the most comfort is in knowing that whatever the ultimate outcome, you have improved your chance for a good prognosis by leaps and bounds in taking the actions you have taken.

I had a few complications myself during the surgery (bladder spasms; extra day for kidney function to return to normal, LOTS of gas...), PLUS I went home with that nasty JP drain hanging off my right side and the cath bag in a bucket in my left! For NINE days! It SUCKED LOL!! All behind me now though, Tuesday will be one month since surgery and I am getting around just fine on my own and seeing improvements in all aspects. Biggest surprise to me was stamina......once I got rid of the hardware I thought it would be back to normal but I actually get worn out a LOT quicker than I used to, although that is improving as well.

      "Content": "Hello, Gary, As a guy who had an elevated PSI, seven DRE's that were normal, T2 Sagittal and axial and T1 coronal MRI's that were normal, and a fourteen core biopsy that was normal, before finally being diagnosed during a fusion-guided biopsy of the SAME images the first radiologist said was \"perfectly normal\", I have become a little skeptical about doctors in general and have decided to play my own advocate, and I suggest you do the same. I would ask about a PCA-3 test; it is a DNA-based test that measures genetic markers specifically from prostate cancer cells. If that is suspicious, i would go for a fusion-guided biopsy...an MRI is done first which will identify areas of interest, then those areas will be targeted during the biopsy. I feel it is the most bang for your buck, and you always have the images on disk as a baseline in case something pops up later, like an increase in PSA. I think you are smart to be concerned and not dismissive........now is the time to satisfy yourself and be DAMN sure you are okay and satisfied with the answers they give you. Oh, and if at any time you detect a little Bravo Sierra, it's time for a second opinion.

      "Content": "Hi, Ron, I had my RALRP done in June of last year and they took 33 lymph nodes while they were in there. About 8 months later the lymphedema stated showing up, but I wasn't sure if that was the cause because I also take a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) for hypertension and it can do the same exact thing. Anyway, no matter the cause, I looked into treatment and basically it involves several weeks of wrapping the legs to get the fuid displaced followed by a management regimen including compression stockings, massage, etc. In my case, I just could not see wearing sweatpants to work for several weeks to go over the bandaging, and my swelling was also intermittent - far worse on some days than others - so I finally decided to not get the treatment for now...instead I am using compression stocking a few hours a day and they help a little bit but it's still pretty miserable some days. In all fairness, my physical therapist and several medical professionals that I know personally say the treatment really can work very well if you commit to it and give it a chance, and there are LOTS of women breast cancer patients who will agree. Do me a favor and let me know how it works out for you if you decide to do it. Good luck, DD T,",

I'm a big fan of the PSA test; it more than likely saved my bacon, and did the same for a lot of my friends here, too. What I am wondering about was, how, before the advent of the PSA screenings, did surgeons determine a biochemical reoccurrence without using PSA numbers as a reference? Hopefully they didn't have to wait unti there was enough tumor mass to x-ray? Anybody know? Thanks, and have a great day, DD",

      "Content": "The one thing I have learned from my journey is this: We all tend to want to compare our situation with another person's; especially when the circumstances are similar, and when their results are good and the outlook positive, and that's not a bad thing; it is human nature for us to try and provide ourselves with answers that are emotionally satisfying when our very lives or at the very least the quality of our lives, are on the table. Yes, you will see some guys what are evaluated at a 4+3, then on second opinion, downgraded to 3+3, but don't forget, it works the other way, too, and that 3+4 can turn out to be a 4+5. That being said, I think it is still the best course to err on the side of caution when deciding on a course of treatment. You can't count on the post-op pathology being consistent with what they find during a biopsy. I am no surgeon but the conventional wisdom dictates that, when (and if) necessary, radiation can follow surgery more effectively than surgery can follow radiation. That, combined with the fact that most who post here have had a considerable return to normalcy post surgery, would make a good case for surgery as a solution. Good luck, friend, and, I agree, you have stumbled upon a really great bunch of guys who will be an invaluable resource. Best regards, DD",

      "Content": "Hey guys, Had my surgery on Tuesday night....Doc said that all went well, both nerve bundles spared, he took quite a few lymph nodes but had planned on doing that anyway due to my high PSA. There was no indication to him that any were positive, but we will see when I follow up with him in six weeks to review, check levels, and strategize treatment.. Surgery was not very traumatic. Last thing I remembered was telling the anesthesiologist that my hand was burning a little at the IV site. Next thing I knew I was in recovery, and feeling pretty close to normal, chatting with the nurses. Woke up on day One felt pretty well; got up and walked around the nurse's station for a good bit, went to a catheter care class, ate some solid food. My creatinine was high and they were a bit concerned about kidney function so kept me an extra day. Day 2 was not so great...big time gas cramps and bladder spasms, unbelievable pain and not even morphine can touch it. Spasms mixed with horrible, vivid dreams all night, and no sleep to speak of. Later on after I woke up, I finally passed gas for the first time and I farted so long and so hard that I almost forgot my birthday.....that helped tremendously with the gas pains AND the bladder spasms....they are now only maybe 10% of what they were and I just grit my teeth until they pass. They let me go go home afternoon of Day 2, with both a Foley catheter AND a wound drain catheter in place, and I tell you it is a lot to manage. I took a shower yesterday and it felt wonderful but the whole ordeal took more than an hour. It is quite difficult to try and keep everything clean and sterile, but so far I guess I am doing okay. I had to re-dress the drain site after the shower and didn't have a clue what I was doing and last night the drain stopped pulling suction in the middle of the night and the fluid from the wound site ran down my leg and I woke up wet with gut juice at 3 a.m. this morning and had to go in and try to patch it all up and keep it all clean. Pain in the ass! Anyway, just wanted to let you guys know I made it out the other side - a little worse for wear but still vertical. Will write more later, have to go empty my drain. Regards, DD",

      "Content": "I understand that maybe it can't be that accurately measured, BUT, then again, there does seem to be these super-sensitive assays..........it occurs to me that, if your PSA was actually 0.0.......ABSOLUTE zero......your treatment would be over. I mean, if there were absolutely NO PSA in your body, wouldn't that make the chance of biochemical reoccurrence impossible? Doesn't PSA come from prostate cells? So if there is no PSA.......how could it ever increase? Where would more come from? So, all of these folks who have been told 0.0, but to come back in three months and have it checked again....why would you need it checked again if it was indeed 0.0? Was it ever REALLY 0.0? I for one think it is a little misleading to tell a patient his PSA Level is 0.0, when the reality is there IS a detectable reading but one that is considered clinically insignificant? Why stress people out like this? Regards, DD",

      "Content": "Hi Folks, I am at Day 9 post - RALRP and had my catheter and drain tube removed this afternoon. I won't go into that experience , but WOW...so nice to be able to move around!!!! Anyway, quick question about continence.... Having had the catheter in for nine days; I have been totally oblivious during that time of when I was actually passing urine. Now that the catheter is gone, should I expect the bladder to store urine and give me some sense of urgency as to when to go to the toilet? It's only been a few hours, but I have no sense of \"filling up\" and my pad is pretty wet....so I'm thinking it is slipping out without my actually being aware of it. When I do get up and stand over the toilet, I find I am only holding back a small squirt and I am empty. Is this normal for starting out? I know everyone is different, just looking for some feedback. Thanks and regards, DD",

      "Content": "Well, I went to bed at around 1100 and woke up with very unfamiliar abdominal cramps at around 0100. I got up and walked to the toilet and to my great surprise released what must have been a pint of urine, which relieved the cramp. I had a pad in and it was a little bit moist but far from being soaked, and everything else was dry. I did this same thing three more times during the night and so got through it this morning having only used one pad for the night. This gives me great hope. What I am taking away here so far is that all of the physical indicators are different; nothing feels like it did before. This urge to urinate doesn't feel anything like the OLD urge to urinate....new nerves, new muscles? Thanks for being there to share this with! DD",

I don't seem conscious of leaking beyond that, but I guess I am; fist pad is two hours old and already pretty wet. Did you cut back on your water consumption? When the cath was in I was using the overnight bag and had to set the alarm to get up and empty it at 0300 (it would be full) and again at 0730. If I move that much water tonight there will be some major damage going on....... Regards, DD P.S. - By the way, congratulations!!!",

      "Content": "Hi Folks, I am at Day 9 post - RALRP and had my catheter and drain tube removed this afternoon. I won't go into that experience , but WOW...so nice to be able to move around!!!! Anyway, quick question about continence.... Having had the catheter in for nine days; I have been totally oblivious during that time of when I was actually passing urine. Now that the catheter is gone, should I expect the bladder to store urine and give me some sense of urgency as to when to go to the toilet? It's only been a few hours, but I have no sense of \"filling up\" and my pad is pretty wet....so I'm thinking it is slipping out without my actually being aware of it. When I do get up and stand over the toilet, I find I am only holding back a small squirt and I am empty. Is this normal for starting out? I know everyone is different, just looking for some feedback. Thanks and regards, DD",

      "Content": "Well, I went to bed at around 1100 and woke up with very unfamiliar abdominal cramps at around 0100. I got up and walked to the toilet and to my great surprise released what must have been a pint of urine, which relieved the cramp. I had a pad in and it was a little bit moist but far from being soaked, and everything else was dry. I did this same thing three more times during the night and so got through it this morning having only used one pad for the night. This gives me great hope. What I am taking away here so far is that all of the physical indicators are different; nothing feels like it did before. This urge to urinate doesn't feel anything like the OLD urge to urinate....new nerves, new muscles? Thanks for being there to share this with! DD",

      "Content": "Hello, I had my RALRP on 9 June of this year, so I am pretty much five months out. My experience with continence post-surgery was comparatively good, I had pads ready at home but never really needed them; I just had the occasional drop or two (probably the same as I had BEFORE surgery, but wasn't so keenly aware or obsessive about it) and, on a few occasions, a bona fide squirt of very small volume. I immediately went to shields, just as a precaution, and at six weeks they were gone, too. So, overall, I have been very fortunate and it certainly was a blessing that I am thankful for.....I know that for most of us, the concern over a return to continence is foremost in our minds, even, in most cases ahead of sexual function. All that being said, I have never really had a return to a normal pattern. I still have days where I feel myself consciously clenching against some \"ghost\" urge, and occasionally the sensation that I have leaked, when in reality I have not. I can very honestly say that some days are a lot better than others....some days I am barely conscious of what's going on down there, and some days I am much too aware. It is also a mystery to me why function is SO different at night than during the day. I am getting up right at three times a night, roughly every 2 1/2 hrs, and completely emptying with a flow like a horse. During the day, I sometimes feel like there is a column of urine trapped in the urethra, and occasionally I get a stinging sensation at the end of the penis, which also mimics a leak....but it's not. Never is. My stream during the day is all over the place, sometimes as strong as it is at night, and other times a will have strong urgency and only deliver a small payload with a weak stream. Anyone else experience these sort of inconsistencies? Like I say, I hate to bitch, but you know how much misery loves company...... Thanks and regards, DD",

But I am not sure of this, I got it from Dr Google.. Yeah, I think the reason people argue about it so much is that the juice alone is not really strong enough to get the job done...this the reason for the pills. I guess it's like fish oil....you have to eat a tuna boat full of fish to get the same effect as a couple of those monster gel caps. Regards, DD",

But I am not sure of this, I got it from Dr Google.. Yeah, I think the reason people argue about it so much is that the juice alone is not really strong enough to get the job done...this the reason for the pills.

You may also want to speak to someone about a PCA3 test; it is a taken on a urine sample after a \"rigorous\" DRE - looks for genetic markers specifically from prostate cancer cells.

      "Content": "I had a prostate MRI done in February. The cost was $974. Oddly enough, the clinic had a \"cash price\" page which offered the same procedure for $625. When I asked why I was being charged so much more, I was told it was because \"I had insurance\". I said well, what if i just pay the cash price...the response? \"Then it won't count towards your deductible\". I'm not making this up. To make matters worse, the first doctor who read the study scored it to be clear of any indication of cancer or even abnormal cells. (PI RADS 1). A month later the doctor who read it at M.D. Anderson found \"areas of interest\" and ordered a fusion biopsy which they did two weeks ago. They found Gleason 3+4. Hard to know who or what to trust in this game, from my experience so far - I've had a clean biopsy AND clean MRI, and countless \"unremarkable\" DRE's before being diagnosed. I have a \"New Member\" type post with the whole sordid story LOL. Good luck, and best regards, DD",

You will even hear that Gleason 6 never evolves into a higher grade of cancer. So what's up, fellas? Fact is, and this trumps everything, you don't really KNOW what you have until they cut it out of you, and quite often (around 50% of the time) once they get in there, they upgrade your Gleason score because biopsies are misleading one way or the other about 40% of the time because they either miss the tumor OR miss the more SERIOUS tumor which might lay right next to that Gleason 6. All the more reason to have a doctor you trust like a brother. Hitch your star to that wagon and get rid of that shit if that's what he thinks is best for you...then don't look back.
