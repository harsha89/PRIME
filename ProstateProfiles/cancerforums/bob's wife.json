      "Content": "Hubby woke up from surgery with the sticky holder already attached. Hospital also sent him home with two extras just in case but the original one held on perfectly all week through daily showers. They also sent him home with a few Chux pads for the bed - the incision sites did bleed a bit especially the drain site that was removed just before he was discharged. The large drainage bag had a plastic clip attached to it with a doubled rubber band so that the clip could be easily repositioned anywhere along the length of the tube. We attached the clip to the side of the mattress - on the bottom sheet - to prevent the weight of the bag from pulling on the tubing. Most of the work during the week he had the catheter was in changing from the large bag to the leg bag every morning and cleaning everything thoroughly and then changing back at bedtime - a job which fell to me of course! If you can avoid that it would really make it easier. Hubby wanted the smaller bag on during the day - but then would want to lie down and rest a couple times each day and since he was wearing the sweat pants we bought in advance that made it a problematic since he needed the bag to hang below his body. I think pants that snap along the sides would work much better - or no pants at all! Since he had the catheter during Christmas week it was different. Our daughter was home staying with us for the holidays and we had Christmas dinner for the whole extended family at our home as well. So the bathrobe wasn't going to work for him because of the timing of surgery. Julie",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the replies Chuck and Djin! Chuck - I've edited my signature to remove all the extra \"leasons\" - that should help! All margins were negative thankfully. About the change in Gleason score - I mentioned the grade change from biopsy to surgical pathology to the nurse who was about to remove Bob's catheter since it was such a significant change. The nurse then announced that many 3+4 patients don't even opt for surgery but choose active surveillance instead. I knew that, having read so much about treatment options here, but was very surprised that a nurse would tell a patient who'd just had RP that, in essence, perhaps he hadn't needed to. I know Bob's decision would have been surgery if the biopsy had indicated either 3+4 (G4 was 30%) or 3+3 but the nurse didn't know that. Some patients might have been pretty upset to hear that during their catheter removal! Djin- We are very optimistic about the final path report but nervous as well about the first couple PSA tests... I forgot to mention that Bob didn't find out about Kegel exercises until two days before surgery when we attended a class at the hospital taught by a prostate cancer educator. I'd tried to explain the exercises to him in advance but he really didn't listen to me - until the nurse stressed their importance. By then he only had one day to practice! He is doing them now though. I found him videos on youtube that helped him get \"it\" as well. About the tumor's size - big prostate I think? I ran out of room to add to the signature from the final pathology report the size: Weight: 73 grams Size: 5 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm And I wanted to include the MRI report since there was certainly no room in the signature for that! PROCEDURE: MRI PROSTATE W WO CONTRAST W PET. HISTORY: Elevated PSA: 4.79 on 8/28/2018. Status post biopsy on 11/13/2018 with multifocal adenocarcinoma including Gleason 4+4 in the right base. TECHNIQUE: Multi-parametric 3.0 Tesla MRI was performed using a torso phased-array coil, including multiplanar T2-weighted images, axial T1-weighted images, axial diffusion-weighted images, and volumetric dynamic post-contrast images of the prostate. Axial in-and-opposed-phase gradient-echo T1-weighted images and pre- and post-contrast fat-suppressed gradient-echo T1-weighted images of the entire pelvis were also obtained using the \"Prostate with contrast\" protocol. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: Prostate size: 5.1 [CC] x 4.3 [AP] x 5.3 [transverse] cm for an overall volume of 60.4 cc. PSA density: 0.08 Membranous urethra length: 1.5 cm. There is diffuse intrinsic T1 hyperintensity throughout the peripheral zones and also scattered within the transitional zones, likely representing blood products from recent biopsy, significantly limiting evaluation. There is also a moderate amount of air within the rectum, which limits evaluation of the DWI/ADC sequences. Tumor localization: Lesion 1 PI-RADS assessment category: 4, High probability Appearance on T2-weighted images: 4, circumscribed, homogeneous moderate hypointense focus/mass confined to prostate and <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on diffusion-weighted images: 4, focal markedly hypointense on ADC and markedly hyperintense on high b value DWI; <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on dynamic post-contrast images: Positive - Focal enhancement directly corresponding to the suspicious finding with early or contemporaneous enhancement to normal prostate Size: 0.9 x 0.4 cm, series 15 image 15 (T2) Side: Right. Zone: Peripheral Level of prostate: Midgland Location within transverse plane: Posteromedial Extraprostatic extension: Abuts the prostatic capsule Lesion 2 PI-RADS assessment category: 4, High probability Appearance on T2-weighted images: 4, circumscribed, homogeneous moderate hypointense focus/mass confined to prostate and <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on diffusion-weighted images: 4, focal markedly hypointense on ADC and markedly hyperintense on high b value DWI; <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on dynamic post-contrast images: Positive - Focal enhancement directly corresponding to the suspicious finding with early or contemporaneous enhancement to normal prostate Size: 0.8 x 0.3 cm, series 15 image 14 (T2) Side: Right. Zone: Peripheral Level of prostate: Midgland Location within transverse plane: Posteromedial Extraprostatic extension: Abuts the prostatic capsule Lesion 3 PI-RADS assessment category: 3, Intermediate probability Appearance on T2-weighted images: 3, heterogeneous signal intensity or non-circumscribed, rounded, moderate hypointensity Appearance on diffusion-weighted images: 3, focal mildly/moderately hypointense on ADC and isointense/mildly hyperintense on high b value DWI Appearance on dynamic post-contrast images: Negative - No early enhancement Size: 0.7 x 0.3 cm, series 15 image 15 (T2) Side: Left. Zone: Peripheral Level of prostate: Midgland Location within transverse plane: Posteromedial Extraprostatic extension: Abuts the prostatic capsule Additional peripheral zone findings: Linear or wedge-areas of decreased signal on T2-weighted imaging with associated diffuse increased perfusion, suggestive of prostatitis. Additional transition zone findings: Enlarged and heterogeneous with circumscribed nodules consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Extraprostatic extension: None Seminal vesicle invasion: None. Lymph nodes: No pelvic lymphadenopathy. Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. Additional findings: The urinary bladder is decompressed. The MRI images of the concurrent PET/MRI study demonstrated no enlarged lymph nodes, suspicious osseous lesion, or areas of restricted diffusion. IMPRESSION: Diffuse intrinsic T1 hyperintensity throughout the prostate gland, likely represent blood products from recent biopsy, and significantly limits evaluation and air limiting the diffusion images. 0.9 x 0.4 cm right posteromedial midgland peripheral zone lesion, corresponding to an assessment category of PIRADS 4 - High (clinically significant cancer is likely to be present). 0.8 x 0.3 cm right posteromedial midgland peripheral zone lesion, corresponding to an assessment category of PIRADS 4 - High (clinically significant cancer is likely to be present). 0.7 x 0.3 cm left posteromedial midgland peripheral zone lesion, corresponding to an assessment category of PIRADS 3 - Intermediate (the presence of clinically significant cancer is equivocal). Findings compatible with prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

      "Content": "I found this forum a week or so ago and have read many hundreds of posts here since then. So much helpful information here and I am so grateful to all who have shared their experiences and expertise. Took me a few tries to get the signature short enough to \"fit\" so perhaps there is more editing I should do? After hubby's biopsy came back at 4+4 I was very worried the final pathology report would be worse - having seen many others post a change in Gleason after surgery when the biopsy needle didn't hit the worst areas. Also the repeated references to \"with intraductal component\" in the biopsy report led me to fear this was a reference to IDC-P which I'd read was rare and definitely not what you'd want to see in a pathology report. He had an MRI a few weeks later but I didn't have enough room in the signature section to post that info. Surgery was robotic 8 days ago on the 21st at Northwestern Memorial in Chicago. Then the wait for the path report.... I could see that some here had received their path reports within a few days so after six days had passed I couldn't take it anymore and messaged the dr's office through the portal to ask if the report was available yet and they posted it online later that day. I was really preparing myself to see a 5 in the final report so was quite shocked when the final path showed 3+4 acinar adenocarcinoma with no mention of any intraductal anything! Yesterday the nurse took the catheter out. No filling the bladder with saline and asking him to try to stop the stream first. I'd expected that to happen after reading about it here. Instead the nurse just withdrew the saline via syringe and slipped the tubing out. Hubby grimaced for a second during the procedure but that was it. I'd ordered a free sample kit of Tena pads in advance - as recommended by a member here. The nurse gave him a pull-up Depends to put on immediately and another to take home. I added the maximum Tena pad inside the Depends for the short car ride home. Unfortunately all the surgeon's office stocked was size XL and way too big for hubby. I was worried about leakage from the sides so dropped him at home and went to Walgreens for supplies. We had a few Chux pads for the bed ready - the hospital had sent us home with those. At Walgreens I bought a huge double pack of Depends Flex Fit and a 52 count size of their maximum pads. Then I ordered a washable bed pad and some jockey shorts with 5% spandex (another suggestion by a member here!) from Amazon. Yesterday afternoon after the catheter was removed hubby said he felt dry and didn't think he was leaking which seemed odd. He tried urinating and stopping his flow (as I told him some here had done in the dr's office just before the catheter was removed) and he said he was able to do that. At bedtime he changed into his new gear from Walgreens - a properly fitting Depends pull-up along with a Depends pad - and I made sure he was properly positioned on top of the Chux pad. Overnight he got up several times to urinate and had no leaking in-between. Today is the same so far - no leaking at all. I'm hoping this is a good harbinger for the future? Or is this possibly just a short-term situation? This is certainly not at all what we expected. Surgeon had said a return to continence would take up to a year - and would be a slow process requiring lots of patience. Said about a 5% chance it wouldn't return after that time and would require another procedure - an artificial sphincter I assume. Thanks to everyone for all your info and any feedback!",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for the replies Chuck and Djin! Chuck - I've edited my signature to remove all the extra \"leasons\" - that should help! All margins were negative thankfully. About the change in Gleason score - I mentioned the grade change from biopsy to surgical pathology to the nurse who was about to remove Bob's catheter since it was such a significant change. The nurse then announced that many 3+4 patients don't even opt for surgery but choose active surveillance instead. I knew that, having read so much about treatment options here, but was very surprised that a nurse would tell a patient who'd just had RP that, in essence, perhaps he hadn't needed to. I know Bob's decision would have been surgery if the biopsy had indicated either 3+4 (G4 was 30%) or 3+3 but the nurse didn't know that. Some patients might have been pretty upset to hear that during their catheter removal! Djin- We are very optimistic about the final path report but nervous as well about the first couple PSA tests... I forgot to mention that Bob didn't find out about Kegel exercises until two days before surgery when we attended a class at the hospital taught by a prostate cancer educator. I'd tried to explain the exercises to him in advance but he really didn't listen to me - until the nurse stressed their importance. By then he only had one day to practice! He is doing them now though. I found him videos on youtube that helped him get \"it\" as well. About the tumor's size - big prostate I think? I ran out of room to add to the signature from the final pathology report the size: Weight: 73 grams Size: 5 x 4.7 x 4.5 cm And I wanted to include the MRI report since there was certainly no room in the signature for that! PROCEDURE: MRI PROSTATE W WO CONTRAST W PET. HISTORY: Elevated PSA: 4.79 on 8/28/2018. Status post biopsy on 11/13/2018 with multifocal adenocarcinoma including Gleason 4+4 in the right base. TECHNIQUE: Multi-parametric 3.0 Tesla MRI was performed using a torso phased-array coil, including multiplanar T2-weighted images, axial T1-weighted images, axial diffusion-weighted images, and volumetric dynamic post-contrast images of the prostate. Axial in-and-opposed-phase gradient-echo T1-weighted images and pre- and post-contrast fat-suppressed gradient-echo T1-weighted images of the entire pelvis were also obtained using the \"Prostate with contrast\" protocol. COMPARISON: None available. FINDINGS: Prostate size: 5.1 [CC] x 4.3 [AP] x 5.3 [transverse] cm for an overall volume of 60.4 cc. PSA density: 0.08 Membranous urethra length: 1.5 cm. There is diffuse intrinsic T1 hyperintensity throughout the peripheral zones and also scattered within the transitional zones, likely representing blood products from recent biopsy, significantly limiting evaluation. There is also a moderate amount of air within the rectum, which limits evaluation of the DWI/ADC sequences. Tumor localization: Lesion 1 PI-RADS assessment category: 4, High probability Appearance on T2-weighted images: 4, circumscribed, homogeneous moderate hypointense focus/mass confined to prostate and <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on diffusion-weighted images: 4, focal markedly hypointense on ADC and markedly hyperintense on high b value DWI; <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on dynamic post-contrast images: Positive - Focal enhancement directly corresponding to the suspicious finding with early or contemporaneous enhancement to normal prostate Size: 0.9 x 0.4 cm, series 15 image 15 (T2) Side: Right. Zone: Peripheral Level of prostate: Midgland Location within transverse plane: Posteromedial Extraprostatic extension: Abuts the prostatic capsule Lesion 2 PI-RADS assessment category: 4, High probability Appearance on T2-weighted images: 4, circumscribed, homogeneous moderate hypointense focus/mass confined to prostate and <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on diffusion-weighted images: 4, focal markedly hypointense on ADC and markedly hyperintense on high b value DWI; <1.5 cm in greatest dimension Appearance on dynamic post-contrast images: Positive - Focal enhancement directly corresponding to the suspicious finding with early or contemporaneous enhancement to normal prostate Size: 0.8 x 0.3 cm, series 15 image 14 (T2) Side: Right. Zone: Peripheral Level of prostate: Midgland Location within transverse plane: Posteromedial Extraprostatic extension: Abuts the prostatic capsule Lesion 3 PI-RADS assessment category: 3, Intermediate probability Appearance on T2-weighted images: 3, heterogeneous signal intensity or non-circumscribed, rounded, moderate hypointensity Appearance on diffusion-weighted images: 3, focal mildly/moderately hypointense on ADC and isointense/mildly hyperintense on high b value DWI Appearance on dynamic post-contrast images: Negative - No early enhancement Size: 0.7 x 0.3 cm, series 15 image 15 (T2) Side: Left. Zone: Peripheral Level of prostate: Midgland Location within transverse plane: Posteromedial Extraprostatic extension: Abuts the prostatic capsule Additional peripheral zone findings: Linear or wedge-areas of decreased signal on T2-weighted imaging with associated diffuse increased perfusion, suggestive of prostatitis. Additional transition zone findings: Enlarged and heterogeneous with circumscribed nodules consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Extraprostatic extension: None Seminal vesicle invasion: None. Lymph nodes: No pelvic lymphadenopathy. Osseous structures: No aggressive osseous lesion. Additional findings: The urinary bladder is decompressed. The MRI images of the concurrent PET/MRI study demonstrated no enlarged lymph nodes, suspicious osseous lesion, or areas of restricted diffusion. IMPRESSION: Diffuse intrinsic T1 hyperintensity throughout the prostate gland, likely represent blood products from recent biopsy, and significantly limits evaluation and air limiting the diffusion images. 0.9 x 0.4 cm right posteromedial midgland peripheral zone lesion, corresponding to an assessment category of PIRADS 4 - High (clinically significant cancer is likely to be present). 0.8 x 0.3 cm right posteromedial midgland peripheral zone lesion, corresponding to an assessment category of PIRADS 4 - High (clinically significant cancer is likely to be present). 0.7 x 0.3 cm left posteromedial midgland peripheral zone lesion, corresponding to an assessment category of PIRADS 3 - Intermediate (the presence of clinically significant cancer is equivocal). Findings compatible with prostatitis and benign prostatic hyperplasia.",

Even a zero PSA reading will show some micro-fluxuations if it went to 3 digits, which is meaningless. So the 2-digit PSA reading is fine. Not a bad idea to test again in 3 months for peace of mind.

Even a zero PSA reading will show some micro-fluxuations if it went to 3 digits, which is meaningless. So the 2-digit PSA reading is fine. Not a bad idea to test again in 3 months for peace of mind.
