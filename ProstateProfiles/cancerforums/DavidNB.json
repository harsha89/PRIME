      "Content": "At risk of appearing somewhat churlish, I would prefer to have scientific research presented by a scientist than \"Barbara is a school psychologist, a published author in the area of personal finance, a breast cancer survivor using \"alternative\" treatments, a born existentialist, and a student of nature and all things natural.\" writing for a publication that appears to advertise a lot of stuff that some might think a bit cranky. One of my closet friends is a breast cancer survivor who is a convinced astrologist and is also concerned about diet and stuff, but I rather think she would be dead had she had not had surgery and tamoxifen as primary treatment. The fact that she is a survivor gives her no authority on medical issues. It does look as if a reputable research centre has found that some chemicals can be active against cancer cells in the test tube and in mice, but that is a long way from saying anything about any potential results (or side effects) in human cases. You might look at http://www.cancer.org/treatment/trea...erals/capsicum, which looks to me to be rather unencouraging. David",

      "Content": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20795977 An experimental \"Trojan-horse\" cancer therapy has completely eliminated prostate cancer in experiments on mice, according to UK researchers. The team hid cancer killing viruses inside the immune system in order to sneak them into a tumour. Once inside, a study in the journal Cancer Research showed, tens of thousands of viruses were released to kill the cancerous cells. Experts labelled the study \"exciting,\" but human tests are still needed. As it says, human tests still needed, and I didn't see anything other than a hint that it could be used for other cancers, and the treatment still envisions chemo/radiation first, but will hopefully make them more effective. I suppose that it is unlikely that there will ever be a single magic bullet to kill cancer, but, in a different context, the story of this year's Tour de France shows that a number of small improvements working together can make a big difference in total. Perhaps this report gives hope that this will be more than a small improvement. David",
