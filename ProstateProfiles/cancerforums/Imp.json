      "Content": "Hello, another new guy here. 47 YO Been having regular PSA tests for several years as my father had PCa. Gradually increasing 2,9 to 4,8 over 7 years. Also had several biopsies. Last Biop 12 months ago showed Gleason 3+3 in 2 places, very small lesions., previous had just shown Atypical cells. Consultant recommended to continue AS with regular MRI to check if the profile changes. 1st MRI was good 6 months ago but last week had 2nd MRI and was informed that one of the lesions seems to have changed shape. It's still small but if it's changed its probably not 3+3. In the NY I'll have another template guided biopsy to see if it's changed to a more aggressive level than previous 3+3. I'm guessing it has. That will mean it's time for an intervention. Either RP DaVinci surgery or HIFU. The place I'm going in London has specialists who do both. The literature on the web around HIFU is mixed. Some very positive & some sceptical. If it's a more significant biopsy upgrade, either in number of cores & lesions or in the aggressiveness, RP will be the way to go but Assuming the biopsy is an upgrade of the 1 of the lesions I know about & the other cores are Ok, Focal HIFU sounds attractive as it's less invasive & I guess I could then opt for RP later if needed. Any thoughts are more than welcome. Meanwhile I'll read up as much as I can & read the Surviving Prostate Cancel book which seems strongly in favour of early RP",

      "Content": "Thanks Highlander for the clarification, in a way that's reassuring but until after the biop it could be several different things - It may be another tumour of the same grade or a more aggressive one that wasn't picked up before. Or I guess the original 3+3 that spread bigger. The 2 they found last time that were both very small. I'm doing a very \"active\" surveillance so I can take the right decision when the treatment is needed. If I get a 4+3 or several 3+3 it will be time to do something.",

      "Content": "So folks,I got my biop results today with the MRI scan details 2mm 0,22cc lesion GL 3+4 on left side. 1mm 0,2cc GL3+3. This was the result of a targeted template guided biopsy following a 3T MRI. Prostate volume is 32cc. PSA is 5 increased from 4, 12 months ago. With these results I feel it's time to act after 3 years AS. The 3+3 on the right is unchanged after 12 months from the previous MRI & biopsy but the left one is larger & upgraded from 3+3 to 3+4 My choice will be focal HIFU which will ablate about 25% of the prostate all on the left. I will leave the right side. After this I will continue active surveillance. The risk of side effects is very low & the recovery time is fast, hopefully 1 week. I hope to not need further intervention, of course this is unknown, but if I do have further developments I will then go directly for RALP to remove the whole thing. The HIFU operation will be in mid February. I know that this isn't a cure & I appreciate we don't have long term efficacy on this focal treatment yet, certainly not beyond 5 years. Time will literally tell on that. In my place, many people may not be comfortable with this choice but I am choosing to significantly lower my risk of quality of life impact over the next 5-10 years whilst accepting I haven't eliminated prostate cancer which may need stronger action in the future. I'm 47, if I were 10 years older I would probably go directly to Davinci & perhaps I will need to do that in the coming years. I'll be diligent in the surveillance & if something changes I will quickly act accordingly. Before the Biop results I set this \"rule\" for myself. 2x small 3+3 continue AS Single 3+4 index HIFU focal Multiple 3+3, 3+4 or 4+3 RALP My father suffers badly from no2 on the trifecta after surgery & salvage (he's 82 so no3 isn't important) his treatment was 15 years ago. Detection & intervention have improved massively since then & I believe in 10 years time they will be immeasurably better still. His father struck out on all 3, 40 years ago. 1 week after the treatment I'll have another MRI scan repeated 6 months after that. Feel free to comment.",

      "Content": "My urologist says a 2nd HIFU or a DaVinci are both valid options if further intervention is needed down the line. The HIFU 5 years success rate is 80%. I.e 20% need a follow up treatment, which is a high number - so let's assume I'm in the 20% not the 80%. If careful monitoring shows something in the 75% of my prostate still there, I could ablate the rest of it or do surgery to remove it, so I'm back to square 1 but I don't think I'm worse off, just 5 years older. 5 years where I can do my job & earn enough to retire relatively comfortably with or without any side effects. I don't know if this statement makes sense, \"the full recovery chance is higher if I'm 47, but on the other hand the quality of life risk effect is also higher the younger you are\" ?? I guess not many have gone this way as its new (especially in the US where it was only approved at the end of 2015) & insurance companies wouldn't pay. In many countries the urologists, radiologists and surgeons are selling their services & so they recommend their product rather than an alternative one. Am I 100% sure? No. You just have to gather all the data you can & take an informed, calculated risk considering the best case & worst case scenarios, age, personal priorities and if you can live with the idea of any cancer hiding inside you even if it's very small & slow to change. RP sounds like a very valid & smart choice to me, but trying HIFU in case I'm in the 80% doesn't sound like a stupid step.",
