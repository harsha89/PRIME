The Dr gave me a foam clamp to wear during radiation, so I can keep something in my bladder to protect it. I am planning to start PT for kegels soon. Since I've already had a RP, is there anything that I can do to protect my colon and rectum? What should I be looking for during the process? I'm planning on having radiation and go back to work.",

      "Content": "New here, brief history, had TURP last year, diagnosed w/ Gleason 6, biopsy 8 months later, Gleason 9. Had robotic prostatectomy, (May 30, 2017) w/ cancer in marginal walls and seminal vesicles. Started Lupron about 2 weeks ago and trying to get financial help w/ Zitiga and will start radiation mid to late August, so I'm all healed up from the surgery. I had bone scan prior to surgery and all clear. Had 34 lymph nodes removed and tested during prostatectomy and all were clear. PSA 4 weeks after surgery was 0.04. My question is, is the Lupron and Zitiga along w/ radiation aggressive enough for longevity? Does anyone know of stem cell treatments and what hospitals do that? My plan is to keep active and enjoy life and I am staying positive and plan to beat this. Thanks,",

      "Content": "New here, brief history, had TURP last year, diagnosed w/ Gleason 6, biopsy 8 months later, Gleason 9. Had robotic prostatectomy, (May 30, 2017) w/ cancer in marginal walls and seminal vesicles. Started Lupron about 2 weeks ago and trying to get financial help w/ Zitiga and will start radiation mid to late August, so I'm all healed up from the surgery. I had bone scan prior to surgery and all clear. Had 34 lymph nodes removed and tested during prostatectomy and all were clear. PSA 4 weeks after surgery was 0.04. My question is, is the Lupron and Zitiga along w/ radiation aggressive enough for longevity? Does anyone know of stem cell treatments and what hospitals do that? My plan is to keep active and enjoy life and I am staying positive and plan to beat this. Thanks,",

I do not feel that my diet change has resulted in a lower score, since I've only been on it for a couple of weeks. I also plan to stay on a healthier diet.

There are some supplements that can have a reverse effect and diminish the effectiveness of the therapy. Anti-oxidation and I believe it is called radical absorption is not what you want during radiation. My RO told me the best way to sensitize the cancer cells was to exercise. Lift weights, fast walking, etc. FWIW. Best, MM Thanks MM, I start the radiation probably around late August. I'm guessing it's ok to keep w/ the diet until then? I am starting to walk some. I have a weight bench too, and maybe if I strengthen up my legs, maybe the incontinence will get better too. I walked a mile last night, came home, leaned over and dribbled about 3 times....",

Drinking Pomegranate juice is an easy step to take as it could be substituted for your morning orange juice or coffee and it won't hurt but may help. I prefer to juice whole fruit in a vitamix rather than buying juice in a bottle because I'm sure some of the nutrition is lost in the processing and bottling process. Below is an excerpt from the study ... \"The most striking evidence for the biological activity of pomegranate extracts was demonstrated in prostate cancer cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that pomegranate extracts are capable of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while also inducing apoptosis.\" If you want to read the full article, the link is below ... https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/701434/ Tim Good read, thanks, I'm taking real pomegranate, broccoli, green tea and turmeric each day. Plus some kale, mixed berries (raspberry, black berry, blueberry) but will probably have to stop some of it at time of radiation, so I get full benefit of the radiation.

I was put on waiting list for the on site living, but haven't heard back from them. According to Dr in Albany, he has latest technology and does a CT scan prior to each radiation and the radiation machine overlays the CT scan. According to him, Emory has just gotten this type of machine or getting it. Albany Dr said he was first place in GA to get one. He seems like a good guy and I like him, but like someone said, this is a one time shot and I want it done right. Dr Jani wanted me to be in a trial w/ PET scan and all of that, but I was in a PET scan trial prior to surgery and I'm wondering if they looked at it. If they had seen cancer was in margins or just barely outside margins, shouldn't they have done radiation first? Or treated first in a different way? Dr Rossi from Emory gave me the green light to proceed w/ Dr in Albany and said that he would give just as good treatments as they would. Dang, this is touch decisions.",

Head guy at Emory says that the guy in Albany will be fine and he supports that. Just got a call from a friend, whose dad got burnt bad by guy in Albany, (15 years ago). My friend's dad has a bladder bag, and he salvaged his colon w/ being cauterized a few times. The Dr in Albany does have a new machine. I'm guessing that there is always a chance of damage during radiation. Albany is 30 minutes away and Emory is 3 hours. I feel Dr in Albany does care, and I feel like a number at Emory.

Drinking Pomegranate juice is an easy step to take as it could be substituted for your morning orange juice or coffee and it won't hurt but may help. I prefer to juice whole fruit in a vitamix rather than buying juice in a bottle because I'm sure some of the nutrition is lost in the processing and bottling process. Below is an excerpt from the study ... \"The most striking evidence for the biological activity of pomegranate extracts was demonstrated in prostate cancer cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have shown that pomegranate extracts are capable of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while also inducing apoptosis.\" If you want to read the full article, the link is below ... https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2013/701434/ Tim Good read, thanks, I'm taking real pomegranate, broccoli, green tea and turmeric each day. Plus some kale, mixed berries (raspberry, black berry, blueberry) but will probably have to stop some of it at time of radiation, so I get full benefit of the radiation. Good luck on your upcoming surgery!",

There are some supplements that can have a reverse effect and diminish the effectiveness of the therapy. Anti-oxidation and I believe it is called radical absorption is not what you want during radiation. My RO told me the best way to sensitize the cancer cells was to exercise. Lift weights, fast walking, etc. FWIW. Best, MM Thanks MM, I start the radiation probably around late August. I'm guessing it's ok to keep w/ the diet until then? I am starting to walk some. I have a weight bench too, and maybe if I strengthen up my legs, maybe the incontinence will get better too. I walked a mile last night, came home, leaned over and dribbled about 3 times....",

I'm wondering if my PSA is 0, if I should keep taking Zytiga and Prednisone or wait for the bandit to show back up? I have an appointment w/ a Nurse case manager on Monday and plan to ask a few questions. I'm planning on living another 20 years, but I'm worried about the side effects of prednisone.",

Dr Al has good pedigree and was in surgery w/ me for over 6 hours. I am going back to Emory next month for a colonoscopy, as I feel that I get better service there than in S. GA.

      "Content": "Hey guys, I recently got turned down for Zytiga, and this time while getting Lupron shot, the Dr said to take casodex w/ it until end of July when Lupron wears off. That will be my 2 years on Lupron, one of those years I was on Zytiga. My PSA today was .06, which is as low at Phoebe in Albany can do, I think. I went to the Winship Center at Emory a few weeks ago, and the oncologist there said that we were going over and beyond the standard protocol. He made me optimistic in the fact that it may be cured, probably 50%. Anyhow, what do you guys think of the casodex w/ Lupron? Also, getting a colonoscopy April 16th, and I have an AUS800, radiation, etc.., Should I be worried about the colonoscopy? I 'm having it done at Emory.",
