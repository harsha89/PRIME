      "Content": "My partner was diagnosed with prostate cancer April 2012 with a gleason score of 9 of all 12 cores taken each one had over 90% cancer. Our first staging was t2 no mo but because of his age 44yrs the cancer was particularly aggressive and a radical robotic prostatectomy was the only possible curative measure. All scans were clear at the time but we had to wait 2weeks for the results to come back. Great we thought its all contained in the capsule, giving what we thought was a good chance of a complete cure. We then waited 4 mths until the surgery was carried out. We had a holiday booked and were told to go ahead as everything would be ok, this was in june. On return we saw the surgeon who put him on hormone therapy for a further 6 weeks, which we understand to be standard before surgery. He went to surgery on the 13th August. Post op pathology results 6 weeks later we discovered it had spread to the seminal vesicles, neck of the bladder and 3/7 lymph nodes were positive. Staging now read t3b n1 mo and were asked if he had a will and life insurance policies. At this point we were stunned and they put him on hormone therapy again. Distressed by this information we saw another consultant at our request and were then told there is every chance of a cure, we were delighted with this and everything was great, only to be told this week that the cancer had infact spread further up the abdominal lymph nodes and might not be curable, and that the hormone tablets he's on were not strong enough to stop any growth but he was not prescribed anything stronger. It really has been a total rollercoaster of emotions for all of us. My concern was why didn't they operate sooner, knowing his cancer was very aggressive, and they were going to throw all treatments at him. its been over 8 weeks since the op, and his PSA post op was 0.1. We feel not enough was done in the timescales for this type of cancer, and the information has been very vague to say the least. Having looked at the NHS waiting times, from refferal from the gp which was October 2011, to the biopsy March 2012, diagnoses April 2012, operation August 2012 all these proceedures should have been carried out within 3-4 months from start to finish. We are now faced with more uncertainty and we are still being told that they are going to throw all treatments at him, which clearly isn't the case. We now face a 4 week wait for a full body scan to see if it has spread even further. If any body reads this and has a similar story I would love to hear from you.",

      "Content": "Hi and yes I'm from the UK. My partner is 44yrs and there is a family history of Prostate Cancer, which he told his GP. His first PSA was 5.9 very high for his age. He had symptoms for a short while and I mentioned to him that a friend of mines father had prostate cancer and had the same symptoms. He was struggling to pee properly and had a burning sensation when doing so. His cancer is very aggressive and I feel this was overlooked. We thought the op would be performed in 4-6 weeks after diagnoses, unfortunately we were wrong and now the prognoses is not looking good. Its a frustrating experience and I do feel everything was done to late. Thank you for you response and I hope you continue in good health.",
