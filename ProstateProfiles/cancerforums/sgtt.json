      "Content": "This is what the sheet I recv'd from the Mayo (Rochester, MN) after surgery says. The following exercise may help you regain bladder control if you are leaking urine. Urinary leakage is often due to weak muscles. This sometimes occurs following prostate surgery. Exercise can improve muscle condition and tone, allowing you greater control over you bladder. You will exercise two groups of muscles: 1. The muscles that stop a bowel movement - This is the group of muscles you tighten when you suddenly want to stop a bowel movement or hold back gas in the rectum. 2. The muscles at the base of the penis - This is the group of muscles you use to expel the final drops of urine at the end of urination or to ejaculate semen. Perform the exercise according to the following directions: 1. Tighten the muscles you use to stop a bowel movement. 2. Then, while tightening these muscles, tighten muscles at the base of the penis (you may feel your penis pull in slightly toward your body). 3. Hold both sets of muscles as tight as possible for a count of \"10\". 4 Relax muscles and rest for one minute. 5 Repeat exercise six times. General Information - Perform this exercise before going to bed. This allows your muscles to rest while you sleep. - Perform this exercise once each day. If you overexercise, your muscles may become tired, and you may experience more leakage. - It is recommended that you do this exercise while sitting on a toilet seat. - Holding these muscles tight while rising from a sitting position or while lifting can help prevent urinary leakage. One you achieve urinary control, continue to perform this exercise to keep you muscles in good condition.",
