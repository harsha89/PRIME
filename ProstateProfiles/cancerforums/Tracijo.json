      "Content": "Dear Mike, I just happened across this P C link tonight. I read your story/history and my heart sank. My husband had PC and he was treated a year ago March by the Dattoli Cancer Foundation. Before treatment his PSA was 7, his Gleason score was 7. Today he is cancer free, his last PSA was under one at his six month check up. Dr. Michael Dattoli has the highest P C success rate than anyone in the World. You are welcome to call and speak with my husband if you would like? Dr. Dattoli doesn't believe in removing the prostate because the cancer is seeded via fingers of cancer growth that cannot be seen. His treatment is ten years ahead of any cancer center in he USA and elsewhere. Please call and set up a free consultation with the Dattoli Cancer Foundation before making any decisions for treatment. I thank God every day that we found Dr. Dattoli when we did. We were scheduled for the DaVinci surgery and cancelled it after speaking with the Dattoli center. They have many YouTube videos you can watch immediately. They also have a website that is quite informative. There is so much misinformation out there on PC it is frightening. The decision of where you go for treatment will make the difference if you will suffer with incontinence for the rest of your life, as well as if you will be sexually active after treatment. Please educate yourself before choosing your treatment center. Don't simply read others blogs and assume they are good choices. I wish you the best and my prayers are with you and your family. Kind regards, Tracijo",
