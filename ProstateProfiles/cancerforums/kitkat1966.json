      "Content": "Hi everyone! It's been a while. . . . . Hubby did uPSA last week and result came back <.006 (signature is updated). We see his PCP tomorrow. She ordered the uPSA test, because his urologist / surgeon told us \"he didn't know how to\". So, I used the test # for labcorp I got her, and talked to our PCP -- She thought he needed the uPSA test, and voila! We see the urologist / surgeon on Tuesday morning. Will be asking the urologist if any other screening tests for biochemical recurrence is needed given the following: PSA prior to RP .8 (that's point Pathology Gleason is 8 EPE is present. I'm wondering since his cancer didn't throw off a high PSA prior to RP if the uPSA test is enough to detect biochemical recurrence, or if we should incorporate some scans into the surveillance. Urologist has not recommended any RT at this time -- we saw him in late Oct (7 weeks post RALP). We'll see what he says on Tuesday. Will also see if he'll write a script for PT for Kegels. Hubby is pretty much continent -- wears 1 pad during the day and 1 at night, mostly for security. Sometimes he forgets and is fine. He's also not doing Kegels with any regularity. Also wondering if he will let him lift more than 10 lbs now! Thanks for any insight. You folks are the absolute best!",

      "Content": "I always strongly suggest that you request copies of each original lab report result. This will list the exact uPSA Methodology used and where the uPSA was analyzed. This is important because you always want The Same Lab Using The Same uPSA Methodology each time in order to compare results. Blood labs periodically change vendors and you will never know it. Also, by getting a copy of the original lab report the is \"0\" chance of error from transcribing the result or reading the result over the phone. Hi Michael: thank you for your quick response! As always great info. I have called the doctor's office to request the switch to uPSA -- am awaiting a call back . . .will also chase down LabCorp number -- they typically dump me into voicemail and then I get a call back the next day . . .but I'll try there too. In regards to the Original Lab report -- who would I get that from ? The Doctor's office, or LabCorp? (our benefits plan has us using LabCorp -- which I see you use too!)",

Having a jump on biochemical recurrence earlier gives you more time to either think treatment options over or to go ahead and jump-start SRT. (If you can't manage to change this first post-surgery PSA changed to uPSA it's not a major deal. My uro/surgeon did a regular first test; I'm going to discuss uPSA with him at my first post-surgery visit). Thanks for all of your posts on this topic .. it's very timely for me and hubby! I did call the doc yesterday to check on PSA vs. uPSA and the doc got back to me saying PSA test is \"fine\" -- so that's what we got this morning. I'll bring it up with him on Tuesday, and we should be able to see the results on labcorp's site on Monday -- if all works the way it should!!",

      "Content": "I always strongly suggest that you request copies of each original lab report result. This will list the exact uPSA Methodology used and where the uPSA was analyzed. This is important because you always want The Same Lab Using The Same uPSA Methodology each time in order to compare results. Blood labs periodically change vendors and you will never know it. Also, by getting a copy of the original lab report the is \"0\" chance of error from transcribing the result or reading the result over the phone. Hi Michael: thank you for your quick response! As always great info. I have called the doctor's office to request the switch to uPSA -- am awaiting a call back . . .will also chase down LabCorp number -- they typically dump me into voicemail and then I get a call back the next day . . .but I'll try there too. In regards to the Original Lab report -- who would I get that from ? The Doctor's office, or LabCorp? (our benefits plan has us using LabCorp -- which I see you use too!)",

Your insight on the nerves is very helpful -- and will be able to ask a surgeon more about that -- any other questions we should ask are welcome regarding the peri neural piece. Are you willing to share what surgeon you used at Hopkins?

      "Content": "Hi everyone: My DH was diagnosed in May with Prostate Cancer -- I've put info from biopsy and PSA in my signature -- if I've missed something, let me know. Bone Scan was recommended by a radiologist but not surgeons -- so it hasn't been done yet. He's had chronic prostatitis since 2013 -- with numerous doses of antibiotics, and low PSA; so cancer was not suspected until Urologist felt a firmness during DRE. We tried to get an MRI to diagnose, but insurance wouldn't approve until biopsy was completed. Given chronic prostatitis, prostate was already enflamed and we wanted to try another diagnostic tool so as not to further enflame the prostate. So, we did finally get get the biopsy and it comes back PC. Gleason info in signature. Urologist is a surgeon so he gave us the news of PC and walked us through the surgery option. Suggested we also talk to a radiologist. Also told us that 20% of PC manifests with LOW PSA numbers like DH. Appt at Fox Chase Cancer Center (suburban Philly) with both surgeon and radiologist. Radiologist has ruled out CyberKnife and other high dose / short duration radiation due to the prostate already being enflamed. He suggests Hormone Therapy shot and then 2 months later start IMRT for 40 doses (8 weeks). Also informs us the PC is perineural (sitting on and around a nerve) Appointment with Surgeon was cut short -- so we are going back next week armed with a lot of questions -- specifically how nerve sparing DaVinci surgery can be if the cancer is perineural In the meantime, we also visited a Radiologist at Atlantic Health in NJ -- he ruled out all forms of radiation due to his very low PSA -- Doc was concerned that post treatment, docs wouldn't be able to follow up on PC to see if it has returned. He felt removing the prostate and getting PSA to 0 and then on-going PSA's would let us know if it has returned. DH's highest PSA was 1.4 and has dropped from there. So, DH is leaning toward RALP, but is very apprehensive due to side effects, and what he thinks is his life expectancy. His parents both died in their 60's and he feels it will be a miracle if he lives to 70. We've only been married 6 years - first marriage for both of us. I'm the one doing the detailed research and talking to doctors, schedulers, etc. Looking to schedule surgery in late August / September. We're contemplating doing a visit to Johns Hopkins to see what they have to say as well. Could also go Penn in Philly. I've looked through a bunch of your threads (which are wonderfully informative!!!) and don't see much commentary on Fox Chase and their surgery docs (pro or con). Surgeons at Penn and Johns Hopkins I've seen very nice / complementary reviews of. So here are a couple questions: 1) Have any of you had PC that was peri neural and had the DaVinci / robotic surgery? Was it able to save the nerve? and do you have ED now? or how long did it take to recover? 2) Given chronic prostatitis -- all docs but original urologist have said chronic prostatitis would go away once the prostate is removed. Original urologist (who was treating him since 2013) wouldn't guarantee it. Any comments on that? 3) Also since he has chronic prostatitis, would radiation, while getting rid of cancer, prolong the prostatitis or make it worse -- Docs wouldn't comment on that question . . .looking for any of you that were in similar situation and chose radiation . . how did you make out? 4) Has anyone done proton beam therapy? How has it worked out for you? Many thanks in advance for any and all responses and for reading this far!! I\"m very grateful for all of the great info I've read on this forum -- so many many thanks!",

      "Content": "Hi everyone: My DH was diagnosed in May with Prostate Cancer -- I've put info from biopsy and PSA in my signature -- if I've missed something, let me know. Bone Scan was recommended by a radiologist but not surgeons -- so it hasn't been done yet. He's had chronic prostatitis since 2013 -- with numerous doses of antibiotics, and low PSA; so cancer was not suspected until Urologist felt a firmness during DRE. We tried to get an MRI to diagnose, but insurance wouldn't approve until biopsy was completed. Given chronic prostatitis, prostate was already enflamed and we wanted to try another diagnostic tool so as not to further enflame the prostate. So, we did finally get get the biopsy and it comes back PC. Gleason info in signature. Urologist is a surgeon so he gave us the news of PC and walked us through the surgery option. Suggested we also talk to a radiologist. Also told us that 20% of PC manifests with LOW PSA numbers like DH. Appt at Fox Chase Cancer Center (suburban Philly) with both surgeon and radiologist. Radiologist has ruled out CyberKnife and other high dose / short duration radiation due to the prostate already being enflamed. He suggests Hormone Therapy shot and then 2 months later start IMRT for 40 doses (8 weeks). Also informs us the PC is perineural (sitting on and around a nerve) Appointment with Surgeon was cut short -- so we are going back next week armed with a lot of questions -- specifically how nerve sparing DaVinci surgery can be if the cancer is perineural In the meantime, we also visited a Radiologist at Atlantic Health in NJ -- he ruled out all forms of radiation due to his very low PSA -- Doc was concerned that post treatment, docs wouldn't be able to follow up on PC to see if it has returned. He felt removing the prostate and getting PSA to 0 and then on-going PSA's would let us know if it has returned. DH's highest PSA was 1.4 and has dropped from there. So, DH is leaning toward RALP, but is very apprehensive due to side effects, and what he thinks is his life expectancy. His parents both died in their 60's and he feels it will be a miracle if he lives to 70. We've only been married 6 years - first marriage for both of us.

      "Content": "Ron: Thanks so much for your reply. To answer your questions: A firmness was found during a DRE on the left side of the prostate which prompted the biopsy. It has come back as prostatic adenocarcinoma. Your insight on the nerves is very helpful -- and will be able to ask a surgeon more about that -- any other questions we should ask are welcome regarding the peri neural piece. Are you willing to share what surgeon you used at Hopkins? I'm in the beginning phone calls -- have talked to 2 very helpful ladies, 1 not so helpful and am awaiting a call back from a triage nurse at the moment. Thanks again! Hope you got the lawn cut!",

A quick update.... hubby has scheduled RALP at Fox Chase cancer center on Aug 17, so I'm reading all of your posts on how to prep for surgery and what to expect afterwards...... He's starting kegel exercises, we've bought depends and pads, oversized pajama bottoms, a bucket and will investigate the lube. Will find out the day before when we need to report....so that's the update. I'll post again as we progress..... thanks for all of the very informative threads...they're so incredibly helpful! One week out to surgery......",
