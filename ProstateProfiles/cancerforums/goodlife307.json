      "Content": "Like me, many of you have purchased and read Dr. Patrick Walsh's book \"Surviving Prostate Cancer.\" In fact, I've heard many of you refer to it as the PC bible. I read with interest the section on Hormone Therapy. Dr. Walsh says he is in the camp of doctors who believe hormone therapy should begin at clinical progression (metastasis) versus earlier. He states that HT does not change OS so why not save it for later and preserve your quality of life while you can. He claims HT is only controlling the hormone sensitive cancer while the non-hormone sensitive cancer is getting stronger and progession will happen at about the same time anyway. I'm curious whether the book is current about this because you usually hear of people starting it much sooner. Thoughts?",

And he also noted that this could explain husband's PSA of 11. Unfortunately it will take another week to find out. So my question to all of you is did most of you have calcification in addition to your cancer? Or do the two conditions usually exist independent of each other? PS -- Per my other thread, we will be switching doctors once we get the results. Husband did not want to wait another month to get in with another doc.",

But, even though it was a wonderful part of our marriage, I am very willing to do this in order to keep him around. As I have read, hormone therapy means a loss of libdo and impotence. But does loss of libdo also mean he won't care to be touched, kissed, etc? Does it mean that if he wants to please me that he will be counting the minutes til it's over? For those of you who have been through hormone therapy, how did you feel about non-intercourse sexual interactions? Did you cease to have romantic feelings altogether?",

We have since seen four doctors -- a Uro, a Uro/Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist, and now a Medical Oncologist. Because my husband is only 59 and in otherwise very good health, all four docs are recommending surgery. Currently he is just on Casodex. Two of the four docs have mentioned some new trials/studies which suggest that newly diagnosed men with high-risk disease can get a huge leg up with a protocol of docetaxel and lupron PRIOR (neoadjuvant) to surgery or radiation. I have not seen any mention of this on this forum but I have read the studies. It is very encouraging and a direction I think we will go. Anyone else heard of this or done this?",

      "Content": "My newly diagnosed G9 husband (age 59) has decided to go the new early chemo route before surgery. He just had his second infusion the other day. Back in January, before the DX, we noticed that he had a large hard lump under his skin on the top of his thigh. It was about 6 inches below his hip bone. With all of the the trauma of the diagnosis we kind of forgot about it. Then after his first round of chemo we have noticed that it has almost completely disappeared. While some might say this is good, I am worried that this might be a metastasis. His MRI did show two nodes as suspicious in the pelvic region but his bone scan was clean. We asked the oncologist about it the other day and he said without doing a biopsy it's hard to know what it is and that it would not change our current course of treatment. He wants hubby to do CT scans after the next round of chemo. My question to all of you is have you ever heard of anything like this relating to PC? Or could it be another type of cancer? If it is prostate cancer, I would think that this would take surgery off the table, meaning that it is now systematic. (Just entered my signature today; hope it shows up) Any insights would be much appreciated!!!",

      "Content": "My husband, who is a G9 T3bN with a PSA of 11.4, was just diagnosed a month ago. We have since seen four doctors -- a Uro, a Uro/Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist, and now a Medical Oncologist. Because my husband is only 59 and in otherwise very good health, all four docs are recommending surgery. Currently he is just on Casodex. Two of the four docs have mentioned some new trials/studies which suggest that newly diagnosed men with high-risk disease can get a huge leg up with a protocol of docetaxel and lupron PRIOR (neoadjuvant) to surgery or radiation. I have not seen any mention of this on this forum but I have read the studies. It is very encouraging and a direction I think we will go. Anyone else heard of this or done this?",

My husband, a newly diagnosed G9, just finished his 3rd of 6 chemo cycles. And as we were told from the beginning, he will have a CT scan now that we are at the half way point to measure to see if the treatment is working. His PSA has been notching up instead of down. He will have surgery once chemo is done. If your husband is scheduled to have surgery or radiation they will probably do scans before those take place. What has your doctor said? What did your husband's PSA do during and after treatment?",
