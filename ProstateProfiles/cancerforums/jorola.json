      "Content": "Hi everyone, You may know me as a mod from the Lung Cancer and other threads. I lurk here as my Dad was diagnosed in Jan 2014 with a very slow growing cancer. He as been on active surveillance ever since. Here's some background. Now bear with me as my parents are stereo typical small town people and try as I may, have not been allowed to go to appointments as I get told \"we don't want to bother you\" crap so I know I am probably missing info here. They also live about 2 hrs away from me so I do not see them all the time. I talk to mom almost every day but dad only gets on the phone once a week and doesn't like talking about this. He is stage 2 - initial PSA was 7.2, July 2014 - 7.9, Nov 2014 10.8, May 2015 7.9, Nov 2015 10.1 and I just convinced him to go today for another test as he wasn't going to for for his six month checkup. His symptoms are weak legs, tired and he tells me he pees and\"stuff\" just fine. Complicating things is that in 1984 he had a stroke due to carbon monoxide poisoning and it affected his right side so some of his weakness in his right leg and tiredness is from that. Here's my question. Last 3 months he gets very snappy for no reason one second then fine the next. Even trying to ask why gets your head bit off. Again the stroke also affected his emotions but that leveled off in time and with medications. Mom is going to talk to the dr about this. Maybe his meds need to be looked at. So back to my question - anyone else seen this? I know I am a mod but of course that does not mean I have all the answers and hey - not lung cancer so I am out of my usual waters here. Naturally I worry about it spreading to the brain but really not seeing any other symptoms other than these mood swings. Also not a man so not understanding what this is like so maybe then men can enlighten me where my father just won't talk about it. I appreciate any thoughts, questions, feedback etc.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, You may know me as a mod from the Lung Cancer and other threads. I lurk here as my Dad was diagnosed in Jan 2014 with a very slow growing cancer. He as been on active surveillance ever since. Here's some background. Now bear with me as my parents are stereo typical small town people and try as I may, have not been allowed to go to appointments as I get told \"we don't want to bother you\" crap so I know I am probably missing info here. They also live about 2 hrs away from me so I do not see them all the time. I talk to mom almost every day but dad only gets on the phone once a week and doesn't like talking about this. He is stage 2 - initial PSA was 7.2, July 2014 - 7.9, Nov 2014 10.8, May 2015 7.9, Nov 2015 10.1 and I just convinced him to go today for another test as he wasn't going to for for his six month checkup. His symptoms are weak legs, tired and he tells me he pees and\"stuff\" just fine. Complicating things is that in 1984 he had a stroke due to carbon monoxide poisoning and it affected his right side so some of his weakness in his right leg and tiredness is from that. Here's my question. Last 3 months he gets very snappy for no reason one second then fine the next. Even trying to ask why gets your head bit off. Again the stroke also affected his emotions but that leveled off in time and with medications. Mom is going to talk to the dr about this. Maybe his meds need to be looked at. So back to my question - anyone else seen this? I know I am a mod but of course that does not mean I have all the answers and hey - not lung cancer so I am out of my usual waters here. Naturally I worry about it spreading to the brain but really not seeing any other symptoms other than these mood swings. Also not a man so not understanding what this is like so maybe then men can enlighten me where my father just won't talk about it. I appreciate any thoughts, questions, feedback etc.",

      "Content": "No you read right on the numbers and no he has not had surgery. His dr told him that surgery would most likely cause the cancer to become super aggressive and did not recommend it. He also said by no surgery he would have 10 to 12 good years. He is currently 67. I have copied Chuck's responses and emailed them to my mom. She is suppose to be calling me tonight to discuss this further. Like I said i am out of my depth here so I appreciate any help. Lung cancer I know - this - nope not at all. I have been a little too trusting it seems to what dad has been saying. But them more I can learn here the better of a talk I can have with him.",

He also said by no surgery he would have 10 to 12 good years. He is currently 67. I have copied Chuck's responses and emailed them to my mom. She is suppose to be calling me tonight to discuss this further. Like I said i am out of my depth here so I appreciate any help. Lung cancer I know - this - nope not at all. I have been a little too trusting it seems to what dad has been saying. But them more I can learn here the better of a talk I can have with him.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, You may know me as a mod from the Lung Cancer and other threads. I lurk here as my Dad was diagnosed in Jan 2014 with a very slow growing cancer. He as been on active surveillance ever since. Here's some background. Now bear with me as my parents are stereo typical small town people and try as I may, have not been allowed to go to appointments as I get told \"we don't want to bother you\" crap so I know I am probably missing info here. They also live about 2 hrs away from me so I do not see them all the time. I talk to mom almost every day but dad only gets on the phone once a week and doesn't like talking about this. He is stage 2 - initial PSA was 7.2, July 2014 - 7.9, Nov 2014 10.8, May 2015 7.9, Nov 2015 10.1 and I just convinced him to go today for another test as he wasn't going to for for his six month checkup. His symptoms are weak legs, tired and he tells me he pees and\"stuff\" just fine. Complicating things is that in 1984 he had a stroke due to carbon monoxide poisoning and it affected his right side so some of his weakness in his right leg and tiredness is from that. Here's my question. Last 3 months he gets very snappy for no reason one second then fine the next. Even trying to ask why gets your head bit off. Again the stroke also affected his emotions but that leveled off in time and with medications. Mom is going to talk to the dr about this. Maybe his meds need to be looked at. So back to my question - anyone else seen this? I know I am a mod but of course that does not mean I have all the answers and hey - not lung cancer so I am out of my usual waters here. Naturally I worry about it spreading to the brain but really not seeing any other symptoms other than these mood swings. Also not a man so not understanding what this is like so maybe then men can enlighten me where my father just won't talk about it. I appreciate any thoughts, questions, feedback etc.",
