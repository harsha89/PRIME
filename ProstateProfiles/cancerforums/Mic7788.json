      "Content": "Hi, I am age 41 and dad with PC. I had a PSA level of 7.5 back in 2015 and with a Kidney stone during a health check. Urologist treated the stone and was removed in March 2016 I had another health screening in Nov 2016 and the PSA was 5.2. A follow up review on April 2017 with my urologist on my stone and I told my urologist that my PSA is at 5.2. She suggested to run a PSA again and the result was 6.4 and fPSA ratio was 0.07 and suggested me to go for MRI and a biopsy. I decided to go with that as I read most you will opt for biopsy for PC. I hope to be on the right path.",

Did your urologist treat you with any anti-biotics to rule out infections? Also your free PSA number would indicate further investigation is necessary. Sounds like u have a urologist who is paying attention. Keep us posted, we are here to help. Good luck, MM MM, I wasn't given any anti-botics.",
