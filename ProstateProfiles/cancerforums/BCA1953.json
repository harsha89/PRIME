      "Content": "Originally Posted by San635 My husband has diagnosed in October 2013 with a gleason 9 T2a. After much discussion and several opinions he opted for a clinical trial phase three with docetaxal with lupron injections and will be followed by surgery after every 3 weeks for total of 18 week chemo Thearpy. Has anyone been through this trial ? Not sure how this forum works. I was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma Gleason 9 and given two years to live. That was over 8 years ago. Doctors should NEVER estimate lifespan. They are NOT God. Now here is something important to know...I have never taken any form of Chemotherapy. I have been on Zoladex for the whole time. My PSA was about 7.5 when this whole thing started. Since then It has remained around 0.1-0.4 I believe the difference maker for me was my personal doctor. He suggested Hi-Dose Vitamin C infusions right from day 1. 3 x a week, 3 hours each time. I did this for two &a half years. No side effects what so ever. Vitamin C is natural cancer killer and taking it interveneuosly takes it right to the bones, and other infected parts. I cant say that this treatment would help your husband the same way, but what are the chances with chemo? Not good, let me tell you. That's why I have refused it. I hope many are listening. I have all records to back up what I am saying.",
