      "Content": "Hi...My husband was diagnosed with PC and bladder cancer. The biopsy showed all 12 samples positive, one was 50%(4+3), one was 70%, the other 10 were 80-100%(all of them were 3+4). Also half the samples showed perineural invasion. Final Gleason score of 7. They haven't said what stage he is in. PSA was 16 6 weeks ago, after 30 days of cipro, it went up to 17, which led to the biopsy. He had a bone scan on Mon., that we are waiting on the results for. He is also scheduled for surgery next week to scrape out the bladder. He is 53yrs old. My questions are..Will scraping the bladder out take care of that cancer? Will he have to have his prostate removed? What are the chances of the cancer moving into his bones? This is all new to us, and completely unexpected. Any advice on good web sites? Thank you in advance!!",

      "Content": "Hi...My husband was diagnosed with PC and bladder cancer. The biopsy showed all 12 samples positive, one was 50%(4+3), one was 70%, the other 10 were 80-100%(all of them were 3+4). Also half the samples showed perineural invasion. Final Gleason score of 7. They haven't said what stage he is in. PSA was 16 6 weeks ago, after 30 days of cipro, it went up to 17, which led to the biopsy. He had a bone scan on Mon., that we are waiting on the results for. He is also scheduled for surgery next week to scrape out the bladder. He is 53yrs old. My questions are..Will scraping the bladder out take care of that cancer? Will he have to have his prostate removed? What are the chances of the cancer moving into his bones? This is all new to us, and completely unexpected. Any advice on good web sites? Thank you in advance!!",
