Eventually I have to go and see to the cats. The dog is elsewhere while he is in the hospital..... My friends are starting with food and we are still in the hospital.

      "Content": "Hubby had DaVinci on April 30.... He is doing very well... The cancer was a gleason 3, 3 nearing bad areas.... He still gets tired, he still leaks and sex is sort of non existent. We are OK with all this and hope that things get better. We are best friends who have been married 30 years. Lots of cuddling. The doc proscribed Cialis at 5 mg once a day and a vacuum pump for the in words. Hubby and I are more worried about the leaks then the other problem (in an ideal world both will get better). First the insurance denied the pills completely. Then the doc tried for preauthorization and the insurance will pay for 6 5 mg pills per month. This is not a sex dose. and will not work for either problem so we are still fighting the insurance. I was wondering if he cant get the 30 would 6 pills at 20 mg every 5 days do the same thing with benefits.... The pills are $191/month. I found a voucher for a 30 day free sample. So at least we will have an idea if the expense is worth it if we lose to the insurance company. The vacuum pump is a non starter with the insurance but is a one time event. It is getting very frustrating dealing with them. THis stuff is supposed to help with the incontinence (which is getting better. What is experience with the insurance?",

I am pretty confident but my hubby does not want to seek a second opinion or leave Boise for the surgery. He has time off from classes but is hoping to grade (but not give) his own finals. I am very grateful he was not planning to teach this summer.",

      "Content": "Tomorrow we see the urologist. I wanted to talk about nerve sparing robotic.. I am hoping he can make the call during surgery. My reading indicate it helps with continence and to a lesser extent sex. I think I should also figure out what we need to have in the home. I am wondering if any of you have questions that we should ask the doc. Things you wish you had before the surgery. Hubby doesn't seem to want to be on the forums. The discomfort from the biopsy finally cleared towards the end of the week Thanks!",

      "Content": "We talked to the doc about the procedure and about nerve sparing. Apparently the problem is near the apex where the prostate narrows like a beat. He is positive he can't spare the left side but there is a possibility that he can spare the right. We also asked him for a prescription for problems we were having before the diagnosis. Now we can play for a month before the problems start. I don't embarrass easily but the way hubby phrased it made it sound like it was all my idea.... The doc put at ease and gave us some samples. Maybe he wants to know what worked best before the surgery too. I am feeling very confident with the doctor and the treatment plan. Now here is hoping that after the operation we will have seen the last of the cancer....",
