      "Content": "Hello all, I was told a week ago that I have PC, had the \"consult\" with my urologist last night and still have many questions and concerns like I'm sure all of you had. My history...I'm 52, was told 3 years ago my PSA numbers were on the rise (upper 3's) need to talk to doc, was told by my GP that it was most likely due to me having an enlarged prostate but we would keep an eye on it. PSA numbers continued to rise to where they are now(5.0). I decided to go straight to urologist he did DRE found prostate to be enlarged but nothing else, did PSA Free test came back 14.4%, told me he wanted to do a biopsy. Biopsy came back last week showing 3 cores positive left side only. Sixe 71ccm. ,gleason 7 (3x4). In the consult last night doc went through all possible treatment options and we narrowed it down to the 2 he thought most likely to be best, surgery and radiology. Now the confusing part for me, he explained the different options for both procedures and said I would need to decide which one I wanted to go with. By this time my head was mush and there was no way for me to grasp everything he was saying but I could kind of tell he was leaning toward the open surgery (RD?). Thought I would come to you guys, maybe get your thoughts and opinions on these two methods. Thanks in advance...Dan",
