Sometimes an enlarged prostate can cause an elevated PSA. I so understand your worrying. I am going through something similar with my dad. His PSA level keeps increasing and it makes me scared..I hope you get positive news at the ultrasound appointment. Keep us posted.",

      "Content": "Hi. We are going through something similar with my dad. His PSA has increased over his last few visits so I can totally understand the stress and anxiety you are going through. I found this information online... \"When total PSA is in the range of 4.0-10.0 ng/mL, a free:total PSA ratio < or =0.10 indicates 49% to 65% risk of prostate cancer depending on age; a free:total PSA ratio >0.25 indicates a 9% to 16% risk of prostate cancer, depending on age\" I think its a good idea to follow up with his urologist and see what he recommends.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by mkane09 Agree 100% with Fairwind. Your dad's last 2 PSAs could be off that far if done at different labs. Even if he HAD PCa, the treatment could be worse than the disease. With surgery, he could end up incontinent, with hormone deprivation he could be so weak as to not be able to function. Radiation? Maybe....but his DRE sounds entirely normal to me. And his PSAs are entirely normal for his age. I guarantee that if you drag him off to enough 2nd opinions, you WILL find a urologist willing to give him a PCa diagnosis.....and plenty of treatment. You both do not want this. Let him enjoy old age. JMHO..... mkane09 Thank you for your response mkane09. I am so confused...(very stressed dealing with my mom's liver cancer and now possible PC for my dad). My parents mean the world to me...I am so thankful to have 2 awesome, loving, caring parents. I am so blessed to have them and can't even begin to imagine my life without them. My dad has an appt with his urologist on Monday. He will be talking to us further about my dad's most recent PCA3 result. However, I was able to get him a prescription for a PSA blood test to be done tomorrow at Quest (where he had the PSA done in December) to see if the result is consistent with the one he had done in December. I think its more to calm our anxiety about the difference in PSA result between Dec (PSA 2.87) and Jan (PSA 3.30). Also...should I request another transrectal sonogram for Monday? It's been almost one year since my dad had the last one. Or should I request a pelvic CT? I am trying to request tests that are not invasive since my dad is on blood thinners. If my dad does have PC, I worry about it spreading, etc. Thankfully, his urologist is very accommodating and takes all our questions and suggestions into consideration to help ease our anxiety...but naturally, the doctor is the one to call the shots...lol!!! Does a percentage free PSA test weigh heavily in regards to helping confirming PC? We will receive the percentage free PSA results on Monday. I am sorry to ramble on and on but this is all new to me and trying my best to seek advice and guidance for my dad. Thank you for listening and helping me.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there, I am not very knowledgeable about PCA3, but his PSA reading seems perfectly fine for a man of 78. Especially with an enlarged prostate, which most likely is BPH (a benign condition where the prostate grows with age -- this is NOT cancer). When BPH begins to manifest itself, it squeezes on the urethra (which runs through the middle of the prostate) and causes slow urine streams, interrupted streams, weak flow, etc. My case of BPH was so bad, at the age of 61, that my garden hose was very envious of the fine spray it produced. The rise in PSA can easily be attributed to the BPH. There are basically only two things that produce PSA -- prostate tissue and prostate cancer. With your dad's diagnosed BPH, there is more prostate tissue than normal -- which means the larger the prostate, the more PSA is produced and, hence, the higher the PSA reading. Completely harmless & nothing to worry about. Also, you were correct in your original question regarding PSA tests in different labs. The same blood sample can be interpreted differently by different labs -- with as much as 1 full point difference between them. So it is ALWAYS best to use the same lab to ensure consistent readings. Also, there should be NO sexual activity (specifically ejaculation) or bike riding or any digital rectal exam in the 48-72 hours before a PSA test. This is because anything that stresses the prostate can temporarily elevate the PSA reading. My guess is that, with all of the above, combined with the normal DREs (aside from the BPH) and other tests, your dad is just fine. Even if there was prostate cancer present, it would probably be something that would not cause any problems within his lifespan -- which hopefully will include at least 20 more years. Wishing him the best of luck & health! Chuck Hi Chuck. Thank you so much for your reply. I will ask my dad's urologist if he thinks that my dad might have BPH. I guess since I do not know about Prostate Cancer, I am still confused as to why one wouldn't treat it, if they are diagnosed with it? This is what truly confuses me. All the replies that I have received regarding my post do not recommend treating the Prostate Cancer. Is it because of \"older age\" for my dad???...he is 78 years old. Thanks = )",

      "Content": "Hello. I am a little anxious regarding my dad's recent results. He is 78 years old. He has been seeing a urologist 2 times a year since 2012. Before that, his primary care doctor drew his PSA blood tests. Here are his results beginning in 2009 thru now (January 2013) Normal range for the PSA at the lab is <=4.0 Also, the PSA tests were done at different labs (some at Quest, some at Bioreference and some at LabCorp). Does having the tests done at different labs effect the results? PSA...1.91 (July 2009) PSA...2.09 (October 2009) PSA...1.97 (January 2010) PSA...1.79 (October 2010) PSA...2.20 (January 2011) PSA...3.22 (February 2012) PSA...2.87 (June 27, 2012) PSA...2.87 (December 28, 2012) PSA...3.30 (January 28, 2013) PCA3...40.4 (March 2012) *** normal range at this lab is 35.0 or below*** PCA3...47.0 (January 2013) ***normal range at this lab is 25.0 or below** During the DRE exam, the Dr said his prostate is a little enlarged but it was smooth with no nodules to suggest malignancy. He also had a transrectal ultrasound, and that was normal. The reason I am extremely worried is because his PSA results are a bit elevated as well as his PCA3 results. My dad takes blood thinners so if he needed a biopsy, it would call for him to stop the blood thinners and that could cause other complications. Also...My dad does get up about 3 times during the night to urinate. And we are waiting the results of the percentage free PSA test that should be back by Monday. Should I insist that a biopsy be done or just do the \"watch & wait\" and bring him to see the doctor in 3 months? Are there any other tests I should be requesting for my dad to have done? I am so worried about my dad and we are also dealing with my mom who has been diagnosed with liver cancer (HCC). This is all so much stress Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind At 78 years, Dad may indeed have PC...But treating it could very well cause more problems than the cancer will ever cause him..His PSA is well within the normal range for a 78 year old with an enlarged prostate..His urologist may prescribe Avodart, a mild form of hormone therapy, which will shrink his prostate and relieve the urination problems and also suppress any possible prostate cancer without introducing any severe side-effects...Usually, this drug will cut his PSA number in half.. Dad's going to be fine. Focus your attension on your Mom....Best of luck to you and your family... Thank you Fairwind for your response. If my dad does indeed have Prostate Cancer, why wouldn't we want to treat it? (Sorry, if some of my questions do not make sense but, I do not understanding the full scope of Prostate Cancer and treatment, etc and... this is all so overwhelming). Wouldn't the cancer spread without treatment? Should I push for my dad to have a biopsy? Are there any other less invasive tests that I should push for? I am a bit confused mainly about his last 2 PSA tests...on December 28th his PSA was 2.87 but one month later on January 28th, his PSA level was 3.30...why is that? I asked his Dr. and he said because the PSA was done at 2 different labs and that can cause a difference in results...is that true?

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi there, I am not very knowledgeable about PCA3, but his PSA reading seems perfectly fine for a man of 78. Especially with an enlarged prostate, which most likely is BPH (a benign condition where the prostate grows with age -- this is NOT cancer). When BPH begins to manifest itself, it squeezes on the urethra (which runs through the middle of the prostate) and causes slow urine streams, interrupted streams, weak flow, etc. My case of BPH was so bad, at the age of 61, that my garden hose was very envious of the fine spray it produced. The rise in PSA can easily be attributed to the BPH. There are basically only two things that produce PSA -- prostate tissue and prostate cancer. With your dad's diagnosed BPH, there is more prostate tissue than normal -- which means the larger the prostate, the more PSA is produced and, hence, the higher the PSA reading. Completely harmless & nothing to worry about. Also, you were correct in your original question regarding PSA tests in different labs. The same blood sample can be interpreted differently by different labs -- with as much as 1 full point difference between them. So it is ALWAYS best to use the same lab to ensure consistent readings. Also, there should be NO sexual activity (specifically ejaculation) or bike riding or any digital rectal exam in the 48-72 hours before a PSA test. This is because anything that stresses the prostate can temporarily elevate the PSA reading. My guess is that, with all of the above, combined with the normal DREs (aside from the BPH) and other tests, your dad is just fine. Even if there was prostate cancer present, it would probably be something that would not cause any problems within his lifespan -- which hopefully will include at least 20 more years. Wishing him the best of luck & health! Chuck Hi Chuck. Thank you so much for your reply. I will ask my dad's urologist if he thinks that my dad might have BPH. I guess since I do not know about Prostate Cancer, I am still confused as to why one wouldn't treat it, if they are diagnosed with it? This is what truly confuses me. All the replies that I have received regarding my post do not recommend treating the Prostate Cancer. Is it because of \"older age\" for my dad???...he is 78 years old. Thanks = )",

      "Content": "Hello. I am a little anxious regarding my dad's recent results. He is 78 years old. He has been seeing a urologist 2 times a year since 2012. Before that, his primary care doctor drew his PSA blood tests. Here are his results beginning in 2009 thru now (January 2013) Normal range for the PSA at the lab is <=4.0 Also, the PSA tests were done at different labs (some at Quest, some at Bioreference and some at LabCorp). Does having the tests done at different labs effect the results? PSA...1.91 (July 2009) PSA...2.09 (October 2009) PSA...1.97 (January 2010) PSA...1.79 (October 2010) PSA...2.20 (January 2011) PSA...3.22 (February 2012) PSA...2.87 (June 27, 2012) PSA...2.87 (December 28, 2012) PSA...3.30 (January 28, 2013) PCA3...40.4 (March 2012) *** normal range at this lab is 35.0 or below*** PCA3...47.0 (January 2013) ***normal range at this lab is 25.0 or below** During the DRE exam, the Dr said his prostate is a little enlarged but it was smooth with no nodules to suggest malignancy. He also had a transrectal ultrasound, and that was normal. The reason I am extremely worried is because his PSA results are a bit elevated as well as his PCA3 results. My dad takes blood thinners so if he needed a biopsy, it would call for him to stop the blood thinners and that could cause other complications. Also...My dad does get up about 3 times during the night to urinate. And we are waiting the results of the percentage free PSA test that should be back by Monday. Should I insist that a biopsy be done or just do the \"watch & wait\" and bring him to see the doctor in 3 months? Are there any other tests I should be requesting for my dad to have done? I am so worried about my dad and we are also dealing with my mom who has been diagnosed with liver cancer (HCC). This is all so much stress Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated!!! Thank you.",

I think its more to calm our anxiety about the difference in PSA result between Dec (PSA 2.87) and Jan (PSA 3.30). Also...should I request another transrectal sonogram for Monday? It's been almost one year since my dad had the last one. Or should I request a pelvic CT? I am trying to request tests that are not invasive since my dad is on blood thinners. If my dad does have PC, I worry about it spreading, etc. Thankfully, his urologist is very accommodating and takes all our questions and suggestions into consideration to help ease our anxiety...but naturally, the doctor is the one to call the shots...lol!!! Does a percentage free PSA test weigh heavily in regards to helping confirming PC? We will receive the percentage free PSA results on Monday. I am sorry to ramble on and on but this is all new to me and trying my best to seek advice and guidance for my dad. Thank you for listening and helping me.",

I think its more to calm our anxiety about the difference in PSA result between Dec (PSA 2.87) and Jan (PSA 3.30). Also...should I request another transrectal sonogram for Monday? It's been almost one year since my dad had the last one. Or should I request a pelvic CT? I am trying to request tests that are not invasive since my dad is on blood thinners. If my dad does have PC, I worry about it spreading, etc. Thankfully, his urologist is very accommodating and takes all our questions and suggestions into consideration to help ease our anxiety...but naturally, the doctor is the one to call the shots...lol!!! Does a percentage free PSA test weigh heavily in regards to helping confirming PC? We will receive the percentage free PSA results on Monday. I am sorry to ramble on and on but this is all new to me and trying my best to seek advice and guidance for my dad. Thank you for listening and helping me.",
