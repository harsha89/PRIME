      "Content": "Hi Michael Yes he did have an MRI it showed nothing. PSA at the time this occurred was 7.8 (2014)Some letters said 7.2 but path says 7.8. In 2010 it was 5.8 but nobody said a thing. In October 2014 he was biopsied and told that he had PC but it was only in 2 cores and about 1 - 2mm. So we went on AS. In April 2015 I believe he had his second follow up blood test which indicated a reading 12.8. Original urologist moved and he was referred to anew urologist who then preformed a template biopsy about mid August this year. This revealed a G7 with a number of positive cores through out the prostate concentrated on the lobes particularly left hand side. It took 3 weeks to get the results then we were told that the cancer was more aggressive and we needed to consider treatment. We chose surgery since he was still fairly young and we thought it was all in the capsule. He was then operated on almost 3 weeks ago and the rest is what I wrote in the first post! I don't have a copy of the current path report but see the specialist in 4 weeks for the results of the first PSA test. Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Webster & Husband! Remain optimistic and hopeful that all PC was removed with the prostate. If in the event of recurrence, Salvage Radiation would be the next step. Several Forum Brothers have gone this route and are doing perfectly well with undetectable PSAs. If comfortable, can you share some additional information that will be helpful to all? Specifically: - Did he ever have an MRI or CT scan of his prostate? - How many months elapsed between the G6 biopsy and the G7 biopsy? - What were his PSA values during this time? - How many weeks between his G7 biopsy and prostate surgery? - If you have a copy of his surgical Pathology report, can you share the \"findings?\" - Where are you being treated? In our battles with PC, we all experience The Dreaded \"Wait\" and associated anxiety! - We have the Biopsy and WAIT for the results - Surgery is scheduled and we WAIT for several weeks for the surgery day to arrive - After surgery we WAIT for the Path Report - Post surgery we monitor our PSAs regularly to detect recurrence. We have our blood drawn and then anxiously WAIT for the result. Good luck with your next PSA! May it and all subsequent PSAs remain undetectable! MF",

      "Content": "Some time ago I posted on this forum re my OH having been diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, at the time it was G6 3+3. So we undertook Active survelliance for a period of time. However his PSA doubling time was only a matter of months which indicated he had something more aggressive happening. After a template biopsy, score was changed to G7. After much thought and prayer OH decided to proceed with a radical prosectomy. During surgery there were some complications so the surgery took twice as long. This was due to the prostate being obliterated with tissue stuck in surround areas. It's suggested this may have occurred after the biopsies. OH is recovering well, however surgeons needed to remove more tissue than anticipated, both nerves removed and more. Upon grading of the prostate we were told the cancer was quite advanced and had escaped the prostate capsule to start on the seminal vesicle but that it was still a G7, nothing about staging but the conversation suggests bordering on a T3. We have been told there is a much higher chance of re occurance in this situation. In four weeks we will have a PSA test to see where levels are. Fingers crossed its a 0 for many years to come!! Anyway many thanks to those on the forum that helped us through this very difficult time, in particular highlander, your help and support was very appreciated",

      "Content": "Hi Highlander, so as to not hijack the other thread here's an update. I now have the path report, I won't scan in but will list some of its content Cancer is not gone, PSA reading is only 1 though so its not the worst news but not the best. I now have the path report of the prostate after grading. G7 3 + 4 BUT its 1% off being a 4 + 3. Pattern 4 affecting 40 - 50% of tumours. 40% of the prostate volume is cancer. pt3b stage. I won't bore you with any more info but now the plan is to wait 3 months do another PSA and go for a more expensive PET scan (1200 not covered by medicare)before having further treatment. Apparently it could be any where in the body. I guess it could have been worse, my only concern is that the cancer grew so quickly there is a fear this could happen again. I know its not likely but then we were told in the first place it wasn't likely, but tumors went from 2mm to 35 mm (largest in months). Step by step the journey continues, hoping though the remaining cancer can be mopped up and that a cure is possible.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Thank you Webster. Keep your spirits & hopes up that he may very well have been cured despite the advanced cancer. If it truly is a T3, that just means that it hit the seminal vesicles and went no further. Even in this type of case, if all of it was removed by the surgery, it should be gone forever. Can you tell us if the G7 was a 3+4 or a 4+3? Thanks Highlander, not sure he didn't say we were just processing the info at the time originally it was a 3 + 4 but that was before the prostate was graded when taken out. It def hit the seminal vesicle, had significant perennial (SP?) invasion but no lymph nodes which is a good sign. It's all good, we are taking one day at a time. OH has the catheter out tomorrow so he won't know himself. He's prepared for the issues of continence and of course the erectile dysfunction with both nerves being removed. It could be worse so grateful for that",

      "Sample": "During surgery there were some complications so the surgery took twice as long. This was due to the prostate being obliterated with tissue stuck in surround areas....It took 3 weeks to get the results then we were told that the cancer was more aggressive and we needed to consider treatment. We chose surgery since he was still fairly young and we thought it was all in the capsule....We chose surgery since he was still fairly young and we thought it was all in the capsule. He was then operated on almost 3 weeks ago and the rest is what I wrote in the first post!...After much thought and prayer OH decided to proceed with a radical prosectomy. During surgery there were some complications so the surgery took twice as long....The surgery OH had was difficult as the prostate was obliterated due to biopsies so surgery took much longer. It was staged tb3 because it was out of the prostate 40 - 50% of the tumour Extensive Perineural and Seminal invasion Was 1% off a pattern 4 apparently....Thanks guys yes I did post some months back, PSA was 0.1 then 0.07, then up to 0.15 then 0.23. The surgery OH had was difficult as the prostate was obliterated due to biopsies so surgery took much longer....",
