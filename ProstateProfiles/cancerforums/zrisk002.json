    "Content": "I was looking through a few pages of posts and am having difficulty finding an answer without posting my question... I'm a 27 year old male and I have had prostate issues the last 3 or 4 years. I am urinating frequently, wake up plenty at night to go and also have trouble going. I'm not nervous when urinating, but sometimes I just cant go or I get a few drips out even though I really need to go. Anyways, I felt that could just be mild prostate issues because I'm getting older. Also, once in a while I have intense burning after I go. The reason why I'm posting though today is because a few weeks ago I ejaculated pure blood after having sex with my wife. It wasn't a cut or anything. What does this mean? I don't know what step to take next. I'm pretty concerned after what happened, any advice would be amazing and I appreciate everyone here...",
