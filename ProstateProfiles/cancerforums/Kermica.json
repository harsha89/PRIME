      "Content": "I have a question for all you smart people who spend time on this Forum. I saw my urologist yesterday for my annual PSA review and he informed me that my number had increased from a .6 to a 3.6. Historically, I have always measured very low (below 1.0). We have another test scheduled in August to see if the new number holds up and, if so, he is talking a biopsy as appropriate. My question is: how often does a volume spike like this occur in someone with a healthy prostate and how often is it a false positive? If happening, this will be my fourth cancer (counting two skin cancers) and I am not eager to engage in another fight while the lymphoma is still active. Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated. Good health, kermica",

Significant progression detected in PET scan - December 2012 Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma, of course. July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13. August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to \"extensive, systemic disease\". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are \"suspicious\" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much. June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains, largest tumor is impacting hearing, measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP, 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds, spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP, V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time, at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However, the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib, one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed, treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation. May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc, have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer. Surgery scheduled for 7/12. September 2018 - biopsy of mass in nose shows transformed DLBCL throughout. Assessing options for this negative development. October 2018 - started 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP. Goal is to get to full remission to open up other options. February/March 2019 - PET shows four hot spots following R-CHOP. referred to Dana Farber for stem cell transplant. Pre testing all good, accepted for Auto Transplant. Will begin inpatient process about April 1.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the quick reply, Michael, I appreciate that. The DRE was negative, prostate felt \"smooth and normal\" according to my URO. He also mentioned the various false indicator triggers that you mentioned in your post. - Activities that impact the prostate gland such as: bike riding, sex, strenuous exercise, DRE prior to the PSA blood draw are contraindicated as they can elevate one's PSA. There is no evidence of prostatits, my urinalysis was normal. Also, no discussion of hyperplasia or any other organic causes. I will just hang in until next month, planning to have the blood draw around the 20th and then will see my doc for a followup in early September. In the meantime, as always, my assumption is that I do not have PC until a definitive biopsy says that I do. Hopefully, that turns out to be not the case. Thanks again! Good health, kermica",

      "Content": "I don't think you'll see any change in your benefits in November, 2017, when I assume you will reach your full-retirement age of 67. Thanks, Jim, for the comeback post. I didn't mean that my benefit would stop but that it would transition from being SSDI to being standard Social Security Retirement. I don't anticipate a change in dollar amount. So someone like GeorgeS might still qualify but just not on the fast track? BigSkyGuy, that is correct. If a person is disabled (and their physicians are willing to certify that) than that person can apply for SSDI. If they are a veteran, then they can also consider applying for compensation through the VA if they believe that their disability is service connected. I have a lawyer working on that for me due to Agent Orange exposure in Thailand in the early 70's. Here is a post I put up a few year ago on the subject...notice that PC is one of the compensable conditions. http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...e-for-benefits What about us caregivers (spouse)? Im wondering if they help with that, Im not working, WifeinWorry, there is no direct government benefit payable to you for being a caregiver. The benefit will flow to your husband as a disabled person or veteran. I notice you mentioned the VA, was he ever physically in Vietnam? If so, the benefit is presumptive even if he was only there for a day. If, like me, he was exposed somewhere other than Vietnam, he has to prove the connection. For anyone dealing with this who had service in SE Asia, there are some great advocacy groups on FaceBook and, to a lesser degree, on the web. I hope this is helpful, I have spent a lot of time educating myself so PM me if you have questions. Good health, kermica",

      "Content": "I don't think you'll see any change in your benefits in November, 2017, when I assume you will reach your full-retirement age of 67. Thanks, Jim, for the comeback post. I didn't mean that my benefit would stop but that it would transition from being SSDI to being standard Social Security Retirement. I don't anticipate a change in dollar amount. So someone like GeorgeS might still qualify but just not on the fast track? BigSkyGuy, that is correct. If a person is disabled (and their physicians are willing to certify that) than that person can apply for SSDI. If they are a veteran, then they can also consider applying for compensation through the VA if they believe that their disability is service connected. I have a lawyer working on that for me due to Agent Orange exposure in Thailand in the early 70's. Here is a post I put up a few year ago on the subject...notice that PC is one of the compensable conditions. http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...e-for-benefits What about us caregivers (spouse)? Im wondering if they help with that, Im not working, WifeinWorry, there is no direct government benefit payable to you for being a caregiver. The benefit will flow to your husband as a disabled person or veteran. I notice you mentioned the VA, was he ever physically in Vietnam? If so, the benefit is presumptive even if he was only there for a day. If, like me, he was exposed somewhere other than Vietnam, he has to prove the connection. For anyone dealing with this who had service in SE Asia, there are some great advocacy groups on FaceBook and, to a lesser degree, on the web. I hope this is helpful, I have spent a lot of time educating myself so PM me if you have questions. Good health, kermica",

      "Content": "Hi guys. I'm not a PC guy but my oncologist made me cut down my coffee consumption when I started chemo because of its diuretic properties. The coffee consumption would have interfered with my kidney function while processing the chemo through my body. The other thing, just like so many we see over on my home board (Lymphoma) is that the results are very early and much more research is needed to confirm the current, preliminary results. Once that is done, then we need a way for the the specific compounds to be isolated or synthesized so they can be tested and approved by the FDA and other regulatory bodies around the world. If all of that is done successfully, then we may have a valuable tool in hand to fight PC and many other cancers, which is great! Having lived this life with cancer for more than five years, I guess I am a bit jaded when the media grabs preliminary results (from the \"publish or die crowd\") and touts them as if a cure is at hand. I would love for that to be the case for you or for me but I don't see it in this article. I wish you all well and the best of good fortune with your individual journeys. Good health, kermica",

Significant progression detected in PET scan - December 2012 Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma, of course. July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13. August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to \"extensive, systemic disease\". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are \"suspicious\" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much. June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains, largest tumor is impacting hearing, measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP, 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds, spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP, V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time, at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However, the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib, one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed, treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation. May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc, have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer. Surgery scheduled for 7/12. September 2018 - biopsy of mass in nose shows transformed DLBCL throughout. Assessing options for this negative development. October 2018 - started 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP.

Remission confirmed July 09 Restaged to Stage 3 May 2010 Recurrence confirmed May 2010 - Watch and Wait commenced - multiple scans with minimal progression. Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosed September 2012. Mohs surgical excision 09/2012. Successful, clean edges all around. Significant progression detected in PET scan - December 2012 Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma, of course. July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13. August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to \"extensive, systemic disease\". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are \"suspicious\" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much. June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains, largest tumor is impacting hearing, measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP, 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds, spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP, V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time, at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However, the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib, one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed, treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation. May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc, have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer. Surgery scheduled for 7/12. September 2018 - biopsy of mass in nose shows transformed DLBCL throughout. Assessing options for this negative development. October 2018 - started 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP. Goal is to get to full remission to open up other options. February/March 2019 - PET shows four hot spots following R-CHOP. referred to Dana Farber for stem cell transplant. Pre testing all good, accepted for Auto Transplant. Will begin inpatient process about April 1.",

Remission confirmed July 09 Restaged to Stage 3 May 2010 Recurrence confirmed May 2010 - Watch and Wait commenced - multiple scans with minimal progression. Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosed September 2012. Mohs surgical excision 09/2012. Successful, clean edges all around. Significant progression detected in PET scan - December 2012 Biopsy to check for transformation 1/18/2013 - negative for that but full of lymphoma, of course. July 2013 - Rescan due to progression shows one tumor (among many) very suspect for transformation, another biopsy 8/12/13. August 2013 - No evidence of transformation, 6 courses of B+R commence 8/29 due to \"extensive, systemic disease\". February 2014 - Diagnostic PET scan states: Negative PET scan. Previous noted hypermetabolic cervical, axillary, iliac and inguinal lymphadenopathy has resolved. Doctor confirms full remission. June 2014 - started 2 year maintenance Rituxan, 1 infusion every 3 months. Doctor confirms lump under right arm are \"suspicious\" for recurrent disease, deferring scans for now. February 2015 - Doc and I agreed to stop R maintenance as it is depressing my immune system too much. June 2015 - Confirm that the beast is back by physical exam, will scan in August after esophageal issues settle down so we can get a clear view. August 2015 - physical exam in error, PET/CT shows no evidence of disease. Remission continues well into second year! December 2015 - Cardiologist tells me I have plaque buildup growing at an alarming rate. Stent or bypass down the road but not yet... March 2016 - new tumor below the jaw so remission is over. Back to active surveillance until treatment is needed. June 2016 - C/T scan indicates presence of multiple lesions in iliac chain. August 2016 - PET/CT shows multiple areas of lymphoma as expected plus new areas of concern in bowel. January 2017 - C/T scan shows significant progression in cervical and inguinal lymph chains, largest tumor is impacting hearing, measures 2.1x4.6 cm. 4 to 8 cycles of R-CVP, 1x3weeks to commence 2/6/17. April 2017 - Mid treatment scan shows about 1/3 reduction in multiple tumors. Also shows abdominal aortic aneurysm with peripheral thrombus. Cardiologist changed meds, spoke of need for surgical repair down the road. September 2017 - finished 10 rounds of R-CP, V was stopped due to neuropathy in feet. No further treatment planned at this time, at least 10 tumors can be felt which seem to be growing again. December 2017 - Biopsy of external iliac node with SUV of 13.1 shows no transformation! However, the FL grade is now 3A instead of Gr 1-2. Will start indefinite protocol using Copanlisib, one of the new targeted therapies. I remain hopeful. March 2018 - Copanlisib failed, treatment stopped 3/28. New plan is to go to Dana Farber on 4/16 for case review and treatment recommendation. May 2018 - did not qualify for clinical trials at Dana Farber. Tumors need to get larger to be considered. On consultation w/Dr. Armand at DF and my onc, have decided to take a break from cancer treatments. Will have a biopsy of the mass in my sinus discovered in scan at DF and to get the aneurysm repaired as it has developed a potentially catastrophic penetrating ulcer. Surgery scheduled for 7/12. September 2018 - biopsy of mass in nose shows transformed DLBCL throughout. Assessing options for this negative development. October 2018 - started 6 to 8 cycles of R-CHOP. Goal is to get to full remission to open up other options. February/March 2019 - PET shows four hot spots following R-CHOP. referred to Dana Farber for stem cell transplant. Pre testing all good, accepted for Auto Transplant. Will begin inpatient process about April 1.",

      "Content": "tessems, I don't think anyone here will be able to answer your specific questions. I will say that it is always in a patients best interest to find a surgeon who is highly experienced in the procedure to be performed. What you should do is seek out a doctor who is affiliated with a National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center. http://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-r...r-centers/find The doctors in these facilities are among the best in the world and are very, very experienced in administering the treatments needed by patients in their specialty. It is also a place to get a second opinion of your diagnosis if desired. Good luck to you and I hope you find what you are looking for in a doctor. I am also moving your thread to the Prostate Cancer Forum as you may get some more specific information there. Good health, kermica",
