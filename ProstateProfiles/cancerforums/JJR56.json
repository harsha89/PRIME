On the other hand, a 6.1 is above normal, so hopefully your new PSA test will be back in normal ranges. Just be sure that you have NOT had sex, done any bike riding, no strenuous exercise and no digital rectal exams over the past 2 days in advance of Monday's test. Please let us know what the results are. Thank you for the info. I'm so new to this. I went for a 5 mile hike yesterday and I'm going now for that new blood test.

      "Content": "Thank you Jim, Chuck and everyone else here. It's been about 3 weeks since I was told my PSA level was 6.1. I never even thought about prostate issues before. I thought I was so healthy because I live a clean life, and longevity is in my family. I'll be honest, I'm scared. But reading a lot of posts here and reading peoples results at the bottom of there signature, I now know if I do have prostate cancer, I can live. It will be a heck of a ride, but I will live. I thought for the past few weeks that my days were numbered and I was trying to grasp the idea of death. Sorry to sound so blunt, but I really was thinking that. I'm so glad I found this board. Thank you all again for listening to me and responding to me. I don't feel alone anymore.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi JJR, When we're talking about 0.1 or 0.2, we're not referring to regular check-up based PSA readings. These numbers deal with POST-SURGERY PSA readings, which should be zero without a prostate and if all the cancer was removed. So this would not be of any comparison to your 6.1. On the other hand, a 6.1 is above normal, so hopefully your new PSA test will be back in normal ranges. Just be sure that you have NOT had sex, done any bike riding, no strenuous exercise and no digital rectal exams over the past 2 days in advance of Monday's test. Please let us know what the results are. Thank you for the info. I'm so new to this. I went for a 5 mile hike yesterday and I'm going now for that new blood test. Now I'm wondering if I should wait until tomorrow to go for the new BT. I'm sorry I'm so freaked out about all of this when it looks like most of you have gone through so much worse. I'm just so alone with this and know nothing about what I should be doing or feeling. I have no one to talk to about all of this.

      "Content": "Thank you Jim, Chuck and everyone else here. It's been about 3 weeks since I was told my PSA level was 6.1. I never even thought about prostate issues before. I thought I was so healthy because I live a clean life, and longevity is in my family. I'll be honest, I'm scared. But reading a lot of posts here and reading peoples results at the bottom of there signature, I now know if I do have prostate cancer, I can live. It will be a heck of a ride, but I will live. I thought for the past few weeks that my days were numbered and I was trying to grasp the idea of death. Sorry to sound so blunt, but I really was thinking that. I'm so glad I found this board. Thank you all again for listening to me and responding to me. I don't feel alone anymore.",
