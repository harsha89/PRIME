      "Content": "Dear Folks, Thanks for letting me \"eaves drop\" over the past weeks. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer on Christmas Eve (what a present!) - 4 out of 12 of the nodules and a Gleason Score of 8. I felt like a dead man walking for the past few weeks. Last Monday, I underwent a radical prostate removal (what fun) and am recovering... each day a bit better. The blessing is this - when I went in to get the staples removed, the urologist came in with a big grin on his face and showed me the pathology report. 10 percent on the gland had been invaded - the margins were clear as were the lymph nodes and the sperm vesicles. In other words, about as good as you could get. I was shocked - expecting the worst. I want you all to know that I had a lot of people praying for me... and that in the future I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers. Forgive me - I'm a Lutheran minister and am used to sharing this way... \"Oh give thanks unto the Lord for He is good and His love endures forever\" (Psalm 106:1). I will pray for your healing and the strength to face whatever faces you in the future. FMG",
