      "Content": "I know when I was dealing with my dad's swollen prostate, the first time they cathed him, it didn't seem too bad for him. I watched the whole process. The cath tapered down at the insertion end. This was an indwelling catheter. They removed it. More complications the same day they removed the catheter landed him with an admittance to the hospital for 3 days. They straight cathed him twice in there. Again I was there. this time the pain was horrible for him. I had noticed that this one was fairly blunt and did not taper down. So before the second cath, I asked the nurse about usung something different and she agreed but did not have one. This one came in a sterilized kit kind of thing. Lidocain was part of it. She did look around saying something about pediatrics but did not produce a better instrument. Just sayin'",

I know PC can end up ugly. Very ugly. 1st hand i have seen its chronic progression. Thankfully I learned from that experience and am able to fend off cancer for now. But dam... I even endured a short cancerous death of my mother. Some of the pain and hardships these people are going through is heart wrenching. I don't know where I'm going with this other than being thankful of the health of me and my family right now. Charlie",

      "Content": "Got myself in a little pickle this evening. I'm 3 weeks into a prostatectomy. I have some incontinence. I have pads and underwear back ups in my main modes of transportation. Well tonight I got a call for help from my aging father. I slipped into a cozy pair of paper underwear and backed it up with a pad. Sucked it up tight with a pair of tighty whities and off my wife and I went. Lucky for us, my dad and I live very close to each other. I ended up taking him to ER (he's OK) with his car and my wife went back home. Well now I have no back-up. I spent 5 hours at the ER (he's still OK) and no back-up urine protection. It wasn't horrible and the hospital probably could have helped me out, but by the time I helped him in and out and up and down and drove here and there I was pretty wet. I threw the liner out at one point and stuffed myself full of toilet paper. By the time I got him home I threw away the wettest pair of disposable underwear I have ever generated. Just sayin... think ahead. Heed a little advise if this is the road your heading down. Dad is 84 and has Alzheimer. Cant get him to eat and maybe he has a bug . Alzheimer, another soulless ruthless beast.",

He is living on borrowed time with or without disease. Just a plain fact. Best of luck on which way to go with the treatment of your father. For me... quality of life would be my main goal. Treat the symptoms and keep their side effects to a minimum. I see no reason to prolong his suffering with ways that may or may not extend his life.",

(It vanished when you updated your signature with your recent 1 year post op PSA) MF Gosh Michael, I didn't think it was that important at this time. Having had the prostate removed I thought I would just consolidate it to one year but ya know, you are correct, all milestones should be reported for all to see. I try to play my situation down a little. Others deserve more scrutiny than my little PC. Thanks for noticing. Happy new year to you too.",

      "Content": "Hello friends, this is a bit off subject but not too far. My family and I have had a rough week with my Dad. In and out of emergency 3 times and the 4th time landing him a ticket to be admitted to a hospital. I myself am 3 weeks into a RALP. I have two questions. Dad has some issues and one is a HUGE prostate. He is 84 years old and has moderate Alzheimer. He has been deteriorating for 6 months. He was 220 lbs 6 months ago and now is 195. Not a huge loss, but effects of anorexia. The third trip to the er was because he could not urinate. They scanned him and threw in a catheter. 800 cc same out before they shut it down for fear of bladder spasm. I wish he could remember the relief. A day before the catheter install they scanned him and said he has an enlarged prostate and a thickened rectum. The initial trip to the er was just pure dehydration. My goodness this post could go on forever so I will just get to my prostate related questions. 1: What can we do for an 84 year old man with a HUGE prostate. Even the urologist ( thank them for getting us in quick) was stunned by the size. Dad is a tuff old bird. 2: I think I'm paying a toll. My sister and I are primary care givers as our \"bonus Mom\" has back issues and cannot physically help. They are so cute together though. They love each other and we love them. Dad and me have been getting him in and out of cars and chairs and beds and yoda yoda yoda for a week now and I feel my incontinence slipping. Is this from the lifting or just not doing my kegels and being tired. As far as Dad is cornered Im sure we will here from the drs but I sure would like some input from you all . Thanks for now as I might not check in for a few days. Hopefully he can watch the Super Bowl at home. Charlie",

As soon as I get all of this jargon and acronyms figured out, I will try and fill out my signature line but for now this is what I have. PSA was 7 back in November 2015 after my first prostate exam found a lump on the prostate by my NEW GP. Annual check-up but a few years too late I believe. Biopsy said cancer with a Gleason of seven 3+4, stage 2 (T2). Had Robotic Nerve-sparing Radical Prostatectomy on Jan 12,2016. Somewhat nerve sparing but very judicious on the left side where the tumor was located. Post-op Gleason- I forget. Positive margins. Nothing in the lymph-nodes. Not sure about the seminal vesicles either. Urologist says the cancer is aggressive and is now T4. I'm not very happy with the Urologist right now because I forgot to bring some disposable underwear for the catheter removal and after asking, they offered very little protection for me themselves, while giving me the pathology results. All I heard was stage 4 and aggressive, wait 3 months and we will check the PSA. Oh ya..\" here is some Cialis.\" \"Have a good evening\", while I'm holding on to my junk trying not to drip on their floor. I think I know what date rape feels like now. I am going to make another appointment with the urologists soon because now there are so many questions. During this whole ordeal I have not showed any signs of prostate problems other than what the DR.'s tell me, like: \"you have a lump\". and \"its cancer\". I feel great today. Sure I dribble NOW and aint had a woody in two weeks, but I feel great. I do have to admit, before all of this, I sometimes did and still do experience pain in my rectum area if I have to hold my bowels from voiding but that was never thought to be a prostate sign, according to me and the internet anyway. I always kind of thought it was hemorrhoids. I should have seen a DR. sooner no doubt about that. It's hard to believe a have stage 4 cancer. Anyway, other than a little venting I do have a question for you all. Do you think waiting 3 months is standard procedure or should I be more aggressive at finding earlier treatment? If you made it this far, thank you for enduring my ramblings. Charlie",

PSA was 7 back in November 2015 after my first prostate exam found a lump on the prostate by my NEW GP. Annual check-up but a few years too late I believe. Biopsy said cancer with a Gleason of seven 3+4, stage 2 (T2). Had Robotic Nerve-sparing Radical Prostatectomy on Jan 12,2016. Somewhat nerve sparing but very judicious on the left side where the tumor was located. Post-op Gleason- I forget. Positive margins. Nothing in the lymph-nodes. Not sure about the seminal vesicles either. Urologist says the cancer is aggressive and is now T4. I'm not very happy with the Urologist right now because I forgot to bring some disposable underwear for the catheter removal and after asking, they offered very little protection for me themselves, while giving me the pathology results. All I heard was stage 4 and aggressive, wait 3 months and we will check the PSA. Oh ya..\" here is some Cialis.\" \"Have a good evening\", while I'm holding on to my junk trying not to drip on their floor. I think I know what date rape feels like now. I am going to make another appointment with the urologists soon because now there are so many questions. During this whole ordeal I have not showed any signs of prostate problems other than what the DR.'s tell me, like: \"you have a lump\". and \"its cancer\". I feel great today. Sure I dribble NOW and aint had a woody in two weeks, but I feel great. I do have to admit, before all of this, I sometimes did and still do experience pain in my rectum area if I have to hold my bowels from voiding but that was never thought to be a prostate sign, according to me and the internet anyway. I always kind of thought it was hemorrhoids. I should have seen a DR. sooner no doubt about that. It's hard to believe a have stage 4 cancer. Anyway, other than a little venting I do have a question for you all. Do you think waiting 3 months is standard procedure or should I be more aggressive at finding earlier treatment? If you made it this far, thank you for enduring my ramblings. Charlie",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DTrom Thanks Jim. It was the doctor that showed me the results. It was 0.05. He explained the test is acurate down to 0.02. I know I'm reacting early. I really don't care anymore but it's driving my family nuts. I feel the same way DTrom, don't really care. Family and friends are over the top freaked out. Maybe someone can lend some psychological explanation for the way we feel. Not in denial but at peace. Not giving up but just want to live as normal as possible. I wish I could get them to see it the same way. For them, I think it is a lack of understanding the cancer. If you are like me, you have done a butt load of research and understand a lot that the family does not understand.They are not willing to do their own research and are frustrated and do not ask or are afraid to ask the right questions. Stay strong Brother, Charlie",
