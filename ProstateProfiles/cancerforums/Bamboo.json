Surgery removed the prostate, seminal vesticles, lymph nodes, etc. Don't remember that they ever told me about a post-surgery Gleason.

If the cancer has returned, and is around the prostate bed, you could be looking at what they call \"salvage radiation,\" which is so-termed because its purpose is to finish the cure that the surgery started. We can tell you more if we have more details. Good luck to you! Chuck",
