      "Content": "Dear Forum I've tried posting this at another forum, but I didn't get much response. If I am posting this in the wrong place please let me know... My father is considering using the Gat Goren Method to treat his enlarged prostate. Has anyone in this forum gone through it? Any advice or experience you could share with me (on or off list) would be much appreciated. Here an article he forwarded me about the treatment: LINK REMOVED AS PER POLICY. PLEASE READ THE RULES FOR NEW POSTERS He went through various other alternative treatments without success. He hasn't been diagnosed with cancer, but the prostate is enlarged and he shows all the symptoms mentioned in the article above. He seems confident in the method mentioned, so I wanted to reach out to you all to make sure he's not making a bad choice... Any help or advice - positive or negative - regarding this method would be much appreciated. Thank you very much! Best regards JJ",
