    "Content": "Hello, Just under three years ago, my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer, the doctors believed it had been developing for up to five years prior to his diagnosis. Since then my father has moved to a large city with a good hospital to help fight the cancer. My father doesn't tell me full details about his condition because he doesn't want me to worry, but I'm concerned the cancer has continued to grow. My father has been on testosterone blockers and has undergone many natural treatments, completely changed his lifestyle to avoid stress and possible exposure to things that may worsen his condition. He's lost a lot of weight and has felt very fit and healthy and getting regular checks, however recent tests show his PSA level is slowly rising despite the hormone blockers and natural treatments, I believe it's currently at 0.6. He's also been experiencing pains around his body, in his joints especially. For now he said its nothing serious but I'm concerned its a sign it's progressing. Since his last test he stopped going back to doctors because they believed he's going downhill and recommended drugs that would cause his teeth to fall out and such (I don't know what drug this was). I have read that signs of progression can be the same or similar symptoms as to what the person may of had when the condition was diagnosed, In this case my father only had a cold which got a bit out of control, it wasn't until his medical was completed that it was discovered. I'm sorry for being so vague, if anyone has questions I will try to answer them as best as I can, I only just got off the phone to him, so I'm a little concerned.",
