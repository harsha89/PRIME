Regaining continence following RRP can be frustrating, i know, I'm there with you. I'm one month post-op today. I think my continence is improving every day, I'm doing the exercises, and started going to the gym doing the treadmill and the elliptical macine... I think walking and exercise helps with the incontinence also. I\"m not completely dry yet, but I've seen improvement.

      "Content": "mtsarpilot, thanks for sharing the info and tips, very helpful, especially since you're 2-3 weeks ahead of me on the calendar post-op. I haven't been to a PT yet on this, been doing te Kegels recommended by my Uro... I've only been doing 2-3 sets per day, I think it will help to increase to at least 5 sets per day. And I'm at 4 weeks post-op today, and I think I'm going to gradually start doing some abs work as you suggested, particularly since you've noticed improvement associated with abs work and general physical activity, like u said, all the abdominal muscles are tied together in the pelvic area. One other poster here had mentioned he saw a lot of improvement just with increase in walking. Like you said, I would agree to caution anyone post RRP to take on any of these activities slowly, not try to rush your recovery, and follow your doctor's advice and guidance. I tried rushing the gym/treadmill work a bit at 2 weeks post-op, on a day I was feeling frisky, and I was pretty sore that night in the lower abdominal area. I'm ready to start stepping up the walking a bit, going to try some longer hikes out on some easy trails, and see where it goes from there. best of luck to you, it sounds like you are well on your way to kicking this disease out of your life! thanks for all the tips too",

      "Content": "Stu, hang in there, I know how stressful all of this is. From my experiences, it's very important for you as the patient to find a urologist that you are comfortable with and have confidence in. You are at the early stages on this process, and most likely it is not cancer at this point. Like others have said here, there are many other causes for a rise in PSA. Over the many years I had dealt with chronic prostatitis, before my cancer diagnosis, I went to 3 or 4 different urologists in my home town. I spent years off and on different antibiotics for chronic prostatitis. I spent hundreds of hours reading online about natural therapies and supplements for prostatitis. I tried almost all the herbal therapies and supplements for prostatitis. Years ago I begged my urologist to just do the surgery and remove the prostate. He couldn't do that, there was no cancer yet. But after 25 years of this journey, my PSA rise finally yielded a Gleason-6 early stage cancer diagnosis, after 3 prostate biopsies over 10 months in 2011. My surgery was 7 months ago, and thank goodness I travelled to Univ of Florida-Shands Medical Center to have the robotic surgery done by Dr. Li-ming Su. My PSA tests have been zero since the surgery, and now 7 months later, I just came home from a 170 mile backpacking trip on the Long Trail in Vermont. I feel like a new person. My point is that you need to find a urologist that you're comfortable with, and the journey may not end with just one urologist. But you need a primary care Uro who you can consult with and can guide you thru the process of prostate care and possible future treatment for whatever condition you are dealing with. Good luck and don't feel rushed, if you need another month or so to find the right doctor, it will be worth it down the road. I think you will find many guys here at this forum who have some great advice and can share their experiences with you. It's a confusing and difficult path for men. Get a copy of Dr. Walsh's book and start educating yourself more on the prostate and different problems that can occur as we get older. let us know how your'e doing!",

I also began investigating nutrional and natural remedies for prostate cancer a year ago when my PSA had risen and I had my first biopsy. You have the right idea. A Gleason 8 cancer will be more aggressive, so you should seek treatment from a good urologist, but also helping yourself thru nutrition cannot hurt and could possibly help slow down growth in the cancer. Research has indicated our \"western\" style diet contributes to a higher incidence rate of prostate cancer than the typical Asian diet. Soy protein is a good idea. Elimination of red meat is good, eat more fish, fruits and vegetables. I've done many internet searches on what research is being done on natural cures for prostate cancer. The turkey-tail mushroom has been shown to kill prostate cancer cells in the laboratory, so I take turkey-tail mushrooom capsules. Other good foods include cooked tomatoes, broccoli, lycopene rich foods such as watermelon, foods high in zinc such as pumpkin seeds, a more asian diet including soy protein, rice, fish. Eliminate processed foods and meats, and dairy products.

      "Content": "newporter- sorry to hear of your friend's passing, very sad. And I agree 110% about PSA testing, it's the only way my cancer was caught so early. My urologist was also very upset about the Task Force recommendations on PSA testing. As said here, there was no urologist on the panel. Personally I think this is a hidden political agenda to \"reduce\" short term health care costs.... very shortsighted. If PSA testing is discontinued for men to detect early stage prostate cancer, it will be a return to the dark ages. I'm telling my friends to go to a urologist and get their PSA tested.",

      "Content": "Happy to report my first PSA post-op is a zero, just found out yesterday. Seems like a long 4 months since surgery in February. Tell the truth, I had put the PSA test out of my mind since the surgery, just concentrating on recovery, doing the Kegels, physical recovery, ED rehab, etc. Then last week I looked at the calendar and went \"oh geez, it's 4 months, time for the first PSA test\"... and I suddenly felt those jitters that so many here must have felt at this time. Yeah, I was trying to put on a brave face and tell myself nothing to be worried about based on the post-op pathology, but i was still nervous. What a relief. Good luck to all you guys here, and thanks for sharing your experiences and knowledge.",

      "Content": "if the back pain hurts when you bend over mainly, it definitely sounds like a muscular-skeletal issue, not prostate cancer. My other guess on your perineal area burning dull ache sounds like prostatitis, probably non-bacterial if antibiotics are not curing it. Your Uro may need to put you on a different regimen of antibiotics, or long term low dose antibiotics. What antibiotic does he have you on now? Your other issues, insomnia, weakness, stomach pain, loss of appetitie, tiredness... could be due to stress, and worrying too much about all this. Have you ever taken anabolic steroids? been a body builder? I experimented briefly with anabolic steroids at age 32, and to this day still regret it, and think it was the root cause of my prostate cancer. After the steroid cycles, about a year later I experienced similar syptoms to what you describe, along with diahrrea and weight loss. To add futher confusion to the matter, I started having back problems from weight lifting. Middle of my back had a swollen disc from doing dead lifts and squats with a poor spotter and I ended up with a partially herniated disc. My immune system had been decimated by the steroids too. I did not know what was going on, and my stress levels went off the meter. Eventually, I ended up seeing several urologists, and spent years on antibiotics for prostatitis, which became chronic prostatitis. And then almost 25 years later, I was diagnosed with Gleason 6 pCA. But I spent 25 years of misery with chronic prostatitis and associated G.I. problems. My advice is get to a good Internist and tell him all your symptoms, and get a battery of tests to find the exact problem.",
