      "Content": "Hi everyone, Been reading through the posts for a while and thought it would be a good time to throw my first post out there. I'm 69 and had been experiencing rising PSA levels for a while. Had a biopsy done at the beginning of October and they told me I had a case of \"non aggressive\" prostate cancer - Gleason score of 6 (3+3). We discussed the various options and I chose removal via Di Vinci robotic surgery. Had that done on Thursday in Seattle and today my abdomen still feels like it was run over by a truck. But I'm trying to walk a little every day and am VERY anxious to get rid of the catheter on Friday. Because I did not want my prostate to be a focus of concern for those around me, I did not tell ANYONE except my wife about the issue. My neighbor called me yesterday to ask if everything was OK, as they hadn't seen me around in a few days, so I know I'm going to have to open up about it soon. Hopefully when I do, I can also tell them that it's all behind me now and I'm OK. Coincidentally, I bought a new Harley about 4 hours before being told I had cancer, so that has been a good mental diversion these past 2-3 months. Can't wait to get better and go riding!",

We discussed the various options and I chose removal via Di Vinci robotic surgery....I'm surprised, but pleased, that your surgery left you with no pain. I took the DiVinci route because it was less invasive, but it's certainly not post-op pain-free....We discussed the various options and I chose removal via Di Vinci robotic surgery. Had that done on Thursday in Seattle and today my abdomen still feels like it was run over by a truck....",
