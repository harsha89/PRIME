      "Content": "I am a 54 year old male and have been very healthy for a good part of my life. I work out frequently and eat like a saint, well most of the time. A couple of years ago I developed a lump in my neck that slowly grew. I was told it was a fatty tumor and not to worry. I pressed to have it removed and it turned out that Papillary Thyroid Cancerous cells had metastasized by the cyst. I had my Thyroid removed last Monday and just found out there were five very small cancerous tumors on it...no bigger than 2mm that had not ruptured the Thyroid capsule. I meet with my Dr. next week for a follow up and am overall feeling pretty good four days after surgery. I am also dealing with high PSA numbers and am going to have a prostrate biopsy next month. My PSA got as high as 9 and has gone back to 7. This is all so sudden and I am feeling like a chapter has definitely closed where one enjoys life with thoughts of health coming up occasionally. Now health worries are front center and all I can think to do is stay positive and know it's treatable. Having a good job and benefits means everything as well, plus being alive in a time when technology allows us to diagnose and treat these conditions. From what I have read, it seems like cases of Thyroid cancer are increasing pointing to over diagnoses and treatment - I'm sure this happens with Prostrate cancer as well. I definitely want to stay proactive with my health but was so sad to lose the Thyroid...perhaps in a few years there will be better ways to cure the cancer while preserving the Thyroid. Hopefully the T4 will allow me to function normally...I'm so worried about weight gain and other shortcomings of life without a Thyroid. The biggest blessing for me is to have a beautiful wife and friend who I've been with for 17 years by my side Not really a question here, just venting I suppose.",

      "Content": "It came out of nowhere. I was just cruising along in life feeling relatively healthy with a great new job and I got diagnosed with Thyroid Cancer (I also found out I have a high PSA count and will get a Prostrate biopsy performed soon). Shift gears! I now have come to realize that the carefree days where keeping myself healthy and fit and thinking my body would just keep going strong to the end has been replaced with an even greater attention to health as my primary concern. A Thyroidectemy and a month later I am feeling pretty good about things. Chiefly because I know things can always be much worse and there are more severe types of cancer one can get, so keeping a good perspective has been vital. Of course like everyone who is diagnosed with cancer, I started scouring the internet and learning everything I could to the extent I read a bit too much of personal accounts of Thyroid Cancer where things didn't go so well for the patient. I even saw a few graphic photos that left my squeamish beyond measure. It would seem one is compelled to write on forums not only for info and support, but also when things aren't going so well. Often when your situation is good life goes on and you don't feel compelled to reach out and write about it. I'll just say the pool of contributors of some forums for my form of cancer seemed to reflect more negative than positive entries. Not here though. With that I wanted to reach out with the hope someone facing recent news about cancer might read this and realize how fortunate they are to be alive in a time when medical advances allow for treatment, as well that case by case situations will vary. So learn everything you can but be wary of what you read. I am two weeks into my low-Iodine diet in preparation for RAI treatment (three-weeks off Thyroid Medication). I read stories about people who could barely get out of bed due to extreme fatigue but I have been able to make it to work every day and do complex computer tasks relating to video encoding. No lack of concentration and business as usual. I do note some fatigue towards the end of the day but think the low-caloric intake comes into play and I usually pep up when I get home and have a snack after work. On most days my wife and I have taken our usual brisk three-mile walk around the Rose Bowl. Some of the personal accounts I read made be think this time was going to be unbearable, but it has been completely normal for the most part. I decided after hearing the news I had cancer that I would deal with it head on, not feel sorry for myself, or ever let it effect the way someone else feels to the degree it would make them sad. This is accomplished by words. Of course I did have to tell people, but I always steered the conversations down courses of positivity and spoke of how treatable my form of cancer is...even tried to find ways to infuse comedy into my words whenever possible and leave things off with a smile. As well I've never forgotten the incredible mind/body connection that steers one's health in so many important ways, so when the mass in my neck was removed along with my Thyroid I immediately started thinking and speaking of my cancer as being an insidious thing of the past. I'm Cancer free! Call this naive, call this the expected over-positive response from someone going through the initial stages of treatment. It is what I choose to believe and while we live of a world of hard facts and logic, I firmly believe there are additional ways to heal oneself that augment the established practical approaches. Good luck to you all whatever you are facing!",
