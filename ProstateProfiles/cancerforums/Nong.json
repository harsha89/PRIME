    "Content": "hello from Thailand, I'm new here. I search for Prostate cancer detail and find this forum is very very knowledgable. there's no such a good forum like this in Thailand. My father (69 yrs old) has a prostate cancer with bone and lymph node metastasis. He was diagnosed that he's had cancer since 2012 with PSA 180. He's started the Hormone Therapy (injection) + have Casodex eversince. The HT worked well, his PSA kept gradually lower (the lowest is about 6-7) But couple years ago, our family had a financial problem so he decided to have the orchiectomy on Mar 2015 and took bicalumide (the PSA then was around 3) His health is normal, and strong. But 6 months ago his PSA kept rising up and up to 6.0 last month. The doctor said that my dad could take the abiraterone, but the cost is very expensive per month, we can't pay for that . So the doctor said that Chemo therapy is another option. For me, I'm quite worried about the Chemo, I'm not sure if he will be ok with it. I found that there's generic abiraterone e.g. Abirapro (Glenmark) or Xbira (Cipla) in Indea. But I'm not really sure about the quality, is it work?? Has anyone ever used it? another question is, I found the Xytica on Onlinewebsite that sell all the generic abiratertone, the price is half price lower than one in Thailand. but I'm not sure if it's the real original Zytica (the Zytica price is double more than generic) Please advise, thank you..",
