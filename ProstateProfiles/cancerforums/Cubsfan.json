      "Content": "I underwent robotic prostatectomy on 8/17. Surgeon was Dr. Alex Gorbonos from Loyola in Chicago. I would recommend him. The surgery went well. I ended up staying 2 nights in the hospital as I was very uncomfortable from an inability to pass gas. Once I was able to do so I headed home. I slept in a chair on the 1st floor of our house for several nights, but by the end of the 1st week I was handling the stairs fine and sleeping in my bed. The catheter was removed 5 days after surgery. Incontinence was an issue, but is steadily improving. I'm using 2 pads during the day and a underpant at night, and the amount of leakage seems to be decreasing almost daily. I planned to return to work a week after the surgery, but decided at the end of the 1st week that that was too aggressive, so I took a second week. I returned to work on the Tuesday after labor day. I went in on a shorter work schedule 5-6 hrs a day because my energy was low, but I feel good enough now to start a full day schedule beginning Monday the 18th. I wish my pathology report was a good as my post-op recovery. The two good things were that they took 21 Lymph nodes out and they were all negative and seminal vesicle invasion was not identified. The bad - Gleason score raised to 9, 4+5, ductal carcinoma approximately 10% of total tissue. They also found small conventional adenocarcinoma, about 1% of tissue with a GS of 6. Perineural invasion, extraprostatic extension, and apical margin involved by carcinoma, staging was identified as pT3a. None of these are good. I'm scheduled to meet with the radiation oncologist on Tuesday. The surgeon indicated that in his opinion, adjuvant radiation should be my next step. He doesn't think HT would be necessary for now. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this, and I'd welcome suggestions about the questions I should be asking. I'm struggling with this, just as my beloved Cubs are in their season, but I'm confident we will both be stronger and better for these struggles. In advance, thank you all.",

Did some limited research on IDC-P last night, Can't say I understand much of it, other than it is bad. What am I looking at? I'm a Chicago area resident and Loyola Hospital is where I'll be treated. Loyola is a teaching hospital and I understand their cancer program is pretty good. Does anyone have information or experience with the hospital that they would like to share? What questions should I be sure to ask the surgeon when I see him today?",

      "Content": "Thanks for the encouragement. The surgeon seems to think that radiation is advised once I'm fully recovered from the surgery. The radiation oncologist feels the research is inconclusive between starting radiation immediately and waiting and monitoring the PSA level. Thankfully I don't have to make the decision right away. Want to see a follow-up PSA score in mid-December. Won't do anything until after the holidays. My recovery has been going well. No discomfort, continence is improving, just stress leakage which I'm working on with Kegels. Dodgers are a good team. Better than we were this year. I trust Theo to make the necessary improvements to get us back in soon. In a way, its a good thing. The NLDS against the Nats was high stress. I don't need more stress in my life right now.",

The surgeon didn't think the Casodex was necessary and suggested 2 years of the Lupron. I opted for both for now,and will evaluate at that 6 month point whether to continue. The way Loyola works it, the surgeon does the prescribing. He agreed with this plan. I got a 3 month shot yesterday and also started the Casodex. Any idea how long before I might start to feel the side-effects? Radiation wnon't start just yet. Haven't heard if I've been accepted in the clinical trial. I'm also waiting to see if the insurer will pay for a PET scan. Normally they won't unless the PSA is higher than my .13. The RO thinks they might because of the Ductal nature of my cancer, the high GS, and the positive margins. We'll see. I'll keep the forum updated.",

      "Content": "If you read some of my earlier posts, you'll see I was recently diagnosed and am trying to decide on a course of treatment. Some of my concerns regarding brachytherapy & ADT involve the bone loss and cognitive issues. The others side effects seem to be unavoidable, but those two seem to be avoidable with estrogen therapy using a patch. I know, the very word estrogen makes us squirm, but let's face it, none of this is easy to contemplate. I'm not suggesting this as a replacement for any of the usual drugs in the cocktail, but as a supplement to avoid some of what I consider serious side effects. I'm wondering if: Does anyone know of any research or trials involving this? If yes, can you supply the links? Anyone has tried this? what were the results? How did you convince your oncologist to prescribe it (since its not a standard part of PCa treatment) As usual, thanks!",

      "Content": "Hi, everyone. Its been a while since I posted. I had my RP last August. Several months post surgery, I was content with my level of urinary control and the very rare leakage I was experiencing. This past Spring, my PSA jumped up. My medical team and I agreed to start a course off radiation along with hormones. 38 radiation sessions, with hormone injections and bicalutamide. The treatments ended a month ago. I tolerated the treatments and the side effects well. lack of energy, hot flashes, but nothing I couldn't handle. My problem is that I'm now experiencing a lot of leakage, drips from simple exertions such as standing up, climbing stairs, etc. I had quit doing Kegels because I felt they weren't necessary any more. I've started them again, but they don't seem to be helping. My Dr. put me on flomax, and that has helped with some urgency issues I was experiencing, but hasn't helped with the leakage. I'm going through 3 pads a day, and am having occasions where I leak through the pads. These are the heavy-duty pads, not the lightweight shields. It is depressing and embarrassing. I would appreciate any help in addressing this problem. Thanks",

Neither does my urologist - the scores surprised him. Only good news so far is that Bone & CT scan (abdomen & Pelvis) were negative Haven't made a decision about Surgery vs. Radiation. Seeing the surgeon tomorrow and the radiologist next week. Will look to schedule in early August (1st, have to go to all 4 days of Lollapalooza with my daughter.) Can use some advice on pros and cons of surgery and radiation. Leaning surgery, because of the opportunity to examine Lymph nodes, but possibility of Lymphedema worries me. On other hand, urologist tells me that with Rad, I'm likely to need ADT, which sounds grim. I'd love to here from you who have gained wisdom the hard way",

      "Content": "I had my surgery on 8/17 so it's too soon to say what my long term satisfaction will be. I opted for surgery because I wanted the knowledge that would come from the post-surgery biopsy. That includes knowing if the tumor had moved outside the capsule, whether the seminal vesicles or lymph nodes were involved. Also, I was told that surgery post-radiation was problematic because of scar tissue from the radiation. The side effects of the hormone therapy used as adjunct to radiation worried me, especially bone loss and possible cognitive issues. I may not be able to avoid them, but I'll be happy to delay them as long as possible. I have a heart condition that resulted in my receiving an implanted defibrillator. The defibrillator was replaced a few months ago but the lead to the heart (circa 2007) was left in. It's not MRI compatible so I wasn't a candidate to have an MRI to place the seeds and aim the beam. I will say the recovery from surgery has been easier than expected. Pain was tolerable, no fever. The biggest problem was gas pains and constipation. As of today, neither is much of a problem. I hope this helps",

Very rarely a small drip when doing some exertion. Only recent issue has been that I apparently aggravated a lumbar disc problem and had a lot of nerve pain in my right leg. 2 cortisone shots in the spine seems to have cleared that up. To everyone here, keep a positive attitude. Life would be a real b**** if you can't stay positive. Cubs will be back in 2018",
