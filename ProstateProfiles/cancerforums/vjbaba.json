      "Content": "Thanks. Yes, the steps recommendation from the uro is to consult with RO and schedule the next PSA test for Jun. He also said that any radiation treatment won't start till the area heals up which could be Jun/ Jul. The next 3 months are going to be tough waiting for the next set of numbers. I guess this is what they call \"Persistent PSA\". And yes, I will fix the signatures!!!",
