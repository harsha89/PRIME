      "Content": "I am a 41 year old male. My psa history is as follows: 07/12-1.27, 12/17-2.90, 1/17-2.40. 2/18-1.90, 2/19-3.50 (Free 0.49) percentage 14%.. My ExoDX Prostate Intelliscore-51.71-2/18. I had an MP-MRI at Johns Hopkins in April 04/18 which showed no lesion, and two areas identified as possible Prostatitis with a PIRADS score of 2. However, my current PSA as of yesterday is 3.5 with a free PSA of 0.49, and a percentage at 14%, is quite concerning for agressive PCA at 41 years of age. I do not have any symptoms indicating a prostate infection. What are the forums thoughts?",
