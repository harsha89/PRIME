      "Content": "Please bear with me---I'm a newbie! My problems are with my PSA readings and probably the prostate itself. 5 years ago PSA readings were very normal (2.0 - 3.7) Then, 4 years ago PSA went up suddenly to 6.64. Repeat test 1 month later was 4.78 and urologist suggested biopsies be taken. On 9/4/09, 12 biopsies were taken---all negative. 10/8/09 PSA was 19.62, on 10/21/09 PSA-11.96, on 1/5/10 PSA-4.15. Throughout 2010 my readings were from 4.11 to 5.55. However because of frequent urination and other problems associated with the prostate, on 1/7/11 my urologist started me on 'Finesteride' (a 5-Alpha reductase inhibitor). The understanding at that time was that from now on ALL my PSA readings would have to be doubled for true value. Further PSA readings were 4.25 (8.50) which urologist was not happy with. On 7/29/11 he took 16 biopsies---all negative again. On 5/1/12, PSA-8.03 (16.06), on 6/25/12, PSA-12.23 (24.46), 9/13/12 PSA-8.85 (17.70). On 10/3/12 my urologist saturated my prostate with 24 biopsies. Once again, all biopsies were negative. Throughout 2013 so far my readings have been in the high 7.60 (15.+), to the high 8.82 (17.+). I'm just about at wits-end here. And so is my urologist. I'm do for a visit with him next week. On my last visit he suggested that he may to refer me to a university hospital to see why my PSA is so elevated. Anyone else out there ever have a problem like this, or know of anyone who has? Boy, any insight or information on this would be soooooo helpful. Thanks much for putting up with my history lesson.",

      "Content": "Big thanks guys, (newporter & Highlander). My apologies for insufficient information. My age-74 yrs, 11 mo. And yes my doctor says I definitely have BPH, (diagnosed in 2009). I was having some real problems with frequent urination, etc., but with first tamsolosin in 2009, and then finasteride in 2011, these medications have been controlling the urination problem. My doctor also suggested maybe going off the finasteride for a while at my last visit, but I declined because I have been so pleased with my problem, or lack of. I now sleep ALL night, without having to 'get up'. However with my next visit with him tomorrow, I will bring up the finasteride controversy that you spoke of (newporter) in your post. I will admit however that the combination of these two medications have all but destroyed what little sex life I had! I've had recent MRI's and most recently a complete bone scan to rule out any cancer, all showed negative. BUT the problems still remain! PSA readings in the high teens and low twenties have me worried to a frazzle. Maybe I'm making too much out of the readings, I don't know! That's why I joined the forum, hoping someone else with a similar problem could give me some information, ideas, knowledge, anything? Again, thanks guys. Any/all information is really appreciated",
