B I get a three month shot of Lupron and before I was on a daily pill Casadex. I became castrate resistant and they kept me on the shot of Lupron and 4 pills of Zytiga at one time each day.",

They have added Zytiga with the Lupron and I have been doing that for about three weeks. There are days that I am exhausted and times that I have to vomit along with loss of appetite. Anyone with experience with this situation and can shed a little light on how I am feeling? Thank you, Erickpaul",

After 3 weeks they told me to stop taking the Zytiga because my blood work was indicating the loss of kidney and liver functions. I know my pain will be coming back but I don't know what options are going to out there for me. Anyone know where this goes? Thank you.",
