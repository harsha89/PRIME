      "Content": "Last post was about suspicious spot on pelvis. Had bone biopsy and result was not prostate related. So it was back to the schedule. Had cystoscopy and everything looked good. Next to hospital for pre surgical testing. Now I am finishing the last of medical clearances. Surgery on the 13th. Hope for the best. On another note, I gave blood and urine to be analyzed for DNA markers for liquid biopsy research. They wanted samples from someone who was diagnosed with prostate cancer before treatment. They said they would follow my PSA for one year. I figured if I could help someone in the future I would be more than willing. Also, talking to research nurse about how many people were needed for the trial she said 300. She told me they had no trouble finding that amount just in my area. After hearing this it then hit home how widespread this cancer is.",

The Doctor gave me a numbing shot at that location and one minute later it was done. This doctor was top notch. After they took me to a room for one hour observation and I went home. No soreness at all that day or the next.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi BH! Sorry you are in \"The Dreaded Wait Mode\" and hoping it turns out to be nothing. Many have had \"suspicious\" pelvic findings on scans that turned out non pathologic. Did your PSA jump from 4.4 to 10 in 1 month or was it Jan '15 to Feb'16? Metastatic PC would likely present with a higher PSA. Did the CT scan include your prostate gland? If so, what are the unusual findings? Stay optimistic and keep us updated - with some good news!!! MF Michael F, PSA went up in one month. I didn`t think to ask about CT scan whether it showed prostate. I meet with my URO this week, so I will have to remember to ask him.",

      "Content": "It has been a while since last post. Previously I stated that the bone scan showed a spot on my pelvis. My Urologist conferred with head of pathology and radiology and they said it looked suspicious and suggested a PET Scan. My insurance denied scan saying it was not medically necessary. They agreed to a CAT scan and I had this done May 5. After review of CAT scan, the hot spot showed up at same area. On May 19 I had a needle biopsy and now wait for the results. Radiology Doc told me it may just be an arthritic lesion due to age and wear and tear. Right now I am hoping it has nothing to do with prostate.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone. New to forum. Recently received Prostate biopsy results and would like some input. Meeting with Urologist on March 8 to discuss options. I know you guys have been there. 1. Prostate, rught base; biopsy - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4= 7 ( grade group 2), present in 2 of 2 cores and involving approximately 10% of each core. - Perineural invasion present. 2. Prostate, right mid; biopsy -Benign prostate tissue with focal acute inflammation. 3. Prostate, right apex; biopsy - Benign prostate tissue. 4. Prostate, left base; biopsy - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7 ( Grade group 3), present in 2 of 2 cores and discontinually involving approximately 80% and 90% of each core. - Perineural invasion present. 5. Prostate, left mid; biopsy - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7(grade group 3), present in 2 of 2 cores and discontinuously involving approximately 80% and 90% of each core. - Perineural invasion present. 6. Prostate,left apex; biopsy - Very small foci of prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (grade group 1), present in 1 of 2 cores and discontinuously involving approximately 30% of the core. - No perineural invasion seen. Note: Immunostains for Pin4 ( high molecular weight cytokeratin, p63 and P504S are performed on blocks A and C, with appropriate controls. The diagnosis of carcinoma is supported by the failure of immunoperoxidase staining for high molecular weight cytkeratin and p63 to demonstrate basal cells in the atypical glands. Also favoring the diagnosis of cancer is that stains for RACEMASE are positive.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone. New to forum. Recently received Prostate biopsy results and would like some input. Meeting with Urologist on March 8 to discuss options. I know you guys have been there. 1. Prostate, rught base; biopsy - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4= 7 ( grade group 2), present in 2 of 2 cores and involving approximately 10% of each core. - Perineural invasion present. 2. Prostate, right mid; biopsy -Benign prostate tissue with focal acute inflammation. 3. Prostate, right apex; biopsy - Benign prostate tissue. 4. Prostate, left base; biopsy - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7 ( Grade group 3), present in 2 of 2 cores and discontinually involving approximately 80% and 90% of each core. - Perineural invasion present. 5. Prostate, left mid; biopsy - Prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 4+3=7(grade group 3), present in 2 of 2 cores and discontinuously involving approximately 80% and 90% of each core. - Perineural invasion present. 6. Prostate,left apex; biopsy - Very small foci of prostate adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+3=6 (grade group 1), present in 1 of 2 cores and discontinuously involving approximately 30% of the core. - No perineural invasion seen. Note: Immunostains for Pin4 ( high molecular weight cytokeratin, p63 and P504S are performed on blocks A and C, with appropriate controls. The diagnosis of carcinoma is supported by the failure of immunoperoxidase staining for high molecular weight cytkeratin and p63 to demonstrate basal cells in the atypical glands. Also favoring the diagnosis of cancer is that stains for RACEMASE are positive.",

Ended up in emergency room and then readmitted. NG tube inserted to try to unblock digestive system. It didn`t work, had open exploratory surgery on June 23 to find blockage. Small intestine blocked and massive amount of scar tissue causing problems. Scar tissue from previous hernia operation and previous appendectomy made for a lot of problems. At home slowly recovering and trying to regain bladder control.",
