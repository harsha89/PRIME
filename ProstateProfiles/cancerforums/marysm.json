      "Content": "Hello everyone, Just wanted to share that Kevin is doing really well. He returned to work last Monday the 14th. A week early with the Dr's approval his surgery was 11/10. Today was his 6 week check up and happy to say PSA level is ZERO!!!! This is the club we want to be in. Kevin has had a very nice recovery once the catheter came out. He has done a lot of walking some days up t 4 miles a day. He is a runner by nature, Dr. feels that this has helped get him further along in recovery. Not everyone can walk that much, but do what you can walking does help. I think, I posted this, but his Gleason sore was upgraded to 7 with prostate 40% cancer. I don't have the full report in front of me. The Dr. was very happy he decided to have it out ASAP as he said it was more aggressive then first thought. It was very close to breaking through the wall into the bladder. I understand some people need time to think things out, but somethings need to be done right away. The biopsy first said non-aggressive Gleason 6 and that he had LOTS of time to think about what he wanted to do. We didn't have lots of time. I do believe Kevin said \"Get it the F out of me\". Of course, we didn't know Kevin had PCa, but this now answers lots of questions we had. Over the last year, he has been exhausted to the point of sleeping all weekend long. Also, sleeping in his car on his lunch hour everyday. He got to the point were he didn't want to go anywhere just sleep. He's a very easy going guy, but his mood was awful. He blamed his 1 hour drive to work and his job. I am happy to report his energy level is back to normal and the cranky ass mood is gone. Thankfully!!! Thank you for all the good thoughts and concern. Happy Holiday to all...",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Congrats on the \"ZERO\" club. A wonderful xmas gift!! Noticed that your husband had surgery less than 4 weeks from his biopsy? Is that correct? My surgeon would not touch me for 6-8 weeks after the biopsy. Told me I had to heal. Oh well. Glad it worked out well for u and your husband. Many more Zero's your way. MM Yes,just a few days from 4 weeks out. It may have been you that questioned us on that. We did double check with the Dr and he was fine with the time. Again, he agreed the healing time is required. I guess every Dr. has a different thought process on it. If it were any less then what we had he wouldn't have done it. Not knowing about the time frame glad it's done as he's next opening was in Feb 2016.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Congrats on the \"ZERO\" club. A wonderful xmas gift!! Noticed that your husband had surgery less than 4 weeks from his biopsy? Is that correct? My surgeon would not touch me for 6-8 weeks after the biopsy. Told me I had to heal. Oh well. Glad it worked out well for u and your husband. Many more Zero's your way. MM Yes,just a few days from 4 weeks out. It may have been you that questioned us on that. We did double check with the Dr and he was fine with the time. Again, he agreed the healing time is required. I guess every Dr. has a different thought process on it. If it were any less then what we had he wouldn't have done it. Not knowing about the time frame glad it's done as he's next opening was in Feb 2016.",

Did he begin getting tested at 45, or were these his first tests? But yes, a PSA level of 6.9 is high, particularly for his age.

A couple of points: - 48 is young but you have taken very wise action to rule out (or in) PCa. - PCa typically has no symptoms until it is more advanced - IF PCa is present, consider yourselves fortunate as it will likely have been detected early and there will be multiple treatment options that can result in a complete cure. - PSA = 6.9 is high and must be investigated to determine the cause(s). Eventhough the DRE was normal, has there been any recent history of BPH or prostatitis? - The PSA is the same 4 months apart. This suggests that it is not actively rising which is encouraging news.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Ron_G Hi marysm, and welcome. 48 is on the young side to have PCa (not saying he does) but with his father having had the disease, that gives him a 1st degree relative who had it which increases his chances. I'm assuming this risk was known already since your hubby was having his PSA tested at <50 years old, which is the normal beginning testing age unless there's a family history--which there is in his case. Did he begin getting tested at 45, or were these his first tests? But yes, a PSA level of 6.9 is high, particularly for his age. However, there are other things that can affect PSA levels besides cancer. Did his doc prescribe any antibiotic to rule out any prostatitis? Any prostate enlargement noticed on the ultrasound? I would encourage you to read around this forum. Lots of useful info is sure to be found and feel free to ask away. Can you provide us your location? It may be helpful as you begin to have more questions. You can go into 'settings' and edit your profile and your location will display with your user name if you'd like. Thanks- I'll check out the setting on this page. His new Dr. tested him due to family history this was his first test. Prostate size was said to be normal with no other issues other then the 6.9. No antibiotic, went right to the biopsy after the 2nd blood test. I've been reading and getting lots of great information. Thank you",

We couldn't be happy. He was coming home from the hospital last night but Dr. wanted to keep the drain in one more day. It was stay or go home with the drain so he stayed. I am just waiting to pick him up today. He's really done well and not had a lot of pain. Of course, hospital stay aren't that comfortable, he feels he's doing pretty well. Hasn't had a BM but lots of gas which he's happy with. After surgery in recovery he got an erection he and the Dr. had a good laugh about that. Is that a good sign.. Who knows but he doing well and we are very grateful. Just got the call to pick him up. Thanks again for all the support.",

We couldn't be happy. He was coming home from the hospital last night but Dr. wanted to keep the drain in one more day. It was stay or go home with the drain so he stayed. I am just waiting to pick him up today. He's really done well and not had a lot of pain. Of course, hospital stay aren't that comfortable, he feels he's doing pretty well. Hasn't had a BM but lots of gas which he's happy with. After surgery in recovery he got an erection he and the Dr. had a good laugh about that. Is that a good sign.. Who knows but he doing well and we are very grateful. Just got the call to pick him up. Thanks again for all the support.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sky365 Hi - This has been one wild ride. Gleason Score of 4+3=7 led to a Radical Prostatectomy sparing 1 nerve. Post op internal urine leaking visible through cystogram and felt like unbelievable labor cramps 3-4 times per day. Catheter remained in place for 31 long days. I felt hopeless on several occasions but my wife dragged me on. Constipation (should be written in capital letters) beyond description. Had my first post op PSA at >0.05. This came with no explanation and was perceived by me as not being zero and therefore, more bad news. Fortunately my Urologist was available and explained that this is goodness... At 66 days, I leak when i stand, cough, sneeze, clear my throat, and laugh. Doing my exercises but no progress. Thinking of buying Tena stock... Despite sparing 1 nerve, there is no erection. Insurance refuses 5mg daily Cialis but approves 2.5mg despite price being the same. No effect whatsoever... Whoda thunk at 54, no sex and wearing panty liners. Hopeful but not too confident. I could live with the incontinence if only the ED could be solved. Having a wife 18 years younger than me used to be a thrilling thing. Good luck to you all, Dan Sorry to hear this at 66 days out. My husband is scheduled for surgery 11/10 he's only 48. Try and stay positive and hope things get better for you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sky365 Hi - This has been one wild ride. Gleason Score of 4+3=7 led to a Radical Prostatectomy sparing 1 nerve. Post op internal urine leaking visible through cystogram and felt like unbelievable labor cramps 3-4 times per day. Catheter remained in place for 31 long days. I felt hopeless on several occasions but my wife dragged me on. Constipation (should be written in capital letters) beyond description. Had my first post op PSA at >0.05. This came with no explanation and was perceived by me as not being zero and therefore, more bad news. Fortunately my Urologist was available and explained that this is goodness... At 66 days, I leak when i stand, cough, sneeze, clear my throat, and laugh. Doing my exercises but no progress. Thinking of buying Tena stock... Despite sparing 1 nerve, there is no erection. Insurance refuses 5mg daily Cialis but approves 2.5mg despite price being the same. No effect whatsoever... Whoda thunk at 54, no sex and wearing panty liners. Hopeful but not too confident. I could live with the incontinence if only the ED could be solved. Having a wife 18 years younger than me used to be a thrilling thing. Good luck to you all, Dan Sorry to hear this at 66 days out. My husband is scheduled for surgery 11/10 he's only 48. Try and stay positive and hope things get better for you.",
