      "Content": "Thank you Chuck. You did provide tons of valuable information. The medicine that my dad is on right now, dutas-t, has dutasteride which is also the primary component of Avodart. We are certainly going to get a biopsy done once we get back the results of his latest Total/Free PSA test. However, I am concerned that since he was not put on antibiotics, effects of Prostatitis, if any, wouldn't be addressed in this report. Also, despite his high grade prostate enlargement, my dad doesn't have any concerning urinary symptom like frequent urination or difficulty urinating. I am trying to find the best medical facility to handle prostate issues in India. With PCa not being as common in India, it is very difficult to find specialists and latest technologies/medicines to thoroughly address PCa and other prostate related issues. By the way, have people seen such jump (from 2.5 to 9) in PSA in two years? Does it typically mean bad news when combined with almost 3x enlarged prostate?",

      "Content": "Thank you everyone for all the information. 5 weeks after his last PSA test when his PSA was 9.2, my dad got another round of Total/Free PSA test done. This time the results were: Total PSA: 2.29, Free PSA percent: 19%. He has been on dutasteride since his last PSA test 5 weeks ago. While he is going to speak with his Urologist tomorrow, meanwhile I am trying to figure out whether he should stay put and get a repeat PSA in 4 weeks or go see his Urologist now? He lives in a city on the other end of the country from where his Urologist is located in India. Any suggestion or advice based on these new numbers would be much appreciated. Regards!",

      "Content": "My dad, who is 63 yrs. old and lives in India, was recently diagnosed with high PSA at 9 and high grade BPH. DRE report said no hardness, nodules or lumps felt. His prostate is enlarged at 90 grams. Doctor has prescribed him dutas-t which is dutasteride and tamsulosin with repeat Total/Free PSA test in a month. Since his PSA was 2.53 in last exam 2 years ago (no DRE done at that time), I am very concerned about this rapid rise. Is it normal for someone to have such high PSA levels and velocity just from BPH? Should he immediately get a biopsy done? Does it make sense to ask his urologist for a round of antibiotics before next PSA test? Any advise or information would be much appreciated. Thanks!",
