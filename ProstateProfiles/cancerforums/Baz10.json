My hospital (Queen Alexandra at Portsmouth) have just introduced a new procedure which I found interesting. Their new software programme allows them to overlay the T3 MRI results over the real time ultrasound during the biopsy so there is no guesswork as they can now specifically target the location (s) of interest identified by the T3 MRI scan. This was the first day they have used this technique during during a template biopsy. So I had both targetted as well as saturation with 42 cores taken. The URO wanted to do both so that with the aid of the new software he had a complete map of my prostate, explaining this would provide them with a complete picture. All in all no where near as bad as I imagined, again it was a general anaesthic so knew nothing. Whole procedure took 50 minutes with only slight bleeding and after two pees urine is completely clear. Results in 3 weeks. Barry",

My hospital (Queen Alexandra at Portsmouth) have just introduced a new procedure which I found interesting. Their new software programme allows them to overlay the T3 MRI results over the real time ultrasound during the biopsy so there is no guesswork as they can now specifically target the location (s) of interest identified by the T3 MRI scan. This was the first day they have used this technique during during a template biopsy. So I had both targetted as well as saturation with 42 cores taken. The URO wanted to do both so that with the aid of the new software he had a complete map of my prostate, explaining this would provide them with a complete picture. All in all no where near as bad as I imagined, again it was a general anaesthic so knew nothing. Whole procedure took 50 minutes with only slight bleeding and after two pees urine is completely clear. Results in 3 weeks. Barry",

      "Content": "My two pennies worth. I was diagnosed Gleason 6 back in April after a fusion 32 core biopsy. i discussed options with my Uro, all options were offerred including radical prostactemy and after a long discussion we agreed AS was the best option at the time. I am on 3 monthly PSA testing and IF nothing changes a further fusion biopsy again in April next year. I was offerred a second opinion should I wish, but my guy according to my GP's is the very best and as the slides are not reviewed by him but a team my mind is at ease. I admit I am more than comfortable with the AS regime as I have wonderful GP's and a very proactive Urology Department at my hospital. Im not suggesting my attitude will suit all but, so far it has worked for me and I thankfully don't have anxiety issues. In fact I'm so comfortable with it that we are definately skiing again in January. As my Uro Mr.Lemke Solomon jokingly said, I wouldn't dare interfere with your plans to get on your ski's again. That works for me. Good luck with whatever option you choose, it's as always a difficult decision, yet in the UK as we have our National Health Service money or insurance is not a consideration.

      "Content": "Thanks guys, I knew I would get the best knowledge and advice available. Mikla, Several days between the DRE and the test. I understand 5.1 is on the low reference end of the scale, but since I didn't have a PSA in 2010 or 2011 due to the other major surgeries, this is the 1st. Doctor used this 5.1 value as a base reference and wants a bone and PSA test this time around. So I need to arrange these in the next few days. As far as possible infection 4 weeks ago they put me on Doxycycline as I had painfully enlarged Inguinal lymph nodes and they wanted to rule out any infection. They then put me on Amoxcillin 1500 mg day as a chaser to again knock out possible infection but this was for those lymph nodes. What is concerning me is that in the last several weeks I got a definate CRC recurrence which was then retracted it was \"now\" a constriction at the colon join OR adhesions. Then the painful lymph nodes erupted with no diagnosis. Then the pain between the legs horrendous on one occasion, then pelvic pain and after a further week a dull ache both side i elbow rib cage both sides so they speculated it may be kidneys. Obviously there are some mixed message symptoms going on which also may be baffling them. I'm not panicking at all, I just need to know answers as to what is going on and a heads up from you guys on what to look out for and what questions I should put to my docs. This is why these forums are so important, so many knowledgeable people and experience one can't put a value on. Thanks again Baz",

      "Content": "Firstly a explanation. I know the ins and outs of Colorectal Cancer, but I'm a complete novice at this prostate stuff. Have been having more than a few problems lately, they thought I had a CRC recurrence then dismissed it, then brought it back as a possibility. Then enlarged Inguinal lymph nodes which are still under investigation so the jury's out on this until,after a MRI then an ultrasound on the 6th and 12 th May. Meanwhile I started getting pains between my legs with a ache around my pelvis and lower back in the area of both kidneys. Have had 3 DRE's in the last 2 weeks, on all occasions the findings were normal with no lumps or bumps or irregularities. 2009 my PSA was < 2 I missed 2010 and 2011 2012 < 3 2013 < 4 2014 5.1 MY GP decided that as I hadn't had a PSA in the last 2 years it would be a good thing. Heyho he called this afternoon at 3.30 to say my PSA was elevated at 5.1 which for my age 69 put me in the investigation envelope. No problem with urination, no problem with start up or stream but a few run offs when stopping. They have a planned MRI of my lower back on 6th and because of the enlarged lymph nodes a ultrasound of the groin and pelvis on 12th May. I'm not jumping to PC at this stage, but do need a heads up on what are the key indicators and what should I be looking out for. Sounds daft I know but as a Supermod on the CRC forum,I've come to the one place where I know there is a wealth of Prostate knowledge. Question at 69 years old does 5.1 ring alarm bells with you guys. And What should I be looking out for and what questions should I fire at my GP. As I said if it was CRC I could answer my own questions but the possibility of PC is a new thing for me. Thanks guys for any input you can give. Barry",

Been through the typical AS regime for the last 32 months having had a T3 MRI, a saturated biopsy of plus 30 cores. 18 month follow up TRUS of 14 cores which except for 1 which showed marginal score of 4. All the remainder 3+3 so I'm both relaxed with continuing AS. the key wording from the URO was It will not shorten your life. Good luck Barry",

      "Content": "Being a relative newbie myself to prostate cancer after having colon cancer, the only difference between yourself and me is 12.9% one core mine being 5%. Similar prostate size at double, yet after lengthy discussions with my eminent urologist we both agreed active surveillance was the way to go. After 31 months a further biopsy confirmed a borderline 4 in one core (3+4 ish) to continue with AS. The key phrase used was \"it will most definitely not shorten you're life\". So rather than rush in with any of the interventions, surgery, radiotherapy, seeds, HT we jointly elected to continue AS with 3 monthly PSA testing. After a number of major surgeries you can imagine I am more than keen to avoid any further unless absolutely essential. Overall it doesn't materially bother me, although I'm not normally given to anxiety anyway, I don't think about it, it doesn't as yet interfere with my life too much and I'm certainly not obsessed by it. My forum bretheren may disagree as they are far more experienced than myself with PCa yet I am most comfortable with AS and would in my humble opinion suggest anyone in a similar situation to carefully consider all options rather than rush into a surgical or invasive intervention, unless it is absolutely necessary. it all comes down to what the specialists advise and whether one is comfortable with their advice in particular how the diagnosis is accepted by the patient. Good luck and I'm sure you will get numerous responses from our experts once your post is picked up. Barry",

      "Content": "From a newbie to this forum at least. I had a rising PSA from 5.2 to 7.2 in 6 months, then did a T3 MRI which showed a area of concern. even though I was dreading the thoughts of a biopsy I had a template biopsy, 32 core samples taken under a general anaesthetic which has proved canver. The procedure went like a dream with few effects and only mild soreness. Now I'm waiting until July 1st to see what they are going to do. my two pennies worth is Go have the T3 MRI and if that shows anything have the fusion biopsy as the others have suggested. They are far wiser than I and have given me some excellent advice and support. Bite the bullet and have it done. Good luck Barry",

I had a rising PSA from 5.2 to 7.2 in 6 months, then did a T3 MRI which showed a area of concern. even though I was dreading the thoughts of a biopsy I had a template biopsy, 32 core samples taken under a general anaesthetic which has proved canver. The procedure went like a dream with few effects and only mild soreness. Now I'm waiting until July 1st to see what they are going to do. my two pennies worth is Go have the T3 MRI and if that shows anything have the fusion biopsy as the others have suggested. They are far wiser than I and have given me some excellent advice and support. Bite the bullet and have it done. Good luck Barry",

And I\u2019m considerably older than yourself which may explain why my readings Latest being 8.2 that was 6 months previously. I to have had MRIs and both a Fusion 32 if I recall correctly guided biopsy and 6 months ago a TRUS biopsy from which they regraded from 3+3 to 3+ marginal 4 But was officially told this would not shorten my life and continue with AS. Not being the worrying type I am relaxed and comfortable being on AS protocol, but recently (last couple months) have been experiencing more symptoms of either BPH or PCa symptoms, nothing major just an advancement as I would call them. Allthough Having beencatheterised due to another unrelated surgical complication 2 months ago it could be due to the catheter at least I\u2019m hoping. I add the above not as a life story but to emphasise that as my eminent urologist says he thinks to many menfolk rush into radical treatment to early due to both external pressure as well as internal pressures (I can\u2019t live with PCa ). No doubt I shall have another MRI and possibly interervention IF that is warranted or I decide to take the radical course which I must admit I doubt I shall. My suggestion and that\u2019s all it can be is see what the latest MRI shows and after serious deliberation and in discussion with Your URO go with what is recommended and you are comfortable with.

      "Content": "Philbo, I echo Littalex in welcoming you even though I'm on the CRC forum. Enjoyed in part reading your post regarding the wonderful times you had with your good lady countered by reading your in the fourth round of your cancer battle. She sounded to be a truly adventurous and inspiring person, you so blessed to have these memories. Yes, it's amazing how so called friends evaporate during hard and sorrowful times, I've never figured out just why they vanish and I learned not to question their motives. Some that I thought acquaintances stepped up to the plate with immense support and a truly caring attitude. Those that walked away, some ran, now I don't even think about and have no need to forgive, just forget. yes, constant pain alters ones perspective and it is natural to curse and swear and be short tempered, yet you seem to rise to the surface again and regain a positive attitude. Keep up the positives. Best wishes in this long, frustrating journey. Barry",

      "Content": "Being a relative newbie myself to prostate cancer after having colon cancer, the only difference between yourself and me is 12.9% one core mine being 5%. Similar prostate size at double, yet after lengthy discussions with my eminent urologist we both agreed active surveillance was the way to go. After 31 months a further biopsy confirmed a borderline 4 in one core (3+4 ish) to continue with AS. The key phrase used was \"it will most definitely not shorten you're life\". So rather than rush in with any of the interventions, surgery, radiotherapy, seeds, HT we jointly elected to continue AS with 3 monthly PSA testing. After a number of major surgeries you can imagine I am more than keen to avoid any further unless absolutely essential. Overall it doesn't materially bother me, although I'm not normally given to anxiety anyway, I don't think about it, it doesn't as yet interfere with my life too much and I'm certainly not obsessed by it. My forum bretheren may disagree as they are far more experienced than myself with PCa yet I am most comfortable with AS and would in my humble opinion suggest anyone in a similar situation to carefully consider all options rather than rush into a surgical or invasive intervention, unless it is absolutely necessary. it all comes down to what the specialists advise and whether one is comfortable with their advice in particular how the diagnosis is accepted by the patient. Good luck and I'm sure you will get numerous responses from our experts once your post is picked up. Barry",

      "Content": "Joe, I missed the NOT Normally out of the opening line. I am very serious,what you stated is normal. We don't and can't diagnose you, only a doctor can. You've had a urine test, so I assume that has ruled out a bladder infection. Most men get a burning sensation during urination at some time in their lives, mostly it's dietary related, unless an infection is present. Had you just stated that you had strange sensations permanently in your penis, that's a different matter. But you decided at first to state the obvious, when you drink a lot you pee a lot. How on earth do you expect anyone of us on here to take you seriously when you make such statements. At 22 years old the chances of you having prostate cancer is more than unlikely. As your GP said it could be a multitude of different things totally unrelated to cancer. urine test is not a test for prostate cancer apart from identifying if the are traces of blood in the urine, as it was you say clear, then thats ruled out. The test you may have heard of is a PSA test which is the histology of a blood sample. Seriously, at your age stop thinking you may have prostate cancer. I'm sorry but this is not the place you need to be right now. Address your questions to your GP as she is the only person that can give you a diagnosis. It could be something as simple as a yeast infection. My previous response still stands. Good luck with your GP, I hope you don't tell her in the same way you posted your original as you may just get the same response, a knowing smile and close the door on the way out.",

Your GP (so it seems your in the UK) has done a urine test, which is clear. When you have a diagnosis of cancer, please come back and we will take you seriously, until then I suggest you cut down the alcohol. Drink more, pee more, drink, less pee less.

This is a serious forum to provide help and support to cancer sufferers, carers and loved ones. So where do you think you fit into this forum, after stating what you did, you can't go more than 30 minutes if your constantly drinking. Your GP (so it seems your in the UK) has done a urine test, which is clear. When you have a diagnosis of cancer, please come back and we will take you seriously, until then I suggest you cut down the alcohol. Drink more, pee more, drink, less pee less. Until then find a pub you can ask sensible questions in, I'll guarantee that anyone in the pub will give you the same advice.",

      "Content": "Joe, I missed the NOT Normally out of the opening line. I am very serious,what you stated is normal. We don't and can't diagnose you, only a doctor can. You've had a urine test, so I assume that has ruled out a bladder infection. Most men get a burning sensation during urination at some time in their lives, mostly it's dietary related, unless an infection is present. Had you just stated that you had strange sensations permanently in your penis, that's a different matter. But you decided at first to state the obvious, when you drink a lot you pee a lot. How on earth do you expect anyone of us on here to take you seriously when you make such statements. At 22 years old the chances of you having prostate cancer is more than unlikely. As your GP said it could be a multitude of different things totally unrelated to cancer. urine test is not a test for prostate cancer apart from identifying if the are traces of blood in the urine, as it was you say clear, then thats ruled out. The test you may have heard of is a PSA test which is the histology of a blood sample. Seriously, at your age stop thinking you may have prostate cancer. I'm sorry but this is not the place you need to be right now. Address your questions to your GP as she is the only person that can give you a diagnosis. It could be something as simple as a yeast infection. My previous response still stands. Good luck with your GP, I hope you don't tell her in the same way you posted your original as you may just get the same response, a knowing smile and close the door on the way out.",

Indeed they gave me all the options you've been given but added how did I feel about AS. Talking things over with the consultant we both agreed AS was the way to go, a decision I'm very comfortable with to be honest until and unless my PSA rises for which I just had routine PSA test last week and awaiting the results. Being a relative newbie at PCa my forum colleague Chuck gave as well as others gave me great and factual advice which I was pleased to take and surprisingly my forum friends were absolutely correct. Quite reassuring to know that we have such in depth real experience on this forum from people that Know. Barry",

      "Content": "It is under NHS Choices where any UK citizen can request their GP to make a referral to the Hopsital of the patients choice, irrespective of location. A word of caution though. I don't know where you are located, but every region has a specialist centre and if that unit can provide treatment in accordance with national standards as per NICE guidelines then a referral to The Royal Marsden or another specialist centre such as Christies may be difficult to get. Anyway your regional centre could well undertake treatment with the support of TRM (Royal Marsden) Where I live my local hospital (Portsmouth) QAH has one of the few Da Vinci robotic units in the UK as well as the surgeons to operate it. Jim Khan, Amjad Parvaiz are the two leaders in robotic prostate surgery as well as about 8 other consultants. May be worth asking your GP on your options. Barry",

      "Content": "Interesting, i must be on the reverse side of this study. Ciprofloxacin 3 days priorto my TRUS resulted in 3 days post TRUS being blue lighted into hospital with major sepsis. 4 days later using a combo of antibiotics it cleared and discharged home. Several months later a VATS Wedge resulted after 3 days being rushed into ICU with yet again Sepsis and acute kidney failure then 3 days in HDU. This time treated with IV Augmentin at what dosage I have no idea and post discharge with 3 weeks tablets of Augmentin at a dosage of 1875 mg day. Im starting to consider whether the first post TRUS sepsis actually cleared my system or whether it is just me. Yet to be hit twice inside 5 months seems to be a little to coincidental unless there are hidden factors I\u2019m unaware of. Albeit a interesting study, yet I\u2019m decidedly concerned as I have another Urology appointment on the 13th of January and IF the consultant recommends another biopsy I shall be taking the high road very quickly. Answer will be a unqualified and resounding NO. Barry",

      "Content": "Yes, certainly the UK is the same as Canada. Doctors are not allowed to openly advertise along with consultants. Privately specialist consultants are named on private hospitals surgeons lists together with their speciality and resume. Interestingly consultant surgeons including oncologists are restricted as to what fees they can charge. In my case circa 2010 for a radical hemicolectomy the surgeons bill came to 741 UK pounds for a 5 hr 30 minute operation, consultant anaesthetist charged 450 the remaining 12,000 or so was for the private hospital for 4 days stay. Surgeons charges are set under a BUPA payment scale agreement which most are signed up to. There are I Beleive incentives paid to GP's to favour certain products but as the NHS is tightening its belt more and more generic medicines are being prescribed and given by the pharmacies. Barry",

Normally Cipro and Flomax is a 2 month course as a UTI infection is notoriously difficult to treat, hence the length od the antibiotic course and they do a further PSA at week 7 or after finishing the antibiotics. after 7 weeks on Cipro and Flomax my PSA was exactly the same at 5.10. I have a further PSA at 6 months. My urologist did say that I quote '' with a enlarged prostate and your PSA level I am not overly worried. However if your prostate was normal size with a PSA of 5.10 I would be concerned''. Yet the only accurate way to diagnose is a needle biopsy as PSA can be affected by many factors other than PC. Just don't miss your appointment is my advice. best of luck Barry",

      "Content": "Robert, Sorry to hear this news and hope your fortunes turn around quickly. My understanding, certainly from a UK perspective is that generic medications purchased from a reputable source should have the same efficacy as any Branded medication. I know that many drugs where the patent has expired are manufactured to the same rigorous standard, however that being said, unless one knows or can find out the actual manufacturer then I wouldn't be touching them. In the UK the NHS are purchasing non branded drugs from reputable drug manufacturers in both Europe and India. If the equivalent drug is manufactured by let's say Ranbaxy in India then they are a reputable worldwide manufacturer amd produce at a fraction of the original cost. Disclaimer I don't have any connection with Ranbaxy or any of it's subsidiaries. Im sure if your proposed supplier is reputable then the drugs should be approved either internationally or by the Canadian authorities. Barry",

      "Content": "To my mind, it is a question of getting expert medical opinion on the circumstances either directly through a peer surgeon or via a lawyer approaching one or more top surgeons and assess the legal risk factor. I'm not one to side with the medical profession as I can only speak about our UK system. Most find that the medical profession tend to close ranks and therefore it is very difficult to get another professional opinion in a litigation case. Maybe in the US things operate differently, I simply don't know. I know after my two surgeries the first thing both surgeons checked for was any signs of a hernia developing. I hope your dad has no more setbacks and continues to recover. Barry",

      "Content": "Chuck, Bob and Michael, Thanks, I threw that out knowing I didn't have a positive diagnosis yet, however I can't understand without biopsy results why my consultant urologist would open a potential treatment dialogue. This baffled me. My GP got a copy of the MRI report, from what he saw and the interpretation report, he Is firmly convinced the report is accurate. I also had a telephone call last Tuesday from the deputy medical director of my NHS Hospital, this was the call that caused some controversy when I got a letter last year advising I would get a call from the hospital at 13.30 April 7th 2015. She had done a thorough review of my file and was checking on the CRC, vascular etc and my current physical status. She was also surprised that a biopsy hadn't yet been done and would chase this up with a letter to the urology consultant copied to my GP. So as of now I'm in limbo, despite potential treatment options being raised and my GP being convinced. Good news is my GP is on the case and chasing up with the hospital. Isn't life a breeze. Barry",

Seems they have relied on the T3 MRI results which indicate it is contained but most definately interpreted as cancer. I said \"aren't we getting ahead of ourselves as you don't know yet what type or grade it is\", response no I Beleive it is far better to discuss options ahead of the biopsy result. I have 2 friends with PCa both were on HT and both had to come off due to dramatic is effects. Any opinion welcome Barry",

This baffled me. My GP got a copy of the MRI report, from what he saw and the interpretation report, he Is firmly convinced the report is accurate. I also had a telephone call last Tuesday from the deputy medical director of my NHS Hospital, this was the call that caused some controversy when I got a letter last year advising I would get a call from the hospital at 13.30 April 7th 2015. She had done a thorough review of my file and was checking on the CRC, vascular etc and my current physical status. She was also surprised that a biopsy hadn't yet been done and would chase this up with a letter to the urology consultant copied to my GP.

      "Content": "To my mind, it is a question of getting expert medical opinion on the circumstances either directly through a peer surgeon or via a lawyer approaching one or more top surgeons and assess the legal risk factor. I'm not one to side with the medical profession as I can only speak about our UK system. Most find that the medical profession tend to close ranks and therefore it is very difficult to get another professional opinion in a litigation case. Maybe in the US things operate differently, I simply don't know. I know after my two surgeries the first thing both surgeons checked for was any signs of a hernia developing. I hope your dad has no more setbacks and continues to recover. Barry",

      "Content": "I'll not enter into a litigation debate as there are far to many variables. I tend to agree with Spouse, One good thing in using the Internet it the ability to research the qualifications and experience of particular surgeons ( in the UK it's quite easy) , elsewhere I have no idea. I do know that I bothe researched the competency of both the surgeons that operated on me prior to letting them get anywhere near me. Fact, all surgical sites can be prone to herniation, particular abdominal. During pre surgery work up, the risks for every surgical procedure should be explained either verbally and/or written into the official patient acceptance forms. It would be highly unusual for this aspect to have been missed either specifically or generically. I don't think anyone on here can advise a course of action as this will be specific to your dads case. Hoping your dad is getting better and continues to do so. Barry",

      "Content": "Chuck, Bob and Michael, Thanks, I threw that out knowing I didn't have a positive diagnosis yet, however I can't understand without biopsy results why my consultant urologist would open a potential treatment dialogue. This baffled me. My GP got a copy of the MRI report, from what he saw and the interpretation report, he Is firmly convinced the report is accurate. I also had a telephone call last Tuesday from the deputy medical director of my NHS Hospital, this was the call that caused some controversy when I got a letter last year advising I would get a call from the hospital at 13.30 April 7th 2015. She had done a thorough review of my file and was checking on the CRC, vascular etc and my current physical status. She was also surprised that a biopsy hadn't yet been done and would chase this up with a letter to the urology consultant copied to my GP. So as of now I'm in limbo, despite potential treatment options being raised and my GP being convinced. Good news is my GP is on the case and chasing up with the hospital. Isn't life a breeze. Barry",

I tend to agree with Spouse, One good thing in using the Internet it the ability to research the qualifications and experience of particular surgeons ( in the UK it's quite easy) , elsewhere I have no idea. I do know that I bothe researched the competency of both the surgeons that operated on me prior to letting them get anywhere near me. Fact, all surgical sites can be prone to herniation, particular abdominal. During pre surgery work up, the risks for every surgical procedure should be explained either verbally and/or written into the official patient acceptance forms. It would be highly unusual for this aspect to have been missed either specifically or generically. I don't think anyone on here can advise a course of action as this will be specific to your dads case. Hoping your dad is getting better and continues to do so. Barry",

      "Content": "In itself an interesting synopsis in treating PCa in the older age range of which I am in this category. However, this must be pointed out that what MD Anderson state is the NORM, certainly within the UK it is. Patients are not considered old at the age of 70 these days in the UK NHS. Yes comorbid ailments are always seriously considered with regard to treatment options and this goes for ANY cancer or indeed non cancerous conditions. Its not rocket science that aggressive treatment where patients with comorbid conditions the treatment would in essence kill them or allow natural controlled progression. It is balancing medical treatment / intervention versus beneficial outcome. Who would be a doctor with thae daily decisions. To give an instance of what we always accept as the norm, contrast given for a CT scan can seriously affect kidney function and with patients who have renal impairment can result in that patient having to have lifetime dialysis. This is just one of the decisions doctors must take when balancing life saving need to detect what is are internal problems against possible future results of introducing contrast and the life of the patient.",

      "Content": "Joe, At least within th VA system being a Brit I'm guessing as I know zero as to how that system works, one would imagine you would be outside the world of insurance decisions ?. I know there is debate within the UK as whether low grade PCa (3+3 as a example should be radically treated. As my understanding goes more men die with PCa rather than from it. The reasoning is that with a quantum leap in diagnostics more are being diagnosed very early stage and IF Gleeson 6 (3+3) should in fact be treated at all. I am in this category and have surpisingly no concerns as I get frequent PSA tests which as a frankly rough indicator mine hovers between 5.8 to 7 ish. No doubt this debate will continue within the peer medical profession. Good luck and hope all works out for you. Barry",

      "Content": "Steve, i can only echo what others have said, indeed you have had a unfortunate experience with drastic possible post procedure consequences. However, I cannot agree with you're statement to avoid a biopsy if at all possible. Unfortunately as of today a biopsy is the only reliable test available. Even my GP said \"this is the most barbaric, inhuman procedure\" yet it is the only method currently available. ive had two, the first a MRI templates biopsy with frankly little physical effect, the second TRUS had somewhat different effects, the procedure not comfortable I agree, yet 3 days later blue lighted into hospital with sepsis. At the results follow up the specialist didn't even mention it, the specialist urology sister said and I quote verbatim \" I see you had a elevated temperature\". One can imagine my response was \" Elevated, that's somewhat of a understatement\". One can conclude the sisters statement indicates how urology respond to post procedure sepsis, No big deal. As I'm on AS then in another 15 months I shall be having another one, does this thought worry me, no as it is for the sake of repetition the only method of producing a conclusive result, so be it. Im coming 73, so my views may change as age progresses. Meanwhile good luck and sincerely hope your problems resolve. Barry",

PSA started at 6 which was slightly high for my age, went to 7.2 then dropped back to 6.7. Recent 14 core TRUS which put me in hospital with sepsis bye the way showed only marginal increase of 1 core a marginal 4. Urologist offered me all options but said I quote \" It will not shorten your life\". Easy decision for me, I opted for continuing AS which the Uro agreed was the better course of action. Now will stay on 6 monthly PSA tests. I am more than comfortable and dare say relaxed and certainly I am not worried nor anxious and frankly never really think about it until the calendar warning on the IPad go is off a week before my next PSA. Its easy to get freaked out by hearing the word Cancer, I'm now living with a short short colon after 2 resections, another CT scan coming up due to symptoms returning. although I'm substantially older than yourself at 72 and a bit, I'd make one suggestion, freaking out doesn't achieve anything apart from making ones own and the families life a misery.

Several matters have been raised to me from practice patients, this being only one I raised during the meeting. The fact they use a small factor I found quite interesting. The other matters are relevant only to our practice therefore are irrelevant to the forum. Barry",

A decade before PCa was generally caught at a more advanced stage, whereas latterly most are diagnosed Fortuntely earlier due to the above and GP's being far more proactive in including PSA testing as a element of normal blood tests, certainly for those aged 50 and over. What is heartening is that governments of either persuasion over the last 15 years have actively promoted testing. barry",

      "Content": "Joe, \"Peddling their trade\" to me is apt terminology for what ostensibly in the US and other parts of the world is the private health systems funded by insurance and or funded research programmes on behalf of drug / equipment organizations. Here in the UK is quite different where yes we have private which accounts for less than 5% of the total number in the UK are treated. The remainder are treated under our National Health system which has a standard treatment regimen for each specific cancer type. These treatment regimes are reviewed by a multi disciplinary team (MDT) at each hospital in relation to each patient and that patients disease and condition. This is where we in the UK substantially differ from other countries as the treatment proposed or not is agreed by the \"team\" which encompasses every involved medical discipline and becomes specific for that patient. I have low grade PCa (Gleeson 3+ 3) and was offerred several treatment options from Watch and wait, through to prostactemy. After a 34 needle fusion biopsy a follow up T3 MRI, the consultant and his registrar sat with me and we discussed every option finally deciding on Active surveillance, a path for which I am perfectly happy with up to now. As you can see from my signature, I am not exactly without comorbid conditions, yet my personal findings are a contradiction to what you postulate. Im certainly not suggesting you are wrong but to draw an analogy, there are many shades of black and white as there are grey. it all I think comes down to to the individual preferences of the specialists and surgeons. Here our NHS doctors/ surgeons are allowed under contract to partially practice in the private medical industry, but and this is where our system differs substantially, our surgeons are restricted in their private practices to only charge what is termed the BUPA rate for an operation, in my colon cancer surgery my surgeon was paid 742 pounds sterling, the private anaesthetist got 438 pounds sterling, the thousands was taken by the private Hospital. That I think is the substantial difference. Barry",

There were 2 consecutive scans, both with contrast, first the standard prostate and pelvic then a dynamic scan. Process lasted exactly 52 minutes, result being the interpretation was cancer. In the UK the standard practice is a T3 MRI, if no obvious cancer in the interpretation, no further action. If cancer is shown or suspected then a biopsy. In my case TRUS with a 38 core biopsy coming up under a general Anaesthetic. My PSA was 5.10 age 70 which is just above the upper threshold, 6 months later after a 2 month course of antibiotics it rose to7.2. My URO said that now they don't go for a biopsy unless the MRI reveals anything considered suspicious or nasty. He said without equivocation in his opinion less than 38 would not produce sufficient evidence as he regarded 6 or 12 core as superficial and opened the possibility of needing a second biopsy which in his words any prostate biopsy was essential but was the most barbaric procedure he could imagine. Therefore get it over and done with in one hit. So I'm now like you in the waiting phase before the procedure. Barry",

      "Content": "Maybe a point of discussion, but my perspective is its not relevant to this forum. We deal with recognised medical treatment protocols in treating any cancer. Does religion play a role in treatment and recovery I don't know, what I do know is that being focused, diligent and determined does play a role and this is derived from any belief we hold or more important our own self belief. Individually we cope with whatever life throws at us in different ways. That's my take, but I reiterate I would not wish to see the contents of this post progress into a fully open forum debate. It is all a matter of belief in whatever and individual perspective. Let's leave it at that please. Barry",

The key words used by the Uro based on the latest compararitive TRUS results were \"Your cancer will not shorten your life\". I am content and quite happy with continuing AS until things change, just had the latest 3 monthly blood test today. So for me until a day before the calendar reminder for the blood test it does not enter my mind. Hoping the decision you have reached sits as comfortably with you as it does for myself. Barry",

      "Content": "Maybe things are a little different over the pond in Blighty, screening as well as AS is not age related at this time, yet I am sure given the overwhelming demands on the NHS some form of rationing will be introduced. Some suggest a unwritten and unpublisized age cut off date exists at 72, true or not I can\u2019t say. Thankfully they haven\u2019t let up on myself, indeed at coming up to 74 our NHS and particularly my hospital I\u2019d suggest are being more \u201cactive\u201d with myself. PSA spiked this month to 11.2 from 8.2 in January, one could suggest at my age of 73 that\u2019s a remarkable rise in 4 months. Response from Urology was immediate, contact us Monday. The age debate may and will no doubt roll on. My two pennies worth is, simple Baseline PSA at 50 for everyone then, dependent on the initial result a monitoring frequency should be established. After all breast cancer screening in the U.K. has been championed for over 20 years by the NHS and has increased significantly the % or early detection. Perhaps it is time as some suggest that males are given the same equality with PCa testing. Barry",

      "Content": "Bricks, I'm no expert on prostate cancer as I'm on the CRC forum but also UK based, but a few things need explanation that's for sure. For our foreign members our NHS works differently to the US, as it is state provided we don't have the luxury of elective surgery or seeking a consultant unless it is under private health insurance and even this needs a referral from ones NHS GP. On another note, a close friend, he's a similar age to myself has had recurring prostate problems for a few months, his PSA was well in excess of 30 heading closer to 40 of I recall. Charles has all the tests over the last 3 months and finally they ruled out cancer, yet his PSA after 3 courses of antibiotics is still above 30. They don't want to operate on Charles unless it is essential and are trying a combination of drugs to see if they will work. If not he will have to have surgery, thankfully our local hospital is one of the few in the UK using the latest Da Vinci robotic surgical system. Ok your different to Charles as you have a confirmed diagnosis, but, his PSA is still in the 30's. I'm sure our other knowledgable members will chip in with answers as they pick up your thread.

      "Content": "Southampton General University Hospital has just released a publication following trials on more than 200 patients of a day case procedure to reduce the size of the prostate. The procedure involves placing microscopic beads in the arteries that feed blood to the prostate which coagulate and block blood flow to the prostate resulting in a dramatic reduction in size and volume. The same principle and procedure of placing stents or clearing blockages in the main arteries is used where a incision is made in the right groin to access the femoral artery. A catheter is placed and guided wire placement of the beads is made In some patients there is a possibility that a incision is needed in left groin to complete the procedure. Normally the time spent in the intervention suite is 1 to 2 hours, followed by recovery for up to 6 hours on the day ward. In nearly all cases the patient was released from hospital the same day. A separate study is running in parallel to identify what effect this procedure may have on prostate tumours as one researcher said, that a zero blood supply could inhibit tumour growth but qualified that this research is in the very early stage. Obviously it was stated that this procedure would normally be offered to those that had reached the age of 60 and above, but was also an option to younger patients after extensive discussion. The results so far have seen a dramatic improvement in nearly all patients with no problem with erectile disfunctional and a major improvement in urinary response. They say it is a major step forward as there is no need for invasive surgery. Barry",

      "Content": "I've been living quite relaxed wth Gleason 3+3 nor for two and a half years on active surveillance. PSA started at 6 which was slightly high for my age, went to 7.2 then dropped back to 6.7. Recent 14 core TRUS which put me in hospital with sepsis bye the way showed only marginal increase of 1 core a marginal 4. Urologist offered me all options but said I quote \" It will not shorten your life\". Easy decision for me, I opted for continuing AS which the Uro agreed was the better course of action. Now will stay on 6 monthly PSA tests. I am more than comfortable and dare say relaxed and certainly I am not worried nor anxious and frankly never really think about it until the calendar warning on the IPad go is off a week before my next PSA. Its easy to get freaked out by hearing the word Cancer, I'm now living with a short short colon after 2 resections, another CT scan coming up due to symptoms returning. although I'm substantially older than yourself at 72 and a bit, I'd make one suggestion, freaking out doesn't achieve anything apart from making ones own and the families life a misery. Good luck and relax if you can. Barry",

      "Content": "At our PPG meeting last evening I asked what criteria our doctors used before a referral to specialists is made as well as statistics for early, late or indeed terminal prognosis. With a patient base of over 13,000 and 8 GP\u2019s their work load is high to say the least. The answer was enlightening They refer to specialists anyone assessed at more than a 3% possibility of having PCa or indeed any other cancer. This seems to be a low theshold, however judged from previous history, current symptoms as well as physical examination and or current test results. To me this appears to indicate a high percentage of referrals if the benchmark is set at 3% possibility of cancer. Waitimg for the stats on referrals to confirmed cancer diagnosis which has to be correlated, yet I would suggest our GP practice is very proactive. After nearly 3 years of being on AS where my PSA has risen from 5.2 to very recently 11.1 the possibility of intervention has increased, yet my eminent Uro suggests wait 3 months and do another PSA. Is this proposal concerning, personally not in the least given both my doctors and specialists are so on the case so to speak.

      "Content": "Being on the sidelines with PCa (3+ marginal 4) and on AS for over 3 years as well as having 2 episodes of CRC perhaps I look at things a little differently to many. Frankly PCa never enters my thoughts apart from remembering my 6 monthly PSA check which precedes the meeting with the URO. I simply could not live my life constantly thinking of what may occur, far better for me to concentrate on what actually matters. There are those that become obsessed with their diagnosis or treatment which pervades every day thoughts marginalising the redeeming aspects of what life is. Granted diagnosis and treatment can be at best extremely disturbing and difficult yet having had two major episodes with CRC and living with PCa tends for myself to focus my mind on the positive aspects of life. We all deal with the pitfalls of life differently, I prefer to live looking at the positives rather than the negatives and doing what I like and love doing. for certain not one of us can evade mortality, something obviously I wish to delay for as long as possible and living in a dark place frankly does not sit well with me. I agree with what all have said, I reiterate I choose life over fear. Barry",

      "Content": "mdt, Sorry you are having these problems. Although I'm on the CRC forum I was diagnosed with prostate cancer some 3 years ago and in between a recurrence of colon cancer. So one may say I should be one of the eternal worriers am I, not in the least. Most of us will die with prostate cancer, not from having it. Thats a fact. PCa appears to be the latest high percentage forum input, mainly I suggest due to the advancement in using PSA blood tests as well as diagnostic techniques and our personal knowledge. Google can be a great tool for specifics, but the devil in disguise with generalised medical symptoms. Rather than research procedures as well as general symptoms I would suggest you have convinced yourself ahead of a biopsy or MRI. i was offered all treatment options should I elect to have treatment Or and in conjunction with my Uro we agreed that active surveillance was the way to go with 6 monthly blood tests and 18 month to 2 years 3T MRI and biopsies dictated by PSA level as well MRI results. Im quite content to follow this regime as it does not cause me symptoms nor any concerns (Worry). My Uro's suggest that some can live with PCa with no worries or anxiety whilst others find it difficult to live with their diagnosis and wish to go straight into treatment. Thats about it frankly, my input is worth exactly what you paid for it, nothing. Wish you the best outcome from your biopsy. Barry",

For a internal clipper that retails in the US for 146 dollars their charge was 1206. Each bag of saline was 9.26 pounds pence, the same costs in the NHS 46 pence. Dont know how you guys and gals do this insurance business every time. Thank God we have the NHS warts and all. Barry",

There are many on here and thousands off forum who have been in just as dire a situation as you appear to suggest and are still alive. Honestly I do not think any doctor would deliberately feed a patient BS and if so that is completely immoral and contradicts the oath they all have to swear and live by in their profession. They may be conservative at times with fact, but misleading a patient I doubt it. Good look and hope you prove you\u2019re doctor right. Barry",
