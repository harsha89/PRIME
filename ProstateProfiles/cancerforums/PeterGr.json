    "Content": "Hi Ponder, I can only offer my experience with the drugs my father has received so far. I will not refer to the medicine he took while he was at the stage of hormone deprivation. I will instead focus on the past year or so. My father was on Taxotere (docetaxel) and registered after the first three infusions a significant drop in his PSA. However that proved short-lived as subsequent tests showed that the disease had started developing immunity to the drug (his PSA went to 13.7 indicating a very steep doubling time) so he didn't get to complete the 9-10 sessions usually prescribed for this drug. He got pneumonia as well so we had to lay off everything for a while until he recovered. He is currently taking Jevtana (cabazitaxel) and seems to be tolerating it well so far. We 'll see how effective that is though... Other than that the only other drug I have heard of is Xtandi but don't have any experience with it that could be useful. This is my two-pence for what its worth, I hope it has been helpful.",
