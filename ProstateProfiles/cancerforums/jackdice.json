      "Content": "Newbie here, first time posting. A lot of very good information here..The Doctor said that he would recommend a PSA test every 6 months but since he said I had a \"high\" PSA test for my age, he wanted to see me again in 4 months. However when I got home, I looked at the ranges for the 40-49 years old normal PSAs and it said 0-2.9. I'm really confused as to why he would think it's high. Also I remember having sex the night before the test so how much can ejaculation throw off the PSA reading? 10-20% perhaps? Anyways, I don't mind doing another PSA test in 4 months but I just don't see how 0.9 for 41 year old warrants alarm? thank for all the advice.....",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck. He did say my prostate felt a little enlarged when he did a DRE...but \"nothing a medical school student would be alarmed at\" he said. Anyways, I went to this urologist for a possible UTI infection from my honeymoon, so maybe it was also due to an infection (which was never picked up from the urine sample he took). I will get the PSA again an will follow your recommendations for the previous 72 hours. Thanks again",
