    "Content": "I am about to have a prostate biopsy due to 3 elevated PSA readings. I will have this procedure on the 9th of April (Tuesday). In the meantime, several glands on both sides of my neck enlarged about 2 weeks ago, with multiple \"knots\", which are painful. For this reason I will be getting a CAT scan on the 7th of April (yes, Sunday). I am having no detectable symptoms such as sore throat, etc. A digital exam of my prostate was negative, and extensive bloodwork shows no abnormalities or symptoms of an infection, other than elivated PSA. Could a problem with my prostate, infection or otherwise, cause my neck glands to enlarge and become painful, or is it most likely 2 seperate concerns? Also, is a CAT scan sufficiently detailed and accurate enough to find something if it is there? My thinking is that the scan would show any masses, but in order to evaluate the cause(s), a biopsy will need to follow. Biopsy of the prostate should be definitive, right?",
