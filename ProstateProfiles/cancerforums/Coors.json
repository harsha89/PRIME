On June 30th went for my visit with the Dr. to get my catheter out and get my pathology results . Dr. said he felt I made the right choice as the cancer was on both lobes not just the right and was 10% of the prostate , stage 2 , gleason 7 3+4 stayed the same , lymph nodes 8 tested were all negative , negative margins and I go back Sept 30 for psa . Dr. feels there is a very good chance to beat this . While there he asked if I wanted to start the erection therapy or wait to get the incontinence under control , I said I'll wait .",
