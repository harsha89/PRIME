      "Content": "Originally Posted by GeorgeS I will do. Today (as I will once a week) I chatted up the RO who is very optimistic that long term recovery is not only possible but quite possible. He pulled up a few reports from PUBMED that had node positive folks (like me) in remission 5 and 10years out from the RT. (very healthy and respectable percentages to boot! (IE: Above 50%) He may insist that the \"recipe\" of RT+18mo's ADT be followed but I told him that was not an issue as long as I can have a END DATE for the ADT! I was diagnosed last month with a psa of 268 Gleason 8 with bone mets and one lymph node effected. I was immediately put on casodex then a week later lupron. Then 2weeks after that my oncologist scheduled me for 6 rounds of docetaxel. The day of my first round of chemo I got the test results of my baseline psa and it had dropped down to 48 from 268 in a matter of just 2 weeks of lupron and casodex therapy only. I'm hoping this is a sign that lupron will work very well for me going forward. I have read that lupron/docetaxel treatment right at diagnosis is having very good long term results for men with advanced PC that hasn't spread to any organs.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, six months into this I'm now a little worried but maybe I shouldn't be. Lupron moved my psa down from around the mid 200s to about 50 pretty quickly .My oncologist started me on docetaxel at this point. Here are my psa scores along the way. 48 at start of docetaxel psa test every 3 weeks 48 1.9 4.9 5.6 4.3 4.3 end docetaxel start zometa psa test every 4 wks 3.61 3.75 What's bothering me is my most recent PSA test. The jump in psa in the beginning I think was because of the docetaxel but I'm a little worried about the slight rise now.What do you guys think about this? Am I being paranoid? My stats- psa 268 at diagnosis Gleason 8 bone mets and a couple lymph nodes affected.lupron every 4 months, 6 cycles docetaxel at beginning of treatment a Zometa after I finished docetaxel. I had another bone and ct scan a couple weeks ago that showed a lot of improvement. My last psa test was just taken on Monday Jan 7th. 2019. Thank you all ,these monthly psa test are really getting to me...",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, six months into this I'm now a little worried but maybe I shouldn't be. Lupron moved my psa down from around the mid 200s to about 50 pretty quickly .My oncologist started me on docetaxel at this point. Here are my psa scores along the way. 48 at start of docetaxel psa test every 3 weeks 48 1.9 4.9 5.6 4.3 4.3 end docetaxel start zometa psa test every 4 wks 3.61 3.75 What's bothering me is my most recent PSA test. The jump in psa in the beginning I think was because of the docetaxel but I'm a little worried about the slight rise now.What do you guys think about this? Am I being paranoid? My stats- psa 268 at diagnosis Gleason 8 bone mets and a couple lymph nodes affected.lupron every 4 months, 6 cycles docetaxel at beginning of treatment a Zometa after I finished docetaxel. I had another bone and ct scan a couple weeks ago that showed a lot of improvement. My last psa test was just taken on Monday Jan 7th. 2019. Thank you all ,these monthly psa test are really getting to me...",
