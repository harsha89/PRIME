      "Content": "Mr SubDenis: I see that your rather dour philosophical questioning has surfaced again. To put it bluntly: We are all dying. With each passing heartbeat, breath, blink of our eyes we are closer to the end. Since death is inevitable, we should chose to live life as fully as possible for as long as possible. I am sorry to read of another malady that you possess. I may be wrong but if you were a full career Navy submariner, then the malady that started at age 25 likely was not life threatening or career threatening. Again, you have had a most fortunate experience with prostate cancer. Many on this forum are far far less fortunate and can only wish that they had received your exact diagnosis. You did a highly commendable job researching all of the possible treatment options and settled on a treatment (HDR BT) that would work best for you - and it has! In 3 months your PSA has dropped more than 75%. At that rate, your upcoming PSA may be less than 0.1 As you say: \"let's choose living!\" Good luck with the next PSA. It'll be vanishing.",

It becomes a major problem both for the individual and those around him/her. IMO, your expressed fear is self centered and out of line with reality. On the full spectrum of Cancer diagnoses, you have received a mere minor surface scratch. You have not been cursed with prostate cancer, rather you have been quite fortunate. If in doubt, take time to read the stories of those with advanced prostate cancer or venture to other forums such as brain and pancreatic cancers where fear is justified. Proper Perspective is what is most important. I fully agree with your position on dignity and gratitude. Together all of us have a lot for which to be thankful.
