      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Nicole! Very sorry about your father but keep in mind that prostate cancer (PCa), if incurable, can be successfully managed and controlled for many many years. So stay optimistic! I suspect that you are outside of the U.S. Regardless of your location, he should be: - 1st diagnosed with PCa, then - Evaluated to determine if it is: 1) Contained to the prostate gland or 2) Spread Locally near the prostate gland or 3) If it is metastatic and spread diffusely - Identify any reasonable treatment options such as radiation in addition to Hormone Therapy (HT) Possibly a MP 3T MRI can provide a good assessment. Also, newer technologies such as Axumin Scans can locate PCa with high accuracy, sensitivity & specificity. Unfortunately, they are quite expensive and health insurers (in the U.S.) are not likely to pay for the use of these scans for a primary diagnosis of PCa. If possible, find a new URO MD who specializes in treating PCa and make an appointment for a consultation / 2nd Opinion. Relax, stay strong and keep a positive attitude! And keep asking questions! MF Hi, hope I'm posting in the right spot. My first time on a forum. Yes, I'm from Australia but couldn't find a forum in OZ. Dad has told me about all of his elderly patients who he diagnosed. His advice was leave it, no surgery, hormone therapy and radiotherapy if it's spread. He told me all of his patients lived for years afterwards. He is less worried than I am but I suspect he is kicking himself that he jumped the gun and injected himself rather than waiting to have the bx first. My understanding is he needs a Gleason score. I vaguely understand why the hormone therapy would defer diagnosis. It suppresses testosterone and starves the cancer or at least halts it. If it has spread to the bone, the cells are still prostate cels that have migrated to the bone so I get how hormone therapy may affect scans. I'm going to phone the Urologist he saw as I know him and find out for sure. He may well be able to have a CT but maybe the doc feels it would do more harm then good at this point - what do cancer cells love more than radiation? I don't believe he's hiding everything from me as my boss who is an ortho surgeon referred him so I will get all his letters and scan results. I'm going to try to be positive but have cried buckets. He is a healthy 83 and never been sick or hospitalised before but I will move in with him to take care of him and things as the hormone therapy has made him very tired and he's having hot flashes. Welcome to my world I say. I told him he would have lovely skin at least and this made him laugh. Thank you for all of your advice and I will check in when I know more. Ps Yes, doctors are very secretive. Having that knowledge would be a double edged sword though.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am writing to get some advice about my father. He is 83 and a retired dr. He had symptoms (which he kept quiet about and I don't know what they were). Wrote out his own path referral to test his PSA. Has a reading of 32. Saw an urologist who was quite insensitive and asked my dad if he just wanted to come back when he had symptoms???? What kind of approach is this? My father asked for a bx but the urologist was going on holiday and asked dad if he wanted a hormone injection. Dad said yes and had a six month injection. I wanted a second opinion so I made an appointment for him to see a doctor at the hospital where I work and was dismayed to find out that dad cannot have a bx now because he had the hormone injection and results would not be accurate. He told dad that he believes it is cancer and not prostatitis as it was not enlarged. Didn't feel anything during digital exam. Also told him a CT scan or ultrasound would be useless, again because of the injection. I'm confused and terrified. Can someone please tell me why metasteses would not show up on CT scan. He has to go back in three months with repeat bloods. I'm so scared for him. Is there anyway you can test for spread and when will scanning be viable if he's had a six month course of hormone. Love him so much. Thank you Nicole",

      "Content": "I spoke to my fathers urologist (the one I referred him to). He explained that it would not have been his choice to start HT before the biopsy and a CAT scan won't show up anything but he said there is no urgency. The hormones will wear off and we will progress from there. So we have a three month wait until the next FBE and PSA. His bloods were otherwise perfect. His hands are tied and I now understand that. At least the hormones will suppress and stall whatever is going on. I asked him if I should be worried. He said no, I will have my dad for years to come and he would keep a close eye on him. I'm not sure how he can know that but it was comforting. I understand that 80 % of men over 80 have prostate cancer and in later life, it tends to be slow growing. I know this is a generalisation but I have to take some comfort in that. Having said that I have no idea if he bothered to check his PSA levels in the past. Doctors are the worst patients. He had a colonoscopy for the first time at 72. His father died at 96 with prostate cancer. Feeling better today and just have to let it play out. No choice.",
