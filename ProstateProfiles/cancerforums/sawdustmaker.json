When we talked about it, I asked him what they did and he said they told him that his DRE was normal and not to worry, he didn't have cancer. Was I wrong to encourage him to get another PSA in a few months? I'm worried about the huge increase. They didn't do a free PSA or anything. Paul",

      "Content": "Yes Michael you are right. If surgery is going to happen (which I'm pretty sure of), it will be Northside Hospital with Dr. Scott Miller. And I have already thanked my PCP for being suspicious. I'm grateful for him making sure even though a 4.2 PSA with no other symptoms might not be alarming. I'm in pretty good condition. I work out with weights, do core exercises, walk hard (can't run any more due to arthritis in knee even though I was a triathlete and marathoner). Already doing Kegels too. Thanks for the advice. Much appreciated.",

Short bio, primary care physician requested I see urologist since PSA rose from 3.1 December 2015 to 4.2 by September 2016. Uro did free PSA test and it was only 7%. Got biopsy showing 4 cores positive on right side only. 3 cores were Gleason 3+4, the other 3+3. 50% in one, 40% in another, 20% in another, and 10% in the other. The one with 10% was a 3+4 but perineural invasion noted. This is my biggest concern because I've read conflicting info about the significance of it. All DREs have always been good; smooth and nothing felt. I'm already preparing for RP with da Vinci with the best guy in Georgia, but meeting with him tomorrow. I'm concerned whether the perineural invasion is going to mean no nerve sparing on right side, and whether cancer could have escaped already, etc. I'm hoping the \"Pros from Dover\" (a little MASH lingo) have something positive to tell me!

      "Content": "wtdedula, Welcome and sorry you are facing this. There are much more qualified people than me on this forum, but I will give you my $.02 worth. A Gleason 3+4 is what I had as well, and this is very curable given that it doesn't appear to have escaped the capsule. So be encouraged. I've personally never seen here or anywhere else where a Gleason 3+4 was worthy of active surveillance, so I think your choice is good. We'll see what everyone else thinks. Regarding a surgeon, since it is very likely you have a good chance for nerve sparing, the skill of the surgeon is very important. Checking around for a really experienced one is worth the time. I wouldn't rush it because this is slow growing stuff. Maybe someone else knows of someone in your area; I'm in the Atlanta area myself. My wife is a nurse and she had urologists she knew tell her that my surgeon was who he'd use in a heartbeat. My primary care doctor said the same thing.

Most if not all the blood flow created by the VED draws veinal blood, not fresh oxygenated blood as with a natural erection. My understanding that it is mainly to help prevent shrinkage since you're not likely having any nighttime normal erections. Things I've read are a little mixed as to whether it draws the best blood, but most things I've seen seem to think it's a good thing. Might want to consider a scrotal shield because as MRJ said, it can pull pretty hard and draw the twins up if you're not pushing it down fairly strongly against the skin. Try figuring it out without the shield first because they cost about $20.00! And don't get scared when you remove it and see you have, as my wife says, a \"blue steamy dragon\"! Saw",

You learn to anticipate the different stresses (cough, sneeze, pick up a heavy object, etc) that cause you to leak. If I pay attention, I'm becoming more able to prevent the little leaks, so I was encouraged by that. Have gone all day without a pad (and wearing my boxers finally) and just had a minor leak when I picked up my 4 year old grandson to put him in his car seat. But it was not noticeable to anyone if you get my drift. And yes Bowy, my doctor was surprised and said he still considered this early continence recovery. I did do my Kegels before the surgery so that may have helped. Saw",

You learn to anticipate the different stresses (cough, sneeze, pick up a heavy object, etc) that cause you to leak. If I pay attention, I'm becoming more able to prevent the little leaks, so I was encouraged by that. Have gone all day without a pad (and wearing my boxers finally) and just had a minor leak when I picked up my 4 year old grandson to put him in his car seat. But it was not noticeable to anyone if you get my drift. And yes Bowy, my doctor was surprised and said he still considered this early continence recovery. I did do my Kegels before the surgery so that may have helped. Saw",

      "Content": "Sorry if this should go under the ED sticker; if so I guess Chuck will move it. But I wanted to better understand what some of you have experienced with specifically the VED pump thing. I read through all the posts in the ED thread, as well as stuff in other places on the interwebs, and there doesn't seem to be a consensus that this is that great. My Dr has had me contacted by some group to arrange to get one. I am 25 days from my RP so I don't guess I'm too late yet in starting something. He has prescribed a 2.5 mg Cialis daily for now. In researching, I came across a urological site that had the pumps and other things, but also something called Viberect. The site is [[[[ LINK REMOVED BY MODERATOR ]]]]. Apparently it is supposed to accomplish the same things as a VED but does it by stimulating the nerves. Obviously the reviews on the site are good, so I searched for as many independent reviews I could find, and I haven't found a bad one yet. I am not scheduled to see my doctor on 3/28 so I emailed his nurse to ask about this, versus the pump. She emailed me a day later and said he thought it was a scam. But it is on the same site where they sell multiple other devices, it is FDA approved, and requires a doctor's prescription. I even saw where the urologist who invented it was on the TV show \"The Doctors\". Has anybody ever heard of this? Saw NOTE FROM MODERATOR: Links to sites that solicit products are not permitted.

      "Content": "Been just lurking around lately but today I received my prostaglandin injection kit via a compounding pharmacy. The ED issue has been slowly improving but my doctor says he has had good results speeding up the process with the dreaded injections. Anyway, I've decided to try it but had a question. I'd call his office but it is nearly impossible to get through and get an answer today. He had said not to use the injection with the sildenafil. He has had me taking a minimum of 2 per day since my surgery, and I took 2 this morning as a matter of habit. I'm assuming he really meant not to use them together at the same time. Anyone have experience with that; am I correct? Ok to try the injection tonight having taken 2 this morning? Saw",

      "Content": "As a public service to anyone who may have this question again, here are some lessons I learned last night. 1-Pay closer attention to what your doctor says about injections and pills, just to make sure 2-Check the response to what your forum brother says at 7:04 PM before you decide that a small starter injection at 9:30 PM will probably be fine with only 40 mg of sildenafil earlier that morning (because your wife is going out of town for a week the next day) 3-Start injections with a lower dose than your doctor recommends\u2026..just to be sure 4-Priapism is uncomfortable 5-When you get to the ER at about the 3 ½ hour mark, and you have an extremely hot ER nurse, and you suddenly realize it is getting better because you can walk upright again, let her check you to make sure anyway There are those with serious issues on at this forum, and I don\u2019t mean to make light of them.

This man is 62 years old and has never had a DRE or PSA. He's been getting up and down at night a lot going to the bathroom. His father had prostate cancer. Obviously I got all over him and told him to get an exam ASAP. He is ex military and said he'd do that. He called me yesterday he went to the VA and got a DRE and PSA and was told everything was normal. They said his prostate wasn't enlarged. I asked what his PSA was and he said he thought they said 6 or something, but wasn't sure. Even though he has no baseline, all of this concerned me. Was I wrong to encourage him to go to another doctor outside the VA? He has regular medical insurance also. Saw",
