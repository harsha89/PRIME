      "Content": "I have had 5 prostate biopsies over the past four years, with 12, 24, 24 and 30+ cores in order. The biopsies were initiated as a result of a quick rise in PSA five years ago. The first found PIN cells, the second, nothing, so we skipped a year. The third found PIN cells again, and the fourth found cancer in the transition zone, in only one core, 5%, Gleason score of 3+3. I have one or two nodules on my prostate, but they have been thoroughly biopsied and do not contain cancer. The urologist that initiated the biopsies stages the cancer as T2c, and recommended an immediate robotic radical prostatectomy. I went to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and met with Dr. Louis Pisters, who performed a DRE, and reviewed the records, biopsy results, etc. from my first urologist. He staged the cancer as T1a, stating that I had had approximately 100 cores, and only one of the last thirty hit cancer. He said further, that the \"T\" staging system relied heavily on the DRE and nodule detection, and because the nodules are apparently cancer free, T2c is overstaging the cancer. He recommended active surveillance, another biopsy in twelve to twenty-four months, and no surgery at this time. He indicated that at this early stage, the risk of quality of life side effects of the surgery are not worth the risk. I am fifty-nine years old, married, healthy, active, work out with a trainer, have no high blood pressure, heart, or any other health issues. No potency or continence problems unusual for my age. Has anyone else come up against evaluations and suggested treatments varying this widely? Anyone with intimate knowledge about how the \"T\" staging system works?",
