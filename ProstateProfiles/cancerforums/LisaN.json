The doctor just told us the cancer is \"in his blood.\" As of now, he is not on \"death's door.\" He had radiation several years ago and was on hormone therapy. The hormone therapy recently stopped working. His PSA was 3 something a month ago, now it's 5 something. The doctor is starting him on chemotherapy soon. I am trying to learn what is going to happen in regards to his prognosis/life expectancy but am not having much luck. I know he can't be cured. So what is the chemotherapy supposed to do? I know it is supposed to slow the cancer, but for how long? What typically happens after he is done with the treatment in regards to his cancer progression? When his PSA goes back up (it must since they can't cure it, right?) can he take chemotherapy again? I'm so confused and worried.",

      "Content": "Thanks to everyone who has replied. It helps me and makes me feel better to talk to others who have gone through prostate cancer. It seems like all doctors do is tell you that you have cancer and send you home. Then you are stuck worrying to death about it. How do they expect anyone not to worry about something like this? Sometimes I feel that I am worrying about nothing and I tell myself that my dad is going to be ok because the doctor is going to take care of him and not just put him in the corner someplace to die. I read that only 3% of people who get prostate cancer (or recurring prostate cancer, I can't remember which) end up dying from it. I tell myself that if it spread he should still be ok with the drugs that are available. Then other times I feel like my dad is going to die soon. I feel that he is doomed if that cancer spread. I keep going up and down on how I feel. My mom tells me to think positive but how can I think positive when I know it is cancer and I know the dangers of cancer? The only thing I can do is pray. I can't change it one way or another. Why do you think my dad needs to see a new doctor? Do you think the one he has now is no good? Yes, she is a urologist. My dad is going for his bone scan and CT or PET tomorrow morning. I am nervous about it and probably will feel uneasy all day, or until I hear the results. Is it possible that my dad's cancer can still be in his prostate? How does the cancer get out of the prostate? I am not sure what scan other than a bone scan that my dad initially had 2 years ago before his radiation. It may have been a CT or PET, even though I said MRI. She told us his cancer was still in the prostate at the time and not in the bones or organs near the prostate. Are you saying she could have been wrong about it? How likely is it for them to find cancer that has spread on this bone scan he is about to have? Just 2 years ago, there was no cancer spotted in the scan. Oh yeah, my mom called the doctor's nurse to get the scoop from her because once my dad found out his cancer was back, that is all he could hear. My mom told the nurse my dad is convinced he is going to die and she said the nurse sounded optimistic. She said, \"Tell him he's not at the end of his road yet.\" I hope she means that and is not just trying to console my dad and make him believe something that isn't true. I don't know if they do that or not. I have never been through anything like this before. I ordered the book that was mentioned here. I can't wait until it gets here. Thanks all for listening. Please pray for him. I will pray for you guys.",

      "Content": "Last week I found out my dad's prostate cancer came back. He was treated with external beam radiation a little over 2 years ago when he was 62. When he was first diagnosed he had a PSA of 16 and Gleason scores of 6, 6, and 7. He got a bone scan back then and it showed no cancer in the bones. He also got an MRI (I think) and it showed the prostate cancer was all contained in the prostate. That's when he got the radiation and after that was over with, he was going for his PSA check every 3 months. I am not exactly sure of his numbers but most were in 0.46-0.72 range. The previous time he was there before last week, he got some kind of a shot and he told me the doctor told him it was to kill any remaining cancer cells. Well this time he went for his blood work and his PSA was 4.3. That's when she told him the cancer was back. He wanted to know how long he has left and the doctor looked at him and said, \"Well it isn't life threatening. If you were dying, I'd tell you that you were.\" Then she said he needs a PET scan and bone scan. If it comes back still in the prostate, he gets Casodex. If it has spread, he gets Provenge. I've read on some sites that once it is in your bones you have about 5 years and Provenge only extends life for about 4 months. But then I also saw a site that says most men with recurring prostate cancer won't die from it. Here's what I keep thinking about... 1.Do you think that if it has spread to his bones that he will live for very long or am I about to lose my dad? 2.What are the odds that the cancer has now spread? Could it have gone from being within the prostate to the bones in 2 years time? 3.Could the radiation have \"knocked\" some of the live cancer cells out of the prostate? Sorry if I sound stupid or ignorant. I am just worried about my dad and I am going crazy waiting for the PET and bone scans but at the same time, I dread him getting them. By the way, he got his blood test results back that he took on the same day (I guess for organ function) and they were all ok.",

It seems like an awful big jump. But I have to keep reminding myself that the doctor says it is not life threatening. I think the doctor is in her 50's. So she's not too young and not too old. I would like to tell my dad to see a cancer doctor as well, but my dad is one of these guys who does what the doctor says. He won't go there unless she makes the appointment for him. I am the one who posted the thread about men no dying from prostate cancer. I figured it would be uplifting to people here as it was for me. I wanted to give others some hope.",

It seems like all doctors do is tell you that you have cancer and send you home. Then you are stuck worrying to death about it. How do they expect anyone not to worry about something like this? Sometimes I feel that I am worrying about nothing and I tell myself that my dad is going to be ok because the doctor is going to take care of him and not just put him in the corner someplace to die. I read that only 3% of people who get prostate cancer (or recurring prostate cancer, I can't remember which) end up dying from it. I tell myself that if it spread he should still be ok with the drugs that are available. Then other times I feel like my dad is going to die soon. I feel that he is doomed if that cancer spread. I keep going up and down on how I feel. My mom tells me to think positive but how can I think positive when I know it is cancer and I know the dangers of cancer? The only thing I can do is pray. I can't change it one way or another. Why do you think my dad needs to see a new doctor? Do you think the one he has now is no good? Yes, she is a urologist. My dad is going for his bone scan and CT or PET tomorrow morning. I am nervous about it and probably will feel uneasy all day, or until I hear the results. Is it possible that my dad's cancer can still be in his prostate? How does the cancer get out of the prostate? I am not sure what scan other than a bone scan that my dad initially had 2 years ago before his radiation. It may have been a CT or PET, even though I said MRI. She told us his cancer was still in the prostate at the time and not in the bones or organs near the prostate. Are you saying she could have been wrong about it? How likely is it for them to find cancer that has spread on this bone scan he is about to have? Just 2 years ago, there was no cancer spotted in the scan. Oh yeah, my mom called the doctor's nurse to get the scoop from her because once my dad found out his cancer was back, that is all he could hear. My mom told the nurse my dad is convinced he is going to die and she said the nurse sounded optimistic. She said, \"Tell him he's not at the end of his road yet.\" I hope she means that and is not just trying to console my dad and make him believe something that isn't true. I don't know if they do that or not. I have never been through anything like this before. I ordered the book that was mentioned here. I can't wait until it gets here. Thanks all for listening. Please pray for him. I will pray for you guys.",

      "Content": "Last week I found out my dad's prostate cancer came back. He was treated with external beam radiation a little over 2 years ago when he was 62. When he was first diagnosed he had a PSA of 16 and Gleason scores of 6, 6, and 7. He got a bone scan back then and it showed no cancer in the bones. He also got an MRI (I think) and it showed the prostate cancer was all contained in the prostate. That's when he got the radiation and after that was over with, he was going for his PSA check every 3 months. I am not exactly sure of his numbers but most were in 0.46-0.72 range. The previous time he was there before last week, he got some kind of a shot and he told me the doctor told him it was to kill any remaining cancer cells. Well this time he went for his blood work and his PSA was 4.3. That's when she told him the cancer was back. He wanted to know how long he has left and the doctor looked at him and said, \"Well it isn't life threatening. If you were dying, I'd tell you that you were.\" Then she said he needs a PET scan and bone scan. If it comes back still in the prostate, he gets Casodex. If it has spread, he gets Provenge. I've read on some sites that once it is in your bones you have about 5 years and Provenge only extends life for about 4 months. But then I also saw a site that says most men with recurring prostate cancer won't die from it. Here's what I keep thinking about... 1.Do you think that if it has spread to his bones that he will live for very long or am I about to lose my dad? 2.What are the odds that the cancer has now spread? Could it have gone from being within the prostate to the bones in 2 years time? 3.Could the radiation have \"knocked\" some of the live cancer cells out of the prostate? Sorry if I sound stupid or ignorant. I am just worried about my dad and I am going crazy waiting for the PET and bone scans but at the same time, I dread him getting them. By the way, he got his blood test results back that he took on the same day (I guess for organ function) and they were all ok.",

I don't know if they do that or not. I have never been through anything like this before. I ordered the book that was mentioned here. I can't wait until it gets here. Thanks all for listening. Please pray for him. I will pray for you guys.",

      "Content": "Last week I found out my dad's prostate cancer came back. He was treated with external beam radiation a little over 2 years ago when he was 62. When he was first diagnosed he had a PSA of 16 and Gleason scores of 6, 6, and 7. He got a bone scan back then and it showed no cancer in the bones. He also got an MRI (I think) and it showed the prostate cancer was all contained in the prostate. That's when he got the radiation and after that was over with, he was going for his PSA check every 3 months. I am not exactly sure of his numbers but most were in 0.46-0.72 range. The previous time he was there before last week, he got some kind of a shot and he told me the doctor told him it was to kill any remaining cancer cells. Well this time he went for his blood work and his PSA was 4.3. That's when she told him the cancer was back. He wanted to know how long he has left and the doctor looked at him and said, \"Well it isn't life threatening. If you were dying, I'd tell you that you were.\" Then she said he needs a PET scan and bone scan. If it comes back still in the prostate, he gets Casodex. If it has spread, he gets Provenge. I've read on some sites that once it is in your bones you have about 5 years and Provenge only extends life for about 4 months. But then I also saw a site that says most men with recurring prostate cancer won't die from it. Here's what I keep thinking about... 1.Do you think that if it has spread to his bones that he will live for very long or am I about to lose my dad? 2.What are the odds that the cancer has now spread? Could it have gone from being within the prostate to the bones in 2 years time? 3.Could the radiation have \"knocked\" some of the live cancer cells out of the prostate? Sorry if I sound stupid or ignorant. I am just worried about my dad and I am going crazy waiting for the PET and bone scans but at the same time, I dread him getting them. By the way, he got his blood test results back that he took on the same day (I guess for organ function) and they were all ok.",

      "Content": "I am also thinking that possibly your husband has had prostate cancer for a long time. Have you asked your husband what he wants to do about his PSA being so high? The doctors can't make him do anything he doesn't want to do. When he would go to talk to the doctor about what to do, he would help make the decision, not just the doctor alone. Is there a way you could talk to your husband about not being so anti-medicine? I can understand that he is a stubborn man but there are others in life that care about him and would want him to be well. Maybe that will convince him to go to the doctor and do the biopsy. Perhaps your husband is afraid of being diagnosed with cancer. I think once a person knows he/she has cancer and is labeled with the diagnosis, it changes how a person feels. Have you heard the saying, \"Ignorance is bliss?\" Maybe that is what is going on. I do think he should go to the doctor though, to find out what is going on and what they recommend doing, by taking his wishes into consideration and trying to work with them. I read a web site, or a few web sites, which said that only about 3% of men die of prostate cancer. While no cancer is good, it's not the worst cancer out there to have. My dad's doctor told him if she was a man and she had to have cancer and she could choose the cancer she had to have, she would choose to have prostate cancer.",
