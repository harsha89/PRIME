      "Content": "Hey all \u0096 new here. I've started lurking a bit in the winter after my first (negative) biopsy. Now I'm officially diagnosed with PC. I'm only 50 and it seems to have been caught early - it was only caught in 1 of 14 samples in the 2nd biopsy (3+4=7 index). The specifics from the tests are at the bottom. I have an appointment in a week with a 'multi-disciplinary' team to discuss treatment. I'm a bit squeamish over the medical information - something I know I need to get over to make good choices. Even reading some of the posts is tough for me to get through. This is happening on top of a divorce - actually 1st high PSA result happened close to her filing. Hopefully that get finalized in the next couple of months. Still, that's leaving me with relatively little support (my siblings live two hours away and my kids are in high school). Not having someone to bounce things off of is going to be tough. Because of my situation, the ED worries me - but I realize it's probably temporary and I wasn't really planning on getting 'back in the game' for a while. I guess someday I'll need to find someone understanding. .. I've seen some references to 'the book' . . is that the book by DR. Walsh? I think it is, but couldn't find that specifically stated in a post. Don't have any specific questions - just wanted to introduce and let go of some fears. Thanks.

      "Content": "Hey all \u0096 new here. I've started lurking a bit in the winter after my first (negative) biopsy. Now I'm officially diagnosed with PC. I'm only 50 and it seems to have been caught early - it was only caught in 1 of 14 samples in the 2nd biopsy (3+4=7 index). The specifics from the tests are at the bottom. I have an appointment in a week with a 'multi-disciplinary' team to discuss treatment. I'm a bit squeamish over the medical information - something I know I need to get over to make good choices. Even reading some of the posts is tough for me to get through. This is happening on top of a divorce - actually 1st high PSA result happened close to her filing. Hopefully that get finalized in the next couple of months. Still, that's leaving me with relatively little support (my siblings live two hours away and my kids are in high school). Not having someone to bounce things off of is going to be tough. Because of my situation, the ED worries me - but I realize it's probably temporary and I wasn't really planning on getting 'back in the game' for a while. I guess someday I'll need to find someone understanding. .. I've seen some references to 'the book' . . is that the book by DR. Walsh? I think it is, but couldn't find that specifically stated in a post. Don't have any specific questions - just wanted to introduce and let go of some fears. Thanks.

      "Content": "I'm going on my 1st post-op date this Friday night. Also my 1st date in 20 years . My ex filed for divorce about the time I was diagnosed and then it was finalized about 1 year ago. Had the operation 8 months ago. Operation went well and my recovery seemed quick. No incontinence problems after about 2 months. Started having occasional full erections at about 3 months while taking Cialis (2.5 mg/2 days) However. . .I have noticed that my erections (without the Cialis) are certainly not as firm and don't last very long. Getting curious, I tried a small dose of the sildenafil and wasn't thrilled with the results (don't have prescription with me but it says 1-5 pills, I took 1). I was not happy with the results of one pill and am a bit worried. I say 1st date, but really this is someone with whom I've had a friendship and we are ramping it up. We came to this conclusion and then we took turns travelling out of town for two weeks with finally being in the same place this weekend. (we actually have 2nd +3rd dates planned to ) So we're moving a bit quick and I think that's ok. She's good people and I'm not completely afraid of talking about it to her, but I'm still in a bit of a panic - maybe unfounded. Any advice here on how to handle sex with a new partner with the possible ED? Again, she should be understanding - we've discussed some aspects of the surgery although not ED specifically. I didn't notice much 'extra' from the one pill - will the max dosage make big difference? Does it make any sense at all to try a bigger dosage in the next couple of days just to know what to expect... or just leave it alone? In the past I never saw much difference with small amounts of alcohol . .does drinking one or two beers to take the edge off make any sense? Any suggestions for success? (Honestly, I do realize I'm in a bit of a panic that I need to talk through with her and perhaps a the therapist from the hospital . . still wanting some thoughts though) Thanks, R",

For me the Prelude worked ok for it's purpose (It's a therapy device, not a aide for intercourse so it's not for achieving full erection) I found the pump difficult to use and only tried it a couple times (probably just me, because I know it worked for others)",
