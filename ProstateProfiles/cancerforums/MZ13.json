Forgot to mention that - I am very much physically active. As of late I have not felt run down. In fact less run down. And that is probably due to diet changes for the better. But I have some leg and back issues, coupled with my first uro's scare, that make for anxiety. But 3 other doctors, two GP's and my new uro do not think I have to worry. The time spans for the PSA's were 8.4 in October, 8.4 in November, 7.4 in January.",
