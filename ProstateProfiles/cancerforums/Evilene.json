      "Content": "Hello, My name is Evilene, and I'm writing because my husband had a 2.3 PSA only 2 years ago. No PSA was taken last year. A month ago he went in because he felt bad, had temp and then asked the Dr. to do his PSA as it was due. BTW...we live in Texas. The Dr. did the test and saw him again in a couple of days. His score was 85!!!! The Dr. just about came out of his seat. He mentioned that is might be an infection, but could also be cancer and maybe aggressive. My husband will be 62 next month. The Dr. gave him a couple of antibiotics and said that would be what the urologist would do, but if we wanted to visit with her, we surely could. Now this Dr. is REALLY a good one...went to Standford. I imediately made an appointment with the urologist which we saw the next day. I took care of my elderly mother for 10 years so have always been the information getter and \"johnny on the spot\". She again told him to take the 2 antibiotics and come back in a month for a FPSA. He did this yesterday and his score was 117! He is actually feeling good now, but the Dr. is mistified as why it didn't go down and went up higher. When she did her exam a month ago she said that it felt \"mussy\" and \"hot\" which usually means infection....but could not be sure. My husband has been trying to find articles, etc. He is an academic so can read all of the statistical data correctly, but not finding much. When I saw this forum I thought it might help. Currently they have scheduled the biopsy for Tuesday of next week and this is Thursday. I am wondering if more can be done now. If after the biopsy nothing is found...what then. When do they do a scan or MRI? I had wanted them to do a scan/MRI in the BEGINNING in case it was an aggressive cancer and had spread as they should be able to see it....shouldn't they? I would appreciate some help in this. I'm wanting to get my ducks in a row so I will have an idea of what route to take depending on the outcome. Will they be able to detect if it is an enlarged prostate? Is there any consistency in these REALLY HIGH scores as to what is happening? I had read a bit about MD Anderson just 3 hours from us and considered that as an alternative. Please let me know any information that you have. We are both rather frustrated and feel that we just don't have information. Thank you so much, Evilene",

I will let you'al know the results of the biopsy when we get them...hopeufully by the end of the week. Thanks for reminding me about the insurance. I have worked for 2 insurance companies after...used to teach elem music. I worked in marketing, but knew all about those little issues and have also dealt with them before. I will need to make sure that the dr./staff handles it all correctly. Not on an HMO now, but POS...almost like a PPO, but still needs some referals. We never had POS when I worked. I now sub in the schools on my own schedule. Again, THANKS! for all of you info and sincere comments. Evilene",

      "Content": "Hello, My name is Evilene, and I'm writing because my husband had a 2.3 PSA only 2 years ago. No PSA was taken last year. A month ago he went in because he felt bad, had temp and then asked the Dr. to do his PSA as it was due. BTW...we live in Texas. The Dr. did the test and saw him again in a couple of days. His score was 85!!!! The Dr. just about came out of his seat. He mentioned that is might be an infection, but could also be cancer and maybe aggressive. My husband will be 62 next month. The Dr. gave him a couple of antibiotics and said that would be what the urologist would do, but if we wanted to visit with her, we surely could. Now this Dr. is REALLY a good one...went to Standford. I imediately made an appointment with the urologist which we saw the next day. I took care of my elderly mother for 10 years so have always been the information getter and \"johnny on the spot\". She again told him to take the 2 antibiotics and come back in a month for a FPSA. He did this yesterday and his score was 117! He is actually feeling good now, but the Dr. is mistified as why it didn't go down and went up higher. When she did her exam a month ago she said that it felt \"mussy\" and \"hot\" which usually means infection....but could not be sure. My husband has been trying to find articles, etc. He is an academic so can read all of the statistical data correctly, but not finding much. When I saw this forum I thought it might help. Currently they have scheduled the biopsy for Tuesday of next week and this is Thursday. I am wondering if more can be done now. If after the biopsy nothing is found...what then. When do they do a scan or MRI? I had wanted them to do a scan/MRI in the BEGINNING in case it was an aggressive cancer and had spread as they should be able to see it....shouldn't they? I would appreciate some help in this. I'm wanting to get my ducks in a row so I will have an idea of what route to take depending on the outcome. Will they be able to detect if it is an enlarged prostate? Is there any consistency in these REALLY HIGH scores as to what is happening? I had read a bit about MD Anderson just 3 hours from us and considered that as an alternative. Please let me know any information that you have. We are both rather frustrated and feel that we just don't have information. Thank you so much, Evilene",

In fact the sermon was about suffering. The comments you sent will give my husband something to think about and know that there is a place to talk and find more info. from people who have been there. I will let you'al know the results of the biopsy when we get them...hopeufully by the end of the week. Thanks for reminding me about the insurance. I have worked for 2 insurance companies after...used to teach elem music. I worked in marketing, but knew all about those little issues and have also dealt with them before. I will need to make sure that the dr./staff handles it all correctly. Not on an HMO now, but POS...almost like a PPO, but still needs some referals. We never had POS when I worked. I now sub in the schools on my own schedule. Again, THANKS! for all of you info and sincere comments. Evilene",

      "Content": "Hello, My name is Evilene, and I'm writing because my husband had a 2.3 PSA only 2 years ago. No PSA was taken last year. A month ago he went in because he felt bad, had temp and then asked the Dr. to do his PSA as it was due. BTW...we live in Texas. The Dr. did the test and saw him again in a couple of days. His score was 85!!!! The Dr. just about came out of his seat. He mentioned that is might be an infection, but could also be cancer and maybe aggressive. My husband will be 62 next month. The Dr. gave him a couple of antibiotics and said that would be what the urologist would do, but if we wanted to visit with her, we surely could. Now this Dr. is REALLY a good one...went to Standford. I imediately made an appointment with the urologist which we saw the next day. I took care of my elderly mother for 10 years so have always been the information getter and \"johnny on the spot\". She again told him to take the 2 antibiotics and come back in a month for a FPSA. He did this yesterday and his score was 117! He is actually feeling good now, but the Dr. is mistified as why it didn't go down and went up higher. When she did her exam a month ago she said that it felt \"mussy\" and \"hot\" which usually means infection....but could not be sure. My husband has been trying to find articles, etc. He is an academic so can read all of the statistical data correctly, but not finding much. When I saw this forum I thought it might help. Currently they have scheduled the biopsy for Tuesday of next week and this is Thursday. I am wondering if more can be done now. If after the biopsy nothing is found...what then. When do they do a scan or MRI? I had wanted them to do a scan/MRI in the BEGINNING in case it was an aggressive cancer and had spread as they should be able to see it....shouldn't they? I would appreciate some help in this. I'm wanting to get my ducks in a row so I will have an idea of what route to take depending on the outcome. Will they be able to detect if it is an enlarged prostate? Is there any consistency in these REALLY HIGH scores as to what is happening? I had read a bit about MD Anderson just 3 hours from us and considered that as an alternative. Please let me know any information that you have. We are both rather frustrated and feel that we just don't have information. Thank you so much, Evilene",
