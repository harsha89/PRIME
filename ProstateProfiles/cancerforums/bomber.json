One day I was ok with it, the next I was freaking out about the cancer spreading. I realized that my quality of life was getting worse each month. I decided to have robotic surgery this past nov. It has worked well for me. Im doing fine and I dont think about cancer with every bite of food and 10 times during every tv program. My surgeon was great and I am wearing 1 pad a day now. I am 62 years old and my doc told me that now I can live until my heart stops not until my prostate cancer kills me1 Good luck with yur decision and God Bless.
