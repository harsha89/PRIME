      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with Prostate Cancer (Gleason 6, PSA 5.8, 1 of 12 cores had cancer and that core show only 5%) so I am somewhat fortunate for that. My urologists indicated that I would be a candidate for Active Surveillance (AS) but also outlined the various radiation and surgery options. After doing some general research I am not comfortable with the AS or radiation options and will likely pursue surgery. Have not decided yet on Robotic or Open. Although I am leaning toward Robotic. Has anyone pursued the surgery option in either Honolulu or Las Vegas? (I live in Hawaii and have a condo in Las Vegas). How was that experience, how did you select your surgeon, and who did you select. I am so grateful for having found this forum. This type of expertise and willingness to help is very much appreciated. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Otago How recent is \"recently diagnosed\"... ? Meaning how much time have you had to evaluate your situation? What is your age and what is your complete PSA history... especially the dates and results of your past few years of PSA tests? Was your PSA tested again after your 5.8 ? How long after that 5.8 was taken? Were your 12 biopsy cores read for a second opinion by some place like John Hopkins? What is your time frame for action? Otago, thanks for your reply. I am 62. Diagnosed 12/5/2014. So I am just getting into the research. My time frame for action is the next 3-6 months. (I don\u0092t want any chance of it spreading so I am being aggressive). I have not gotten a second opinion on the Biopsy results. I was told the PSA results while taking the Finasteride and Tamsulosin should be doubled because they artificially lower the PSA reading by that amount. So 2.89 x 2 is about 6.8. Here is some history: 6/2008 : 2.2 6/2009: 8.6 Biopsy taken: Negative for Cancer: No Meds No treatment 9/2009: 2.5 12/2009 to 12/2012 <2.5 6/2013: 7.8; Physical exam showed enlarged Prostate one side; Finasteride and Tamsulosin Prescribed 12/2013: 3.2; Some enlargement still present; continue meds. 9/2014: 2.89; Enlargement much reduced but Dr. feels \u0093nodule\u0094 11/2014: Biopsy done (12 cores- 6 per side) 12/5: Biopsy results (1 core positive; 5% cancer; Gleason 3 + 3)",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Welcome to the forum. Sorry that you have PC, but very happy that it is the low risk type. Yes, you are a prime candidate for AS. At the same time, biopsies can be wrong about 20% of the time, which means there is always a chance of a more aggressive tumor that the biopsy missed. With that said, your PSA would \"suggest\" that Gleason 6 is all you have and that AS would be fine. But I tend to agree with you about wanting to do treatment instead. I live in the NW Indiana area, just outside of Chicago. But I still flew to Mayo Clinic in Minnesota for a second opinion and also for my da Vinci surgery. While I would recommend a trip to Mayo for you, you should also be able to find excellent surgeons in either Hawaii or Las Vegas. Perhaps others in the forum have more direct knowledge of doctors in those areas. If not, you can do a few tricks to try and find an experienced/competent doctor. Start checking the larger clinics -- which is where such surgeries are apt to be performed on a more frequent basis. Whether you choose open or da Vinci, you'll want to ensure that the surgeon has performed at least 300 of them because there is a long learning curve involved. In the meantime, you would probably owe it to yourself to investigate ALL possible forms of treatment. I tend to be a surgery guy, but always recommend that a newly DXd patient also consult with an experienced radiation oncologist to learn the pros and cons of radioactive seeds or external beam radiation. Once you know the ins and outs of radiation and surgery, you can make your final choice of treatment. With a Gleason 6 likely to be your only type of PC, you have PLENTY of time to plan your treatment. No need at all to rush into anything. You might also read the 3rd edition of the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer\" by Dr Pat Walsh. You'll learn a lot about PC in this easy to understand book. In the meantime, stick around the forum with us and you'll get lots of info, advice, thoughts & comments from the others. Good luck! Chuck Chuck, really appreciate all you do on this forum particularly taking the time to provide individual responses to pretty much everyone here. You are a God send. Anyway, I am usually the proactive type and am finding difficulty not rushing into even though I am fortunate in having some time to make the best decision possible. I will try to slow down. On of my issues is I live on \"The Big Island\" (Kona) and will have to air travel either to Oahu (Honolulu) or to the Mainland for the surgery. In all you have heard or experienced how much time should I plan to spend in the location where I have the surgery and how soon could I be expected to fly. What are some consideration in traveling after the surgery that I am sure I am not thinking about right now? I would really prefer to recover at my residence but it is not a show stopper.",
