      "Content": "Hi Richard, my PSA was checked in 2002 at age 47 by my family doctor, it came out at 2.2. He said I should see a uroligist. I did, he checked my prostate and said it was enlarged a little on one side, no biopsy, see you next year. 2003 PSA is 5.5 did a biopsy with 6 samples coming back neg, he says see you next year, 2004 PSA up to 8 did biopsy with 6 samples coming back neg, he says see you next year. 2005 PSA up to 46, sent me to have another PSA test in a month and it went up to 56. He then did my third biopsy. Took 10 samples with 3 coming back positive. Sent me for bone scan and CT scan. He said the cancer has escaped my prostate and is now in my scapula (shoulder blade ) I took my first hormone injection ($2700.00)in Sept of 2005 and it brought my PSA down to 0. I also take Casodex ($440.00 for 30 pills) This seems to be working well for now but the truth is once it has spread average life is 14 to 21 months. Looking back, I wish I had a biopsy every six months and with more samples while my PSA was going up. If they can find it while it is still in your prostate, they can remove the prostate and you would be good for probably 15 years. Oh yeah, I forgot to say that to this day, I have no symptoms. I would not even know I have it if they were not telling it to me. I would ask that he do a bone scan and a Ct scan now. Hope this helps you.Thanks Greg.",

      "Content": "Hi Richard, my PSA was checked in 2002 at age 47 by my family doctor, it came out at 2.2. He said I should see a uroligist. I did, he checked my prostate and said it was enlarged a little on one side, no biopsy, see you next year. 2003 PSA is 5.5 did a biopsy with 6 samples coming back neg, he says see you next year, 2004 PSA up to 8 did biopsy with 6 samples coming back neg, he says see you next year. 2005 PSA up to 46, sent me to have another PSA test in a month and it went up to 56. He then did my third biopsy. Took 10 samples with 3 coming back positive. Sent me for bone scan and CT scan. He said the cancer has escaped my prostate and is now in my scapula (shoulder blade ) I took my first hormone injection ($2700.00)in Sept of 2005 and it brought my PSA down to 0. I also take Casodex ($440.00 for 30 pills) This seems to be working well for now but the truth is once it has spread average life is 14 to 21 months. Looking back, I wish I had a biopsy every six months and with more samples while my PSA was going up. If they can find it while it is still in your prostate, they can remove the prostate and you would be good for probably 15 years. Oh yeah, I forgot to say that to this day, I have no symptoms. I would not even know I have it if they were not telling it to me. I would ask that he do a bone scan and a Ct scan now. Hope this helps you.Thanks Greg.",
