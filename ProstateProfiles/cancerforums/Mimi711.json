      "Content": "Obviously I've been under a rock. DH is five-weeks post op. A few days after the catheter was removed, he started on a daily low-dose of Cialis. Now he's supposed to switch to Viagra. Not sure for how long, but for at least a month. So we went to the pharmacy today to pick up DH's Viagra. The guy there told us that our insurance will cover only THREE pills. And that the next SEVEN pills, without insurance, would cost us about $270. We took back the written prescription and decided to research this and re-group. So the question now is where do you all get your Viagra, or the generic equivalent?Does anyone have an online site they use and trust? I read some old posts about Canadian pharmacies but I couldn't find anything recent. I would appreciate some advice on this. Thanks, Mimi711",

      "Content": "Hi all. As soon as we get back to our more normal routines, I plan to write a post about DH's robotic RP which was last week. For now, I have a question regarding lymph nodes. Prior to the surgery, the plan was that the lymph nodes would be sampled with additional nodes to be removed if they looked enlarged. Right after the surgery, DH's surgeon told me that there weren't many lymph nodes there, that there was a lot of fatty tissue on one side, but that he did sample the nodes. The post-op pathology report states that two lymph nodes were removed, one from the right side and one from the left. The report describes the specimen labeled \"left pelvic lymph node\" but then states: \"Sectioning reveals unremarkable adipose tissue, no lymph node grossly is identified.\" It looks as if the surgeon intended to take out a lymph node from the left side but ended up only with fatty tissue. So where are the lymph nodes on that side? We meet with the surgeon later today and I'm not sure what to ask. Has anyone else had this happen? More importantly, should we be concerned, given the size and how close it was to the capsule, that no lymph node sampling was done on that one side? There had to be lymph nodes there, somewhere, right? Thanks, Mimi Here are relevant parts from the path report: Robotic RP on Aug 20, 2014: still 3+4=7 (whew!) Moderately involved, bilaterally, 25% -EPE; -SVI; +PNI; (intraprostatic); -Lymph node Pseudocapsule penetrated but not capsule itself",

Makes me think that this particular surgeon doesn't spend much time looking for those lymph nodes--although before surgery he had indicated that the nodes would be sampled. Guess there's nothing to do about it now but it does make me wonder . . . .",

      "Content": "Hi John, Thanks very much for a very thorough response. I appreciate the information and the care you took to present it. The numbers do make me feel better about DH's prognosis. (Sometimes my imagination takes over.) One of the issues we're having (between me and DH) is that I have a burning need to completely understand the pathology report and the implications, while DH is happy to think that it's all good news. Not that I want it to be bad news; I just can't relax and believe it's truly good news if it's only good news because we didn't ask the right questions. I don't know if that makes any sense but I'll try to not think that way.",

(FYI Amazon is fighting with the book's publisher and is delaying delivery so get it somewhere else.) Here is a list of questions we prepared for our second surgery consult. They may involve issues not relevant in your case so tailor as you see fit. Let me know if you have any questions. Questions for surgeon: Any change from first pathology report? What stage? Predictions or stats re outside prostate or recurrence after surgery Imaging tests: Multiparametric 3T MRI \u2013 When to do it; where to do it; with what radiologist to read results. (Who is going to order this?) Surgeon's experience and stats: How many cases in a day? In a week? How many days a week do you operate? Number of prostatectomies done\u2014both open and robotic Incidence of recurrence\u2014both open and robotic Stats re positive margins Does doctor keep data on patient's outcomes after surgery, including cancer control and side effects, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. (Doctors often do not provide full information about side effects from their procedures. Speak to survivors in a prostate cancer patient support group in your area to get information from men who have had surgery.) Rates for incontinence (how defined and at what time after Surgery) Rates for potency (how defined and at what time after surgery) Incidence of infection\u2014both open and robotic Has he ever had to switch from robotic to open? How many times? Does he do entire surgery? Are there multiple surgery rooms at the same time? What does he do with lymphnodes? What does he do with bladder? What percentage of patients eventually require an artificial sphincter? Any special preparations for surgery? (kegels; diet; store blood; bladder stretching to increase capacity, no sit ups, etc) If doctor recommends radical prostatectomy, open or robotic laparoscopic surgery? Discuss impact of husband's previous procedures Likelihood of nerve preservation on the left side? What does he do to spare the nerve? Likelihood of extracapsular extension on the left side? Timing of surgery: How long after biopsy? Then how long can we wait before having surgery? Any other appts before actual surgery? Post-Op: --recovery period? When back to work? --follow-up tests and appts; timing of PSA tests --any things to help w ED such as vacuum erection device and/or Viagra --try all three ED meds to see what works for him? --does the practice have a specialist to help with ED and incontinence issues? My concerns about small cell, or other aggressive cancers that don\u2019t make much PSA. Way to rule out now? Advanced blood tests: Oncotype DX Prolaris If GS 7(3+4) prostate cancer, in just a small area of his prostate gland, can the area of cancer be treated (focal ablation), rather than the entire prostate(prostatectomy)?

      "Content": "Sorry about your diagnosis. If you haven't already done so, try to get a copy of Dr. Walsh's book on surviving prostate cancer. I think it's the third edition. (FYI Amazon is fighting with the book's publisher and is delaying delivery so get it somewhere else.) Here is a list of questions we prepared for our second surgery consult. They may involve issues not relevant in your case so tailor as you see fit. Let me know if you have any questions. Questions for surgeon: Any change from first pathology report? What stage? Predictions or stats re outside prostate or recurrence after surgery Imaging tests: Multiparametric 3T MRI \u2013 When to do it; where to do it; with what radiologist to read results. (Who is going to order this?) Surgeon's experience and stats: How many cases in a day? In a week? How many days a week do you operate? Number of prostatectomies done\u2014both open and robotic Incidence of recurrence\u2014both open and robotic Stats re positive margins Does doctor keep data on patient's outcomes after surgery, including cancer control and side effects, such as urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. (Doctors often do not provide full information about side effects from their procedures. Speak to survivors in a prostate cancer patient support group in your area to get information from men who have had surgery.) Rates for incontinence (how defined and at what time after Surgery) Rates for potency (how defined and at what time after surgery) Incidence of infection\u2014both open and robotic Has he ever had to switch from robotic to open? How many times? Does he do entire surgery? Are there multiple surgery rooms at the same time? What does he do with lymphnodes? What does he do with bladder? What percentage of patients eventually require an artificial sphincter? Any special preparations for surgery? (kegels; diet; store blood; bladder stretching to increase capacity, no sit ups, etc) If doctor recommends radical prostatectomy, open or robotic laparoscopic surgery? Discuss impact of husband's previous procedures Likelihood of nerve preservation on the left side? What does he do to spare the nerve? Likelihood of extracapsular extension on the left side? Timing of surgery: How long after biopsy? Then how long can we wait before having surgery? Any other appts before actual surgery? Post-Op: --recovery period? When back to work? --follow-up tests and appts; timing of PSA tests --any things to help w ED such as vacuum erection device and/or Viagra --try all three ED meds to see what works for him? --does the practice have a specialist to help with ED and incontinence issues? My concerns about small cell, or other aggressive cancers that don\u2019t make much PSA. Way to rule out now? Advanced blood tests: Oncotype DX Prolaris If GS 7(3+4) prostate cancer, in just a small area of his prostate gland, can the area of cancer be treated (focal ablation), rather than the entire prostate(prostatectomy)?

      "Content": "DH had a palpable mass on the left side, near the base, so his urologist wanted to focus on that area. He still took the usual 12 samples, but he concentrated on the base of both the right and left lobes. So one left apex, two left mid and then three left base--instead of two in each area. Same pattern on the right side. He told us something about spacing the left base samples a certain distance apart to make it more likely for him to actually \"hit\" the mass. And it worked. We had not discussed any of this detail beforehand. Only learned about his plan when we were going over the path report. It worked in this case although, interestingly, none of the six samples on the right picked up any cancer--and it was there, too. So if there is a palpable mass, and the urologist has some idea of where he felt it, he might want to do the same thing. But talk about it. Never hurts to ask. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Thanks for the responses. What is complicating things is that we're traveling to NYC for the surgery but aren't sure yet where DH will have his post-op PSA tests done. Traveling to NYC for a blood test doesn't sound like a great plan, especially if he's going to be tested every three months that first year. (Can't remember surgeon's recommended schedule.) But I thought I read that you should try to use the same lab every time, or at least the same assay, so I'd like to have some kind of plan in place. Which is why I asked about ultra-sensitive vs. regular. I'll see what the surgeon recommends. Thanks again for your input. Mimi711",

Just thought I would throw that in anyway. I suggested a list of meds because even though DH had amended the meds list a zillion times, the old unamended list kept showing up--even with the anesthesiologist right before surgery. Very frustrating. And the hospital did supply most of DH's regular meds but there was one glitch, so it was good that we had his meds on hand. OTOH, they sent us home with lots of stuff that I thought we would have to buy. I'll list those at another time though every hospital varies.",

I ask because our first urologist sent the biopsy cores to a \"general\" pathologist. When I was doing research, I learned that people frequently send the slides for a second opinion to a pathologist who specializes in prostate or genito-urinary biopsies (don't know if I spelled that correctly). Many recommend Epstein at Johns Hopkins or Bostwick. Our second opinion surgeon required that we send DH's slides to their pathologist. And our third surgeon did, too.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I've been lurking for a couple weeks (had trouble registering) and want to thank everyone (especially Highlander) for all their support and willingness to educate and share. My husband was diagnosed a month ago: He is 50 with a family history (dad) of PCa. DH's regular doctor found a nodule on DRE--same time as a jump in PSA to 1.7. Biopsy done end of June: 1 of 12 cores positive at 50%, 3+4=7 Gleason. Second opinion path report found 3 of 12 cores positive at 50%, 3+4=7 Gleason. Radiation oncologist said that DH is not a good candidate for radiation and, frankly, we just want it gone. DH is scheduled for robotic RP in less than two weeks. The surgeon ordered a bone scan and MRI. No signs of cancer beyond the one known lesion which is estimated to be 1.1 cm, bigger than originally thought. Our main question for now is how to reconcile the really low PSA with a 1.1 cm lesion. Has anyone had or known of similar numbers? Thanks for any insight, Mimi711",

I realize that worrying about whether it's aggressive, or whether the Gleason will be upgraded, isn't going to change anything so I should focus now on getting ready for the surgery. Lots to do before we travel for the operation. Yes, I am very happy that DH has the \"good\" kind of 7. Incredibly, when the urologist called with the pathology results, he told us it was a 7 and we didn't know enough then to ask. I did some research, called the office and was able to get an answer from one of the nurses--right before they closed for a three-day holiday weekend. So weird looking back that, before the biopsy, I had done some research on biopsies, and had known to ask about an MRI-fusion type biopsy (which that urologist said was unnecessary) and yet I hadn't known anything about Gleason scores. btw, DH's prostate is less than 30 grams.

I actually typed, submitted, then deleted a very similar post regarding (what I call) prophylactic radiation--ie, radiation treatment before the PSA becomes detectable. I'm kind of confused as to the circumstances that would warrant one having radiation therapy prior to the PSA becoming detectable. I'm assuming ECE and EPE on the path report is one. And maybe positive lymph node or SV involvement? But when it comes to positive margins, does it matter how many positive areas there are? The size of the positive area? The kinds of cancer cells at the margin? Are there different kinds of positive margins? Or does it come down to doctor preference? Are some more likely to recommend it than others?",

      "Content": "Hi Brave, I should explain since our experience probably is not typical: DH forgot his toothbrush and they did provide one--along with a comb and other things. Just thought I would throw that in anyway. I suggested a list of meds because even though DH had amended the meds list a zillion times, the old unamended list kept showing up--even with the anesthesiologist right before surgery. Very frustrating. And the hospital did supply most of DH's regular meds but there was one glitch, so it was good that we had his meds on hand. OTOH, they sent us home with lots of stuff that I thought we would have to buy. I'll list those at another time though every hospital varies.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. I've been lurking for a couple weeks (had trouble registering) and want to thank everyone (especially Highlander) for all their support and willingness to educate and share. My husband was diagnosed a month ago: He is 50 with a family history (dad) of PCa. DH's regular doctor found a nodule on DRE--same time as a jump in PSA to 1.7. Biopsy done end of June: 1 of 12 cores positive at 50%, 3+4=7 Gleason. Second opinion path report found 3 of 12 cores positive at 50%, 3+4=7 Gleason. Radiation oncologist said that DH is not a good candidate for radiation and, frankly, we just want it gone. DH is scheduled for robotic RP in less than two weeks. The surgeon ordered a bone scan and MRI. No signs of cancer beyond the one known lesion which is estimated to be 1.1 cm, bigger than originally thought. Our main question for now is how to reconcile the really low PSA with a 1.1 cm lesion. Has anyone had or known of similar numbers? Thanks for any insight, Mimi711",

I realize that worrying about whether it's aggressive, or whether the Gleason will be upgraded, isn't going to change anything so I should focus now on getting ready for the surgery. Lots to do before we travel for the operation. Yes, I am very happy that DH has the \"good\" kind of 7. Incredibly, when the urologist called with the pathology results, he told us it was a 7 and we didn't know enough then to ask. I did some research, called the office and was able to get an answer from one of the nurses--right before they closed for a three-day holiday weekend. So weird looking back that, before the biopsy, I had done some research on biopsies, and had known to ask about an MRI-fusion type biopsy (which that urologist said was unnecessary) and yet I hadn't known anything about Gleason scores. btw, DH's prostate is less than 30 grams.

      "Content": "Thank you Chuck and Newporter for your responses. I've been mulling over this and, before I talk to the surgeon about this, I thought I'd run this by you both--and anyone else who wants to chime in. My reading of the path report is like yours: there are two small positive spots at the surgical margin. I'm not sure how to reconcile that conclusion with the surgeon's comments to us that the margins were negative. Is he discounting or dismissing the two small spots as irrelevant? Are the positive margins in the pseudocapsule which the PA said was inside the actual capsule? (The PA explained that the cancer had gone thru the pseudocapsule but not the capsule.) If so, why did the pathologist use the word margin at all? Or maybe the surgeon was thinking of someone else's path report when he was talking to us? From my reading, I've learned that there is no true capsule around the entire prostate. There is a membrane around part of it (capsule membrane), and a more fibrous part that makes up the \"edge\" in other places (pseudocapsule). And I believe there's a part of the prostate that has both a pseudocapsular layer and a capsule membrane--but I'm not sure where that part is, or if that's what's going on here. Can anyone shed any light on this? Additionally, the original pathology report doesn't include the size of the focally positive area, or the kinds of cancer cells that are there. Everything is getting sent to Jonathan Epstein at Johns Hopkins for a second opinion. Assuming there are positive margins, will he automatically provide that info? Thanks for your help, Mimi711",

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, I agree. It would be very helpful if urologists had a model or other visual aid so that they could explain where the cancer was. In DH's case, any explanation would have been helpful. I'm still trying to reconcile how the cancer can be at the edge of the surgical margin (what the path report indicates) AND millimeters away from escaping the prostate (what the surgeon said). I also would have liked a more thorough pathology report that stated where the cancer was. Hopefully the second opinion will provide more info. Thanks again, Mimi711 PS There is an article that talks about the pseudocapsule, and that there is no true capsule.

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, I agree. It would be very helpful if urologists had a model or other visual aid so that they could explain where the cancer was. In DH's case, any explanation would have been helpful. I'm still trying to reconcile how the cancer can be at the edge of the surgical margin (what the path report indicates) AND millimeters away from escaping the prostate (what the surgeon said). I also would have liked a more thorough pathology report that stated where the cancer was. Hopefully the second opinion will provide more info. Thanks again, Mimi711 PS There is an article that talks about the pseudocapsule, and that there is no true capsule. I found the language in the full article which, for some reason, I can no longer access: http://www.jurology.com/article/S002...667-3/abstract",

      "Content": "Here is the language from DH's post-op pathology report: Margins: Focally positive left posterior mid and superior pseudocapsular resection margin. All other margins negative for tumor. So, does this mean that the margins are positive? The very language (\"All other margins . . . .\") seems to imply that. And is it significant that they're talking about a resection margin? I've tried to figure this out myself, but I'm only confused by the bits of info I've gleaned. If anyone can shed light on this I would be very grateful. Thanks, Mimi711",
