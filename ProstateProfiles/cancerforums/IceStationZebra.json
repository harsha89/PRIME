Uro oncologist said the old school method was to re biopsy in 3 months but felt there was no merit to that any longer and felt that was too aggressive.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate It seems that you have already been on AS for the past year. Your steadily rising psa and low free psa are cause for continued close monitoring. If you have HGPIN or ASAP, there is no certainty that they will ever become true cancer, or at least not a significant cancer. Your idea for future testing in the next year makes sense. I would suggest PHI rather than psa/fpsa tests, and also that you track your PHI density, which Johns Hopkins has found to be the most reliable test for future significant PCa. See there it is...more stuff I didn\u0092t know! 😀 Can you clue me in what HGPIN or ASAP or PHI are? In all my thread crashing , never heard of those.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate It seems that you have already been on AS for the past year. Your steadily rising psa and low free psa are cause for continued close monitoring. If you have HGPIN or ASAP, there is no certainty that they will ever become true cancer, or at least not a significant cancer. Your idea for future testing in the next year makes sense. I would suggest PHI rather than psa/fpsa tests, and also that you track your PHI density, which Johns Hopkins has found to be the most reliable test for future significant PCa. See there it is...more stuff I didn\u0092t know! 😀 Can you clue me in what HGPIN or ASAP or PHI are? In all my thread crashing , never heard of those.",

      "Content": "Djin, The odd thing is that my signature is there. In fact I just edited it to add my new results. I have no idea why it\u0092s there sometimes and sometimes not. Strange. The only thing that concerns me is that this was my second biopsy with the first 12 core random (March 2018 ) being totally clean. The March 2019 2 core fusion (on the pirads 3/4) was clean but hey then did a random 10 core after the fusion. 8 were clean, 1 precancerous and 1 G6. So I would Love to say this is just more G6 but the probability of that seems less given that I\u0092ve had 22 samples taken across the prostate and only 1 came back with a 2mm G6. That seems to make it less likely of wide spread G6. As much as I hate it, this seems like something more significant that was missed. But then again it could be prostatitis starting or ending. The pirads 3/4 was indicative of prostatitis or scarring so maybe I have another case. As far as the new provider, I had the 3t in Dec 2018 and that drove the fusion biopsy I had in March 2019 I certainly hope that is close enough I don\u0092t have to do either again. I definitely want another biopsy as soon as possible though. So to summarize we don\u0092t know Jack! 😀 Thanks guys I hope y\u0092all have a great Easter weekend and hopefully some downtime.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Glad to see you back. A few notes in the use of language. Unless you are in a professionally managed and monitored AS program you are not in AS. Managing this on your own is valid and taking time to assess your situation is valid, but it is not AS. Your clarity in this disease will come with clarity in your language. Your thoughts, actions and outcomes will follow a shift to your clear use of language around this disease. Most are not clear that our language drives our knowledge and actions and not our thoughts. Once you are clear in the language of this desease you will be clear in your actions. The use of testosterone, regardless of purpose, can manifest in smaller more agressive cancer that is difficult to find and can present early in younger men. Glad you have stopped it. I have two friends my age who are using it. Once I mentioned my situation and cautioned them about it's use they went silent on it. Most men are irrational when it comes to this disease. Sadly, I believe I am unwanted reminder of their lack of care. It has affected our relationship in they don't ask and don't tell. The burden for me is to quietly watch it unfold. My advice is to continue to monitor and diagnois while you upgrade your healthcare support and lose weight in anticipation. You may now be motivated. Also, be cautious of the rock stars in the industry. Search for those with experience with obese men. Don't count calories, count \"added\" sugars. Natural sugars bound to their original fiber is okay. It is the added (refined) sugars added to low fat and diet foods to compensate for reduced calories that is the culprit. Most labels now list added sugar. You can eat all the calories of fruit, nuts and vegetables you want. Just don't put \"reduced fat\" salad dressings or toppings on it. The reduced calories have been replaced with sugar. Consider a fiber supplement to support the reduction in food. One without added sugar. Next add in a low salt diet. Added salt, as a flavor enhancer, is also an indicator of poor quality food which contributes to fat gain. This is more difficult than the sugar. Government standards for salt consumption is twice what it should be. This will almost eliminate all processed carbohydrates, such as bread and processed grain anad snacks products. You will intially loath this diet, but the outcome will make you a believer and may save your life. Keep us posted. Watch \"That Sugar Film.\" It is on Prime, Netflick, and youTube. Hi Another! I always appreciate your advice whether I want to hear it or not! 😀 But it is always spot on and I really appreciate the helpful info you provide. When you say I\u0092m not on AS and am managing it myself, what do you mean? After my biopsy results showing the G6 the current uro oncologist and I talked and decided AS was the path to go and scheduled the next biopsy for September. So I\u0092m not managing it myself we just haven\u0092t made it to the next biopsy. Unless there\u0092s something I\u0092m supposed to do to be on official AS, I\u0092m on it as far as I know. We stopped the testosterone but started clomid to get my own testosterone back to a livable level. I was basically bottomed out and on unintentional hormone therapy without the supplement or clomid. That was misery. But I\u0092m thinking I\u0092ll now have to stop the clomid as it looks like I have something more involved going on. As far as diet my gp gave me the sugar buster diet and it\u0092s along the lines of what you\u0092re talking about. No breads, no sugars, no potatos, no corn, no honey plus a bunch of other things. Dropped a few pounds already. I switched doctors after several things which completely eradicated my faith in the uro oncologist. Calling me one week apart with different biopsy results\u0097 and not remembering (or lying that he didn\u0092t remember) that he talked to me was one. The last was the disagreement over biopsy sedation. Valium doesn\u0092t work on me so they said office fully awake or the hospital outpatient center. So I scheduled for the outpatient center at the hospital only to receive a call back from the doc\u0092s MA telling me the doctor had canceled my September biopsy in favor of just rechecking PSA and doing an office consult. I felt that was \u0093my way or we just won\u0092t do it\u0094 and that\u0092s not okay. Right now I\u0092m more than a little concerned about this nearly double jump in six months. It just doesn\u0092t seem that reasonable that just a G6 would cause that sharp if a rise. I feel like my chances of surgery just rose exponentially. The first google result of course was a cbs news article that a sharp rise year over year was indicative of an aggressive cancer that greatly increased the chances of death whether you have treatment or not. So I\u0092m a bit unnerved by this news. I really wasn\u0092t expecting a 7+ result.",

The only thing that concerns me is that this was my second biopsy with the first 12 core random (March 2018 ) being totally clean. The March 2019 2 core fusion (on the pirads 3/4) was clean but hey then did a random 10 core after the fusion. 8 were clean, 1 precancerous and 1 G6. So I would Love to say this is just more G6 but the probability of that seems less given that I\u0092ve had 22 samples taken across the prostate and only 1 came back with a 2mm G6. That seems to make it less likely of wide spread G6. As much as I hate it, this seems like something more significant that was missed. But then again it could be prostatitis starting or ending. The pirads 3/4 was indicative of prostatitis or scarring so maybe I have another case. As far as the new provider, I had the 3t in Dec 2018 and that drove the fusion biopsy I had in March 2019 I certainly hope that is close enough I don\u0092t have to do either again. I definitely want another biopsy as soon as possible though. So to summarize we don\u0092t know Jack! 😀 Thanks guys I hope y\u0092all have a great Easter weekend and hopefully some downtime.",

Managing this on your own is valid and taking time to assess your situation is valid, but it is not AS. Your clarity in this disease will come with clarity in your language. Your thoughts, actions and outcomes will follow a shift to your clear use of language around this disease. Most are not clear that our language drives our knowledge and actions and not our thoughts. Once you are clear in the language of this desease you will be clear in your actions. The use of testosterone, regardless of purpose, can manifest in smaller more agressive cancer that is difficult to find and can present early in younger men. Glad you have stopped it. I have two friends my age who are using it. Once I mentioned my situation and cautioned them about it's use they went silent on it. Most men are irrational when it comes to this disease. Sadly, I believe I am unwanted reminder of their lack of care. It has affected our relationship in they don't ask and don't tell. The burden for me is to quietly watch it unfold. My advice is to continue to monitor and diagnois while you upgrade your healthcare support and lose weight in anticipation. You may now be motivated. Also, be cautious of the rock stars in the industry. Search for those with experience with obese men. Don't count calories, count \"added\" sugars. Natural sugars bound to their original fiber is okay. It is the added (refined) sugars added to low fat and diet foods to compensate for reduced calories that is the culprit. Most labels now list added sugar. You can eat all the calories of fruit, nuts and vegetables you want. Just don't put \"reduced fat\" salad dressings or toppings on it. The reduced calories have been replaced with sugar. Consider a fiber supplement to support the reduction in food. One without added sugar. Next add in a low salt diet. Added salt, as a flavor enhancer, is also an indicator of poor quality food which contributes to fat gain. This is more difficult than the sugar. Government standards for salt consumption is twice what it should be. This will almost eliminate all processed carbohydrates, such as bread and processed grain anad snacks products. You will intially loath this diet, but the outcome will make you a believer and may save your life. Keep us posted. Watch \"That Sugar Film.\" It is on Prime, Netflick, and youTube. Hi Another! I always appreciate your advice whether I want to hear it or not! 😀 But it is always spot on and I really appreciate the helpful info you provide. When you say I\u0092m not on AS and am managing it myself, what do you mean? After my biopsy results showing the G6 the current uro oncologist and I talked and decided AS was the path to go and scheduled the next biopsy for September. So I\u0092m not managing it myself we just haven\u0092t made it to the next biopsy. Unless there\u0092s something I\u0092m supposed to do to be on official AS, I\u0092m on it as far as I know. We stopped the testosterone but started clomid to get my own testosterone back to a livable level. I was basically bottomed out and on unintentional hormone therapy without the supplement or clomid. That was misery. But I\u0092m thinking I\u0092ll now have to stop the clomid as it looks like I have something more involved going on. As far as diet my gp gave me the sugar buster diet and it\u0092s along the lines of what you\u0092re talking about. No breads, no sugars, no potatos, no corn, no honey plus a bunch of other things. Dropped a few pounds already. I switched doctors after several things which completely eradicated my faith in the uro oncologist. Calling me one week apart with different biopsy results\u0097 and not remembering (or lying that he didn\u0092t remember) that he talked to me was one. The last was the disagreement over biopsy sedation. Valium doesn\u0092t work on me so they said office fully awake or the hospital outpatient center. So I scheduled for the outpatient center at the hospital only to receive a call back from the doc\u0092s MA telling me the doctor had canceled my September biopsy in favor of just rechecking PSA and doing an office consult. I felt that was \u0093my way or we just won\u0092t do it\u0094 and that\u0092s not okay. Right now I\u0092m more than a little concerned about this nearly double jump in six months. It just doesn\u0092t seem that reasonable that just a G6 would cause that sharp if a rise. I feel like my chances of surgery just rose exponentially. The first google result of course was a cbs news article that a sharp rise year over year was indicative of an aggressive cancer that greatly increased the chances of death whether you have treatment or not. So I\u0092m a bit unnerved by this news. I really wasn\u0092t expecting a 7+ result.",

My dumb doctor\u0092s office\u0097one of the reasons I\u0092m switching to the other office (hey doc staff can make or break you)\u0097gave me 3 Valium to take. They told me they would tell me when to take them but never did. I finally asked after arriving and sitting there for a minute or two. The Valium didn\u0092t take effect until breakfast after everything was said and done! I felt it all! But my breakfast bagel experience was wonderful! 😀 Good luck with your results!!!",

They shoulf have told you they don\u2019t sedate anyone for the procedure. That is the odd thing, talking to the ultrasound tech\u0085 He said that most of them are done under sedation. The frustrating thing is that I called and emailed asking about the fact that my urologist said it would be under sedation but they had me booked for the valium experience . I never got anything other than a shoulder shrug or non-return calls. I manage through the 12 core random OK. This fusion biopsy was excruciating. I\u0092m not a difficult patient at all, despite what you all may think But I was shuffled from one doctor to another with what looks like a poor hand off",

      "Content": "My primary urologist didn\u0092t do my fusion biopsy, the resident uro oncologist did it. My doc told me it would be sedated and that the uro oncologist was coordinating the particulars. My uro stepped out of the planning of this when the uro oncologist stepped in. I inquired multiple times with the doctor and staff about sedation and most inquiries went unanswered and I was ultimately told that my insurance company didn\u0092t cover it. So today, being my first day back at work, I began the trek to find the responsible party that denied the anesthesia. Talked with my go to claims person (I work for the insurer) and the doctor\u0092s office never even called to request the sedation. They didn\u0092t even try. The Valium didn\u0092t work, at all. 30 mg and nothing, I could have driven home. I went through that barbaric fusion biopsy and all 14 snaps and felt every jab and searing pain with each. I felt the stream of blood running down my cheek and was in misery the entire time at least 10-15 minutes. For some reason, it was ten times worse than the random core biopsy that I had done previously. Right now, I\u0092m so pissed that I was lied to that I\u0092m ready to go down there personally and let the office manager have it about their lazy staff. Am I being unreasonable?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Duck2 While a biopsy is not pleasant (mostly due to anxiety) , I don\u2019t see where the procedure warrants sedation. They shoulf have told you they don\u2019t sedate anyone for the procedure. That is the odd thing, talking to the ultrasound tech\u0085 He said that most of them are done under sedation. The frustrating thing is that I called and emailed asking about the fact that my urologist said it would be under sedation but they had me booked for the valium experience . I never got anything other than a shoulder shrug or non-return calls. I manage through the 12 core random OK. This fusion biopsy was excruciating. I\u0092m not a difficult patient at all, despite what you all may think But I was shuffled from one doctor to another with what looks like a poor hand off",

Hey I asked for opinions and appreciate yours too. For me the 12 core was doable without sedation but not this one. The fusion was awful. Could have been the technique required or whatever....maybe skill of the doc. But this one had me lifting up off the table at times.

They might also target the pirads 1-2 just out of an abundance of caution. The doctor doing it didn\u0092t have my records in front of him but said if it was big enough they\u0092d sample it too.

      "Content": "Hi guys and gals, Maybe this thread will help others but I know it could help me. I\u0092m having my fusion biopsy on 2/13 and I want to be prepared for the results and have some well thought out questions ready. I don\u0092t know if the results will come over the phone or in person but I know I cannot wait until my next scheduled appointment on 3/29. If just inflammation or prostatitis as suggested by the MRI (please Lord let it be that) then I will have had two random 12 cores plus the fusion biopsy of the pirads 3-4 all of which were clean. My thinking is that there would really be nothing else we can do but monitor PSA and redo the MRI. Am I missing anything I should ask for or some other treatment plan for what would be a continued BPH diagnosis? If it\u0092s pca obviously I will need the Gleason score. But that\u0092s where everything gets confusing and I know that many answers will depend on the Gleason score. Is there any extended information I should ask for? Do I ask for a second opinion on the scoring? I keep seeing people talking about the Cleveland Clinic, do I ask for a referral there? Second opinion on how to proceed? I\u0092ll be a little lost if this is the disagnosis. Any tidbits of information from your experience that can help me in the event of either path? I\u0092m thinking your stories and tips might help me in what\u0092s likely to be great news or bad news. Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Welcome to the party pal, we\u0092re nearly in the same boat. I\u0092m 48. My PSA was 4.5 at the last measure after climbing for many years. My PSA hit 4.1 in March of last year, Dre clear. Free was 10%. so we did the 12 core biopsy and all was clear. I was about to be put on a year cycle between appts when I switched doctors within the same practice to a doc closer to home and one that specializes in testosterone replacement since I had to stop it when the scare happened. He did the 4K blood test that came back at 17% and then the MRI that found one pirads 1-2 and a 5mm pirads 3-4. I have a fusion biopsy scheduled for 2/12 and while under they will do another 12 core. So far I don\u0092t have cancer and the MRI suggested the 3-4 was prostatitis or scarring from inflammation. But I feel it will likely be cancer. Your stats look better than mine mostly, I think. so you might be okay and this could all be due to scarring or inflammation. I\u0092d guess that given your low PSA anything found that would be cancerous would usually be in the early stages. From my limited experience you most definitely need a biopsy and preferably one that is MRI guided so they can get the specific spots they found. I personally would not accept no for an answer as to doing a biopsy sampling them both and then would suggest that they do a 12 core random after completing the fusion. That targets the area found plus does a random. But I\u0092m a worrier and am aggressive with my treatment and need to know. The way I understand pca is this. Think of a swimming pool. PCa happens like algae bloom...you might see a spot in the deep end but it could also be in several places just undetected. So the advice is: 1) find a good uro you like and trust them. 2) be ready for the fact that you\u0092ll not be getting definitive answers at all. Diagnosis and treatment are an art form and there are precious few absolutes. 3) be prepared for the fact that no one generally gets in a hurry because this is slow growing 4) do not be hesitant to be pushy until you come up with a plan that you understand and agree with philosophically 5) realize that even if this is cancer it will likely be okay. My doc told me that even if the 5mm piece is cancer it\u0092s extremely early and he wouldn\u0092t get excited. 6) don\u0092t let this consume you, it\u0092s easy to do. Breathe and relax.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Southsider Certainly a lot longer than what I experienced after any of my biopsies. I wouldn't panic over it, but I would give a call to the doctor next Monday if it doesn't stop and definitely mention it. For bleeding to continue for 2 weeks after being poked a few times with a needle is pretty rare. Will do thanks for the reply and suggestion. My last one didn\u0092t bleed this long either. However this time I had what felt and looked like a river of blood ooze out during the procedure. And he had the nurse hold pressure on the wound area for 5 minutes or so after he was done and left. I\u0092m hoping it was just waiting too long to go yesterday. It was painful.",

      "Content": "Hi guys and gals, Maybe this thread will help others but I know it could help me. I\u0092m having my fusion biopsy on 2/13 and I want to be prepared for the results and have some well thought out questions ready. I don\u0092t know if the results will come over the phone or in person but I know I cannot wait until my next scheduled appointment on 3/29. If just inflammation or prostatitis as suggested by the MRI (please Lord let it be that) then I will have had two random 12 cores plus the fusion biopsy of the pirads 3-4 all of which were clean. My thinking is that there would really be nothing else we can do but monitor PSA and redo the MRI. Am I missing anything I should ask for or some other treatment plan for what would be a continued BPH diagnosis? If it\u0092s pca obviously I will need the Gleason score. But that\u0092s where everything gets confusing and I know that many answers will depend on the Gleason score. Is there any extended information I should ask for? Do I ask for a second opinion on the scoring? I keep seeing people talking about the Cleveland Clinic, do I ask for a referral there? Second opinion on how to proceed? I\u0092ll be a little lost if this is the disagnosis. Any tidbits of information from your experience that can help me in the event of either path? I\u0092m thinking your stories and tips might help me in what\u0092s likely to be great news or bad news. Thanks in advance",

      "Content": "Welcome to the party pal, we\u0092re nearly in the same boat. I\u0092m 48. My PSA was 4.5 at the last measure after climbing for many years. My PSA hit 4.1 in March of last year, Dre clear. Free was 10%. so we did the 12 core biopsy and all was clear. I was about to be put on a year cycle between appts when I switched doctors within the same practice to a doc closer to home and one that specializes in testosterone replacement since I had to stop it when the scare happened. He did the 4K blood test that came back at 17% and then the MRI that found one pirads 1-2 and a 5mm pirads 3-4. I have a fusion biopsy scheduled for 2/12 and while under they will do another 12 core. So far I don\u0092t have cancer and the MRI suggested the 3-4 was prostatitis or scarring from inflammation. But I feel it will likely be cancer. Your stats look better than mine mostly, I think. so you might be okay and this could all be due to scarring or inflammation. I\u0092d guess that given your low PSA anything found that would be cancerous would usually be in the early stages. From my limited experience you most definitely need a biopsy and preferably one that is MRI guided so they can get the specific spots they found. I personally would not accept no for an answer as to doing a biopsy sampling them both and then would suggest that they do a 12 core random after completing the fusion. That targets the area found plus does a random. But I\u0092m a worrier and am aggressive with my treatment and need to know. The way I understand pca is this. Think of a swimming pool. PCa happens like algae bloom...you might see a spot in the deep end but it could also be in several places just undetected. So the advice is: 1) find a good uro you like and trust them. 2) be ready for the fact that you\u0092ll not be getting definitive answers at all. Diagnosis and treatment are an art form and there are precious few absolutes. 3) be prepared for the fact that no one generally gets in a hurry because this is slow growing 4) do not be hesitant to be pushy until you come up with a plan that you understand and agree with philosophically 5) realize that even if this is cancer it will likely be okay. My doc told me that even if the 5mm piece is cancer it\u0092s extremely early and he wouldn\u0092t get excited. 6) don\u0092t let this consume you, it\u0092s easy to do. Breathe and relax.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Deep breath, Ice! You don't want or need to make out a med school decision tree for every possible condition, outcome, and differential diagnosis in a 2000-page textbook of urology! You just need your urologist and the mantra One Step at a Time. Whatever the outcome, get a written copy of your biopsy report for your records. Start a list of questions to ask your doc at each visit. Post your results, your doc's recommendations, and your questions at that point and Forum Brothers will make detailed suggestions based on all that information. I know waiting is difficult--we've all been there and we're here for you! As you learn what's going on in your prostate, the confusion fog will start to lift and you'll be able to focus on your specifics. Djin Actually I\u0092m an Accountant, a CPA. So a medical school decision tree sounds wonderful! I could do it in Excel😀. It\u0092s how my mind makes sense and establishes a sense of control out of this uncontrollable process. I\u0092m actually pretty calm...much more so than at the start of all this. Just trying to make sure I\u0092m prepared.

I couldn't sleep, I could not concentrate, and found myself obsessing over diagnosis probabilities and treatment modalities. My MO hit me over the head several times and smacked me in the face once with \"I've done this thousands of times, I've helped men down this road many times a month for over 25-years and really do know what I am doing. SO - please let me guide you as we get more information.\" He stressed that NO Decisions of any kind were necessary, in fact would not be appropriate, prior to getting the biopsy information back. He then stressed \"I've never lost a patient, EVER, due to being cautious and taking our time to make an informed decision.\" He worked hard to make sure that I could talk with him as much as I wished after the biopsy as we then formulated a plan to deal with the biopsy results. He also told me that I would probably want to talk with other medical professionals about the biopsy results, e.g radiation guys, maybe HIFU proponents, and even, hopefully, active surveillance advocates. His main takeaway was that PCa treatment is complex and can take many unexpected twists and turns. All we, the patient, can do is take one more step with the one more bit of information we gain. Step -by- Step without looking too far into the future. It is a hard lesson - to take this journey step by step, but, at least in my case with my mental attitude, looking too far into the future is counter productive. And, I did learn that my MO really did anticipate ALL my questions and concerns and provided almost all the information I wanted and needed without me asking for it. I understand how Michael Jackson got hooked on propofol. It\u0092s the only rest I get. I joked with the last doc that used it to put me under, do the procedure and then go to lunch. Wake me mid afternoon. 😀 Thanks for the information. I always said cancer was the worst thing I could have to deal with because of my tendency to worry. But here I am hoping for a hat trick on these tests.",

      "Content": "Hi guys and gals, Maybe this thread will help others but I know it could help me. I\u0092m having my fusion biopsy on 2/13 and I want to be prepared for the results and have some well thought out questions ready. I don\u0092t know if the results will come over the phone or in person but I know I cannot wait until my next scheduled appointment on 3/29. If just inflammation or prostatitis as suggested by the MRI (please Lord let it be that) then I will have had two random 12 cores plus the fusion biopsy of the pirads 3-4 all of which were clean. My thinking is that there would really be nothing else we can do but monitor PSA and redo the MRI. Am I missing anything I should ask for or some other treatment plan for what would be a continued BPH diagnosis? If it\u0092s pca obviously I will need the Gleason score. But that\u0092s where everything gets confusing and I know that many answers will depend on the Gleason score. Is there any extended information I should ask for? Do I ask for a second opinion on the scoring? I keep seeing people talking about the Cleveland Clinic, do I ask for a referral there? Second opinion on how to proceed? I\u0092ll be a little lost if this is the disagnosis. Any tidbits of information from your experience that can help me in the event of either path? I\u0092m thinking your stories and tips might help me in what\u0092s likely to be great news or bad news. Thanks in advance",

Patience? Patience? Ain\u0092t nobody got time for that! 😀 They are going to target the pirads 3-4, I presume they will hit it in several places since it\u0092s 5mm and we know the MRI is inaccurate. They might also target the pirads 1-2 just out of an abundance of caution. The doctor doing it didn\u0092t have my records in front of him but said if it was big enough they\u0092d sample it too. After they are done they will do a 12 core random. My thought is \u0093I\u0092m asleep for this one, do everything you can while I\u0092m asleep\u0094.

My 12 core was all perfectly negative. I guess I could go back on hrt if my own levels do not rebound and then talk to the doctor about one of the bph treatments to alleviate the symptoms caused by the t fueled bph growth. The doc said the t probably just increased the curve on which my prostate was already growing. But I\u0092m only 47 ...almost 48 years old. That\u0092s a lot of possible future growth. If cancer ever develops I would probably\u0097given my prostate is already 46ml+\u0097opt to try the removal with surgery. At least then I could guarantee no future spreading (or relatively guarantee it) and go back on hrt without worry. I\u0092d probably go back using the shots as the gel is a giant pain in the butt.

      "Content": "48 and my PSA spiked to 4.1 in March. Free PSA measured above the threshold they wanted so we did a biopsy and I had a perfect 12 for 0 on the cancer free. Fast forward six months to my checkup and total PSA measured 4.4 and they did the pca3 test to see if I had the genes. I still have not talked to the doctor about the results but was told by office staff that it was \u0091negative\u0092. So having not had a conversation with the doctor yet, what should I push for? -remeasure in six months and see because it is likely just BPH? -go ahead and ask for the MRI to be sure there\u0092s no cancer? -lean down, put my head between my legs and kiss my Kiester goodbye? -go have some pie? I just don\u0092t know\u0097having seen the long road of benign results you guys have had only to find cancer later\u0097if I should rest comfortably in the negative pca3. Thoughts?",

      "Content": "Hi guys and gals! It\u0092s been a while since I\u0092ve posted, after my pc scare of March, subsequent biopsy and negative results. I really liked my doctor for the pc treatment, not so sure about his knowledge of managing hormones. I stopped juicing with the Androgel (after 10 years) on 3/6 and my doctors said that whatever negative impacts (aka the crash) I would see should manifest themselves within a couple weeks...certainly by a month. Well I cruised right by that with relative minimal issues. Fatigue and stupidity (beyond what\u0092s normal ) were my main complaints but thought I could fight through. Now that I\u0092m essentially at 3 months later I\u0092m sweating and missing my testosterone. I think I\u0092ve bottomed out. Mainly fatigue, low libido, lack of concentration and drive (just looking at a project on the House is mentally overwhelming) and some fleeting depression. But worst is extreme exercise intollerance, shortness of breath and anxiety. The anxiety manifests itself in the form of feeling like I\u0092m going to explode from the inside of my chest out. I\u0092ve been doing the same walk for years now, sometimes twice a day but had to call my wife to pick me up yesterday because I was too exhausted to put one foot in front of the other and was having trouble breathing. I was about 15 minutes from the end of the walk but still, I used to do that walk with ease. I take Xanax as needed and the Xanax will take away the shortness of breath and anxiety so I know it\u0092s not heart related. It was hot and I have developed asthma in the last year so that might have contributed. Breathing has definitely gotten worse since stopping the t. So here\u0092s my question.....what have you guys on HT done when the doc says \u0093gotta stop because of pc or the threat of pc\u0094. I can\u0092t live like this....I\u0092m gaining weight because I can\u0092t exercise. My follow up isn\u0092t until September but I think I\u0092ll end up spontaneously angry combusting before then. No not really, probably! 😁. I have noticed that the size of my testicles have doubled since stopping the HT, so I was hoping my body was starting my own testosterone up again. Now I\u0092m unsure. Anyone with experience? Sorry for the length of this.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by white08gt Talk to your Uro about trying Clomid, side effect is increases your natural testosterone. after one month of taking my T doubled from low 200s to low 400s. waiting for my followup 6 month checkup and anxious to see if it has come up considerable or just leveled out. worth looking into, insurance will not pay for it but only $42 at Costco for 30 day supply. clomiphene citrate, clomid for short. check it out on the web. Well after typing out this long post and then reading your reply, I was kind of struck in the face by reality and how dumb my original post was\u0097I blame the low T. I\u0092m totally screwed. And I just realized it. The pc scare of fueling pc, if it\u0092s there, by using testosterone isn\u0092t that the increased risk is a side effect of Androgel specifically, it\u0092s a side effect of the testosterone itself. So whether I get my numbers up by my own body rebounding, through clomid or by restarting hrt it increases my odds of fueling pc or fueling the bhp that I was diagnosed with. You know in movies when a character realizes they\u0092re screwed right before a train or car or speeding bullet hits them and they look at the camera with an \u0093oh crap\u0094 look? I just had my moment. Dang..... I guess my only hope is that my own body rebounds with just enough of its own testosterone that the symptoms of low t become manageable. If not, there is no permanent solution except to have the prostate taken out so that I can restart hrt without the fear of pc or without swelling my prostate to the size of a grapefruit. It\u0092s already 46 ml! Thanks for the reply. I\u0092ll discuss this with my doc. But it seems like a problem with no answer.",

Sex to career ambition and focus...relationships, etc. It doesn\u0092t help that it seems that everything else in life: work, finances, son\u0092s college grades, etc. are all spinning out of control at the same time. The weather is getting nice here so I\u0092m hoping to get out a lot more and exercise, which will greatly help.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor I've described my coping process in other threads here but will try to briefly cover MY way of dealing with the fundamental life changes you describe. I do understand a bit of your anguish about the many changes occurring in short order. For me, and my wife of 44-years: - sudden onset of seemingly serious heart problems after years of being told those problems would never be important - now need to take medicine to control heart rhythms, which adversely affects ALL my athletic endeavors - wife suffered two life threatening and debilitating bicycle accidents which now prevent her from riding with me, which has been a very important part of our life for over 35-years - wife went thru five serious orthopedic surgeries in three years in attempt to repair shoulder, arm, hip, leg with not so good results - move from San Diego to SW Florida and all the changes (good and bad) that entails - owning a home for the first time in 18-years (had been living on our sailboat since mid-2000) - termination of relationship with sister after death of our parents and her theft of several hundred K dollars from the estate (she was executrix) - wife retired from a job she loved and had worked at for 35-years and found she really missed the work and friends (now 2,800 miles distant) My wife and I have been a strong team since 1974. We've gone thru a lot of counseling as a couple and as individuals. I did graduate work in counseling and she had some undergraduate classes in the same while studying to be a speech therapist and special ed teacher. Our prior experiences were not sufficient to get us through the trauma, physical and mental of all the changes, gravely exacerbated by my PCa diagnosis and treatment, since 2014. I was fortunate to find a Ph.D counselor with vast experience dealing with geriatric patients (I am 71 and wife is 63) experiencing fundamental changes due to physical and mental situations. She is in her mid-50s and is personally aware of many of the situations we here deal with. And, her 78-year old father has been battling PCa for 10-years (RP, ADT, radiation, metastatic disease) so she really understands the PCa aspects of our problems. She is the primary care giver for her father and has also counselled hundreds of other PCa men. While I was in the pre-RP, post-RP, and 'wait for the first post-RP µPSA' phase of my PCa journey I talked with her twice a week for a hour each time. I did not have to explain things - I could just vent with no concern about her feelings or judgement. That in itself was of great value but she was able to ask questions and turn around my statements and thoughts to allow me to understand what I was really worried about and what I really wanted to do. Additionally, due to her personal experience with her father, and with many dozen other PCa men, she had a lot of practical advice and was quite outspoken in offering it. And, she arranged for my wife and I to meet with a couples therapist who specializes in medical counselling and practical strategies for dealing with traumatic medical issues. I did not appreciate the degree of PTSD my wife was suffering after the two horrible bike accidents (2014 - she had to walk two miles out of a mountain canyon with a broken arm, dislocated shoulder, and severe concussion & 2016 she was unconscious for 6-days). That accident built on the PTSD she suffered 30-years ago when she had to walk 3-miles out of the Mt. Rainier woods with a broken illiac crest, broken forearm, and concussion. I was shocked at how little I understood where my wife was coming from and why she was being so cold about my whole PCa journey. The couples therapist was able to let wife and I understand and appreciate the others perspective on my PCa. I just did not know how freaked out the wife was about my disease. She was unable to talk about it until after the RP and was unable to say the word \"cancer\" until months after we began sessions with the counselor. My therapist also convinced me to try some anti-depressants and some anti-anxiety medication which, after a short while, allowed me to develop and practice new thought processes. I now understand that: - PCa is a 'rest of my lifetime' disease and will always be lurking in the background. - I am doing everything possible to manage my PCa - I will take the required next steps, whatever they are, if I suffer BCR - I can't do anything more than I am now doing - I cannot change my place in life - I must actively find things to do that give my life purpose and meaning - I discuss all my fears and worries with the wife who can now accept that I do have cancer Thank you for the post, exactly what I had in mind. Respect to the two of you for going through all of that and coming out the other side. I think I\u0092m sitting at a 70% everything else and 30% pca frustration level right now. Hopefully everything else will smooth out so I can move on to other things. I was just surprised by the variability of that frustration. Yes I have a low grade of cancer, yeay me, but it\u0092s affecting my life pretty significantly.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor I've described my coping process in other threads here but will try to briefly cover MY way of dealing with the fundamental life changes you describe. I do understand a bit of your anguish about the many changes occurring in short order. For me, and my wife of 44-years: - sudden onset of seemingly serious heart problems after years of being told those problems would never be important - now need to take medicine to control heart rhythms, which adversely affects ALL my athletic endeavors - wife suffered two life threatening and debilitating bicycle accidents which now prevent her from riding with me, which has been a very important part of our life for over 35-years - wife went thru five serious orthopedic surgeries in three years in attempt to repair shoulder, arm, hip, leg with not so good results - move from San Diego to SW Florida and all the changes (good and bad) that entails - owning a home for the first time in 18-years (had been living on our sailboat since mid-2000) - termination of relationship with sister after death of our parents and her theft of several hundred K dollars from the estate (she was executrix) - wife retired from a job she loved and had worked at for 35-years and found she really missed the work and friends (now 2,800 miles distant) My wife and I have been a strong team since 1974. We've gone thru a lot of counseling as a couple and as individuals. I did graduate work in counseling and she had some undergraduate classes in the same while studying to be a speech therapist and special ed teacher. Our prior experiences were not sufficient to get us through the trauma, physical and mental of all the changes, gravely exacerbated by my PCa diagnosis and treatment, since 2014. I was fortunate to find a Ph.D counselor with vast experience dealing with geriatric patients (I am 71 and wife is 63) experiencing fundamental changes due to physical and mental situations. She is in her mid-50s and is personally aware of many of the situations we here deal with. And, her 78-year old father has been battling PCa for 10-years (RP, ADT, radiation, metastatic disease) so she really understands the PCa aspects of our problems. She is the primary care giver for her father and has also counselled hundreds of other PCa men. While I was in the pre-RP, post-RP, and 'wait for the first post-RP µPSA' phase of my PCa journey I talked with her twice a week for a hour each time. I did not have to explain things - I could just vent with no concern about her feelings or judgement. That in itself was of great value but she was able to ask questions and turn around my statements and thoughts to allow me to understand what I was really worried about and what I really wanted to do. Additionally, due to her personal experience with her father, and with many dozen other PCa men, she had a lot of practical advice and was quite outspoken in offering it. And, she arranged for my wife and I to meet with a couples therapist who specializes in medical counselling and practical strategies for dealing with traumatic medical issues. I did not appreciate the degree of PTSD my wife was suffering after the two horrible bike accidents (2014 - she had to walk two miles out of a mountain canyon with a broken arm, dislocated shoulder, and severe concussion & 2016 she was unconscious for 6-days). That accident built on the PTSD she suffered 30-years ago when she had to walk 3-miles out of the Mt. Rainier woods with a broken illiac crest, broken forearm, and concussion. I was shocked at how little I understood where my wife was coming from and why she was being so cold about my whole PCa journey. The couples therapist was able to let wife and I understand and appreciate the others perspective on my PCa. I just did not know how freaked out the wife was about my disease. She was unable to talk about it until after the RP and was unable to say the word \"cancer\" until months after we began sessions with the counselor. My therapist also convinced me to try some anti-depressants and some anti-anxiety medication which, after a short while, allowed me to develop and practice new thought processes. I now understand that: - PCa is a 'rest of my lifetime' disease and will always be lurking in the background. - I am doing everything possible to manage my PCa - I will take the required next steps, whatever they are, if I suffer BCR - I can't do anything more than I am now doing - I cannot change my place in life - I must actively find things to do that give my life purpose and meaning - I discuss all my fears and worries with the wife who can now accept that I do have cancer Thank you for the post, exactly what I had in mind. Respect to the two of you for going through all of that and coming out the other side. I think I\u0092m sitting at a 70% everything else and 30% pca frustration level right now. Hopefully everything else will smooth out so I can move on to other things. I was just surprised by the variability of that frustration. Yes I have a low grade of cancer, yeay me, but it\u0092s affecting my life pretty significantly.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by andy12 Yes, of course, anything can change at any time. A meteor could fall out of the sky and knock your head off. Do you spend a lot of time worrying about that? I think the way we play the cards we are dealt is less about the psychology of pca and more about the psychology of us, as individuals. I have a similar diagnosis to yours, four years now. I have explicit trust in my doctor and continue on AS. My PSA has never been higher than the 4.2 that triggered the biopsy (along with family history--brother) in 2015. Most recently, last month, it was 2.5. I really don't think much about cancer. I live in a pleasant climate, I am fit and healthy, I have wonderful grandchildren that make me smile and laugh. I know that hearing the word \"cancer\" is frightening. But as we hear over and over on this forum, prostate cancer when caught early is very treatable, even curable. I had a neighbor who had radical prostatectomy when he was 51. He died last fall at the age of 81 from heart disease. It really sounds like your doctor and you are ahead of the curve on your situation. That is a good thing. If the meteor is coming at you, you will see it well in advance. Yes, get outside and exercise. And then, do it some more. Funny you should mention a meteor, I\u0092ve often said that if I had my choice of how to go, getting dead centered by a meteor would be quick, painless and newsworthy! 😀 I don\u0092t think it\u0092s as simple as you State. You\u0092re coming at it from a different perspective and clarity, having the benefit of time with it. This is a month old for me, not quite that (although I\u0092ve been in the testing loop for a year). Unfortunately, we don\u0092t go through this in a vacuum. I think if I could get everything else to stop falling apart of once, I\u0092d be in decent shape. I\u0092m managing this pca and several life adjustments all at the same time. It\u0092s hard not to feel like you\u0092re being hit with a tsunami at times. So we have exercise and life distractions (grandkids). I don\u0092t want any grandkids right now though, my kids are 20 and 16!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi ISZ. Areas found on the MRI are graded from 1 to 5 on a PIRADS scale. Here is an explanation of the likelihood of an area being PCa. When a biopsy is planned the usual 12 cores taken around the prostate are increased in number to include the PIRADS 3 to 5 areas. 3 is an Indeterminate or \"gray\" zone, but it's considered best to explore those too. In a biopsy-naive guy, which you are not, a doc who suspects PCa will go ahead with the biopsy even if the MRI comes back as negative. See what the MRI shows and what you doc says and keep us updated. Outstanding thank you. I almost deleted the post for it being a dumb question but turns out it wasn\u0092t. I\u0092m more prepared thank you very much!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OK, as you have learned, your MRI merits a biopsy, which becomes the \"bible\" for what comes after. You'll know what the PIRADS 3/4 lesions is. If it turns out to be nothing or scar tissue, you now have a baseline MRI for comparison if there are future concerns. If it is cancer, either you will be a candidate for AS, or, if it needs treatment, you have caught it early. Early diagnosis is the best way to get the upper hand on PCa! Good luck -- and keep us posted. Thanks for the reply. This is the most aggravating condition ever known to man. No answers just more tests. I\u0092m not sure exactly what he thought was good news exactly...maybe other than I wasn\u0092t eaten up and the spots weren\u0092t 5\u0092s.",

      "Content": "So as to not be a total attention whore and start a new thread....I\u0092m posting the highlights or lowlights from my MRI below: It is Enlarged 5.8 x 4.1 x 4.4 CM Two findings: 1) Wedge shaped area of ill defined decreased T2 signal within the right peripheral zone of the mid gland. Associated with a slightly more nodular area of more focal T2 hypointense signal measuring 5MM . There is also mid focal volume loss, mild to moderate decreased signal on ADC map and equivocal increased signal on DWI (and I don\u0092t even drink! ). This area is hyperenhancing on the DCE (PI-RADS 3/4). 2) Ill-defined area of low t2 signal within the left anterior peripheral zone of the prostatic apex abutting the border with the transitional zone, with mild decreased signal on ADC (PI-RADS 2). Transitional zone: Diffuse heterogeneous signal throughout the transitional zone which appears to be aggravated into more defined areas of nodule signal intensity, most consistent with stromal predominant hyperplastic change (PI-RADS 2)\u0085..I guess this is the #2 item above? The outer postatatic capsule is somewhat indistinct at the level of the PI-RADS4 lesion mentioned above. No bulky measurable extracapsular disease identified. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. There are a few mildly prominent external lilac chain lymph nodes present with normal appearing central fatty hila. So the finding per the report: Suspicious area of signal abnormality within the right peripheral zone of the mid gland (PI-RADS 3 / 4) morphologically suggesting scarring/fibrosis related to prior prostatitis VERSES underlying neoplasm. Consider targeted biopsy vs follow-up imaging. No additional areas of suspicious signal abnormality within the prostate gland\u0097but what about the PI-RADS2 above? Is that not suspicious? Aforementioned are of signal abnormality abuts the prostate capsule, which is slightly retracted. No bulky extracapsular disease or findings of metastatic disease within the pelvis. So my takeaways: After hearing the 3 / 4 I honestly had a hard time processing information. That was like a kick to the gut. But what I took away from the doc was: -5mm is small and caught very early no matter even if it is cancer, which it might not be. -We\u0092re doing a focused biopsy on 2/14 -If it is cancer, treatment depends on the type. Non aggressive cancer\u0097we might just AS it. Aggressive\u0097I\u0092ll probably want it out of me using the high frequency ultrasound. It sounds like the report indicates it thinks the HI-RADS 3 / 4 is something other than cancer. It seems to show that I\u0092m not eaten up with cancer. My doc was glad to see whatever it is was confined to the prostate but I\u0092m having a hard time getting that from the results above\u0097it looks to me like it\u0092s within the prostate but pretty darned close to not being in the prostate. Somehow my doctor said this was all good news. Aside from proving I\u0092m not totally eaten up wit cancer this just seems to kick the can down the road for more expensive tests. We might ultimately prove it\u0092s not cancer but I don\u0092t see this as good news. Any help? Thanks as always guys and gals.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OK, as you have learned, your MRI merits a biopsy, which becomes the \"bible\" for what comes after. You'll know what the PIRADS 3/4 lesions is. If it turns out to be nothing or scar tissue, you now have a baseline MRI for comparison if there are future concerns. If it is cancer, either you will be a candidate for AS, or, if it needs treatment, you have caught it early. Early diagnosis is the best way to get the upper hand on PCa! Good luck -- and keep us posted. Thanks for the reply. This is the most aggravating condition ever known to man. No answers just more tests.

      "Content": "So as to not be a total attention whore and start a new thread....I\u0092m posting the highlights or lowlights from my MRI below: It is Enlarged 5.8 x 4.1 x 4.4 CM Two findings: 1) Wedge shaped area of ill defined decreased T2 signal within the right peripheral zone of the mid gland. Associated with a slightly more nodular area of more focal T2 hypointense signal measuring 5MM . There is also mid focal volume loss, mild to moderate decreased signal on ADC map and equivocal increased signal on DWI (and I don\u0092t even drink! ). This area is hyperenhancing on the DCE (PI-RADS 3/4). 2) Ill-defined area of low t2 signal within the left anterior peripheral zone of the prostatic apex abutting the border with the transitional zone, with mild decreased signal on ADC (PI-RADS 2). Transitional zone: Diffuse heterogeneous signal throughout the transitional zone which appears to be aggravated into more defined areas of nodule signal intensity, most consistent with stromal predominant hyperplastic change (PI-RADS 2)\u0085..I guess this is the #2 item above? The outer postatatic capsule is somewhat indistinct at the level of the PI-RADS4 lesion mentioned above. No bulky measurable extracapsular disease identified. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. There are a few mildly prominent external lilac chain lymph nodes present with normal appearing central fatty hila. So the finding per the report: Suspicious area of signal abnormality within the right peripheral zone of the mid gland (PI-RADS 3 / 4) morphologically suggesting scarring/fibrosis related to prior prostatitis VERSES underlying neoplasm. Consider targeted biopsy vs follow-up imaging. No additional areas of suspicious signal abnormality within the prostate gland\u0097but what about the PI-RADS2 above? Is that not suspicious? Aforementioned are of signal abnormality abuts the prostate capsule, which is slightly retracted. No bulky extracapsular disease or findings of metastatic disease within the pelvis. So my takeaways: After hearing the 3 / 4 I honestly had a hard time processing information. That was like a kick to the gut. But what I took away from the doc was: -5mm is small and caught very early no matter even if it is cancer, which it might not be. -We\u0092re doing a focused biopsy on 2/14 -If it is cancer, treatment depends on the type. Non aggressive cancer\u0097we might just AS it. Aggressive\u0097I\u0092ll probably want it out of me using the high frequency ultrasound. It sounds like the report indicates it thinks the HI-RADS 3 / 4 is something other than cancer. It seems to show that I\u0092m not eaten up with cancer. My doc was glad to see whatever it is was confined to the prostate but I\u0092m having a hard time getting that from the results above\u0097it looks to me like it\u0092s within the prostate but pretty darned close to not being in the prostate. Somehow my doctor said this was all good news. Aside from proving I\u0092m not totally eaten up wit cancer this just seems to kick the can down the road for more expensive tests. We might ultimately prove it\u0092s not cancer but I don\u0092t see this as good news. Any help? Thanks as always guys and gals.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic For what it's worth, I had no symptoms during the early years of my BHP, just a rising PSA that prompted a long series of biopsies. It's quite possible the MRI results will shed light on what's going on. Stay positive! 46 g -- that's small potatoes (well, one potato). My prostate was 90 g when I had my TURP surgery to scoop it out. It was reduced to 30 g. It had grown back to 60 g at the time of my RP for PCa. (The specific gravity of prostate tissue is about 1, so 1 ml = 1 g). Wow! 90g you have me beat. I thought from the way the docs are talking that 46 must have been a world record or something! Turns out no. Thanks for the info and best of luck to you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by andy12 Yes, of course, anything can change at any time. A meteor could fall out of the sky and knock your head off. Do you spend a lot of time worrying about that? I think the way we play the cards we are dealt is less about the psychology of pca and more about the psychology of us, as individuals. I have a similar diagnosis to yours, four years now. I have explicit trust in my doctor and continue on AS. My PSA has never been higher than the 4.2 that triggered the biopsy (along with family history--brother) in 2015. Most recently, last month, it was 2.5. I really don't think much about cancer. I live in a pleasant climate, I am fit and healthy, I have wonderful grandchildren that make me smile and laugh. I know that hearing the word \"cancer\" is frightening. But as we hear over and over on this forum, prostate cancer when caught early is very treatable, even curable. I had a neighbor who had radical prostatectomy when he was 51. He died last fall at the age of 81 from heart disease. It really sounds like your doctor and you are ahead of the curve on your situation. That is a good thing. If the meteor is coming at you, you will see it well in advance. Yes, get outside and exercise. And then, do it some more. Funny you should mention a meteor, I\u0092ve often said that if I had my choice of how to go, getting dead centered by a meteor would be quick, painless and newsworthy! 😀 I don\u0092t think it\u0092s as simple as you State. You\u0092re coming at it from a different perspective and clarity, having the benefit of time with it. This is a month old for me, not quite that (although I\u0092ve been in the testing loop for a year). Unfortunately, we don\u0092t go through this in a vacuum. I think if I could get everything else to stop falling apart of once, I\u0092d be in decent shape. I\u0092m managing this pca and several life adjustments all at the same time. It\u0092s hard not to feel like you\u0092re being hit with a tsunami at times. So we have exercise and life distractions (grandkids). I don\u0092t want any grandkids right now though, my kids are 20 and 16!",

For me, and my wife of 44-years: - sudden onset of seemingly serious heart problems after years of being told those problems would never be important - now need to take medicine to control heart rhythms, which adversely affects ALL my athletic endeavors - wife suffered two life threatening and debilitating bicycle accidents which now prevent her from riding with me, which has been a very important part of our life for over 35-years - wife went thru five serious orthopedic surgeries in three years in attempt to repair shoulder, arm, hip, leg with not so good results - move from San Diego to SW Florida and all the changes (good and bad) that entails - owning a home for the first time in 18-years (had been living on our sailboat since mid-2000) - termination of relationship with sister after death of our parents and her theft of several hundred K dollars from the estate (she was executrix) - wife retired from a job she loved and had worked at for 35-years and found she really missed the work and friends (now 2,800 miles distant) My wife and I have been a strong team since 1974. We've gone thru a lot of counseling as a couple and as individuals. I did graduate work in counseling and she had some undergraduate classes in the same while studying to be a speech therapist and special ed teacher. Our prior experiences were not sufficient to get us through the trauma, physical and mental of all the changes, gravely exacerbated by my PCa diagnosis and treatment, since 2014. I was fortunate to find a Ph.D counselor with vast experience dealing with geriatric patients (I am 71 and wife is 63) experiencing fundamental changes due to physical and mental situations. She is in her mid-50s and is personally aware of many of the situations we here deal with. And, her 78-year old father has been battling PCa for 10-years (RP, ADT, radiation, metastatic disease) so she really understands the PCa aspects of our problems. She is the primary care giver for her father and has also counselled hundreds of other PCa men. While I was in the pre-RP, post-RP, and 'wait for the first post-RP µPSA' phase of my PCa journey I talked with her twice a week for a hour each time. I did not have to explain things - I could just vent with no concern about her feelings or judgement. That in itself was of great value but she was able to ask questions and turn around my statements and thoughts to allow me to understand what I was really worried about and what I really wanted to do. Additionally, due to her personal experience with her father, and with many dozen other PCa men, she had a lot of practical advice and was quite outspoken in offering it. And, she arranged for my wife and I to meet with a couples therapist who specializes in medical counselling and practical strategies for dealing with traumatic medical issues. I did not appreciate the degree of PTSD my wife was suffering after the two horrible bike accidents (2014 - she had to walk two miles out of a mountain canyon with a broken arm, dislocated shoulder, and severe concussion & 2016 she was unconscious for 6-days). That accident built on the PTSD she suffered 30-years ago when she had to walk 3-miles out of the Mt. Rainier woods with a broken illiac crest, broken forearm, and concussion. I was shocked at how little I understood where my wife was coming from and why she was being so cold about my whole PCa journey. The couples therapist was able to let wife and I understand and appreciate the others perspective on my PCa. I just did not know how freaked out the wife was about my disease. She was unable to talk about it until after the RP and was unable to say the word \"cancer\" until months after we began sessions with the counselor. My therapist also convinced me to try some anti-depressants and some anti-anxiety medication which, after a short while, allowed me to develop and practice new thought processes. I now understand that: - PCa is a 'rest of my lifetime' disease and will always be lurking in the background. - I am doing everything possible to manage my PCa - I will take the required next steps, whatever they are, if I suffer BCR - I can't do anything more than I am now doing - I cannot change my place in life - I must actively find things to do that give my life purpose and meaning - I discuss all my fears and worries with the wife who can now accept that I do have cancer Thank you for the post, exactly what I had in mind. Respect to the two of you for going through all of that and coming out the other side. I think I\u0092m sitting at a 70% everything else and 30% pca frustration level right now. Hopefully everything else will smooth out so I can move on to other things. I was just surprised by the variability of that frustration. Yes I have a low grade of cancer, yeay me, but it\u0092s affecting my life pretty significantly.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by andy12 Yes, of course, anything can change at any time. A meteor could fall out of the sky and knock your head off. Do you spend a lot of time worrying about that? I think the way we play the cards we are dealt is less about the psychology of pca and more about the psychology of us, as individuals. I have a similar diagnosis to yours, four years now. I have explicit trust in my doctor and continue on AS. My PSA has never been higher than the 4.2 that triggered the biopsy (along with family history--brother) in 2015. Most recently, last month, it was 2.5. I really don't think much about cancer. I live in a pleasant climate, I am fit and healthy, I have wonderful grandchildren that make me smile and laugh. I know that hearing the word \"cancer\" is frightening. But as we hear over and over on this forum, prostate cancer when caught early is very treatable, even curable. I had a neighbor who had radical prostatectomy when he was 51. He died last fall at the age of 81 from heart disease. It really sounds like your doctor and you are ahead of the curve on your situation. That is a good thing. If the meteor is coming at you, you will see it well in advance. Yes, get outside and exercise. And then, do it some more. Funny you should mention a meteor, I\u0092ve often said that if I had my choice of how to go, getting dead centered by a meteor would be quick, painless and newsworthy! 😀 I don\u0092t think it\u0092s as simple as you State. You\u0092re coming at it from a different perspective and clarity, having the benefit of time with it. This is a month old for me, not quite that (although I\u0092ve been in the testing loop for a year). Unfortunately, we don\u0092t go through this in a vacuum. I think if I could get everything else to stop falling apart of once, I\u0092d be in decent shape. I\u0092m managing this pca and several life adjustments all at the same time. It\u0092s hard not to feel like you\u0092re being hit with a tsunami at times. So we have exercise and life distractions (grandkids). I don\u0092t want any grandkids right now though, my kids are 20 and 16!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic For what it's worth, I had no symptoms during the early years of my BHP, just a rising PSA that prompted a long series of biopsies. It's quite possible the MRI results will shed light on what's going on. Stay positive! 46 g -- that's small potatoes (well, one potato). My prostate was 90 g when I had my TURP surgery to scoop it out. It was reduced to 30 g. It had grown back to 60 g at the time of my RP for PCa. (The specific gravity of prostate tissue is about 1, so 1 ml = 1 g). Wow! 90g you have me beat. I thought from the way the docs are talking that 46 must have been a world record or something! Turns out no. Thanks for the info and best of luck to you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OK, as you have learned, your MRI merits a biopsy, which becomes the \"bible\" for what comes after. You'll know what the PIRADS 3/4 lesions is. If it turns out to be nothing or scar tissue, you now have a baseline MRI for comparison if there are future concerns. If it is cancer, either you will be a candidate for AS, or, if it needs treatment, you have caught it early. Early diagnosis is the best way to get the upper hand on PCa! Good luck -- and keep us posted. Thanks for the reply. This is the most aggravating condition ever known to man. No answers just more tests.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi ISZ. Areas found on the MRI are graded from 1 to 5 on a PIRADS scale. Here is an explanation of the likelihood of an area being PCa. When a biopsy is planned the usual 12 cores taken around the prostate are increased in number to include the PIRADS 3 to 5 areas. 3 is an Indeterminate or \"gray\" zone, but it's considered best to explore those too. In a biopsy-naive guy, which you are not, a doc who suspects PCa will go ahead with the biopsy even if the MRI comes back as negative. See what the MRI shows and what you doc says and keep us updated. Outstanding thank you. I almost deleted the post for it being a dumb question but turns out it wasn\u0092t. I\u0092m more prepared thank you very much!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic You're welcome. I was still editing when you replied! Thanks. My PSA has been rising since being measured but my pcp throught it was incidental to testosterone replacement. Finally got above 4 in March of last year. Free was like 10%. Biopsy was negative for all 12. My prostate is 46ml so they thought it was just BPH due to a honker of a prostate. The thing is I have absolutely no symptoms of any kind. Maybe I\u0092ll get up 1x a night if I drink water before bed, most nights I don\u0092t. I switched docs who tested the 4K that came back as 17% so here we are. I predict all 3\u0092s so that we don\u0092t know what to do. I\u0092m really hoping and praying for nothing found. Not sure what to expect, very aggravated and tired.

      "Content": "So as to not be a total attention whore and start a new thread....I\u0092m posting the highlights or lowlights from my MRI below: It is Enlarged 5.8 x 4.1 x 4.4 CM Two findings: 1) Wedge shaped area of ill defined decreased T2 signal within the right peripheral zone of the mid gland. Associated with a slightly more nodular area of more focal T2 hypointense signal measuring 5MM . There is also mid focal volume loss, mild to moderate decreased signal on ADC map and equivocal increased signal on DWI (and I don\u0092t even drink! ). This area is hyperenhancing on the DCE (PI-RADS 3/4). 2) Ill-defined area of low t2 signal within the left anterior peripheral zone of the prostatic apex abutting the border with the transitional zone, with mild decreased signal on ADC (PI-RADS 2). Transitional zone: Diffuse heterogeneous signal throughout the transitional zone which appears to be aggravated into more defined areas of nodule signal intensity, most consistent with stromal predominant hyperplastic change (PI-RADS 2)\u0085..I guess this is the #2 item above? The outer postatatic capsule is somewhat indistinct at the level of the PI-RADS4 lesion mentioned above. No bulky measurable extracapsular disease identified. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes. There are a few mildly prominent external lilac chain lymph nodes present with normal appearing central fatty hila. So the finding per the report: Suspicious area of signal abnormality within the right peripheral zone of the mid gland (PI-RADS 3 / 4) morphologically suggesting scarring/fibrosis related to prior prostatitis VERSES underlying neoplasm. Consider targeted biopsy vs follow-up imaging. No additional areas of suspicious signal abnormality within the prostate gland\u0097but what about the PI-RADS2 above? Is that not suspicious? Aforementioned are of signal abnormality abuts the prostate capsule, which is slightly retracted. No bulky extracapsular disease or findings of metastatic disease within the pelvis. So my takeaways: After hearing the 3 / 4 I honestly had a hard time processing information. That was like a kick to the gut. But what I took away from the doc was: -5mm is small and caught very early no matter even if it is cancer, which it might not be. -We\u0092re doing a focused biopsy on 2/14 -If it is cancer, treatment depends on the type. Non aggressive cancer\u0097we might just AS it. Aggressive\u0097I\u0092ll probably want it out of me using the high frequency ultrasound. It sounds like the report indicates it thinks the HI-RADS 3 / 4 is something other than cancer. It seems to show that I\u0092m not eaten up with cancer. My doc was glad to see whatever it is was confined to the prostate but I\u0092m having a hard time getting that from the results above\u0097it looks to me like it\u0092s within the prostate but pretty darned close to not being in the prostate. Somehow my doctor said this was all good news. Aside from proving I\u0092m not totally eaten up wit cancer this just seems to kick the can down the road for more expensive tests. We might ultimately prove it\u0092s not cancer but I don\u0092t see this as good news. Any help? Thanks as always guys and gals.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic You're welcome. I was still editing when you replied! Thanks. My PSA has been rising since being measured but my pcp throught it was incidental to testosterone replacement. Finally got above 4 in March of last year. Free was like 10%. Biopsy was negative for all 12. My prostate is 46ml so they thought it was just BPH due to a honker of a prostate. The thing is I have absolutely no symptoms of any kind. Maybe I\u0092ll get up 1x a night if I drink water before bed, most nights I don\u0092t. I switched docs who tested the 4K that came back as 17% so here we are. I predict all 3\u0092s so that we don\u0092t know what to do. I\u0092m really hoping and praying for nothing found. Not sure what to expect, very aggravated and tired. These things never happen in a vacuum and work is going crazy and my oldest just moved out to college. So lots of fun things to worry about.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic For what it's worth, I had no symptoms during the early years of my BHP, just a rising PSA that prompted a long series of biopsies. It's quite possible the MRI results will shed light on what's going on. Stay positive! 46 g -- that's small potatoes (well, one potato). My prostate was 90 g when I had my TURP surgery to scoop it out. It was reduced to 30 g. It had grown back to 60 g at the time of my RP for PCa. (The specific gravity of prostate tissue is about 1, so 1 ml = 1 g). Wow! 90g you have me beat. I thought from the way the docs are talking that 46 must have been a world record or something! Turns out no. Thanks for the info and best of luck to you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OK, as you have learned, your MRI merits a biopsy, which becomes the \"bible\" for what comes after. You'll know what the PIRADS 3/4 lesions is. If it turns out to be nothing or scar tissue, you now have a baseline MRI for comparison if there are future concerns. If it is cancer, either you will be a candidate for AS, or, if it needs treatment, you have caught it early. Early diagnosis is the best way to get the upper hand on PCa! Good luck -- and keep us posted. Thanks for the reply. This is the most aggravating condition ever known to man. No answers just more tests.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi ISZ. Areas found on the MRI are graded from 1 to 5 on a PIRADS scale. Here is an explanation of the likelihood of an area being PCa. When a biopsy is planned the usual 12 cores taken around the prostate are increased in number to include the PIRADS 3 to 5 areas. 3 is an Indeterminate or \"gray\" zone, but it's considered best to explore those too. In a biopsy-naive guy, which you are not, a doc who suspects PCa will go ahead with the biopsy even if the MRI comes back as negative. See what the MRI shows and what you doc says and keep us updated. Outstanding thank you. I almost deleted the post for it being a dumb question but turns out it wasn\u0092t. I\u0092m more prepared thank you very much!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic You're welcome. I was still editing when you replied! Thanks. My PSA has been rising since being measured but my pcp throught it was incidental to testosterone replacement. Finally got above 4 in March of last year. Free was like 10%. Biopsy was negative for all 12. My prostate is 46ml so they thought it was just BPH due to a honker of a prostate. The thing is I have absolutely no symptoms of any kind. Maybe I\u0092ll get up 1x a night if I drink water before bed, most nights I don\u0092t. I switched docs who tested the 4K that came back as 17% so here we are. I predict all 3\u0092s so that we don\u0092t know what to do. I\u0092m really hoping and praying for nothing found. Not sure what to expect, very aggravated and tired. These things never happen in a vacuum and work is going crazy and my oldest just moved out to college. So lots of fun things to worry about.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OK, as you have learned, your MRI merits a biopsy, which becomes the \"bible\" for what comes after. You'll know what the PIRADS 3/4 lesions is. If it turns out to be nothing or scar tissue, you now have a baseline MRI for comparison if there are future concerns. If it is cancer, either you will be a candidate for AS, or, if it needs treatment, you have caught it early. Early diagnosis is the best way to get the upper hand on PCa! Good luck -- and keep us posted. Thanks for the reply. This is the most aggravating condition ever known to man. No answers just more tests. I\u0092m not sure exactly what he thought was good news exactly...maybe other than I wasn\u0092t eaten up and the spots weren\u0092t 5\u0092s.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic For what it's worth, I had no symptoms during the early years of my BHP, just a rising PSA that prompted a long series of biopsies. It's quite possible the MRI results will shed light on what's going on. Stay positive! 46 g -- that's small potatoes (well, one potato). My prostate was 90 g when I had my TURP surgery to scoop it out. It was reduced to 30 g. It had grown back to 60 g at the time of my RP for PCa. (The specific gravity of prostate tissue is about 1, so 1 ml = 1 g). Wow! 90g you have me beat. I thought from the way the docs are talking that 46 must have been a world record or something! Turns out no. Thanks for the info and best of luck to you!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Hi ISZ. Areas found on the MRI are graded from 1 to 5 on a PIRADS scale. Here is an explanation of the likelihood of an area being PCa. When a biopsy is planned the usual 12 cores taken around the prostate are increased in number to include the PIRADS 3 to 5 areas. 3 is an Indeterminate or \"gray\" zone, but it's considered best to explore those too. In a biopsy-naive guy, which you are not, a doc who suspects PCa will go ahead with the biopsy even if the MRI comes back as negative. See what the MRI shows and what you doc says and keep us updated. Outstanding thank you. I almost deleted the post for it being a dumb question but turns out it wasn\u0092t. I\u0092m more prepared thank you very much!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi doubleH! Very glad to see that you PSA has dropped since your arrival at The Forum! Since you are on AS, when is your next scheduled Bx? We previously had a discussion about getting a 3T MRI in advance of your next Bx. This would be wise in order to identify and target any areas of suspicion that may have been missed on your 1st Bx. Your PSA is still quite elevated and any \"undetected\" PCa should be ruled in or out (hopefully out!). If your next Bx is on the near horizon, sending your 1st set Bx slides to Dr Epstein's group for a 2nd evaluation may not be of any clinical value. If me, I'd wait for the next Bx and evaluate the results. If there is uncertainty about continuing AS, I would send the slides to Dr Epstein. Meanwhile, keep that PSA decreasing! MF MichaelF, You pointed out something which I thought was impossible. How does PSA ever go down? Besides prostatitis or infection? I thought my doc said that the prostate would never naturally shrink and therefore my PSA would be elevated and never really go down. I suppose I could have misheard him.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Something that another doctor told me around 35 years ago was \"we can rule it in, but not out\". I wish my urologist had told me the same thing, about two years earlier. My cancer might not have progressed as it did, while he led me believe that my prostate was normal. As you've been at this for six months (?) ... I don't see any stats other than your PSA, I'm guessing that you are in the same boat I was in four years ago... consistently rising PSA but all tests \"negative\" so far. If my urologist had offered me a prostatectomy back then I might have taken him up on it, rather than fumbling around with false negative biopsies which were doomed to failure unless a different approach was taken. Of course, standards of care wouldn't permit that. Whatever loop you find yourself currently caught up in, I hope you can find an exit soon! I added my stats but the don\u0092t show up in my signature. March PSA hit 4.1 but I\u0092ve been high since 2012 age adjusted. Urologist said I should have had my first biopsy in 2013. Free was 10% so we did a 12 core that all came back cancer free, just inflammation. The prostate is 47ml. Stopped testosterone replacement in March hoping that would stop the increase but the PSA went to 4.5. Now the 4K is 17%.",

      "Content": "Well, it\u0092s been a while since I last updated. It seems that I\u0092m stuck in the cycle like it or not. My last appointment my PSA went up slightly to 4.4 or 4.5. So my doctor ordered the 4k PSA test that came back at 17%. Not great but also not 94%. So im now on to the 3t prostate ultrasound. That test will\u0097according to my doctor\u0097only show clinically significant cancers. So a small piece of low grade cancer in there will likely not get picked up by the MRI. If something is picked up on the MRI, I get the fun of the MRI guided ultrasound. But it sounds like there is nothing that will ever rule out that I have cancer, it looks like we\u0092re just delaying it until we hit a ringer and some test finds something. So try as I might it seems that I\u0092m not ever getting the all clear. It could be worse, but I thought I was close to getting the \u0091see you in a year\u0092 kind of thing. Now it seems I\u0092m back in the cycle. This is a frustrating problem! Prayers out for all those suffering.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic We have to take into account two facts in looking at risk figures. Not all men live long lives. For elderly guys, the older we get the greater the chances that we will die in x years from all non-PCa causes. The fact that we die from a non-PCa causes doesn't mean we don't have metastatic disease that is being treated and has serious symptoms. Risk calculators can lead you down the garden path: we are not all one \"average\". Aren't you better off trying to avoid bad or worst cases? I will need to deep dive the results and read, I just looked at the stats and remembered my question about survival rates. If they included other mortalities in there these results kind of become pointless. No matter what they find on my next or subsequent biopsies I still expect fully to die at the hands of my wife of 27 years. In fact I\u0092m really impressed with her restraint thus far! 😀",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic We have to take into account two facts in looking at risk figures. Not all men live long lives. For elderly guys, the older we get the greater the chances that we will die in x years from all non-PCa causes. The fact that we die from a non-PCa causes doesn't mean we don't have metastatic disease that is being treated and has serious symptoms. Risk calculators can lead you down the garden path: we are not all one \"average\". Aren't you better off trying to avoid bad or worst cases? I will need to deep dive the results and read, I just looked at the stats and remembered my question about survival rates. If they included other mortalities in there these results kind of become pointless. No matter what they find on my next or subsequent biopsies I still expect fully to die at the hands of my wife of 27 years. In fact I\u0092m really impressed with her restraint thus far! 😀",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Duck2 \u0093Within 36 hours, a tumor the size of a golf ball on her forehead had disappeared, and within two weeks there was no cancer detectable in her body.\u0094 Is this even biologically possible? I can\u0092t get rid of poison ivy in 36 hours. Good question. Maybe find someone with a bad case of measles and kiss them a few times next time you have poison ivy and report back? 😀 If I had to guess being the newly coronated medical professional that I am thanks to this pca scare..... I\u0092m thinking that it might have been the body\u0092s reaction to a great big giant dose of the measles. The article made it sound like she had some instant and palpable reactions with the headache, etc. Maybe the body recognized the super dose of measles as being so severe that the body had to send all of it\u0092s infection fighting \u0091soldiers\u0092 out to fight and then the cancer just got caught in the crossfire. I\u0092d be concerned with a few questions: 1). What if the body\u0092s response also attacks healthy cells? 2). What if you\u0092re one of those people who can\u0092t fight off the measles so you die cancer free from the measles? 3). It\u0092s clear the tumor disappeared and wasn\u0092t THERE (as in where it was) any longer but did it dissolve the tumor into 10,000,000 individual cells of cancer that are landing in the lungs, brain and pancreas? It definitely has promise.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Ask your doc \"You are giving me a nerve block before taking the cores, right???\" Speaking as one with many biopsies under his belt (or lower), I can tell you (1) the doc's ability to do a good nerve block makes a huge difference, and (2) as the number of cores taken increases, the accumulative insult to the prostate build ups, and the closer the needle comes to the nerve plexus (the cores start from the apex, farthest from the plexus). This bottom (ha ha) line is that the biopsy becomes more uncomfortable as it goes on: speed is your friend Perhaps you can also ask you doc if he does an isopropy alcohol (or some other) wash of the needle between cores: this cuts down on infection complications and will make you look very well-informed too. I just scheduled my Sept biopsy and am going through the same dance trying to get it sedated because Valium doesn\u0092t affect me. They called back with \u0093insurance doesn\u0092t cover sedation\u0094 and the only thing they offer for the procedure is Valium. Sigh. I finally got someone who cared and told them that if they called in and asked for sedation, it would likely be approved especially since Valium doesn\u0092t work. I had shoulder surgery once and they gave me something called Versed while I was waiting\u0097not sure why\u0097but I don\u0092t remember anything from that point on despite having conversations with anesthesiologists and others. I think this is lust laziness on their part. I know I cannot go through the procedure completely lucid again. So re the alcohol question I am trying to avoid asking any more questions and being more of a pain than I am. I\u0092m not saying that the doc might use too little numbing medication in retaliation but I don\u0092t want that thought to occur to him either ! 😀",

      "Content": "Hang in there bud it looks like you\u0092re cruising towards a possible diagnosis but it could also be something as simple as prostatitis. For the appt I would expect to get felt up but it looks like you\u0092ve already been felt up. You will likely get bloodwork and maybe even an ultrasound. They might give you a course of antibiotics and retest in a few weeks but with your symptoms they might go straight to a biopsy. This will make others laugh (I\u0092m the resident board worrier) but just relax nothing you can do about the outcome. Pca likely will not kill you but is just something you need to manage and deal with...a life inconvenience. For what it\u0092s worth all my DRE were normal with no lumps or abnormalities found. My tests (all kinds) were a mixed bag with some pointing to cancer and others pointing away. The MRI was essentially useless since it pointed out a pirads 3/4 that wasn\u0092t cancer and missed a spot of cancer that they found via a random 12 core. So expect a lot of tests that honestly mean little to nothing \u0097unless they lead to a biopsy that finds cancer. Beyond that there is precious little certainty. It\u0092s definitely a marathon and not a dash, so this isn\u0092t something you can hit with a course of antibiotics and go in with life (unless it\u0092s prostatitis). Either way..cancer or not...it\u0092ll be something you\u0092re dealing with for a while. Best of luck! Prayers for a good outcome.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic One of the huge advantages of AS is that a good portion of men with low-risk PCa will never need treatment. True, the other portion will need or opt for treatment down the pike, but that's the beauty of AS: treatment only for those who need it. The whole debate about PSA screening came about because of overtreatment. Today we know that many men should be on AS. What scares me about AS, after learning the shortcomings of all detection methods, is how do you know anything for certain? MRI can\u0092t tell you for certain that it detected all cancers. MRI can\u0092t accurately guarantee how big an area detected really is. MRI can\u0092t tell you for certain where the boundaries are. And MRI is the best detection method from an imaging perspective. So you do a biopsy\u0097random 12 core or focused fusion biopsy\u0097and find cancer. How do you know that the biopsy needle didn\u0092t hit a sample of low risk cancer that\u0092s right next to a sample of high risk that wasn\u0092t detected? You\u0092re doing AS on a section while the undetected cancer spreads. I guess if I knew for certain that the MRI results were accurate and the spot of cancer wasn\u0092t growing, I\u0092d absolutely let it sit there and hurt nothing. For those doing AS how does your doc manage that risk of non-detection? ETA: I\u0092m not challenging anyone\u0092s decision for or against AS but clearly I can\u0092t be the first person to think of these questions so they must have sufficiently been addressed by someone/somewhere.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate ISZ, It's a probability scheme, with a combination of PHI tests, DRE's, TRUS biopsies, 3T mp-MRIs, fusion biopsies, OncotypeDX and other genomics tests. When you do a regular schedule of all of those, you greatly reduce the odds of any significant cancer being missed. It takes much more than one biopsy to know what you are dealing with. A strict AS program gives you all the other testing. In Johns Hopkins' experience, there has been no additional mortality risk for men who began AS and later need treatment, versus those who chose immediate treatment. Yeah, see I edited above to say someone had to have thought about the questions I had above and they have. Thank you greatly for the information. Just when I think I understand it, I learn something new. I really appreciate the information. I\u0092m so young if my 2/13 biopsy comes back cancerous, I\u0092m going to have a hard time figuring out what to do. I have a lot of life to live with the symptoms of treatment. So if circumstances permit AS might work while I hope to kick the can down the road while technology catches up and advances.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic One of the huge advantages of AS is that a good portion of men with low-risk PCa will never need treatment. True, the other portion will need or opt for treatment down the pike, but that's the beauty of AS: treatment only for those who need it. The whole debate about PSA screening came about because of overtreatment. Today we know that many men should be on AS. What scares me about AS, after learning the shortcomings of all detection methods, is how do you know anything for certain? MRI can\u0092t tell you for certain that it detected all cancers. MRI can\u0092t accurately guarantee how big an area detected really is. MRI can\u0092t tell you for certain where the boundaries are. And MRI is the best detection method from an imaging perspective. So you do a biopsy\u0097random 12 core or focused fusion biopsy\u0097and find cancer. How do you know that the biopsy needle didn\u0092t hit a sample of low risk cancer that\u0092s right next to a sample of high risk that wasn\u0092t detected? You\u0092re doing AS on a section while the undetected cancer spreads. I guess if I knew for certain that the MRI results were accurate and the spot of cancer wasn\u0092t growing, I\u0092d absolutely let it sit there and hurt nothing. For those doing AS how does your doc manage that risk of non-detection? ETA: I\u0092m not challenging anyone\u0092s decision for or against AS but clearly I can\u0092t be the first person to think of these questions so they must have sufficiently been addressed by someone/somewhere.",

Sure could've been a lot worse news. We're still awaiting the Decipher results, which were ordered a week after my RALP. Will review these, along with my next uPSA test, in March.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by KarlEmagne I had an MRI done in May 2018 that was inconclusive, no suspicious nodules visible, but a larger area that could be infection or cancer. The radiologist concluded I thus don't need a fusion biopsy, as they would likely hit this larger something. Though I live in a lager city, the biopsy is done at a small hospital not doing MRIs. In fact, when I asked around in March 2018, they were unpacking the MRI machine at the best university hospital in town and were just starting to do fusion biopsies. You are definitely right I should stop the head spinning, as it doesn't get me anywhere. Looking at this calculator, chances are good I might live another 10 years and chances are bad I'll be progression free. That, however, would have been almost the same back in March 2018. If I get a high Gleason score from my biopsy, then reading through other threads, most recommend seeking advice at one of the big hospital centers, for RP outcomes but also quality and variety of subsequent treatments. Just for the RP I'm not entirely sure this would pay off, but for newer other treatments options in my province are lagging behind. Since a 4-6 week wait for RP after biopsy is common, I'm still tempted to reactivate my 5 star private European health insurance starting from April. Even if the costs are high, this money might be well spent. Similar. I\u0092ve confirmed that the original random biopsy alread hit the area that raised questions with the pirads 3/4. That original biopsy mentioned inflammation, prostatitis and something else that makes no difference (benign). So I\u0092m hoping the mri report that said this looked like inflammation, prostatitis verses cancer is correct. But that leaves the nagging question of \u0093well great but what now?\u0094. Time will tell. As for you man, chillax. You have this. At this point you haven\u0092t even had a positive biopsy result so all of this becomes mental torture.

I had to stop a year ago because my PSA finally exceeded the 80+ year old levels and my PCP woke up and realized that I had a potential problem.. We tried stopping cold turkey and letting my body recover but it only got my total T back up to 267 or 270 I can\u0092t remember. I\u0092m a big strong strapping guy and I couldn\u0092t even mow my front yard with a walk behind (20 minute job) without stopping 3-4 times...it was like trying to mow the grass with raging flu. Since that didn\u0092t work and I was figuratively dying from lack of T (no mental sharpness, no drive at work, completely overwhelmed by simple mental tasks, weight gain, muscle loss and Ed)....my doctor went off label and is using clomid to naturally increase my own testosterone production. According to the numbers I\u0092m back up but I can\u0092t tell any difference in how I feel. Men were made to use testosterone and I need some badly. Plus there\u0092s the added risk of heart disease and diabetes that associates with extended periods of low t. Yes, Another, I know I need to lose weight and am working on it but I don\u0092t think that I would have enough t if I lost 100lbs. I\u0092m too tired to walk after work all I have the energy to do is fall asleep. It\u0092s not a want to problem, I want to walk and exercise but just don\u0092t have the energy. Again, go get the flu and try walking 3-4 miles after work. I\u0092ve legitimately tried enough times with the wife having to get in the car and come get me, so I just stopped.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Ice, Johns Hopkins did a study years ago about their prostatectomy patients who were TRUE Gleason 6 patients -- meaning that the pathology report confirmed the biopsy report of only Gleason 6 and no higher grades found. Their study included 17,000 Gleason 6 patients. And out of those 17,000, the number of patients who had metastasized Gleason 6 was -- ABSOLUTE ZERO! As Djin noted, Gleason 6 CANNOT spread because it is not \"sophisticated\" enough to survive outside of the prostate. I can understand the sting you are feeling regarding the false diagnosis. The same thing happened to me..... I had pre-arranged for the uro's office to call me with my biopsy results, which came in a few days after the biopsy. When I got home, the first thing I did was check my Caller ID unit -- and I saw that the doctor's office had called me. So I went to my desk and very nervously sat down and picked up the phone to return their call. I remember thinking that the next minute or so could possibly define the rest of my life. I made the call and a woman answered and I told them who I was. She confirmed that the results of my biopsy were in and I heard her thumbing through the papers and finally pronounced, \"I have it right here -- and it's BENIGN!\" I cannot describe the profound relief I felt at that moment and said \"Thank God\" to myself as the relief poured through me. Then, it happened..... As I was sinking back in my chair with relief, she said, \"Oh, wait a minute. I was reading someone else's report, hang on for a second.\" I heard her rifling through more papers and she came back on and said, \"I just found your report -- and it is ... MALIGNANT!\" Again, I cannot describe the head-on collision between my original sense of relief and the cold terror that suddenly began surging inside of me. I was really out of it for a few seconds as I tried to process what had just happened. This was on a Friday afternoon and she told me she could get me in to see the doctor in a week for all the details. Then she told me, \"but you probably want to see him sooner than a week.\" And I almost answered, \"NO SHIT?\" So she said they would squeeze me in late the following Monday afternoon. So I had to spend the entire weekend with my mind dwelling on all the possibilities -- am I going to survive or should I avoid buying any green bananas? I had to fight down feelings of panic over & over. I wish I had known about this forum at that time, that's for sure. Fortunately, Monday arrived and I was as nervous as a snowball approaching Hell when my name was called to go into the exam room. The doctor was VERY gentle and nice and explained that I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6 and that I would live out my full lifespan if I had surgery. With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems. That was over 7 years ago and my PSA remains zero and my urination remains at firehose levels. So, hang in there, my friend. Sometimes things that start off with horror end up being very good. And, with just one positive core -- of Gleason 6 -- you are going to be just fine! Thanks my friend. I appreciate the time you put into this post. You guys have definitely encouraged me. I awoke this AM in a pretty good mood. I was pretty aggravated early evening but finally got over it...spiked the plans to do tax work (I have a tax business) and ordered a pizza and Dr. Pepper and watched a movie. I think it was good that my wife was out of town because it freed me from trying to comfort her and let me come to terms with it. Yeah I know this is their jobs and people make mistakes but for crying out loud read the correct report and read it accurately. What if the opposite had happened and the misreported it as cancer and the person killed themselves out of grief only to get the correcting call too late? I\u0092m going to have to give the docs a pass, they\u0092re only human but they definite get a great big ESPN c\u0092mon mannnnn. It was funny after all the trouble we had with the biopsy scheduling I think it was my wife who said \u0093I hope those were your results\u0094 😀 I have a lot going on specifically I worry that the job I have now and associated insurance will last until said treatment is needed. A change in jobs or coverage quality could impact everything from how much I pay to the doctors I can see. Oh well, c\u0092est la vie, those taxes I spiked last night are calling. Thanks again, I really appreciate the encouragement.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Yes, G6 cannot metastasize, and repeat imaging/biopsies are part of the \"active\" in active surveillance I'm not sure why your doc is predicting early treatment. Perhaps it has to do with your other cores and a prediction based on his experience that your prostate will in the coming years generate a bit too much G6 to remain in AS. The concern with a prostate having many pattern 3 lesions is not these G6 lesions themselves, but rather that there is some pattern 4 hidden somewhere, i.e., G7 (3+4) or (4+3) lesions. Treatment at that point is aimed at preventing more serious cancer down the road. In fact, some of these men who have had only G6 biopies, reveal G7 lesions when their entire prostate is examined after surgery (remember a biopsy samples only about 1% of prostate tissue). In any case, treatment in AS men is highly successful: very few of these men die from the cancer. The Subforum here (near the top of the main Forum page) has an entire topic with papers on AS studies. You can take the next few years to relax and read about the success rates. Thanks again. I\u0092m pretty resolved at this point it it what it is. My doc said that 60% of people with scores like mine end up never needing treatment and 40% do. However he said that my age was the determining factor that I would not make it out of this life without needing treatment. Who knows what else he used for that opinion. I can\u0092t be certain he was looking at my records 😀 I\u0092ll talk to them more soon. I guess through a combination of things they can monitor bia the AS but the paranoia of what\u0092s there and undiscovered is nagging at me. I can\u0092t decide if the cancer is the worse news or the fact that I\u0092ll need another biopsy in six months. Dear sweet fancy Moses.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Littleman Thanks so much for your quick responses. I have posted here before when my husband 's PSA fluctuated from 3.4, down to .77 and finally up to 7.1. After reading the wealth of information on this forum, I asked his urologist for him to have an MRI (he suggested an in-office biopsy). I was so glad I did. The initial MRI report indicated that the \"findings were suggestive of prostatitis\". We breathed a sigh of relief until I read today's biopsy report. My husband is approaching 74 and is a survivor of a very aggressive form of leukemia, including a bone marrow transplant 5 years ago. When his PSA started fluctuating, the doctor quickly said that he would not be a candidate for surgery, primarily due to his age. I will report back as to what the urologist says. We live in New Jersey and are seen by doctors at The Cancer Institute in New Brunswick, where he was treated for his leukemia. We are more that willing to travel elsewhere for a second opinion. If anyone has a referral, it would be greatly appreciated. I have learned so much from this forum. Thanks so much! So very sorry for your husband\u0092s diagnosis, my best and prayers to him. Those words \u0093suggestive of prostatitis\u0094 sent a shiver down my spine. I\u0092m waiting an MRI targeted biopsy Valentine\u0092s week and my MRI report said the same.",

The other thing he mentioned that didn\u0092t give me great comfort is that they really didn\u0092t have AS stats regarding success past 10 years. That whole ten year mortality stat thing.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Ice, Johns Hopkins did a study years ago about their prostatectomy patients who were TRUE Gleason 6 patients -- meaning that the pathology report confirmed the biopsy report of only Gleason 6 and no higher grades found. Their study included 17,000 Gleason 6 patients. And out of those 17,000, the number of patients who had metastasized Gleason 6 was -- ABSOLUTE ZERO! As Djin noted, Gleason 6 CANNOT spread because it is not \"sophisticated\" enough to survive outside of the prostate. I can understand the sting you are feeling regarding the false diagnosis. The same thing happened to me..... I had pre-arranged for the uro's office to call me with my biopsy results, which came in a few days after the biopsy. When I got home, the first thing I did was check my Caller ID unit -- and I saw that the doctor's office had called me. So I went to my desk and very nervously sat down and picked up the phone to return their call. I remember thinking that the next minute or so could possibly define the rest of my life. I made the call and a woman answered and I told them who I was. She confirmed that the results of my biopsy were in and I heard her thumbing through the papers and finally pronounced, \"I have it right here -- and it's BENIGN!\" I cannot describe the profound relief I felt at that moment and said \"Thank God\" to myself as the relief poured through me. Then, it happened..... As I was sinking back in my chair with relief, she said, \"Oh, wait a minute. I was reading someone else's report, hang on for a second.\" I heard her rifling through more papers and she came back on and said, \"I just found your report -- and it is ... MALIGNANT!\" Again, I cannot describe the head-on collision between my original sense of relief and the cold terror that suddenly began surging inside of me. I was really out of it for a few seconds as I tried to process what had just happened. This was on a Friday afternoon and she told me she could get me in to see the doctor in a week for all the details. Then she told me, \"but you probably want to see him sooner than a week.\" And I almost answered, \"NO SHIT?\" So she said they would squeeze me in late the following Monday afternoon. So I had to spend the entire weekend with my mind dwelling on all the possibilities -- am I going to survive or should I avoid buying any green bananas? I had to fight down feelings of panic over & over. I wish I had known about this forum at that time, that's for sure. Fortunately, Monday arrived and I was as nervous as a snowball approaching Hell when my name was called to go into the exam room. The doctor was VERY gentle and nice and explained that I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6 and that I would live out my full lifespan if I had surgery. With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems. That was over 7 years ago and my PSA remains zero and my urination remains at firehose levels. So, hang in there, my friend. Sometimes things that start off with horror end up being very good. And, with just one positive core -- of Gleason 6 -- you are going to be just fine! Thanks my friend. I appreciate the time you put into this post. You guys have definitely encouraged me. I awoke this AM in a pretty good mood. I was pretty aggravated early evening but finally got over it...spiked the plans to do tax work (I have a tax business) and ordered a pizza and Dr. Pepper and watched a movie. I think it was good that my wife was out of town because it freed me from trying to comfort her and let me come to terms with it. Yeah I know this is their jobs and people make mistakes but for crying out loud read the correct report and read it accurately. What if the opposite had happened and the misreported it as cancer and the person killed themselves out of grief only to get the correcting call too late? I\u0092m going to have to give the docs a pass, they\u0092re only human but they definite get a great big ESPN c\u0092mon mannnnn. It was funny after all the trouble we had with the biopsy scheduling I think it was my wife who said \u0093I hope those were your results\u0094 😀 I have a lot going on specifically I worry that the job I have now and associated insurance will last until said treatment is needed. A change in jobs or coverage quality could impact everything from how much I pay to the doctors I can see. Oh well, c\u0092est la vie, those taxes I spiked last night are calling. Thanks again, I really appreciate the encouragement.",

      "Content": "If you\u0092ll remember, I got the call last week that my fusion + 12 core random biopsy came back with no cancer. 14 cores, 12 completely clear and 2 were pre-cancerous. We all kind of did the victory dance. I just got a call from the doctor who did the biopsy\u0097that I spoke to last Friday to the day\u0097and....it\u0092s cancer. He didn\u0092t even remember talking to me and was like \u0093you talked with me?\u0094 But he had no idea what changed and how. I don\u0092t have the path report but what I was told was that it was found in the same area as the pirads 3/4 (right peripheral) but wasn\u0092t one of the cores targeted with the MRI. Gleason 3+3 in 20% of that particular core so he quantified it as low risk worthy of surveillance but he also told me I didn\u0092t have cancer last week. Do you people see why I\u0092m cynical? 😀. For the love of all that\u0092s good and holy how do you get the relative all clear one Friday and cancer the next? I\u0092ve asked it to be sent to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion. And that\u0092s where I stand. I guess the sting for me was last week with the precancerous finding and I knew that meant the next biopsy would be cancerous most likely. So this news is more \u0093wth?\u0094 Due to the snafu. The bad thing is that my son is away at college and my wife and daughter are out of town at a band program (my baby made all state) so I\u0092m completely alone this weekend and can\u0092t even tell my wife. It would wreck her trip and neither she nor my daughter would enjoy the rest of the weekend and this is a big weekend for both of them. 48 years old with prostate cancer. Wow.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ISZ, I know you were let down, but putting their screwup aside, you really do want to know what's going on in your prostate. You'll be in an AS program, and could well be in the large group of G6 (3+3) men who never need treatment. Make sure you get a written copy of you path report. My guess regarding your earlier all-clear call is that either records/patients got screwed up (less likely), or a regular review of you slides was done and your pathology revised (perhaps more probable). And yes, the JH path review is certainly warranted. Try to put this in perspective: one core with some G6 (3+3) is the absolute minimum you can have and still qualify to call it cancer. It can't metastasize, and you'll be monitored. IF anything of concern hapens in your future, you can be confident you've caught it as early as possible And you're not alone---we're all right here! Djin Thanks Djin. I\u0092m not there with you yet...but this is like two hours old.

I don\u0092t know how AS is any more (or less) reliable than anything else in this adventure. My doc told me he would do another 12 core random in 6 months and an MRI again six months after that followed by a fusion biopsy. However his outlook wasn\u0092t so rosy. He said that the chances were great that this would progress and I would need treatment in the intermediate term of 3-5 years. So I am confused.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Yes, G6 cannot metastasize, and repeat imaging/biopsies are part of the \"active\" in active surveillance I'm not sure why your doc is predicting early treatment. Perhaps it has to do with your other cores and a prediction based on his experience that your prostate will in the coming years generate a bit too much G6 to remain in AS. The concern with a prostate having many pattern 3 lesions is not these G6 lesions themselves, but rather that there is some pattern 4 hidden somewhere, i.e., G7 (3+4) or (4+3) lesions. Treatment at that point is aimed at preventing more serious cancer down the road. In fact, some of these men who have had only G6 biopies, reveal G7 lesions when their entire prostate is examined after surgery (remember a biopsy samples only about 1% of prostate tissue). In any case, treatment in AS men is highly successful: very few of these men die from the cancer. The Subforum here (near the top of the main Forum page) has an entire topic with papers on AS studies. You can take the next few years to relax and read about the success rates. Thanks again. I\u0092m pretty resolved at this point it it what it is. My doc said that 60% of people with scores like mine end up never needing treatment and 40% do. However he said that my age was the determining factor that I would not make it out of this life without needing treatment. Who knows what else he used for that opinion. I can\u0092t be certain he was looking at my records 😀 I\u0092ll talk to them more soon. I guess through a combination of things they can monitor bia the AS but the paranoia of what\u0092s there and undiscovered is nagging at me. I can\u0092t decide if the cancer is the worse news or the fact that I\u0092ll need another biopsy in six months. Dear sweet fancy Moses.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Ice, Johns Hopkins did a study years ago about their prostatectomy patients who were TRUE Gleason 6 patients -- meaning that the pathology report confirmed the biopsy report of only Gleason 6 and no higher grades found. Their study included 17,000 Gleason 6 patients. And out of those 17,000, the number of patients who had metastasized Gleason 6 was -- ABSOLUTE ZERO! As Djin noted, Gleason 6 CANNOT spread because it is not \"sophisticated\" enough to survive outside of the prostate. I can understand the sting you are feeling regarding the false diagnosis. The same thing happened to me..... I had pre-arranged for the uro's office to call me with my biopsy results, which came in a few days after the biopsy. When I got home, the first thing I did was check my Caller ID unit -- and I saw that the doctor's office had called me. So I went to my desk and very nervously sat down and picked up the phone to return their call. I remember thinking that the next minute or so could possibly define the rest of my life. I made the call and a woman answered and I told them who I was. She confirmed that the results of my biopsy were in and I heard her thumbing through the papers and finally pronounced, \"I have it right here -- and it's BENIGN!\" I cannot describe the profound relief I felt at that moment and said \"Thank God\" to myself as the relief poured through me. Then, it happened..... As I was sinking back in my chair with relief, she said, \"Oh, wait a minute. I was reading someone else's report, hang on for a second.\" I heard her rifling through more papers and she came back on and said, \"I just found your report -- and it is ... MALIGNANT!\" Again, I cannot describe the head-on collision between my original sense of relief and the cold terror that suddenly began surging inside of me. I was really out of it for a few seconds as I tried to process what had just happened. This was on a Friday afternoon and she told me she could get me in to see the doctor in a week for all the details. Then she told me, \"but you probably want to see him sooner than a week.\" And I almost answered, \"NO SHIT?\" So she said they would squeeze me in late the following Monday afternoon. So I had to spend the entire weekend with my mind dwelling on all the possibilities -- am I going to survive or should I avoid buying any green bananas? I had to fight down feelings of panic over & over. I wish I had known about this forum at that time, that's for sure. Fortunately, Monday arrived and I was as nervous as a snowball approaching Hell when my name was called to go into the exam room. The doctor was VERY gentle and nice and explained that I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6 and that I would live out my full lifespan if I had surgery. With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems. That was over 7 years ago and my PSA remains zero and my urination remains at firehose levels. So, hang in there, my friend. Sometimes things that start off with horror end up being very good. And, with just one positive core -- of Gleason 6 -- you are going to be just fine! Thanks my friend. I appreciate the time you put into this post. You guys have definitely encouraged me. I awoke this AM in a pretty good mood. I was pretty aggravated early evening but finally got over it...spiked the plans to do tax work (I have a tax business) and ordered a pizza and Dr. Pepper and watched a movie. I think it was good that my wife was out of town because it freed me from trying to comfort her and let me come to terms with it. Yeah I know this is their jobs and people make mistakes but for crying out loud read the correct report and read it accurately. What if the opposite had happened and the misreported it as cancer and the person killed themselves out of grief only to get the correcting call too late? I\u0092m going to have to give the docs a pass, they\u0092re only human but they definite get a great big ESPN c\u0092mon mannnnn. It was funny after all the trouble we had with the biopsy scheduling I think it was my wife who said \u0093I hope those were your results\u0094 😀 I have a lot going on specifically I worry that the job I have now and associated insurance will last until said treatment is needed. A change in jobs or coverage quality could impact everything from how much I pay to the doctors I can see. Oh well, c\u0092est la vie, those taxes I spiked last night are calling.

He didnt seem to think I could get that far down the road, he kept stating 2-3 years was his expectations. I remember that because I was wondering if my current job would hold out that long should I need surgery. The other thing he mentioned that didn\u0092t give me great comfort is that they really didn\u0092t have AS stats regarding success past 10 years. That whole ten year mortality stat thing. He didn\u0092t have much comfort that he felt AS that long would be a success. I\u0092m asking the Mrs. to pick up he pathology report on Monday while I\u0092m at work. I hope to know more then.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Littleman Thanks so much for your quick responses. I have posted here before when my husband 's PSA fluctuated from 3.4, down to .77 and finally up to 7.1. After reading the wealth of information on this forum, I asked his urologist for him to have an MRI (he suggested an in-office biopsy). I was so glad I did. The initial MRI report indicated that the \"findings were suggestive of prostatitis\". We breathed a sigh of relief until I read today's biopsy report. My husband is approaching 74 and is a survivor of a very aggressive form of leukemia, including a bone marrow transplant 5 years ago. When his PSA started fluctuating, the doctor quickly said that he would not be a candidate for surgery, primarily due to his age. I will report back as to what the urologist says. We live in New Jersey and are seen by doctors at The Cancer Institute in New Brunswick, where he was treated for his leukemia. We are more that willing to travel elsewhere for a second opinion. If anyone has a referral, it would be greatly appreciated. I have learned so much from this forum. Thanks so much! So very sorry for your husband\u0092s diagnosis, my best and prayers to him. Those words \u0093suggestive of prostatitis\u0094 sent a shiver down my spine. I\u0092m waiting an MRI targeted biopsy Valentine\u0092s week and my MRI report said the same.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Yes, G6 cannot metastasize, and repeat imaging/biopsies are part of the \"active\" in active surveillance I'm not sure why your doc is predicting early treatment. Perhaps it has to do with your other cores and a prediction based on his experience that your prostate will in the coming years generate a bit too much G6 to remain in AS. The concern with a prostate having many pattern 3 lesions is not these G6 lesions themselves, but rather that there is some pattern 4 hidden somewhere, i.e., G7 (3+4) or (4+3) lesions. Treatment at that point is aimed at preventing more serious cancer down the road. In fact, some of these men who have had only G6 biopies, reveal G7 lesions when their entire prostate is examined after surgery (remember a biopsy samples only about 1% of prostate tissue). In any case, treatment in AS men is highly successful: very few of these men die from the cancer. The Subforum here (near the top of the main Forum page) has an entire topic with papers on AS studies. You can take the next few years to relax and read about the success rates. Thanks again. I\u0092m pretty resolved at this point it it what it is. My doc said that 60% of people with scores like mine end up never needing treatment and 40% do. However he said that my age was the determining factor that I would not make it out of this life without needing treatment. Who knows what else he used for that opinion. I can\u0092t be certain he was looking at my records 😀 I\u0092ll talk to them more soon. I guess through a combination of things they can monitor bia the AS but the paranoia of what\u0092s there and undiscovered is nagging at me. I can\u0092t decide if the cancer is the worse news or the fact that I\u0092ll need another biopsy in six months. Dear sweet fancy Moses.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ISZ, I know you were let down, but putting their screwup aside, you really do want to know what's going on in your prostate. You'll be in an AS program, and could well be in the large group of G6 (3+3) men who never need treatment. Make sure you get a written copy of you path report. My guess regarding your earlier all-clear call is that either records/patients got screwed up (less likely), or a regular review of you slides was done and your pathology revised (perhaps more probable). And yes, the JH path review is certainly warranted. Try to put this in perspective: one core with some G6 (3+3) is the absolute minimum you can have and still qualify to call it cancer. It can't metastasize, and you'll be monitored. IF anything of concern hapens in your future, you can be confident you've caught it as early as possible And you're not alone---we're all right here! Djin Thanks Djin. I\u0092m not there with you yet...but this is like two hours old. It\u0092s amazing the mind screw that happens when you hear the news for sure, it\u0092s almost like you\u0092re starting over. I guess I was unaware that the 6 could not metastasize are you certain of that? So basically you\u0092re saying that piece cannot grow or spread to bones, etc.? The real rub is that we don\u0092t know what was missed. I could still have an aggressive cancer somewhere else..heck this was found in a random area. I don\u0092t know how AS is any more (or less) reliable than anything else in this adventure. My doc told me he would do another 12 core random in 6 months and an MRI again six months after that followed by a fusion biopsy. However his outlook wasn\u0092t so rosy. He said that the chances were great that this would progress and I would need treatment in the intermediate term of 3-5 years. So I am confused.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic If you need treatment in 30 years, that treatment will very likely be a distant cousin to today's. Well true. He didnt seem to think I could get that far down the road, he kept stating 2-3 years was his expectations. I remember that because I was wondering if my current job would hold out that long should I need surgery. The other thing he mentioned that didn\u0092t give me great comfort is that they really didn\u0092t have AS stats regarding success past 10 years. That whole ten year mortality stat thing. He didn\u0092t have much comfort that he felt AS that long would be a success. I\u0092m asking the Mrs. to pick up he pathology report on Monday while I\u0092m at work. I hope to know more then.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Yes, G6 cannot metastasize, and repeat imaging/biopsies are part of the \"active\" in active surveillance I'm not sure why your doc is predicting early treatment. Perhaps it has to do with your other cores and a prediction based on his experience that your prostate will in the coming years generate a bit too much G6 to remain in AS. The concern with a prostate having many pattern 3 lesions is not these G6 lesions themselves, but rather that there is some pattern 4 hidden somewhere, i.e., G7 (3+4) or (4+3) lesions. Treatment at that point is aimed at preventing more serious cancer down the road. In fact, some of these men who have had only G6 biopies, reveal G7 lesions when their entire prostate is examined after surgery (remember a biopsy samples only about 1% of prostate tissue). In any case, treatment in AS men is highly successful: very few of these men die from the cancer. The Subforum here (near the top of the main Forum page) has an entire topic with papers on AS studies. You can take the next few years to relax and read about the success rates. Thanks again. I\u0092m pretty resolved at this point it it what it is. My doc said that 60% of people with scores like mine end up never needing treatment and 40% do. However he said that my age was the determining factor that I would not make it out of this life without needing treatment. Who knows what else he used for that opinion. I can\u0092t be certain he was looking at my records 😀 I\u0092ll talk to them more soon. I guess through a combination of things they can monitor bia the AS but the paranoia of what\u0092s there and undiscovered is nagging at me. I can\u0092t decide if the cancer is the worse news or the fact that I\u0092ll need another biopsy in six months. Dear sweet fancy Moses.",

      "Content": "If you\u0092ll remember, I got the call last week that my fusion + 12 core random biopsy came back with no cancer. 14 cores, 12 completely clear and 2 were pre-cancerous. We all kind of did the victory dance. I just got a call from the doctor who did the biopsy\u0097that I spoke to last Friday to the day\u0097and....it\u0092s cancer. He didn\u0092t even remember talking to me and was like \u0093you talked with me?\u0094 But he had no idea what changed and how. I don\u0092t have the path report but what I was told was that it was found in the same area as the pirads 3/4 (right peripheral) but wasn\u0092t one of the cores targeted with the MRI. Gleason 3+3 in 20% of that particular core so he quantified it as low risk worthy of surveillance but he also told me I didn\u0092t have cancer last week. Do you people see why I\u0092m cynical? 😀. For the love of all that\u0092s good and holy how do you get the relative all clear one Friday and cancer the next? I\u0092ve asked it to be sent to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion. And that\u0092s where I stand. I guess the sting for me was last week with the precancerous finding and I knew that meant the next biopsy would be cancerous most likely. So this news is more \u0093wth?\u0094 Due to the snafu. The bad thing is that my son is away at college and my wife and daughter are out of town at a band program (my baby made all state) so I\u0092m completely alone this weekend and can\u0092t even tell my wife. It would wreck her trip and neither she nor my daughter would enjoy the rest of the weekend and this is a big weekend for both of them. 48 years old with prostate cancer. Wow.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Ice, Johns Hopkins did a study years ago about their prostatectomy patients who were TRUE Gleason 6 patients -- meaning that the pathology report confirmed the biopsy report of only Gleason 6 and no higher grades found. Their study included 17,000 Gleason 6 patients. And out of those 17,000, the number of patients who had metastasized Gleason 6 was -- ABSOLUTE ZERO! As Djin noted, Gleason 6 CANNOT spread because it is not \"sophisticated\" enough to survive outside of the prostate. I can understand the sting you are feeling regarding the false diagnosis. The same thing happened to me..... I had pre-arranged for the uro's office to call me with my biopsy results, which came in a few days after the biopsy. When I got home, the first thing I did was check my Caller ID unit -- and I saw that the doctor's office had called me. So I went to my desk and very nervously sat down and picked up the phone to return their call. I remember thinking that the next minute or so could possibly define the rest of my life. I made the call and a woman answered and I told them who I was. She confirmed that the results of my biopsy were in and I heard her thumbing through the papers and finally pronounced, \"I have it right here -- and it's BENIGN!\" I cannot describe the profound relief I felt at that moment and said \"Thank God\" to myself as the relief poured through me. Then, it happened..... As I was sinking back in my chair with relief, she said, \"Oh, wait a minute. I was reading someone else's report, hang on for a second.\" I heard her rifling through more papers and she came back on and said, \"I just found your report -- and it is ... MALIGNANT!\" Again, I cannot describe the head-on collision between my original sense of relief and the cold terror that suddenly began surging inside of me. I was really out of it for a few seconds as I tried to process what had just happened. This was on a Friday afternoon and she told me she could get me in to see the doctor in a week for all the details. Then she told me, \"but you probably want to see him sooner than a week.\" And I almost answered, \"NO SHIT?\" So she said they would squeeze me in late the following Monday afternoon. So I had to spend the entire weekend with my mind dwelling on all the possibilities -- am I going to survive or should I avoid buying any green bananas? I had to fight down feelings of panic over & over. I wish I had known about this forum at that time, that's for sure. Fortunately, Monday arrived and I was as nervous as a snowball approaching Hell when my name was called to go into the exam room. The doctor was VERY gentle and nice and explained that I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6 and that I would live out my full lifespan if I had surgery. With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems. That was over 7 years ago and my PSA remains zero and my urination remains at firehose levels. So, hang in there, my friend. Sometimes things that start off with horror end up being very good. And, with just one positive core -- of Gleason 6 -- you are going to be just fine! Thanks my friend. I appreciate the time you put into this post. You guys have definitely encouraged me. I awoke this AM in a pretty good mood. I was pretty aggravated early evening but finally got over it...spiked the plans to do tax work (I have a tax business) and ordered a pizza and Dr. Pepper and watched a movie. I think it was good that my wife was out of town because it freed me from trying to comfort her and let me come to terms with it. Yeah I know this is their jobs and people make mistakes but for crying out loud read the correct report and read it accurately. What if the opposite had happened and the misreported it as cancer and the person killed themselves out of grief only to get the correcting call too late? I\u0092m going to have to give the docs a pass, they\u0092re only human but they definite get a great big ESPN c\u0092mon mannnnn. It was funny after all the trouble we had with the biopsy scheduling I think it was my wife who said \u0093I hope those were your results\u0094 😀 I have a lot going on specifically I worry that the job I have now and associated insurance will last until said treatment is needed. A change in jobs or coverage quality could impact everything from how much I pay to the doctors I can see. Oh well, c\u0092est la vie, those taxes I spiked last night are calling. Thanks again, I really appreciate the encouragement.",

Then she told me, \"but you probably want to see him sooner than a week.\" And I almost answered, \"NO SHIT?\" So she said they would squeeze me in late the following Monday afternoon. So I had to spend the entire weekend with my mind dwelling on all the possibilities -- am I going to survive or should I avoid buying any green bananas? I had to fight down feelings of panic over & over. I wish I had known about this forum at that time, that's for sure. Fortunately, Monday arrived and I was as nervous as a snowball approaching Hell when my name was called to go into the exam room. The doctor was VERY gentle and nice and explained that I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6 and that I would live out my full lifespan if I had surgery. With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems. That was over 7 years ago and my PSA remains zero and my urination remains at firehose levels. So, hang in there, my friend. Sometimes things that start off with horror end up being very good. And, with just one positive core -- of Gleason 6 -- you are going to be just fine! Thanks my friend. I appreciate the time you put into this post. You guys have definitely encouraged me. I awoke this AM in a pretty good mood. I was pretty aggravated early evening but finally got over it...spiked the plans to do tax work (I have a tax business) and ordered a pizza and Dr. Pepper and watched a movie. I think it was good that my wife was out of town because it freed me from trying to comfort her and let me come to terms with it. Yeah I know this is their jobs and people make mistakes but for crying out loud read the correct report and read it accurately. What if the opposite had happened and the misreported it as cancer and the person killed themselves out of grief only to get the correcting call too late? I\u0092m going to have to give the docs a pass, they\u0092re only human but they definite get a great big ESPN c\u0092mon mannnnn. It was funny after all the trouble we had with the biopsy scheduling I think it was my wife who said \u0093I hope those were your results\u0094 😀 I have a lot going on specifically I worry that the job I have now and associated insurance will last until said treatment is needed. A change in jobs or coverage quality could impact everything from how much I pay to the doctors I can see. Oh well, c\u0092est la vie, those taxes I spiked last night are calling.

He didnt seem to think I could get that far down the road, he kept stating 2-3 years was his expectations. I remember that because I was wondering if my current job would hold out that long should I need surgery. The other thing he mentioned that didn\u0092t give me great comfort is that they really didn\u0092t have AS stats regarding success past 10 years. That whole ten year mortality stat thing. He didn\u0092t have much comfort that he felt AS that long would be a success. I\u0092m asking the Mrs. to pick up he pathology report on Monday while I\u0092m at work. I hope to know more then.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ISZ, I know you were let down, but putting their screwup aside, you really do want to know what's going on in your prostate.

The real rub is that we don\u0092t know what was missed. I could still have an aggressive cancer somewhere else..heck this was found in a random area. I don\u0092t know how AS is any more (or less) reliable than anything else in this adventure. My doc told me he would do another 12 core random in 6 months and an MRI again six months after that followed by a fusion biopsy. However his outlook wasn\u0092t so rosy. He said that the chances were great that this would progress and I would need treatment in the intermediate term of 3-5 years. So I am confused.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Yes, G6 cannot metastasize, and repeat imaging/biopsies are part of the \"active\" in active surveillance I'm not sure why your doc is predicting early treatment. Perhaps it has to do with your other cores and a prediction based on his experience that your prostate will in the coming years generate a bit too much G6 to remain in AS. The concern with a prostate having many pattern 3 lesions is not these G6 lesions themselves, but rather that there is some pattern 4 hidden somewhere, i.e., G7 (3+4) or (4+3) lesions. Treatment at that point is aimed at preventing more serious cancer down the road. In fact, some of these men who have had only G6 biopies, reveal G7 lesions when their entire prostate is examined after surgery (remember a biopsy samples only about 1% of prostate tissue). In any case, treatment in AS men is highly successful: very few of these men die from the cancer. The Subforum here (near the top of the main Forum page) has an entire topic with papers on AS studies. You can take the next few years to relax and read about the success rates. Thanks again. I\u0092m pretty resolved at this point it it what it is. My doc said that 60% of people with scores like mine end up never needing treatment and 40% do. However he said that my age was the determining factor that I would not make it out of this life without needing treatment. Who knows what else he used for that opinion. I can\u0092t be certain he was looking at my records 😀 I\u0092ll talk to them more soon. I guess through a combination of things they can monitor bia the AS but the paranoia of what\u0092s there and undiscovered is nagging at me. I can\u0092t decide if the cancer is the worse news or the fact that I\u0092ll need another biopsy in six months. Dear sweet fancy Moses.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Ice, Johns Hopkins did a study years ago about their prostatectomy patients who were TRUE Gleason 6 patients -- meaning that the pathology report confirmed the biopsy report of only Gleason 6 and no higher grades found. Their study included 17,000 Gleason 6 patients. And out of those 17,000, the number of patients who had metastasized Gleason 6 was -- ABSOLUTE ZERO! As Djin noted, Gleason 6 CANNOT spread because it is not \"sophisticated\" enough to survive outside of the prostate. I can understand the sting you are feeling regarding the false diagnosis. The same thing happened to me..... I had pre-arranged for the uro's office to call me with my biopsy results, which came in a few days after the biopsy. When I got home, the first thing I did was check my Caller ID unit -- and I saw that the doctor's office had called me. So I went to my desk and very nervously sat down and picked up the phone to return their call. I remember thinking that the next minute or so could possibly define the rest of my life. I made the call and a woman answered and I told them who I was. She confirmed that the results of my biopsy were in and I heard her thumbing through the papers and finally pronounced, \"I have it right here -- and it's BENIGN!\" I cannot describe the profound relief I felt at that moment and said \"Thank God\" to myself as the relief poured through me. Then, it happened..... As I was sinking back in my chair with relief, she said, \"Oh, wait a minute. I was reading someone else's report, hang on for a second.\" I heard her rifling through more papers and she came back on and said, \"I just found your report -- and it is ... MALIGNANT!\" Again, I cannot describe the head-on collision between my original sense of relief and the cold terror that suddenly began surging inside of me. I was really out of it for a few seconds as I tried to process what had just happened. This was on a Friday afternoon and she told me she could get me in to see the doctor in a week for all the details. Then she told me, \"but you probably want to see him sooner than a week.\" And I almost answered, \"NO SHIT?\" So she said they would squeeze me in late the following Monday afternoon.

      "Content": "If you\u0092ll remember, I got the call last week that my fusion + 12 core random biopsy came back with no cancer. 14 cores, 12 completely clear and 2 were pre-cancerous. We all kind of did the victory dance. I just got a call from the doctor who did the biopsy\u0097that I spoke to last Friday to the day\u0097and....it\u0092s cancer. He didn\u0092t even remember talking to me and was like \u0093you talked with me?\u0094 But he had no idea what changed and how. I don\u0092t have the path report but what I was told was that it was found in the same area as the pirads 3/4 (right peripheral) but wasn\u0092t one of the cores targeted with the MRI. Gleason 3+3 in 20% of that particular core so he quantified it as low risk worthy of surveillance but he also told me I didn\u0092t have cancer last week. Do you people see why I\u0092m cynical? 😀. For the love of all that\u0092s good and holy how do you get the relative all clear one Friday and cancer the next? I\u0092ve asked it to be sent to Johns Hopkins for a second opinion. And that\u0092s where I stand. I guess the sting for me was last week with the precancerous finding and I knew that meant the next biopsy would be cancerous most likely. So this news is more \u0093wth?\u0094 Due to the snafu. The bad thing is that my son is away at college and my wife and daughter are out of town at a band program (my baby made all state) so I\u0092m completely alone this weekend and can\u0092t even tell my wife. It would wreck her trip and neither she nor my daughter would enjoy the rest of the weekend and this is a big weekend for both of them. 48 years old with prostate cancer. Wow.",

I don\u0092t know how AS is any more (or less) reliable than anything else in this adventure. My doc told me he would do another 12 core random in 6 months and an MRI again six months after that followed by a fusion biopsy. However his outlook wasn\u0092t so rosy. He said that the chances were great that this would progress and I would need treatment in the intermediate term of 3-5 years. So I am confused.",

He didnt seem to think I could get that far down the road, he kept stating 2-3 years was his expectations. I remember that because I was wondering if my current job would hold out that long should I need surgery. The other thing he mentioned that didn\u0092t give me great comfort is that they really didn\u0092t have AS stats regarding success past 10 years. That whole ten year mortality stat thing. He didn\u0092t have much comfort that he felt AS that long would be a success. I\u0092m asking the Mrs. to pick up he pathology report on Monday while I\u0092m at work. I hope to know more then.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic ISZ, I know you were let down, but putting their screwup aside, you really do want to know what's going on in your prostate. You'll be in an AS program, and could well be in the large group of G6 (3+3) men who never need treatment. Make sure you get a written copy of you path report. My guess regarding your earlier all-clear call is that either records/patients got screwed up (less likely), or a regular review of you slides was done and your pathology revised (perhaps more probable). And yes, the JH path review is certainly warranted. Try to put this in perspective: one core with some G6 (3+3) is the absolute minimum you can have and still qualify to call it cancer. It can't metastasize, and you'll be monitored. IF anything of concern hapens in your future, you can be confident you've caught it as early as possible And you're not alone---we're all right here! Djin Thanks Djin. I\u0092m not there with you yet...but this is like two hours old.

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and terrified (have those words ever been uttered here? ). Trying desperately to keep some perspective, while I wait two more days for my biopsy results. I'm 47 years old and went on Androgel about, I don't know, 10-12 years ago because my T levels were 260 at age 37 or 38. Ummm worked okay I guess--super expensive and a pain to administer/deal with. Life bumped along until two weeks ago when I did some routine bloodwork and received a message from my primary care doc who had been measuring my PSA. It had bounced to 4.1 which exceeded the high end level. He apparently had been asleep at the wheel (I had no idea about PSA velocity or rising PSA), here are my PSA levels by year: 2012: 2.2 2013: 2.6 2014: 2.8 2015: 3.1 2016: 3.5 2017: ? I don't have a copy, I'm SURE we measured it. 2018: 4.1 He should have clued in something was wrong, so I referred to a urologist immediately and stopped the androgel. The doc said androgel probably wouldn't cause the high reading but might just accelerate the trajectory of where my prostate was going anyway. Family history: Dad aged 75 has the prostate of a 25 year old. Half brother, nothing. DRE showed a larger than average prostate (but I'm a big guy, 6'3\" 295) that subsequently measured 46 ML on an ultrasound--large prostate, lots of PSA. The prostate was smooth, no nodules or bumps. On the ultrasound the doc said he saw no signs of odd density or oddities, nothing to worry about from the ultrasound. The doctor measured my free PSA that measured at 10% that gave me >50% chance of cancer until you discounted my age. The doc plugged my numbers into his handy dandy calculator and told me 75% chance it's BPH and 25% and chance it's cancer. He said his threshold to 'wait and see' was 20%, so being the worry wart I am I opted for the biopsy. No anesthesia but he gave me 30 mg of Xanax that kicked in about 30 minutes AFTER the biopsy was over, I hear I enjoyed the bagel my wife bought me on the way home (don't remember it). But I remember every SECOND of that barbaric biopsy. Anyway, that's it. The doctor said he believes it will ultimately be BPH but I'm just scared to death that it's cancer. The doctor said that even if it was cancer, it's 87% chance it's NOT the aggressive kill you type and that he'd get rid of it and the ride to the doctor's office would be riskier than the cancer...with regards to my life. I go Thursday (two days from now) to get the results and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping worrying about this. A wife and a college freshman and high school freshman, I have a lot of people who need me around.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and terrified (have those words ever been uttered here? ). Trying desperately to keep some perspective, while I wait two more days for my biopsy results. I'm 47 years old and went on Androgel about, I don't know, 10-12 years ago because my T levels were 260 at age 37 or 38. Ummm worked okay I guess--super expensive and a pain to administer/deal with. Life bumped along until two weeks ago when I did some routine bloodwork and received a message from my primary care doc who had been measuring my PSA. It had bounced to 4.1 which exceeded the high end level. He apparently had been asleep at the wheel (I had no idea about PSA velocity or rising PSA), here are my PSA levels by year: 2012: 2.2 2013: 2.6 2014: 2.8 2015: 3.1 2016: 3.5 2017: ? I don't have a copy, I'm SURE we measured it. 2018: 4.1 He should have clued in something was wrong, so I referred to a urologist immediately and stopped the androgel. The doc said androgel probably wouldn't cause the high reading but might just accelerate the trajectory of where my prostate was going anyway. Family history: Dad aged 75 has the prostate of a 25 year old. Half brother, nothing. DRE showed a larger than average prostate (but I'm a big guy, 6'3\" 295) that subsequently measured 46 ML on an ultrasound--large prostate, lots of PSA. The prostate was smooth, no nodules or bumps. On the ultrasound the doc said he saw no signs of odd density or oddities, nothing to worry about from the ultrasound. The doctor measured my free PSA that measured at 10% that gave me >50% chance of cancer until you discounted my age. The doc plugged my numbers into his handy dandy calculator and told me 75% chance it's BPH and 25% and chance it's cancer. He said his threshold to 'wait and see' was 20%, so being the worry wart I am I opted for the biopsy. No anesthesia but he gave me 30 mg of Xanax that kicked in about 30 minutes AFTER the biopsy was over, I hear I enjoyed the bagel my wife bought me on the way home (don't remember it). But I remember every SECOND of that barbaric biopsy. Anyway, that's it. The doctor said he believes it will ultimately be BPH but I'm just scared to death that it's cancer. The doctor said that even if it was cancer, it's 87% chance it's NOT the aggressive kill you type and that he'd get rid of it and the ride to the doctor's office would be riskier than the cancer...with regards to my life. I go Thursday (two days from now) to get the results and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping worrying about this. A wife and a college freshman and high school freshman, I have a lot of people who need me around.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome ISZ! First & Foremost: Relax & Do NOT Panic! While we are not MDs and can not make predictions, I can assure you that all of us share the opinion that You will be around for a long time. Some points to consider: - You are young. Men in their 40's can/do get PCa but it is far more prevalent with men in their 60's. Thus the statistics are in your favor. - You prostate gland is large. The Ultrasound is not as accurate as an MRI in measuring prostate volume. So yours may actually be larger than 46 cc. - You PSA is definitely elevated and rising. However, the rate of rise is NOT meteoric which is good. - 10% Free PSA is concerning but in now way diagnostic of PCa - Your URO MD does not seem suspect PCa so neither should you! Did the URO MD not inject your prostate with lidocaine prior to biopsy? On the long list of Things No Man Has Ever Said is: \"I really relaxed & enjoyed the time between walking into my Urologist's office to have my biopsy and returning a week later for the results!\" Good luck and best wishes for walking out of the office next visit with all good results! Be sure to get a copy of the Path Report for your records. Keep us updated. MF Thanks for the reassurance. Consensus seems to be I\u0092m okay so I\u0092m holding you all to that! 😀 He did inject it with lidocain and once he did, it was fine. In fact I told him to take extra samples if he wanted because I wanted to be sure. I felt one minor twinge on one of the samples. The problem was getting the thing in there. Not sure how others are but this thing was shaped like a longer, large Nintendo Wii controller. I first thought \u0093awesome, while waiting for the Xanax to kick in we\u0092re going to play Wii golf\u0094. No were gonna play hide this giant brick sized ultrasound and knife attack machine in there. It was a bit of a struggle because there\u0092s just no way to relax during THAT! But I got through it and then stumbled around like a cast member of the walking dead at the bagel shop. I don\u0092t remember a thing about that experience but am in intensive therapy trying to forget the biopsy. 😀 I think I\u0092m going to fire my primary care doc and write him a letter informing him why and what he should be doing for other patients on TRT. And technically for men not on TRT, if their velocity increases like mine. .5 is apparently a pretty reliabile indicator of high probability of cancer. The good news is that unless I crash, I plan to be off the TRT. Hated being dependent on that stuff and hoping that each insurer plan covers it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard to BOTH of you. Ice, I believe your uro is probably correct that this is NOT a case of prostate cancer, but the result of a steadily growing prostate. Prostate tissue creates PSA and, of course, larger prostates produce more PSA. Normal PSA readings for the 40s age group is 0 - 2.5. You're approaching the age group of the 50s, for which the range is 0 - 3.5. So you're not horribly far from the high norm. In addition, your PSA elevation has been a slow, steady increase over the past few years, which kind of dovetails with your BPH. You'll probably be just fine -- but will be in a situation where I was at in that an enlarged prostate/higher PSA could someday be masking a tumor, which would probably be reflected by a rapid spike in the PSA reading. This means that you'll want to have regular PSA tests from now on to keep an eye on things. Good luck! Chuck Thanks Chuck, very helpful.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard to BOTH of you. Ice, I believe your uro is probably correct that this is NOT a case of prostate cancer, but the result of a steadily growing prostate. Prostate tissue creates PSA and, of course, larger prostates produce more PSA. Normal PSA readings for the 40s age group is 0 - 2.5. You're approaching the age group of the 50s, for which the range is 0 - 3.5. So you're not horribly far from the high norm.

      "Content": "Hi all, Nervously awaiting my biopsy results and a question popped into my head that I don\u0092t think was ever asked. I know plenty of you have had negative original biopsies only to have a later positive biopsy. However, has anyone had the situation where the first biopsy result was totally clear and a later biopsy showed a surprising amount of cancer? My original biopsy was March of last year and was complete clear. I\u0092m wondering what to expect from these fusion results...I would expect that just a year later if there is any cancer at all it should be relatively localized\u0097perhaps in the PIRADS 3/4 area. I would be a little surprised if the 12 core random biopsy samples they took after the fusion came back with significant cancer in degree or quantity. Basically my interpretation of the clean biopsy from last March was that it could only say that My prostate wasn\u0092t completely eaten up with cancer. Just curious if anyone had the surprise lots of cancer on a second biopsy. Am I making any sense what so ever?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic The laterality (uni- or bilateral), and also the extent to some degree, of cancer that is prostate-confined has little correlation with biochemical recurrence (the return of increasing PSA after primary treatment). The new edition of the TNM staging guide does away with subclassifying stage pT2 for that reason. The TMN 8th edition: Validation of the proposal for organ - confined (pT2) prostate cancer [2018] [Emphasis mine] Roughly 1/3 of (random) 12-core TRUS biopsies miss existing cancer. My final biopsy found cancer on one side only, yet it was present one both sides. Nontheless, the cancer involved only about 5% of my prostate. In other words, PCa is multifocal and can pop up all over, even if there is often a \"primary\" lesions which is the largest and perhaps the oldest. As I see it, what is more important that the number of lesions or total amount of tumor in a biopsy is: The Gleason score, which contributes significantly to the risk classification of the cancer Is the cancer prostate-confined or not? The cancer can spread either by growing out of the prostate capsule, by growing through the prostate base into neighboring anatomical structures or by sending off metastases, local or distant. The location of the lesions and imaging can give you a not-always-accurate idea as to whether the cancer is prostate-confined. The genomics (genetic nature) of the cancer--basically its aggressiveness and tendency to metastasize. This can be independent of the Gleason score. Based on a biopsy, there are really 3 outcomes: No cancer found (which does not mean it isn't there) Cancer that be monitored by active surveillance Cancer that needs to be treated If you have a 2nd negative biopsy, you should continue to be on your uro's radar to be followed diligently. The chance of missing existing cancer go down very fast with repeat biopsies. Thank you, very informative. I was hoping for a \u0093get outta here, that never happens\u0094 but instinctively knew it had to...to someone, somewhere. Yesterday I hit a zen kind of peace about it and today I\u0092m having a hard time breathing due to the worry. Maybe I instinctively knew it couldn\u0092t possibly be delivered yesterday. I guess that\u0092s my next question for the doc if I get really blessed and the MRI fusion and the second random 12 core comes back clean....what next? I think we\u0092ve just about done every test at this point.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Yes my initial biopsy was totally negative... no sign of cancer. The fusion biopsy two years later showed that 25% of my prostate was grade 4, Gleason 8. How did that happen? Without an MRI and a fusion biopsy, the urologist can only access less than one half of the prostate. In other words, my original urologist - in my opinion, didn't even look. It's like opening the closet door and saying nothing in here but clothes, without bothering to at least look around. By the time I was on my third urologist, I remarked on a graphic he had hanging in his office which showed that the top half of the prostate (the \"base\") is entirely hidden behind the pubic bone. I said \"no wonder my other urologist couldn't find my cancer\" and he said \"yeah, you can never find them up there.\" So how could one's cancer progress from non-existent to very high risk and locally advanced in just two years? By a urologist who was not entirely honest with the patient. He made no attempt whatsoever to INFORM me of the possibility of a false negative biopsy. He only told me that my biopsy was negative and that my prostate was normal. In my mind, performing a biopsy that completely missed a sizable tumor should be grounds for a lawsuit. But of course that would likely be a futile effort and would just make me feel worse. And so because two years were lost, I am basically now an incontinent eunuch with major depressive disorder. I certainly hope you don't end up that way. I always assumed that a doctor would know what he's doing and that he would act only in the patient's best interest. Not so. Thank you for your reply. I\u0092m very sorry this happened to you. I wish I had some magic wand to make it all better for you but can only offer my prayers and artfully dealt sarcastic wit. The pirads 3/4 they identified is in the right peripheral lobe and should have been reachable, I think. My last biopsy showed inflammation and prostatitis and some other benign condition but I don\u0092t have the report to tell me where those samples hit. If they were in the right peripheral the 3/4 that showed up on the MRI might be what was found last time. Hang in there my friend.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic The best medicine now is to relax!! If it's cancer you will deal with it and be done. If it's not, your doc will look elsewhere for any symptoms you're having. It's possible that there are repeat biopsies in your future. Imaging, especially newer PET scans, are improving and are starting to be used for diagnosis. After my I-don't-remember-which-number negative biopsy, my doc said \"We are not going to let you die of high-grade cancer.\"Turns out we subsequently did find very high-grade cancer. The good news is that he's kept his promise so far: I'm alive and typing. Glad to hear it....glad you made it brother. That\u0092s the funny thing up until I got that Ill fated email from my pcp this time last year I never had the first symptom of any significance. So there\u0092s not much to treat. I do have some Ed but I think that\u0092s because they stopped the testosterone replacement and might be BPH related to some extent. But even that\u0092s manageable.

Be sure to get a copy of the Path Report for your records. Keep us updated. MF Thanks for the reassurance. Consensus seems to be I\u0092m okay so I\u0092m holding you all to that! 😀 He did inject it with lidocain and once he did, it was fine.

But I got through it and then stumbled around like a cast member of the walking dead at the bagel shop. I don\u0092t remember a thing about that experience but am in intensive therapy trying to forget the biopsy. 😀 I think I\u0092m going to fire my primary care doc and write him a letter informing him why and what he should be doing for other patients on TRT. And technically for men not on TRT, if their velocity increases like mine. .5 is apparently a pretty reliabile indicator of high probability of cancer. The good news is that unless I crash, I plan to be off the TRT. Hated being dependent on that stuff and hoping that each insurer plan covers it.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and terrified (have those words ever been uttered here? ). Trying desperately to keep some perspective, while I wait two more days for my biopsy results. I'm 47 years old and went on Androgel about, I don't know, 10-12 years ago because my T levels were 260 at age 37 or 38. Ummm worked okay I guess--super expensive and a pain to administer/deal with. Life bumped along until two weeks ago when I did some routine bloodwork and received a message from my primary care doc who had been measuring my PSA. It had bounced to 4.1 which exceeded the high end level. He apparently had been asleep at the wheel (I had no idea about PSA velocity or rising PSA), here are my PSA levels by year: 2012: 2.2 2013: 2.6 2014: 2.8 2015: 3.1 2016: 3.5 2017: ? I don't have a copy, I'm SURE we measured it. 2018: 4.1 He should have clued in something was wrong, so I referred to a urologist immediately and stopped the androgel. The doc said androgel probably wouldn't cause the high reading but might just accelerate the trajectory of where my prostate was going anyway. Family history: Dad aged 75 has the prostate of a 25 year old. Half brother, nothing. DRE showed a larger than average prostate (but I'm a big guy, 6'3\" 295) that subsequently measured 46 ML on an ultrasound--large prostate, lots of PSA. The prostate was smooth, no nodules or bumps. On the ultrasound the doc said he saw no signs of odd density or oddities, nothing to worry about from the ultrasound. The doctor measured my free PSA that measured at 10% that gave me >50% chance of cancer until you discounted my age. The doc plugged my numbers into his handy dandy calculator and told me 75% chance it's BPH and 25% and chance it's cancer. He said his threshold to 'wait and see' was 20%, so being the worry wart I am I opted for the biopsy. No anesthesia but he gave me 30 mg of Xanax that kicked in about 30 minutes AFTER the biopsy was over, I hear I enjoyed the bagel my wife bought me on the way home (don't remember it). But I remember every SECOND of that barbaric biopsy. Anyway, that's it. The doctor said he believes it will ultimately be BPH but I'm just scared to death that it's cancer. The doctor said that even if it was cancer, it's 87% chance it's NOT the aggressive kill you type and that he'd get rid of it and the ride to the doctor's office would be riskier than the cancer...with regards to my life. I go Thursday (two days from now) to get the results and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping worrying about this. A wife and a college freshman and high school freshman, I have a lot of people who need me around.",

He should have never been allowed on stage to give a TED Talk related to being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He is on AS! He has not been affected by Prostate Cancer except for his self proclaimed grossly inappropriate psychological impacts of a disease status that is most likely 100% harmless to him. He received a gift diagnosis not a death sentence! He has not experienced any of the following either individually or in combination: Radiation Therapy, Radical Prostatectomy Surgery, Hormone Therapy; Radical Prostatectomy Surgery followed by Radiation Therapy, Any of these combined with Hormone Therapy, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, loss of masculinity during treatment and obviously not death by prostate cancer. No, he experienced no pain or suffering. He has never had to battle the disease. Rather he used his \"misfortune\" to snag a new girlfriend and ride off to a new start in his blue convertible. Get out the puke bags buddy!!! Instead Mr McCarthy stands in the spotlight and insipidly spews out a theme stolen from the great Al Greene: Love and Happiness. What a misguided total fool! What an insult to the members of this forum who have been truly impacted by prostate cancer. Sorry Mr SubDenis but you should remove the link to Mr McCarthy's shameful self-aggrandizing charade.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic The laterality (uni- or bilateral), and also the extent to some degree, of cancer that is prostate-confined has little correlation with biochemical recurrence (the return of increasing PSA after primary treatment). The new edition of the TNM staging guide does away with subclassifying stage pT2 for that reason. The TMN 8th edition: Validation of the proposal for organ - confined (pT2) prostate cancer [2018] [Emphasis mine] Roughly 1/3 of (random) 12-core TRUS biopsies miss existing cancer. My final biopsy found cancer on one side only, yet it was present one both sides. Nontheless, the cancer involved only about 5% of my prostate. In other words, PCa is multifocal and can pop up all over, even if there is often a \"primary\" lesions which is the largest and perhaps the oldest. As I see it, what is more important that the number of lesions or total amount of tumor in a biopsy is: The Gleason score, which contributes significantly to the risk classification of the cancer Is the cancer prostate-confined or not? The cancer can spread either by growing out of the prostate capsule, by growing through the prostate base into neighboring anatomical structures or by sending off metastases, local or distant. The location of the lesions and imaging can give you a not-always-accurate idea as to whether the cancer is prostate-confined. The genomics (genetic nature) of the cancer--basically its aggressiveness and tendency to metastasize. This can be independent of the Gleason score. Based on a biopsy, there are really 3 outcomes: No cancer found (which does not mean it isn't there) Cancer that be monitored by active surveillance Cancer that needs to be treated If you have a 2nd negative biopsy, you should continue to be on your uro's radar to be followed diligently. The chance of missing existing cancer go down very fast with repeat biopsies. Thank you, very informative. I was hoping for a \u0093get outta here, that never happens\u0094 but instinctively knew it had to...to someone, somewhere. Yesterday I hit a zen kind of peace about it and today I\u0092m having a hard time breathing due to the worry. Maybe I instinctively knew it couldn\u0092t possibly be delivered yesterday. I guess that\u0092s my next question for the doc if I get really blessed and the MRI fusion and the second random 12 core comes back clean....what next? I think we\u0092ve just about done every test at this point.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Yes my initial biopsy was totally negative... no sign of cancer. The fusion biopsy two years later showed that 25% of my prostate was grade 4, Gleason 8. How did that happen? Without an MRI and a fusion biopsy, the urologist can only access less than one half of the prostate. In other words, my original urologist - in my opinion, didn't even look. It's like opening the closet door and saying nothing in here but clothes, without bothering to at least look around. By the time I was on my third urologist, I remarked on a graphic he had hanging in his office which showed that the top half of the prostate (the \"base\") is entirely hidden behind the pubic bone. I said \"no wonder my other urologist couldn't find my cancer\" and he said \"yeah, you can never find them up there.\" So how could one's cancer progress from non-existent to very high risk and locally advanced in just two years? By a urologist who was not entirely honest with the patient. He made no attempt whatsoever to INFORM me of the possibility of a false negative biopsy. He only told me that my biopsy was negative and that my prostate was normal. In my mind, performing a biopsy that completely missed a sizable tumor should be grounds for a lawsuit. But of course that would likely be a futile effort and would just make me feel worse. And so because two years were lost, I am basically now an incontinent eunuch with major depressive disorder. I certainly hope you don't end up that way. I always assumed that a doctor would know what he's doing and that he would act only in the patient's best interest. Not so. Thank you for your reply. I\u0092m very sorry this happened to you. I wish I had some magic wand to make it all better for you but can only offer my prayers and artfully dealt sarcastic wit. The pirads 3/4 they identified is in the right peripheral lobe and should have been reachable, I think. My last biopsy showed inflammation and prostatitis and some other benign condition but I don\u0092t have the report to tell me where those samples hit. If they were in the right peripheral the 3/4 that showed up on the MRI might be what was found last time. Hang in there my friend.",

      "Content": "Hi all, Nervously awaiting my biopsy results and a question popped into my head that I don\u0092t think was ever asked. I know plenty of you have had negative original biopsies only to have a later positive biopsy. However, has anyone had the situation where the first biopsy result was totally clear and a later biopsy showed a surprising amount of cancer? My original biopsy was March of last year and was complete clear. I\u0092m wondering what to expect from these fusion results...I would expect that just a year later if there is any cancer at all it should be relatively localized\u0097perhaps in the PIRADS 3/4 area. I would be a little surprised if the 12 core random biopsy samples they took after the fusion came back with significant cancer in degree or quantity. Basically my interpretation of the clean biopsy from last March was that it could only say that My prostate wasn\u0092t completely eaten up with cancer. Just curious if anyone had the surprise lots of cancer on a second biopsy. Am I making any sense what so ever?",

      "Content": "Oh yeah, sorry one more thing..... I believe at some point the androgel stopped working or stopped being effective and my body started its own T production again. I stopped the androgel over 2 weeks ago and I feel better than ever. I'm anxious as can be about this chance of cancer but my sex life is better than it has been in forever (feel real desire again and morning erections). My mind is a little foggier but energy is fine. I have a STRONG belief that I was converting much of the androgel to estrogen. My urologist said on androgel stopping cold turkey, I should see any crash within a few days....but I feel fine. If this turns out to be BPH this might save me a lot of mess and money!",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and terrified (have those words ever been uttered here? ). Trying desperately to keep some perspective, while I wait two more days for my biopsy results. I'm 47 years old and went on Androgel about, I don't know, 10-12 years ago because my T levels were 260 at age 37 or 38. Ummm worked okay I guess--super expensive and a pain to administer/deal with. Life bumped along until two weeks ago when I did some routine bloodwork and received a message from my primary care doc who had been measuring my PSA. It had bounced to 4.1 which exceeded the high end level. He apparently had been asleep at the wheel (I had no idea about PSA velocity or rising PSA), here are my PSA levels by year: 2012: 2.2 2013: 2.6 2014: 2.8 2015: 3.1 2016: 3.5 2017: ? I don't have a copy, I'm SURE we measured it. 2018: 4.1 He should have clued in something was wrong, so I referred to a urologist immediately and stopped the androgel. The doc said androgel probably wouldn't cause the high reading but might just accelerate the trajectory of where my prostate was going anyway. Family history: Dad aged 75 has the prostate of a 25 year old. Half brother, nothing. DRE showed a larger than average prostate (but I'm a big guy, 6'3\" 295) that subsequently measured 46 ML on an ultrasound--large prostate, lots of PSA. The prostate was smooth, no nodules or bumps. On the ultrasound the doc said he saw no signs of odd density or oddities, nothing to worry about from the ultrasound. The doctor measured my free PSA that measured at 10% that gave me >50% chance of cancer until you discounted my age. The doc plugged my numbers into his handy dandy calculator and told me 75% chance it's BPH and 25% and chance it's cancer. He said his threshold to 'wait and see' was 20%, so being the worry wart I am I opted for the biopsy. No anesthesia but he gave me 30 mg of Xanax that kicked in about 30 minutes AFTER the biopsy was over, I hear I enjoyed the bagel my wife bought me on the way home (don't remember it). But I remember every SECOND of that barbaric biopsy. Anyway, that's it. The doctor said he believes it will ultimately be BPH but I'm just scared to death that it's cancer. The doctor said that even if it was cancer, it's 87% chance it's NOT the aggressive kill you type and that he'd get rid of it and the ride to the doctor's office would be riskier than the cancer...with regards to my life. I go Thursday (two days from now) to get the results and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping worrying about this. A wife and a college freshman and high school freshman, I have a lot of people who need me around.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome ISZ! First & Foremost: Relax & Do NOT Panic! While we are not MDs and can not make predictions, I can assure you that all of us share the opinion that You will be around for a long time. Some points to consider: - You are young. Men in their 40's can/do get PCa but it is far more prevalent with men in their 60's. Thus the statistics are in your favor. - You prostate gland is large. The Ultrasound is not as accurate as an MRI in measuring prostate volume. So yours may actually be larger than 46 cc. - You PSA is definitely elevated and rising. However, the rate of rise is NOT meteoric which is good. - 10% Free PSA is concerning but in now way diagnostic of PCa - Your URO MD does not seem suspect PCa so neither should you! Did the URO MD not inject your prostate with lidocaine prior to biopsy? On the long list of Things No Man Has Ever Said is: \"I really relaxed & enjoyed the time between walking into my Urologist's office to have my biopsy and returning a week later for the results!\" Good luck and best wishes for walking out of the office next visit with all good results! Be sure to get a copy of the Path Report for your records. Keep us updated. MF Thanks for the reassurance. Consensus seems to be I\u0092m okay so I\u0092m holding you all to that! 😀 He did inject it with lidocain and once he did, it was fine. In fact I told him to take extra samples if he wanted because I wanted to be sure. I felt one minor twinge on one of the samples. The problem was getting the thing in there. Not sure how others are but this thing was shaped like a longer, large Nintendo Wii controller. I first thought \u0093awesome, while waiting for the Xanax to kick in we\u0092re going to play Wii golf\u0094. No were gonna play hide this giant brick sized ultrasound and knife attack machine in there. It was a bit of a struggle because there\u0092s just no way to relax during THAT! But I got through it and then stumbled around like a cast member of the walking dead at the bagel shop. I don\u0092t remember a thing about that experience but am in intensive therapy trying to forget the biopsy. 😀 I think I\u0092m going to fire my primary care doc and write him a letter informing him why and what he should be doing for other patients on TRT. And technically for men not on TRT, if their velocity increases like mine. .5 is apparently a pretty reliabile indicator of high probability of cancer. The good news is that unless I crash, I plan to be off the TRT. Hated being dependent on that stuff and hoping that each insurer plan covers it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome ISZ! First & Foremost: Relax & Do NOT Panic! While we are not MDs and can not make predictions, I can assure you that all of us share the opinion that You will be around for a long time. Some points to consider: - You are young. Men in their 40's can/do get PCa but it is far more prevalent with men in their 60's. Thus the statistics are in your favor. - You prostate gland is large. The Ultrasound is not as accurate as an MRI in measuring prostate volume. So yours may actually be larger than 46 cc. - You PSA is definitely elevated and rising. However, the rate of rise is NOT meteoric which is good. - 10% Free PSA is concerning but in now way diagnostic of PCa - Your URO MD does not seem suspect PCa so neither should you! Did the URO MD not inject your prostate with lidocaine prior to biopsy? On the long list of Things No Man Has Ever Said is: \"I really relaxed & enjoyed the time between walking into my Urologist's office to have my biopsy and returning a week later for the results!\" Good luck and best wishes for walking out of the office next visit with all good results! Be sure to get a copy of the Path Report for your records. Keep us updated. MF Thanks for the reassurance. Consensus seems to be I\u0092m okay so I\u0092m holding you all to that! 😀 He did inject it with lidocain and once he did, it was fine. In fact I told him to take extra samples if he wanted because I wanted to be sure. I felt one minor twinge on one of the samples. The problem was getting the thing in there. Not sure how others are but this thing was shaped like a longer, large Nintendo Wii controller. I first thought \u0093awesome, while waiting for the Xanax to kick in we\u0092re going to play Wii golf\u0094. No were gonna play hide this giant brick sized ultrasound and knife attack machine in there. It was a bit of a struggle because there\u0092s just no way to relax during THAT! But I got through it and then stumbled around like a cast member of the walking dead at the bagel shop. I don\u0092t remember a thing about that experience but am in intensive therapy trying to forget the biopsy. 😀 I think I\u0092m going to fire my primary care doc and write him a letter informing him why and what he should be doing for other patients on TRT. And technically for men not on TRT, if their velocity increases like mine. .5 is apparently a pretty reliabile indicator of high probability of cancer. The good news is that unless I crash, I plan to be off the TRT. Hated being dependent on that stuff and hoping that each insurer plan covers it.",

I stopped the androgel over 2 weeks ago and I feel better than ever. I'm anxious as can be about this chance of cancer but my sex life is better than it has been in forever (feel real desire again and morning erections). My mind is a little foggier but energy is fine. I have a STRONG belief that I was converting much of the androgel to estrogen. My urologist said on androgel stopping cold turkey, I should see any crash within a few days....but I feel fine.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic The best medicine now is to relax!! If it's cancer you will deal with it and be done. If it's not, your doc will look elsewhere for any symptoms you're having. It's possible that there are repeat biopsies in your future. Imaging, especially newer PET scans, are improving and are starting to be used for diagnosis. After my I-don't-remember-which-number negative biopsy, my doc said \"We are not going to let you die of high-grade cancer.\"Turns out we subsequently did find very high-grade cancer. The good news is that he's kept his promise so far: I'm alive and typing. Glad to hear it....glad you made it brother. That\u0092s the funny thing up until I got that Ill fated email from my pcp this time last year I never had the first symptom of any significance. So there\u0092s not much to treat. I do have some Ed but I think that\u0092s because they stopped the testosterone replacement and might be BPH related to some extent. But even that\u0092s manageable. Remember that 80\u0092s shirt Frankie says relax, well I used to say Frankie needs his butt whipped. Relaxing is not my thing...certainly not right now. But I\u0092ll try to as best I can.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and terrified (have those words ever been uttered here? ). Trying desperately to keep some perspective, while I wait two more days for my biopsy results. I'm 47 years old and went on Androgel about, I don't know, 10-12 years ago because my T levels were 260 at age 37 or 38. Ummm worked okay I guess--super expensive and a pain to administer/deal with. Life bumped along until two weeks ago when I did some routine bloodwork and received a message from my primary care doc who had been measuring my PSA. It had bounced to 4.1 which exceeded the high end level. He apparently had been asleep at the wheel (I had no idea about PSA velocity or rising PSA), here are my PSA levels by year: 2012: 2.2 2013: 2.6 2014: 2.8 2015: 3.1 2016: 3.5 2017: ? I don't have a copy, I'm SURE we measured it. 2018: 4.1 He should have clued in something was wrong, so I referred to a urologist immediately and stopped the androgel. The doc said androgel probably wouldn't cause the high reading but might just accelerate the trajectory of where my prostate was going anyway. Family history: Dad aged 75 has the prostate of a 25 year old. Half brother, nothing. DRE showed a larger than average prostate (but I'm a big guy, 6'3\" 295) that subsequently measured 46 ML on an ultrasound--large prostate, lots of PSA. The prostate was smooth, no nodules or bumps. On the ultrasound the doc said he saw no signs of odd density or oddities, nothing to worry about from the ultrasound. The doctor measured my free PSA that measured at 10% that gave me >50% chance of cancer until you discounted my age. The doc plugged my numbers into his handy dandy calculator and told me 75% chance it's BPH and 25% and chance it's cancer. He said his threshold to 'wait and see' was 20%, so being the worry wart I am I opted for the biopsy. No anesthesia but he gave me 30 mg of Xanax that kicked in about 30 minutes AFTER the biopsy was over, I hear I enjoyed the bagel my wife bought me on the way home (don't remember it). But I remember every SECOND of that barbaric biopsy. Anyway, that's it. The doctor said he believes it will ultimately be BPH but I'm just scared to death that it's cancer. The doctor said that even if it was cancer, it's 87% chance it's NOT the aggressive kill you type and that he'd get rid of it and the ride to the doctor's office would be riskier than the cancer...with regards to my life. I go Thursday (two days from now) to get the results and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping worrying about this. A wife and a college freshman and high school freshman, I have a lot of people who need me around.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here and terrified (have those words ever been uttered here? ). Trying desperately to keep some perspective, while I wait two more days for my biopsy results. I'm 47 years old and went on Androgel about, I don't know, 10-12 years ago because my T levels were 260 at age 37 or 38. Ummm worked okay I guess--super expensive and a pain to administer/deal with. Life bumped along until two weeks ago when I did some routine bloodwork and received a message from my primary care doc who had been measuring my PSA. It had bounced to 4.1 which exceeded the high end level. He apparently had been asleep at the wheel (I had no idea about PSA velocity or rising PSA), here are my PSA levels by year: 2012: 2.2 2013: 2.6 2014: 2.8 2015: 3.1 2016: 3.5 2017: ? I don't have a copy, I'm SURE we measured it. 2018: 4.1 He should have clued in something was wrong, so I referred to a urologist immediately and stopped the androgel. The doc said androgel probably wouldn't cause the high reading but might just accelerate the trajectory of where my prostate was going anyway. Family history: Dad aged 75 has the prostate of a 25 year old. Half brother, nothing. DRE showed a larger than average prostate (but I'm a big guy, 6'3\" 295) that subsequently measured 46 ML on an ultrasound--large prostate, lots of PSA. The prostate was smooth, no nodules or bumps. On the ultrasound the doc said he saw no signs of odd density or oddities, nothing to worry about from the ultrasound. The doctor measured my free PSA that measured at 10% that gave me >50% chance of cancer until you discounted my age. The doc plugged my numbers into his handy dandy calculator and told me 75% chance it's BPH and 25% and chance it's cancer. He said his threshold to 'wait and see' was 20%, so being the worry wart I am I opted for the biopsy. No anesthesia but he gave me 30 mg of Xanax that kicked in about 30 minutes AFTER the biopsy was over, I hear I enjoyed the bagel my wife bought me on the way home (don't remember it). But I remember every SECOND of that barbaric biopsy. Anyway, that's it. The doctor said he believes it will ultimately be BPH but I'm just scared to death that it's cancer. The doctor said that even if it was cancer, it's 87% chance it's NOT the aggressive kill you type and that he'd get rid of it and the ride to the doctor's office would be riskier than the cancer...with regards to my life. I go Thursday (two days from now) to get the results and I'm having trouble eating and sleeping worrying about this. A wife and a college freshman and high school freshman, I have a lot of people who need me around.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Welcome aboard to BOTH of you. Ice, I believe your uro is probably correct that this is NOT a case of prostate cancer, but the result of a steadily growing prostate. Prostate tissue creates PSA and, of course, larger prostates produce more PSA. Normal PSA readings for the 40s age group is 0 - 2.5. You're approaching the age group of the 50s, for which the range is 0 - 3.5. So you're not horribly far from the high norm. In addition, your PSA elevation has been a slow, steady increase over the past few years, which kind of dovetails with your BPH. You'll probably be just fine -- but will be in a situation where I was at in that an enlarged prostate/higher PSA could someday be masking a tumor, which would probably be reflected by a rapid spike in the PSA reading. This means that you'll want to have regular PSA tests from now on to keep an eye on things. Good luck! Chuck Thanks Chuck, very helpful. You may be completely and totally wrong and I might have a raging case of PC, but your response will help me get through this nightmare. I alternate from \u0093I feel absolutely fine and have next to no symptoms\u0094 to \u0093I can\u0092t breathe I\u0092m so scared\u0094. Little area in between.",

He should have never been allowed on stage to give a TED Talk related to being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He is on AS! He has not been affected by Prostate Cancer except for his self proclaimed grossly inappropriate psychological impacts of a disease status that is most likely 100% harmless to him. He received a gift diagnosis not a death sentence! He has not experienced any of the following either individually or in combination: Radiation Therapy, Radical Prostatectomy Surgery, Hormone Therapy; Radical Prostatectomy Surgery followed by Radiation Therapy, Any of these combined with Hormone Therapy, incontinence, erectile dysfunction, loss of masculinity during treatment and obviously not death by prostate cancer. No, he experienced no pain or suffering. He has never had to battle the disease. Rather he used his \"misfortune\" to snag a new girlfriend and ride off to a new start in his blue convertible. Get out the puke bags buddy!!! Instead Mr McCarthy stands in the spotlight and insipidly spews out a theme stolen from the great Al Greene: Love and Happiness. What a misguided total fool! What an insult to the members of this forum who have been truly impacted by prostate cancer. Sorry Mr SubDenis but you should remove the link to Mr McCarthy's shameful self-aggrandizing charade.

I took fluoxetine 20mg for several weeks and the issue wasn't that the drug didn't have any effects. It increased my clumsiness, caused strange headaches, and most importantly destabilized me. I flipped from seeing pink elephants to miserable or irritable with disorganization and crappy ideas in very short time. Did more harm than good. Possible there are now better medications on the market, but they should be chosen with care and I'm not too confident, judging from experience, that the public health system will provide this service should I need it post-OP. Honestly, all of this is just such a nightmare. KarlEmagne, yes it is a nightmare. Thanks for the positive thoughts. I told my wife that it\u0092s like some really well directed movies where you learn and associate with the main character and you feel trapped right along with them in their circumstances. Training Day is one instance, I felt completely trapped with Ethan Hawke\u0092d character. The only difference is we don\u0092t get to turn the channel or pick a romantic comedy! 😀 Hang in there brother. Definitely try out a new antidepressant for the short term. There are several that are new and good. I took generic Prozac and really didn\u0092t want to stop except it caused a little weight gain. Made me crave carbs..all the carbs. But it gave me the most elaborate and beautiful dreams that seemed to go on forever like a long movie. After my mom died I had a long conversation with her in heaven...she was healthy and could breathe again and that was a gift. Good luck buddy, there are people who have so many uncurable cancers...were the lucky ones if you can call it luck. Most of us have a positive future, just a semi rough road to hoe to get to it.",

      "Content": "I have a 3t MRI on Monday and am a little concerned about it. I\u0092ve had two MRI\u0092s before on my shoulders. The first (after injecting the contrast) they put this scaled down hula hoop over my head to check for fit. I had about 3\u0094 of shoulders on each side outside. So it was either reschedule to the larger opening machine or make sausage out of me. They strapped the shoulder being MRI\u0092d down and used a towel to wrap my free arm like a straight jacket. I was still scraping the sides of the machine so they had to move me in a few inches and let me wiggle and then they moved me some more. It was harrowing. The second was a wider machine and I did a little better but I could still look down and see a little daylight. I\u0092m scheduled for the larger machine but am a little concerned about being stuck that far in the machine. Does your head go in first and if so, do you end up with your head outside the other side? Or are you truly coffin\u0092d in there?",

If you\u0092re prone to it maybe join a local cancer support group as sometimes talking through things will help. There are a lot of new SSRI\u0092s and non-SSRI drugs that are new and great. Just be patient and know it may take a few trials before you find yours. The best help I had was from a local church who offers ministry services with licensed psychologists. The one I saw helped me immensely. And it was free. I liked the fact that he focused on causation vs just issuing drugs. That\u0092s all I have to help other than my prayers. I\u0092m 48 and really sweating this fusion biopsy result that should be in mid-week. I might be right behind you. Prayers out for you my friend.",

      "Content": "Hey my friend, I haven\u0092t had an RP (yet, but it seems inevitable). But I\u0092ve had some depressive episodes due to stress overload at times. If you\u0092re prone to it maybe join a local cancer support group as sometimes talking through things will help. There are a lot of new SSRI\u0092s and non-SSRI drugs that are new and great. Just be patient and know it may take a few trials before you find yours. The best help I had was from a local church who offers ministry services with licensed psychologists. The one I saw helped me immensely. And it was free. I liked the fact that he focused on causation vs just issuing drugs. That\u0092s all I have to help other than my prayers. I\u0092m 48 and really sweating this fusion biopsy result that should be in mid-week. I might be right behind you. Prayers out for you my friend.",

      "Content": "I have a 3t MRI on Monday and am a little concerned about it. I\u0092ve had two MRI\u0092s before on my shoulders. The first (after injecting the contrast) they put this scaled down hula hoop over my head to check for fit. I had about 3\u0094 of shoulders on each side outside. So it was either reschedule to the larger opening machine or make sausage out of me. They strapped the shoulder being MRI\u0092d down and used a towel to wrap my free arm like a straight jacket. I was still scraping the sides of the machine so they had to move me in a few inches and let me wiggle and then they moved me some more. It was harrowing. The second was a wider machine and I did a little better but I could still look down and see a little daylight. I\u0092m scheduled for the larger machine but am a little concerned about being stuck that far in the machine. Does your head go in first and if so, do you end up with your head outside the other side? Or are you truly coffin\u0092d in there?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by OldTiredSailor I can certainly understand and identify with your concern. I've had many, dozens ?, of MRIs over the years due to bad back, knees, shoulder, neck. During the first ?? (many over the years) I never had a claustrophobia problem. I'd spent years crawling around very tight pipes, tunnels, and engine rooms with no thought of a problem. Then suddenly, about 2003, I became extremely claustrophobic during an MRI for my back. (I was 30-minutes into the MRI, which was an old style narrow tube with a closed end where your head ended up for a back image. I was listening to classical music and was half asleep when the technician says \"Boy am I glad you are not claustrophobic - it is a real nuisance when people freak out in there.\" I quickly lost it! My heart accelerated, my breathing almost stopped and I started sweating like crazy. As I recall I made it thru that one but the next several MRIs were downright frightening.) Since that time MRIs, CT scans, and radionuclide cardiac stress tests (the sensor presses on your chest) have been a real issue for me and cause me a lot of stress leading up to the event. My 3T mpMRI (June this year) for the prostate was in a newer Siemens machine and it was a whole lot LESS problematic (scary!) than the older enclosed machines. The tunnel is wide open at both ends and is at least 50% wider than the older style. They put me in feet first so that my shoulders and head were outside the tube. Additionally, and most important for my mental state, I had to keep my arms above my head while lying there. My claustrophia is worst when I feel like my arms and hands are pinned in such a fashion I cannot help myself ESCAPE. The machine used for my 3T mpMRI did not cause that irrational sensation. AND, my GP has given me an Rx for Adivan 0.5mg (Lorazepam), which is a very mild anti-anxiety medication. I take one 90-minutes before they put me in the tube and I feel almost NO concerns and can even fall asleep if the technician does not talk to me. I also feel no effect from the Adivan, it does not seem to make my thinking slow or cloudy and does not seem to impair my judgement, or at least my wife says she cannot tell when I take it. They snatched victory from the jaws of defeat! 😀",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Be careful. You are both young to be presenting with PC. If you were both on testosterone supplements it may be viewed suspiciously as the source of your PC presenting early. I have heard it's influence can be for early, small, and aggressive cancers. Nobody knows what is normal for testosterone. Everyone wants what testosterone provides; energy, vitality, libido, limber, erections, muscle mass, etc. Who wouldn't, but at what price? Professional advice from Mayo is to not use testosterone supplements to counter normal aging. There have been studies that confuse this issue. What we do know. One proven treatment for advanced prostate cancer is to effectively use drug therapy to reduce testosterone to very low levels and force/stun prostate cancer into remission. The implication in this proven treatment is PC responds to testosterone. It can respond and adjust to manipualtion of testosterone and become resistant to it or continue to thrive at varying levels. It's a wild card. It's use now may affect use later when you may really need it. My advice, unless you have a life threatening issue addressed by testosterone supplementation it is safer to avoid it unless neccesary to combat PC. I am no expert in this, but when I hear talk of experimenting with it in the presence of PC the hair on my neck goes up. Especially, when it's use may have been the source of it presenting as it has. Nobody can claim you are clear of cancer, now or after RP. The commercialized pressure through advertising to influence patients to ask doctors for certain drug therapies seems to cause some doctors to throw up their hands and let you have your way. Sort of an eyes wide open, except you really don't know. You just want to be young again. The symptoms of testosterone use are many. I\u0092m curious would you lump the use of clomid which fools my brain into making testosterone of it\u0092s own in the same vein? We\u0092ve adjusted me to like a 500-550 range not bodybuilder level just so that I can have some energy, stamina and libido. I get what you are saying but are all the guys on this board taking the medication that stops their own testosterone production? Boy talk about the walking dead. I get not throwing on the external sources testosterone if you have cancer but naturally producing it via clomid is not the same as what you\u0092re talking right?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Be careful. You are both young to be presenting with PC. If you were both on testosterone supplements it may be viewed suspiciously as the source of your PC presenting early. I have heard it's influence can be for early, small, and aggressive cancers. Nobody knows what is normal for testosterone. Everyone wants what testosterone provides; energy, vitality, libido, limber, erections, muscle mass, etc. Who wouldn't, but at what price? Professional advice from Mayo is to not use testosterone supplements to counter normal aging. There have been studies that confuse this issue. What we do know. One proven treatment for advanced prostate cancer is to effectively use drug therapy to reduce testosterone to very low levels and force/stun prostate cancer into remission. The implication in this proven treatment is PC responds to testosterone. It can respond and adjust to manipualtion of testosterone and become resistant to it or continue to thrive at varying levels. It's a wild card. It's use now may affect use later when you may really need it. My advice, unless you have a life threatening issue addressed by testosterone supplementation it is safer to avoid it unless neccesary to combat PC. I am no expert in this, but when I hear talk of experimenting with it in the presence of PC the hair on my neck goes up. Especially, when it's use may have been the source of it presenting as it has. Nobody can claim you are clear of cancer, now or after RP. The commercialized pressure through advertising to influence patients to ask doctors for certain drug therapies seems to cause some doctors to throw up their hands and let you have your way. Sort of an eyes wide open, except you really don't know. You just want to be young again. The symptoms of testosterone use are many. I\u0092m curious would you lump the use of clomid which fools my brain into making testosterone of it\u0092s own in the same vein? We\u0092ve adjusted me to like a 500-550 range not bodybuilder level just so that I can have some energy, stamina and libido. I get what you are saying but are all the guys on this board taking the medication that stops their own testosterone production? Boy talk about the walking dead. I get not throwing on the external sources testosterone if you have cancer but naturally producing it via clomid is not the same as what you\u0092re talking right?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic A recent study hypothesizes a PCa-protective effect for BPH and a mechanism for it. I believe the incidence of PCa in men with BPH is lower that in men without it. You could make the case that without my 20+ years of BPH, I would have wound up with cancer earlier than I did, as opposed to BPH being a contributing factor. Interesting, when I think I have it all figured out...I learn more. It seems I\u0092ve read it both ways. Something I read seemed to indicate BPH being a contributing factor for PCA. But I like your explanation better.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Very true: as in my case, BPH with a continuously but slowly rising PSA rise will likely mean repeat biopsies are in your future. And the path report at surgery can find both down- and up-grading of the Gleason score assigned at biopsy (which is why G6 men need to be cautious and adhere to their AS protocols if they are candidates). On the other hand for the rest of us guys, treatment means treatment, and we have to play the pathological cards we are dealt. Yeah it\u0092s definitely frustrating. If I were older..maybe late 60\u0092s or even in my 70\u0092s I might just have it yanked out at the first sign\u0097given the inability to be sure how bad and where the cancer really is. I figure by that time my wife won\u0092t want to fool around with my old wrinkly self so she wouldn\u0092t miss it so much. But I\u0092m 48. To lose sex at this age would be devastating to both of us. Yeah I expect I\u0092ll be doing biopsies every year or two going forward. I might also need a urolift procedure to alleviate any urinary symptoms. I\u0092m not really having any now...until the blood clot suddenly clogs the pipe momentarily. Thankfully it was only for a second before I had the chance to point it at myself to see what was what. 😀",

      "Content": "I have a coworker...staff member actually. We talked about prostate issues previously and he said he had issues and was taking flowmax. So I figured he was in good care. He told me two days ago that his GP had told him his prostate had grown since the last exam. He apparently wasn\u0092t regularly seeing the urologist. I asked what the GP said or did, he doubled his flowmax. What the heck? The GP has watched his PSA in the high 3\u0092s for years and said nothing. So I asked him what his urologist said at the last visit and he said \u0093he told me you don\u0092t have prostate cancer, don\u0092t worry\u0094. So he stopped going. That might not sound that terribly bad until you realize the poor guy is 42 or 43 years old. African American. His PSA has been in the upper 3\u0092s for years. It was 3.7 at last year\u0092s check. Oh yeah and no family history unless you count both his dad and his uncle on his father\u0092s side who had prostate cancer. Oh and the urologist proclaimed he didn\u0092t have cancer without doing free PSA, pca3, 4K, an MRI or a BIOPSY. For the love of all that\u0092s good and holy...he\u0092s been failed by both doctors in a very bad way. How can that urologist even make that comment with no factual testing basis? I sat him down and explained the things I could and gave him a roadmap of what I\u0092ve done and been through. I tried to impart the gravity of what he could be facing without terrifying him, but he\u0092s motivated now. I gave him my doctor\u0092s name but warned him about the office staff. He needs some immediate help and a biopsy. What is wrong with these doctors?",

Because there is no cancer, BPH,and the needles missing the lesions when there is. That is what ISO PSA test is supposed to due - eliminate unneeded biopsies. Yes to clarify I didn\u0092t tell him that he had pca just that his PSA was way too high...should be 2.0 or lower.

IMO, 5 weeks may not be sufficient time to allow a very angry prostate gland to become quiescent. Great question for your URO MD to answer!

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic See the above study regarding skim -- nothing but skim in our house, and only for cereal and as an ingredient in some recipes. While humans are definitely omnivores (and therefore meat-eaters), evolution will only get you to the age of reproduction and child care, after that, all bets are off, as is the case for otherwise healthy foods that (later) contribute to cancer risk. On the flip side, when my sister, then a vegetarian, was pregnant with her first child, her OB was not happy and wanted her to add meat back to her diet. Well, I don\u0092t have a definitive diagnosis yet...may be as early as Wednesday or if I get lucky and this fusion biopsy is clean, until my next biopsy. Based on all I\u0092ve learned here, it seems like a matter of time. I\u0092m 48 so I think the chances that I end up with BPH for 30-40 years without it turning to cancer is zippo. Anyway, I\u0092m the same size as my dad was at the same age and have exactly the same diet. In fact, I would say I eat healthier than he ever did and exercise whereas he didn\u0092t. He has the prostate of a 21 year old and PSA in the 1\u0092s at 75. My half brother has brain cancer but no prostate problems. I\u0092m unaware of anyone in the family who had prostate issues of any kind. No one. So somewhere this has to be plain old dna recessive genes or something. I just don\u0092t get it.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wbigs Thanks for the responses. I think one of the underlying reasons that my doc is looking at treatment sooner than later is my family history of prostate cancer. My dad and all three of his brothers have had their prostates removed along with his mom and sister having breast cancer. I believe I have a significant target on my back. IÂ\u0092ll have a more in depth conversation with my doc after my next psa. I have been trying to get ahead on the kegel exercises when I remember. I need to come up with something to remind me to do them at certain times of the day. That makes sense. Sorry to hear but I\u0092ve said it several times that my real personal risk is under treating pca based on finding only a G6 when there could be G7-G9 hidden in there. I would have a real time accepting the fact that I was too conservative with AS for too long and let something get out of control. At our age the odds\u0097with cancer already found\u0097of dying with our prostate on board are low. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Whats up fellas and ladies? Well I\u0092m back. Don\u0092t worry those who might remember me and think \u0093oh no, he\u0092s back and probably has cancer\u0094. Well that\u0092d be a good guess and who knows whether you\u0092re right and whether you\u0092re wrong? 😀 Well initially I started this journey with a 4.1 PSA and 10% free PSA and then had a 12 core biopsy that came back all negative. That was six months ago. Had my six month follow up today and my PSA sadly hit 4.4 so that\u0092s a .3 rise in only six months....extrapolated that\u0092s .6 in a year. DRE was fine, no problems. So the doctor ordered the pca3 test. If it comes back positive that\u0092s a pretty good indication that I have some cancer that was missed by the biopsy. If so, there\u0092s some MRI combined with some sort of ultrasound that will help them find the cancer and eliminate it and around and around we go. So I don\u0092t know much more but after stopping TRT I hoped the PSA would fall and I could quit wondering. Too long didn\u0092t read? I don\u0092t know squat...still.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Ice, looks like your PSA is rising, but you probably need a few more to be sure it is up, up, up. At 4.+ it's terribly high, but when it hits ten, there's no doubt you got something going on in there. Mine kept going up, but my biopsy was negative and all my DRE's were normal. I wasn't able to get the MRI guided fusion biopsy until I changed Uro's. It was quite a struggle. As much as I hope that you do not have cancer, a negative biopsy is not proof of that... unfortunately. God bless you my man. Looking at your history in your signature is exhausting mentally but you\u0092re still kicking butt! I came to the assessment that all we\u0092ve proven is that my prostate isn\u0092t eaten up with it, not that it\u0092s cancer free. From the sounds of it if this test comes back positive, we go searching for the source of the cancer and eradicate it. I\u0092m pretty calm about it compared to waiting for the original biopsy. It sounds like worse case, I\u0092m in for a long exhausting journey like many here but will die of something else. Probably at the hands of my wife like she\u0092s planned for the past 26 years. It seems a shame to rob her of that ! 😀",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by wbigs Thanks for the responses. I think one of the underlying reasons that my doc is looking at treatment sooner than later is my family history of prostate cancer. My dad and all three of his brothers have had their prostates removed along with his mom and sister having breast cancer. I believe I have a significant target on my back. IÂ\u0092ll have a more in depth conversation with my doc after my next psa. I have been trying to get ahead on the kegel exercises when I remember. I need to come up with something to remind me to do them at certain times of the day. That makes sense. Sorry to hear but I\u0092ve said it several times that my real personal risk is under treating pca based on finding only a G6 when there could be G7-G9 hidden in there. I would have a real time accepting the fact that I was too conservative with AS for too long and let something get out of control. At our age the odds\u0097with cancer already found\u0097of dying with our prostate on board are low. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic There is staging before RP, but I assume you doc would have to communicate this to Epstein. (Epstein is very good, but even he can't do a DRE remotely.) I'm not sure how this particular form works, but they may not bother with staging for biopsy reviews. Staging in the diagnosis phase is recorded as a \"cT...\" for clinical. Staging after RP begins with a \"pT...\" for pathologic. Clinical staging is obviously only a best estimate based on the PE and diagnostic tests/imaging. (Yes, I was confused at first, but then saw the locations of the G6 and the atypical glands.) BTW, the apex is a good location to have a single G6 core -- it's down at the tip of the prostate, away from the prostate base, which is up and closer to important anatomical structures. Since you have little to worry about, you can update your signature That is a bright spot. I was wondering if the apex wasn\u0092t bad because there\u0092s less area before any cancer made it outside the capsule. But maybe I\u0092m wrong, hopefully I\u0092m wrong. Right in the middle of the great big part away from edges and anything else important sounds pretty good.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee Ice, looks like your PSA is rising, but you probably need a few more to be sure it is up, up, up. At 4.+ it's terribly high, but when it hits ten, there's no doubt you got something going on in there. Mine kept going up, but my biopsy was negative and all my DRE's were normal. I wasn't able to get the MRI guided fusion biopsy until I changed Uro's. It was quite a struggle. As much as I hope that you do not have cancer, a negative biopsy is not proof of that... unfortunately. God bless you my man. Looking at your history in your signature is exhausting mentally but you\u0092re still kicking butt! I came to the assessment that all we\u0092ve proven is that my prostate isn\u0092t eaten up with it, not that it\u0092s cancer free. From the sounds of it if this test comes back positive, we go searching for the source of the cancer and eradicate it. I\u0092m pretty calm about it compared to waiting for the original biopsy. It sounds like worse case, I\u0092m in for a long exhausting journey like many here but will die of something else. Probably at the hands of my wife like she\u0092s planned for the past 26 years. It seems a shame to rob her of that ! 😀",

Well that\u0092d be a good guess and who knows whether you\u0092re right and whether you\u0092re wrong? 😀 Well initially I started this journey with a 4.1 PSA and 10% free PSA and then had a 12 core biopsy that came back all negative. That was six months ago. Had my six month follow up today and my PSA sadly hit 4.4 so that\u0092s a .3 rise in only six months....extrapolated that\u0092s .6 in a year. DRE was fine, no problems. So the doctor ordered the pca3 test. If it comes back positive that\u0092s a pretty good indication that I have some cancer that was missed by the biopsy. If so, there\u0092s some MRI combined with some sort of ultrasound that will help them find the cancer and eliminate it and around and around we go. So I don\u0092t know much more but after stopping TRT I hoped the PSA would fall and I could quit wondering. Too long didn\u0092t read? I don\u0092t know squat...still.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic There is staging before RP, but I assume you doc would have to communicate this to Epstein. (Epstein is very good, but even he can't do a DRE remotely.) I'm not sure how this particular form works, but they may not bother with staging for biopsy reviews. Staging in the diagnosis phase is recorded as a \"cT...\" for clinical. Staging after RP begins with a \"pT...\" for pathologic. Clinical staging is obviously only a best estimate based on the PE and diagnostic tests/imaging. (Yes, I was confused at first, but then saw the locations of the G6 and the atypical glands.) BTW, the apex is a good location to have a single G6 core -- it's down at the tip of the prostate, away from the prostate base, which is up and closer to important anatomical structures. Since you have little to worry about, you can update your signature That is a bright spot. I was wondering if the apex wasn\u0092t bad because there\u0092s less area before any cancer made it outside the capsule. But maybe I\u0092m wrong, hopefully I\u0092m wrong. Right in the middle of the great big part away from edges and anything else important sounds pretty good.",

      "Sample": "And the fact that Dr Porter himself had prostate cancer and robotic surgery also played into our decision. My comments were kind of meant to be comical not critical....My husband is approaching 74 and is a survivor of a very aggressive form of leukemia, including a bone marrow transplant 5 years ago. When his PSA started fluctuating, the doctor quickly said that he would not be a candidate for surgery, primarily due to his age....With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems. That was over 7 years ago and my PSA remains zero and my urination remains at firehose levels....Thats a lot of possible future growth. If cancer ever develops I would probablygiven my prostate is already 46ml+opt to try the removal with surgery....When his PSA started fluctuating, the doctor quickly said that he would not be a candidate for surgery, primarily due to his age. I will report back as to what the urologist says....My Uro says it's still possible I'll be looking at radiotherapy after I've had a chance to heal from my RALP, due to the high risk, aggressive nature of my cancer, and my poor risk factors, but all things considered, we're cautiously positive. Sure could've been a lot worse news....The doctor was VERY gentle and nice and explained that I had 3 positive cores of Gleason 6 and that I would live out my full lifespan if I had surgery. With a prostate of almost 100 gms, and the BPH urination problems that went with it, I ended up having the surgery to cure both the cancer and the urination problems....I remember that because I was wondering if my current job would hold out that long should I need surgery. The other thing he mentioned that didnt give me great comfort is that they really didnt have AS stats regarding success past 10 years....Because of the hard sell feeling from Dr Ellis et al it reinforced my decision going with Dr Porter. And the fact that Dr Porter himself had prostate cancer and robotic surgery also played into our decision....He says \"Well, it's good news: your uPSA is 0.01\" Phew... So, due to a number poor-risk factors, I'm now in the \"uPSA every 6 weeks, with follow-up\" until 6 months post op. My Uro says it's still possible I'll be looking at radiotherapy after I've had a chance to heal from my RALP, due to the high risk, aggressive nature of my cancer, and my poor risk factors, but all things considered, we're cautiously positive....If cancer ever develops I would probablygiven my prostate is already 46ml+opt to try the removal with surgery. At least then I could guarantee no future spreading (or relatively guarantee it) and go back on hrt without worry....He didnt seem to think I could get that far down the road, he kept stating 2-3 years was his expectations. I remember that because I was wondering if my current job would hold out that long should I need surgery....",
