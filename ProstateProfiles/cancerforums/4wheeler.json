      "Content": "Well here is my story so far- had the nerve-sparing robotic Da Vinci surgery back in 2010 after the Doc found a small lump on the prostate. Gleason 9 pre-surgery with a psa of 6.0 and upgraded to Gleason 10 post-surgery. Had 39 EBRT treatments 6 weeks later and psa dropped to 0.30. Also had a 6 month shot of Eligard and worked for a while and then of course psa gradually rose and then was switched to Lupron shots every 6 months until the psa rose to 3.5 and then doubled in one month. Could still perform with the help of Cialis but that is gone now and have metastasis to the spine in a couple of places.At that time was put on Zytiga and that has worked for 7 months and now psa is rising again. Also have been taking Xgeva for strengthening the bones and now am waiting on approval for Xtandi. The fear of my mortality bothers me but must persevere and go through the hoops of treatment, so to speak. Searched through some of your stories and was wondering if anyone has tried some of the new so-called specific targeted chemotherapies that are starting to come out of trials!",

I will definitely keep posting as I learn more- I will be seeing the doc on Jan. 29th and will hopefully become more educated. Pretty sure I will start the Xtandi that week. I think the Xgeva has helped with bone pain and will talk to the doc about spot radiation if pain increases again. Might have to find better hobbies than extreme 4 wheeling also lol! Last August the bone scans and ct scans showed entire cancer involvement of T 11 and partial involvement of T 10 and T 6 and minimum involvement in the lower sacrum in the pelvic area. Take care and will keep listening and posting!!",

      "Content": "Well here is my story so far- had the nerve-sparing robotic Da Vinci surgery back in 2010 after the Doc found a small lump on the prostate. Gleason 9 pre-surgery with a psa of 6.0 and upgraded to Gleason 10 post-surgery. Had 39 EBRT treatments 6 weeks later and psa dropped to 0.30. Also had a 6 month shot of Eligard and worked for a while and then of course psa gradually rose and then was switched to Lupron shots every 6 months until the psa rose to 3.5 and then doubled in one month. Could still perform with the help of Cialis but that is gone now and have metastasis to the spine in a couple of places.At that time was put on Zytiga and that has worked for 7 months and now psa is rising again. Also have been taking Xgeva for strengthening the bones and now am waiting on approval for Xtandi. The fear of my mortality bothers me but must persevere and go through the hoops of treatment, so to speak. Searched through some of your stories and was wondering if anyone has tried some of the new so-called specific targeted chemotherapies that are starting to come out of trials!",

      "Content": "Well here is my story so far- had the nerve-sparing robotic Da Vinci surgery back in 2010 after the Doc found a small lump on the prostate. Gleason 9 pre-surgery with a psa of 6.0 and upgraded to Gleason 10 post-surgery. Had 39 EBRT treatments 6 weeks later and psa dropped to 0.30. Also had a 6 month shot of Eligard and worked for a while and then of course psa gradually rose and then was switched to Lupron shots every 6 months until the psa rose to 3.5 and then doubled in one month. Could still perform with the help of Cialis but that is gone now and have metastasis to the spine in a couple of places.At that time was put on Zytiga and that has worked for 7 months and now psa is rising again. Also have been taking Xgeva for strengthening the bones and now am waiting on approval for Xtandi. The fear of my mortality bothers me but must persevere and go through the hoops of treatment, so to speak.

      "Content": "Hi George- thanks for your post and hope things are going well for you. I will definitely keep posting as I learn more- I will be seeing the doc on Jan. 29th and will hopefully become more educated. Pretty sure I will start the Xtandi that week. I think the Xgeva has helped with bone pain and will talk to the doc about spot radiation if pain increases again. Might have to find better hobbies than extreme 4 wheeling also lol! Last August the bone scans and ct scans showed entire cancer involvement of T 11 and partial involvement of T 10 and T 6 and minimum involvement in the lower sacrum in the pelvic area. Take care and will keep listening and posting!!",

I will definitely keep posting as I learn more- I will be seeing the doc on Jan. 29th and will hopefully become more educated. Pretty sure I will start the Xtandi that week. I think the Xgeva has helped with bone pain and will talk to the doc about spot radiation if pain increases again. Might have to find better hobbies than extreme 4 wheeling also lol! Last August the bone scans and ct scans showed entire cancer involvement of T 11 and partial involvement of T 10 and T 6 and minimum involvement in the lower sacrum in the pelvic area.

The doc is very confident the insurance will approve the Xtandi and he just told me about the progress made with Provenge and we will use that if necessary. I do take vit. c and also lots of calcium and vit. d and concentrated pomegranate. I do believe the theory that \" the cure is in the cause\" and that cancers are directly related to our diet and lifestyle and have tried (rather weakly, I confess!) to make changes in these areas.

      "Content": "Met with the oncologist yesterday and discussed treatment options. I started Xtandi 2 weeks ago and will get psa results on March 30th. I will continue with the 3-month Lupron shots as well- the testosterone is undetectable. I discussed combining Provenge with Xtandi and the doc. said first of all there have been poor results in general with Provenge and in my case, with bone mets and more advanced cancer, would be a waste of time. He said there has been a little improvement in patients in early stages of cancer. I realize other doctors will have a different view... I will post my psa results at the end of March!",
