He was told he could come less frequently than annually since his health was very good, so it was 3-4 years since his last physical . When he went back around 5-6 weeks ago, his PSA level was at around 100. His biopsy revealed cancer, but scans indicated lower grade than numbers. He is currently in hormone therapy and going to Mayo and Northwestern, trying to decide where to have surgery. As I\u0092m reading these posts, I\u0092m not seeing anyone with these kinds of numbers.
