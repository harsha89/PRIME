      "Content": "Hi! I'm still hanging in there since last post. PSA is up to 19.45 and doctors say they can still see no sign of cancer. My bladder is giving a lot of trouble though,so urologist recommended a bladder implant by Medtronics. I am wondering if any one else has had experience with this. So far (2 months) it has not helped. They can program the input signal in many different ways and are continuing to adjust the programing but Friday I had to have a catheter installed and it has given 100 percent better results. The doctor says bladder was damaged by radiation I had 8 years ago.",
