Unfortunately I went to The Christie cancer hospital in Manchester to see my doctor and have been given the news that my cancer is back, very aggressive and have been told I will be lucky to stay alive for 6 years. I start chemotherapy in 10 weeks time. I am having hormone therapy also. The cancer is in my lymph nodes and showing on scans. Not in my bones yet! I am gutted but positive. My first thought is to prove the medical people wrong. I think I might have been a bit foolish thinking that the operation would cure me., but as my doctor said with a Gleeson 9 there was a good chance the cancer would return, but he did not think it would return this quick. So here I am at 12.20 am UK time listening to Bruce Springsteen and chilling, worrying and doing all the things I should not. At the end of the day when I am on my own I can't stop thinking about what I have been told. I am tearful and scared as I want to see my 2 boys have families but I am also a realist.

I went to see my GP and he told me he wants me to have another 1st December 2015 I still have a bit of incontinence but that is going slowly. I forgot in my original post that they also removed my nerve sacks. Sounds weird but this has affected me a bit mentally as I cannot get an erection at all at 54 years old. I also find it hard to talk to my medical team about it and if it will come back on its own or with pills etc. I would be grateful if someone can advise me on this delicate subject. Mark",
