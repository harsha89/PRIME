The only time I ever had a catheter before was for knee surgery and that came off after a day. The idea of this bag going with me every step is taking some getting used too. Any advice on best way or best place {bed or chair} to sleep would be welcomed. Thanks",

      "Content": "My name is Carlton, 65 year old Afro American recently diagnosed with PC, Gleason score 7, 3+4 clinical stage t1c, with PIN 2 at left mid and right mid. I was diagnosed earlier this month and have Davinci surgery scheduled for the 19th of this month. I've been reading on here for the last two weeks and i am really glad i found this place. My PSA had for the last three years been in the 3,6 range and this year went up tp 4.7, and after a script of Cipro for six weeks the subsequent PSA was 5.3. I was not prepared for that at all. I also suffer from long term low testosterone and was looking to get replacement therapy via implants. Obviously, that is on the back burner for now. I am just hoping the surgery takes care of the problem but if not, reading on here is helping me prepare for whatever happens. So thanks to all of you, you've made it easy for me to say, new member in the club.",
