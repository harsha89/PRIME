Lately I have loss my desire for sex, and before that I had the desire, but hard to get an erection. I've tried 3 different ED meds, none help even a little bit. Mdoc and Udoc both did not seem to know why. I am 61 years old. Wife doesn't seem to care that I don't want sex.... In fact, she seems happy. So, do you think PCa can cause this ?

      "Content": "To make a 12 year story short: My first BIOPSY with a PSA of 4.6 11 years ago was negative. Later the same UR doc wanted to do another. I told him I was going to get a second opinion. The next UR doc found infection in my Prostate seminal fluid. But antibiotics did not work. He wanted to do a \"Saturation Biopsy\" at the hospital. I went, 30 cores later and it was negative. Later this second UR doc wanted me to under go another \"Saturation Biopsy\". I told him I was going to get another opinion. The third UR doc took a 2 month wait and HE wanted to do standard biopsy. It was negative for PCa but positive for inflammation . All three doctors told me that they thought I had Prostate cancer before they did they $$ Biopsy's. My PSA was going from 3 to 15 and hanging somewhere in between. Free PSA also looked bad ! The last doctor is still the one I see. After a negative biopsy, he put me on Proscar 5mg a day for 6 months. He told me that the Proscar will shrink my Prostate, but not High Grade Prostate Cancer. My PSA went from 15 down to 1.5 and is 1.1 (Double that because of the Proscar) and you get 2.2. Now I am on Proscar 5mg every other day. So all of this time my high PSA was from a moderately enlarged Prostate and maybe inflammation. So don't worry right away if you have a PSA that is high. It can be caused by several other factors other than Pca. Unfortunately, for me, it gave me great anxiety for the last 12 years. I know many lives have been saved because of PSA testing and I glad for you. But PSA is not a Prostate Cancer test ! Chris",

Upon DRE the Udoc found a lump on his prostate. A biopsy was positive for cancer. Lucky it had not escaped the prostate. He had it removed several years ago and no re-occurrence. In this case the PSA reading was meaningless. My Udoc (this is my third, but I trust him more) said that if it's negative again, he is going to give me one of the drugs that shrink the prostate. He said it will shrink the prostate, but if there is cancer in it, it won't shrink the cancer. Then he \"should\" be able to find it with a DRE. We will see. I guess the point I am trying to make is: if your PSA is low, it doesn't mean you DON'T have cancer, and if it is high it doesn't mean you DO have prostate cancer.

      "Content": "\" Isn't it better to find and treat prostate cancer early? Once prostate cancer is detected, doctors try their best to determine whether the cancer is dangerous. But the truth is in many cases, nobody knows for sure. Here's what some of the experts say: Susan G. Fisher, PhD, professor and chair of preventive medicine at the University of Rochester, N.Y.: \"Right now we do not have an accurate marker to identify people who have prostate cancer that could eventually cause serious problems for them.\" Otis Brawley, MD, chief science officer of the American Cancer Society: \"It is very well accepted that 40% to 60% of localized prostate cancers that we cure are in men who did not need to be cured.\" Barnett S. Kramer, MD, MPH, director of the office of disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health: \"Unfortunately right now we are left with diagnosing a large number of people without precise enough knowledge to spare those who don't need to be treated from treatment.\" But a healthy man who is told he has cancer no longer feels like a healthy man. In the U.S., most such men will seek treatment.\"",

I've suffered up and down PSA's for years. I agreed to have another biopsy on DEC 20. This will be my third and first one in 3 years. I'm thinking that I do now have PC.
