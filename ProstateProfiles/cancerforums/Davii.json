      "Content": "G'day all Well it's that time again. <.008. I'm at the point now that my urologist has set my next test our to 6 months. I know that it could always come back but if it had already set up a distant met, it would show up in the ultra sensitive psa early. Continency...Been great. Don't have a problem except for a bit of urgency early. Very worried about every drip and stain. Decieded to have grey underwear only! Probably left a few marks before but I'm a bit more worried now! ED... Hard to handle at first as I fidnt react to the same. Wiff of perfume, peek of inner leg XXX. Didn't happen. Now it's coming back. Slowly but it's morning erections! Able to do the biz without the Viagra. Too early to tell but I'm hopeful of some more progress. Meanwhile I'm still here over the first shock and ready to see where life leads me Thanks all Wishing all the best",

      "Content": "G'day Micheal Yes I'm aware that the systems are diferent but the are the same focus. I had a MRI before biopsy and it enabled those needles to target those points of interest and find the Gleason 9. Also indicated that it was on the capsule wall. So before the OP I was told by my surgeon he would be cutting wide on the left. He is very highly regarded and has a low positive margin count so I excepted this was the most prudent path. Pathology proved him correct. I'll be seeing my surgeon in November for my next PSA and if another undetectable he will pass me back to my family doctor for continuing PSAs into the future. Or he'll pass my on to an oncologist. I'm not considering radiation as a adjunct therapy. I recon it negates the original reason for surgery. My bladder control is great and I'm working on the ED. Why compromise those now for no reason. However if the cancer were to return I certainly would consider radiation as salvage treatment. I'm in contact with a small band of brothers all Gleason 9s even though our staging and treatments vary we all share another thing in common.... We are all above the grass line Thanks micheal for your concern, I really appreciate all the knowledge of the board, you lot are amazing.",

My surgeon was able to preserve my bladder neck so I regained control of my bladder early. The last is ED, and only with only I side of the nerve bundle saved I don't know what I can expect. I'm 4 1/2 months post op so still a bit of healing to come. I'm keeping an open mind and hope to hear from others with partial nerve sparing",

I know that it could always come back but if it had already set up a distant met, it would show up in the ultra sensitive psa early. Continency...Been great. Don't have a problem except for a bit of urgency early. Very worried about every drip and stain. Decieded to have grey underwear only! Probably left a few marks before but I'm a bit more worried now! ED... Hard to handle at first as I fidnt react to the same. Wiff of perfume, peek of inner leg XXX. Didn't happen. Now it's coming back. Slowly but it's morning erections! Able to do the biz without the Viagra. Too early to tell but I'm hopeful of some more progress. Meanwhile I'm still here over the first shock and ready to see where life leads me Thanks all Wishing all the best",

There is none for lung cancer so that 5 year survival rate is pretty dismal as it's only when the symptoms are noticed that it gets diagnosed. To late... Great prostate cancer survival rate is 95 per cent! But the devil is in the detail! That 5 per cent is 3400 men a year, 8 per day, by the time you get to 5 years that's 17000 men... died.
