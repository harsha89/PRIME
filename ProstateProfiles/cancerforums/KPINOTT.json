Below I have listed my numbers. I was on TRT for a few months for low T which shot my PSA up to 3.1 but I have been off for a few months now. My numbers have ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 and have gone up and down. I just had a test yesterday and it came back at 2.75 which is above the normal range for my age group. However, when I reach 50 in six months I will be within normal range unless it spikes drastically. Was thinking of waiting until I turn 50 to have another test Any suggestions here Past results below July 2011 \u0096 2.12 after DRE August 2011 - 1.56 before DRE Sept 2015 \u0096 2.54 December 2015: 2.56 \u0096 On TRT October 2016 \u0096 2.16 \u0096 no TRT April 2017 \u0096 3.1 \u0096 back on TRT September 7th 2017 - 2.75 off TRT for 3 months (exercised vigorously beforehand which I heard can raise the number) Thanks for any advice",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi KP! The 2 key phrases are: - \"unless it spikes drastically\" (KPINOTT) - \"there is no disturbing upward trend\" (ASAdvocate) While it is highly unlikely that you harbor PCa at this time, it remains best to have an experienced URO MD make this judgement call. Keep in mind that there is no evidence and no suspicions that TRT can cause PCa. However, in the presence of PCa, TRT can cause it to progress at a near exponential rate! Similar to throwing gasoline on a small smoldering campfire. Be sure that your URO MD is aware of your TRT dosages and schedule. He/she may want you to monitor your PSA at least every 6 months. Also, there are several Forum Members who have harbored serious PCa in the face of \"normal\" PSA levels. My 'guess' is you are likely free from PCa. Remaining vigilant will be essential.

The 2 key phrases are: - \"unless it spikes drastically\" (KPINOTT) - \"there is no disturbing upward trend\" (ASAdvocate) While it is highly unlikely that you harbor PCa at this time, it remains best to have an experienced URO MD make this judgement call. Keep in mind that there is no evidence and no suspicions that TRT can cause PCa. However, in the presence of PCa, TRT can cause it to progress at a near exponential rate!

      "Content": "Hello all I am currently 49 and will be 50 in about six months. I have been getting PSA tests for the last 8 years or so as I am very proactive about my health. Below I have listed my numbers. I was on TRT for a few months for low T which shot my PSA up to 3.1 but I have been off for a few months now. My numbers have ranged from 1.5 to 3.1 and have gone up and down. I just had a test yesterday and it came back at 2.75 which is above the normal range for my age group. However, when I reach 50 in six months I will be within normal range unless it spikes drastically. Was thinking of waiting until I turn 50 to have another test Any suggestions here Past results below July 2011 \u0096 2.12 after DRE August 2011 - 1.56 before DRE Sept 2015 \u0096 2.54 December 2015: 2.56 \u0096 On TRT October 2016 \u0096 2.16 \u0096 no TRT April 2017 \u0096 3.1 \u0096 back on TRT September 7th 2017 - 2.75 off TRT for 3 months (exercised vigorously beforehand which I heard can raise the number) Thanks for any advice",

      "Content": "Hello all Forgive me for posting as I do not have PC but last year my PSA was high for my age and I was in a panic and found this great site Anyway, I wouldn't mind feedback on this as I think it might be an interesting situation; I had my PSA tested back in 2010 at age 42 and my PSA was 1.08. I then had my PSA level tested last year (2015), as I have a friend who contracted PC at 45 years old and I am similar in age; 48 now. I am extremely disciplined about my health and what I eat so wanted to be proactive about this. Last year at age 47, I had my PSA checked again and it was 2.54 in December. Then had it re-checked in January and it was 2.56. Hence the panic. My family Dr. said it was elevated for my age and referred me to a Urologist. The urologist was impressed with my knowledge of the disease as I had done my research and agreed with my suggestion to monitor it every year and do nothing else at that point. I have no risk factors such as race, obesity (in top physical condition), under 50, no family history etc Fast forward to this week; to my delight, my PSA was down to 2.16. I don't have an explanation but I think it might be related to the regimen of dietary and increased physical exercise. Have read a ton on nutrition and diet relating to PC and some of the common foods that come up are; tree nuts pomegranate green tea extract soy Lycopne cruciferous vegetables,to name a few I added all of these foods to my diet and started doing intense exercise 5-6 times per week The other possibility is that I changed labs and the testing may be less sensitive Any thoughts on this?

I eat a little salmon and Tuna and rarely eat red meat anymore. Do eat a bit of chicken also. My weakness has been sugar and potato chips which I am cutting out almost completely. Regarding my intense exercise routine; I agree with you that it may be overkill for what I am trying to achieve but I got involved in Crossfit and its changed my life. I do it so often as it makes me feel great and tons of energy I am in full belief that diet and lifestyle has a lot do to with this disease and I'm surprised that others seem to make comments to the contrary and even make jokes about it. I feel bad for them. People I work with tend to joke about my lifestyle and say I am too extreme. Perhaps I am but I look at the excess weight they carry and the health problems I see and I'm ok with the odd joke. To each their own I guess",

      "Content": "Hello all Brand new here and I was thinking it might be a good place to get feedback; Had my PSA done in 2011 when I was 43. Reading came back at .78 and 1.06 within a few days of each other. Second was after a DRE so a little higher Have been taking propecia fo 15 years up until 6 months ago. Just had another PSA and it came back at 2.54 Doctor is concerned since its over the 2.5 level for my age. I am not that concerned in that I understand propecia can skew the readings and you should multiply by around 2.3 to get an accurate reading. That would have brought my 2011 test to around 2.4 which is close to what it is today, using the more accurate reading with propecia not skewing it any longer. I also have a slightly enlarged prostate according to the urologist I saw back in 2011 Should i be concerned here? Thanks",
