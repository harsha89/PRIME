      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter sequoiaranger, one of the regular posters here took Zytiga for a while but he recently went on to Xtandi. If I remember correctly, he also had some side effects but don't know if he had leg cramps. Perhaps he can comment or you can send him a private message to get his perspective on Zytiga. May we ask if Zytiga works for you in terms of controlling your PSA/cancer? Good luck. I was taking Zytiga for about six months, when I started getting severe leg cramps and doctor switched me to Bicalutamide. Since then I have heard great success with Zytiga, so I would like to go back on it. I need to find an answer to my leg cramps. If any one knows a solution to my problem, please let me know. Thanks",
