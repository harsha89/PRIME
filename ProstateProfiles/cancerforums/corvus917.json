      "Content": "Thanks for the replies everyone. We still haven't told him anything, and we're still debating bringing it up at all. Our doctor is making a house call on Friday, so we're going to talk to him about it. And truthfully, we're convinced that it is almost assuredly terminal, so we're not even considering chemo or anything of the sort, especially given his age. We just want to know how much longer he likely has with us. I just don't know if an oncologist can give a timeline based on the PSA test and CT scan alone. As for taking care of him and his inability to walk or stand by himself, we're pretty much limited to his wheelchair and, if possible, his walker. Thing is, he can't even support himself with his left leg anymore, so he is dependent on us. That, and he's already taking over a dozen pills a day for hypothyroidism, appetite, proton pump inhibition, and back pain. We've tried finding a nurse to take care of him at home, but they're in short supply around here, so my mom, uncle and I are the ones taking care of him. We're just hoping we can keep him eating and hydrated, since he went to the hospital in the first place because he stopped eating after he had three of his teeth extracted, and ended up losing 40 pounds and getting dehydrated. If it were possible, we'd keep him on IV fluids, but he is so stubborn and fussy that, well, you only have to look at the numerous black spots on his arms to see just how uncooperative he is. I can't count the number of times he had to have the tubing replaced because of blood backing up into it; hell, he actually knocked his dextrose over trying to take a shower for himself when we left him alone for a couple hours to get some overnight stuff for the hospital, and left it lopsided so that it sucked blood into the bag. So yeah, hospitals and hospice is out of the question.",

      "Content": "So, after having to readmit my 80 year old father into the hospital twice in a month due to dehydration, weakness in the legs and back pain, we had him take a PSA test and a CT scan and an ultrasound. The results of the test was a PSA of 300, and the scans indicated that the prostate had a volume of 81 CCs, and there were calcifications and growths on the spine, which would suggest metastasis. Our doctor told our father the results of the tests, but we chose not to tell him that we thought it was cancer. My mother and I just told him that he needed a biopsy. Thing is that he refused to have a biopsy, since he hates hospitals (calls them places where \"people go to die\") and said that he \"didn't want them to find anything else wrong with me\", and he just wanted to leave. Now he's home two days later, and we're taking care of him, but we don't know how to tell him what is wrong with him. We thought he figured it out himself, but it seems that he's oblivious to what's wrong with him. He's too frail for chemo or radiotherapy, it's a struggle to get him to eat or drink anything even with appetite stimulants, and he can't even stand on his own. We haven't seen an oncologist yet, and we don't know how long he has left. I don't know what to do.",
