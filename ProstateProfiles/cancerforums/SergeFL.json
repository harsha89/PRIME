Decision making is very hard due to so much information available. \"Fortunately\" for me my dad went through treatment (BT/ER/HT) 8 years ago and shared his personal experience, including emotional part of PC diagnose. I believe it is very important to find someone you really trust and not just pushing its own agenda, business or bias point of view. Then study and get as much info from books, forums and support groups because every bit of information you get during learning curve will help you in the end to make best educated choice for treatment, recovery and future life.",

I understand that this is controversial topic and requires lot of research and study. Right now I more inclined to think that well balanced life described in chapter 10 can slow down progression or even (possible?) halt PC for LOW Risk/Volume cases. I can also view it as preparation for treatment to boost immune system and overall health to have better recovery from potential side effects of treatment. The reason I refer this book because I studied several books on this subject as well this forum and this book has the most comprehensive overview that covers the latest updates on all available treatments in US and abroad, including many stories from doctors and patients. If someone wants to take surgery path or get in-depth knowledge on cancer causing factors, then I recommend Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.",

      "Content": "Thank you for all replies and valuable inputs. Based on biopsy results and Polaris report I am qualified for active surveillance. However, I have number of concerns before choosing AS for now: First, as you may know random TRUS biopsy is only 30% accurate and will miss 70% of cancers. To combat this uncertainty I plan on doing 3t MRI in June plus another PCA and Free PCA testing to have better understanding where I stand. Once I have this information my next step, if I have additional areas of concern, is to do MRI-Fusing biopsy for 20 cores. It is still 80% accurate, but it is better then 30% of random biopsy. As my urologist mentioned the only reason why he found cancer, because he aimed in the area of firmness discovered during DRE. Second, the location of tumor and how close it is to prostate wall. The urologist told me that he can not say where exactly the tumor is. What worries me is the procentage of core with cancer (8%). If the tumor is really small how he can fill it during DRE unless it is very close or touching the prostate wall. The other possibility if biopsy sampled the side of tumor and the actual tumor is much higher volume but deeper in prostate. If tumor is deeper in prostate then AS is very good option for now. However, if it is \"touching\" prostate wall then it is completely different situation and it moves me to intermediate risk group (regardless of low Gleason score) that require treatment withing one year period. This is the reason why I am trying to get information about best treatment options, as well AS. I met two radiation oncologists. Both offer IGRT. One RO uses KV CBCT (without fiducial markers). This is the same clinic that treated my father. And other RO uses IGRT but with fiducial markers. Not sure what guide system they use. Surgery is concern to me because of tumor location: Left Medial Apex. As I learned from one of the book I read, this specific area has higher possibility of leaving positive margin due to close proximity to urethra. I will consider all these treatment options once I have better understanding of current state of cancer. Right now I am looking toward AS.",
