I spent a few years underwater in the submarine force and I need to catch up on my fresh air and sun! Denis",

No soreness, no urination issue, actually no SEs. unfortunately, we had a family tragedy, as my first wife passed away suddenly. My wife and I went to NC to support my two daughters. They asked me to do the eulogy, which I did and it was an amazing service for our family. My daughters struggled with all of this, especially having to make the decision to discontinue life support. In parallel to all of this my GI doc told me there were two polyps from my last colonoscopy. I am on the annual plan due to family history. Well, I couldn't get the doc to tell me the path report and with all the emotions I was convinced it was bad news. Fortunately, I was wrong, benign. Emotions and cancer don't go well together. As to my PC, I now wait three months for the PSA. Feeling relieved and grateful. Denis",

      "Content": "Am I living or dying? Cancer throws a wrench into that question. My experience for this last year or so has been one of many thoughts, feelings, and questions. The vivid memory of that Urologist telling me \u0093you have prostate cancer\u0094 is as if it happened yesterday. Shock, fear, and loneliness surrounded me that day. My wife was away in Hawaii visiting her daughter and we expected the doctor visit to be like the last and a message you have nothing to worry about. So, the shock was exponential based on my expectations. The doctor babble about surgery and even suggested we could get it scheduled in the next number of weeks, even though I was a Gleason 6, 4 cores and none above 30%. I happened to have taken my motorcycle to the appointment, so when I left I rode by the ocean to try to process what had happened. It was a long night and many long nights the next 6 months as my wife and I tried to figure out what to do. I am a thinker, researcher, reader so I dove into the literature, attended PCRI conference and attended a weekend with other PC folks. I changed Uros and went to Yale and loved my doc there. They did a second opinion on my biopsy samples and upgraded one core to G7 (3+4) <5%. We did a genomic test that came back less than favorable and decided to treat. My great doc at Yale was newer in the profession and had done 200 robotic prostatectomies. So, we decided to move our treatment to Florida and had an appointment with Dr. Patel who has done more than 13,000. In the meantime we met with an RO and once informed about other choices, we choose HDR BT. The treatment and recovery were easy and now I am in the wait and watch what happens to my PSA. At its height it was 5.7, 3 months post op it was 1.3. I have my next blood draw in a couple of weeks. Living or dying? I am active on a couple of forums and of late it seems like there is a rash of reoccurrences and guys are dealing with more advanced treatments. A week or so ago I got a little down about this fact and started worrying about my case. I am blessed with another malady that focuses on living one day at a time and I have been practicing that for more than 40 years. It became clear to me that when I am worried, stressed, upset, etc. I am more dying than living. I have had sleepless nights, high anxiety and other negative feelings this last year but as time passes I seem to have them much less. As a matter of fact, the only time I think about PC is when I log onto a forum and interact with fellow PC brothers. As to my next PSA test I have no real feelings about it right now. I am in a place of acceptance and know there is nothing I can do to change the state of my PC today. One tool I use often is to make a gratitude list, for which I have many, many things and people to be grateful for! So, I choose to live. Living for me includes showing up as a grateful and helpful person. I know that through helping others I get the focus off of self. As I was contemplating this writing I thought, I certainly am closer to the end of my life than the beginning of my life. I am 66 years old, but I am healthy, happy and have a lot to share and help others. To me, that is what living is about. Living is about giving! I see this every day on the forum as guys support each other and help new guys. We (in my opinion) have a responsibility to help others, particularly those who are just starting this journey. Cancer has enabled me to form new friendships and allowed me to recommit to living. Sure, there are dark times, but I have the choice right now to turn on the light, to choose to be alive, to reach out and help others. One interesting gift I have received is fitness. I have always been active and tried to take care of myself and this last six months I have double down on my fitness and feel more fit and alive than almost any time in my life. I write this on a plane heading to North and South Dakota with my wife for two weeks of exploration and focused couple time. What a gift. I have no idea what my future holds concerning my health and I committed to minimizing the time I fret about the future, as I find that to be in the dying mode not living. We have a choice to show up right now alive or dying, let's choose living!",

      "Content": "The most confusing part of having PC for me and what I hear others say is deciding what to do! The need to learn about the options, the side effects, and the relapse rates all figure into to it. Certainly, we need a good diagnosis and staging info to make this decision. Also, there is a risk part of the decision, the risk of not choosing the best, the risk of acting too soon, etc. The below link is a decision tree that I find useful. For me, the other critical factors trust in my Uro. My first Uro and I did not connect, within 15 minutes of telling me I had cancer he was talking about scheduling surgery and I was G6, four cores, all less than 33%. My current Uro is willing to sit and talk, discusses the research, and seems well balanced and truly caring! In the end, it is my wife's and my decision and hopefully, we have enough good research and trust to make the most informed decision possible when we make it. I also believe there will be a series of decisions along this journey. I do find forums like this most helpful in the decision process. Thanks, Denis",

      "Content": "I am new at this PC adventure and in the early decision-making state. I read a great deal, am active on a few forums, have a great Doc and feel well informed. Yesterday on a forum a Gentleman shared his AS story and the shock of going from G6 to G9 in five years. A great discussion in the thread occurred. To say it set me on my heels is not an overstatement. I have been through the typical emotional wringer many of us go through in the early days of diagnosis. I had become comfortable with following AS at Yale. I meet with my Uro today, hopefully, to get Decipher results and create a short-term plan. And the post mentioned has me full of doubt. I also had this thought that my fear of intervention (which I believe will happen at some point) is really about the SEs of intervention. So, the bet I am making is it worth delaying SEs for some period and risking advanced disease and possibly metastasis? At the PCRI conference, I met a big group of men on AS who were very happy. A few who had interventions after AS for many years and were pleased with their decision. I believe there is great value in AS for many. Am I one of them is the key question? As I reflect on the many tough decisions I have made in my life, none seem as difficult as this one. The impreciseness of the tools we have, the complexity of this stupid little gland, and the bias we all have makes this a most difficult decision. What do I know? Well I know I have positive cores with second opinion grading. I don\u0092t know if there is a worst disease that the biopsy missed but probability wise there is a greater chance that I have worse than better cancer. More cases are upgraded than downgraded. I also know many guys who have had /are having a good run at AS and even those who intervened were able to keep the window of survivability open. I am getting clearer, for me, that AS is a good strategy that really is delayed intervention for many. In the recent Netherlands study, the following was found: https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...e-netherlands/ Here is what Verbeek et al. reported in London: \u0095 Of the 900 eligible patients, o 223 (24.8 percent) were initially placed on active surveillance. o 312 (34.7 percent) elected immediate radiation therapy. o 365 (40.6 percent) elected immediate radical prostatectomy. \u0095 The 15-year rates of metastasis-free survival were o 96.9 percent for the men initially placed on active surveillance. o 96.6 percent for the men treated with immediate radiation therapy. o 97.7 percent for the men treated with immediate radical prostatectomy. \u0095 The 15-year rates of prostate cancer-specific survival were o 97.2 percent for the men initially placed on active surveillance. o 97.5 percent for the men treated with immediate radiation therapy. o 98.5 percent for the men treated with immediate radical prostatectomy. \u0095 There were no statistically significant differences between the groups of patients with regard to either metastasis-free or prostate cancer-specific survival. Well, I am a bit lost as to my next steps. I do trust my doc and today will have a gut discussion. I am confident the path will be clearer later today and my wife and I can decide the best course for us. I am open to input for all. Well time to go for a run and let the spirits guide me! Be well all! Denis",

In the recent Netherlands study, the following was found: https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...e-netherlands/ Here is what Verbeek et al. reported in London: \u0095 Of the 900 eligible patients, o 223 (24.8 percent) were initially placed on active surveillance. o 312 (34.7 percent) elected immediate radiation therapy. o 365 (40.6 percent) elected immediate radical prostatectomy. \u0095 The 15-year rates of metastasis-free survival were o 96.9 percent for the men initially placed on active surveillance. o 96.6 percent for the men treated with immediate radiation therapy. o 97.7 percent for the men treated with immediate radical prostatectomy. \u0095 The 15-year rates of prostate cancer-specific survival were o 97.2 percent for the men initially placed on active surveillance. o 97.5 percent for the men treated with immediate radiation therapy. o 98.5 percent for the men treated with immediate radical prostatectomy. \u0095 There were no statistically significant differences between the groups of patients with regard to either metastasis-free or prostate cancer-specific survival. Well, I am a bit lost as to my next steps. I do trust my doc and today will have a gut discussion. I am confident the path will be clearer later today and my wife and I can decide the best course for us. I am open to input for all. Well time to go for a run and let the spirits guide me! Be well all! Denis",

      "Content": "Thanks All. it was a smooth day, all the professionals were attentive and caring. For prep, I had to do two enemas, and two showers with surgical soap. No eating from noon the day before and no drinking after midnight. I arrived at 6 am and was in prep room by 630. They did vitals and IV. The anesthesiologist came and talked about sedation. The first step in the procedure was to insert the catheters in the prostate, 15 of them. And a urinary catheter for the day. This was done under general anesthesia. I also had an MRI in this process but don't remember it. This was to ensure the caths were correctly placed. They used a rectal ultrasound to place the caths. I then woke up and brought to the radiation lab where they inserted tubes into catheters. The tubes were hooked up to a machine that delivered the radiation. This was done by physicists, they left the room. I was alone in the room for maybe a half hour while they did the treatments. They then brought me back to the recovery room and waited my turn to have the caths removed, this time under propofol. During the awake periods, I felt discomfort/pressure in my urinary and prostate area. Occasions jabs of discomfort. about every 5 minutes they were offering pain meds but I did not need any. After they removed the caths the go home test was to urinate. I waited about 15 minutes in recovery and then was able to pee. A tinge of blood in the urine. Went home, had a nice dinner. I have two minor issues. My perineum is sore, had to wear loose clothes last night, no tighty whitees And when I urinate there is a burning sensation at the tip of my penis. They gave me an OTC med for the burning. It turns your urine bright orange. There is one other issue and that is they put e back on Flomax, and it causes insomnia in me. Happened after biopsy and I had hoped it was anxiety. I am going to try taking it in the morning and see if that helps, if not find an alternative. I feel great this morning. I go back in two weeks for the second and final treatment. . Denis",

While I am not grateful to have cancer, I am very grateful for the people I have met, the wonderful medical professionals who go out of their way to help me. I am also extremely grateful I live in a country where quality medical care is available. During the last six months, I have experienced an array of emotions, unsureness, and loneliness that were not pleasant. However, I also met all of you, men and women at GFMPH and at the PCRI conference. I also have found many existing friends who have PC. The level of conversation is much different when you talk to another man with PC. I have so many gifts and those related to PC include the ability to learn, to trust, to be inquisitive and to be so thankful for those who help me on this journey. The ability to connect and share is such a gift. During this holiday season, I have been reflecting on the gifts related to my cancer and am very grateful. So, I wish you all peace and a wonderful holiday season. I also want to thank you all for being on these forums and other get-togethers where you have helped me come to grips with my disease and options. You are very special men and women! Peace, Denis",

      "Content": "I looked at most recent publications on the NIH PubMed site and compiled these, all have good outcomes for HDR-BT. What seems odd to me, still, is why isn't this treatment more common? I get there are not as many docs who specialize in it, I get there is less money to be made, and I get there are fewer fellowships to get trained.

      "Content": "Bias will kill us! I know from personal experience that once I make a decision I start to ignore and rule out other important information that may not support my opinion. I was set on doing RP because of a ignorance about radiation. Fortunately, I met a doctor who explained it in a way that caused me to pause and motivated me to learn more about HDR-BT. My bias almost eliminated this option for me. Now I also know there was this internal pressure to make a decision and get treatment. The idea that there was CANCER in me was causing emotional decision making not factual decision making. There also may be some value one I am set on a treatment plan to focus on that, so the focused FB pages may serve a value. As you all know the decision on treatment is a very difficult for some of us. Having a forum like this one was a great tool in my decision making.",

      "Content": "I just got back from an awesome golf school in Arizona. It was called Vision54, which is about setting audacious goals, the score of 54 is birding every hole. One of the key components of the school is about being present and mindful when int he play box. They use think box, play box, and memory box as phases of the golf game. In the play box, we are more successful if we are committed and clear about our intentions. The PC journey is similar for me. Early on I spent way to much time in the think box and much of my thinking carried into today or the play box, contaminating it. Sure I needed to learn about PC, make decisions about treatment and even feel the fear of having PC. But today I can set that aside when I step into the play box or life. And I can create new memories of a life well lived. Being present is a gift to self. Denis",

      "Content": "Thanks another I agree prob have an extra 10 pounds. My D has to be fine. I do plan adding strengh training. The timing issue is a question. Technically I am low risk category still. We are doing another MRI to see if there are any changes. Have a big trip to Hawaii to take care of grandkids in November and ski trip in March. Hoping to do those and use time to verify what to do. However, if PSA or other indicator say otherwise I will act. Thanks Denis",

      "Content": "I have some experience with research reports, both writing and reading. In this forum, we come across many and are trying to make sense of them. One of the best tips I ever got about research is the following 4 steps. 1. Practical problem (does X effect Y)? 2. Statistical problem (does a sample population have a relationship between X and Y)? 3. Statistical solution (what is the correlation between X and Y)? 4. Practical solution (eliminate X due to the relationship with Y). A couple of key thoughts on the generic research report. Most of the research that I have seen on PC is correlational research, which looks at is there a relationship between two variables. There are two VERY important things to consider when looking at correlation results, the sample population, and the significance of the relationship. Each correlation study has a sample group of men, 1,000, 2,000, etc. and the hope of the researcher is this sample represents the population. The gold standard of research is \u0093pure random sample of sample participants\u0094 and most samples are not pure, some are better than others. Age, comorbidity, the region where participants live, ethnicity, etc. all affect how well the sample represents the population. Remember the end the statistic solution refers to the larger population, or we make inference about the variable in question to the population. The second critical factor is the significance of the relationship. A perfect correlation is 1, no correlation is 0. See https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat100/node/35 for more on significance. The real key and most often in research there is a positive correlation meaning based on the statistical test there is a relationship. Now I have often heard and read there is a statistical correlation but not a practical one. One other thought is bias, researcher bias, sample bias and many other biases. I am not suggesting intentional bias. When I did my dissertation, I had a strong hypothesis. The results came in completely opposite of what I believed. At first, I thought I failed. However, disproving or looking for another variable that could explain the result is as valuable as my initial belief about the relationship between variables. I suggest most researchers have bias and the good ones declare it and ensure the research plan accounts for it. In this source are some good thoughts and definitions of many of the terms in research reports. http://researchbasics.education.uconn.edu/correlation/ I was taught to read research reports with a healthy skepticism. Look for flaws, look for the makeup of the sample and how well the sample represents the population. Also look for the significance of the findings. One key to research is where is it published. Peer-reviewed is the gold standard but there are different levels of peers. Being published in the AMA is more rigorous than a local group that formed a website to publish their thoughts. I am not a statistician but do have some experience with research design and interpretation. Please feel free to add your thoughts and experience to this thread. The better we are at understanding the importance of a study, the better decisions we will make. Thanks, Denis",

I am pretty sure all who have PC would disagree with cutting back on screening. The problem is not screening it is having well-schooled docs who know how to lead us through the next steps once there is an indication of abnormality, like high PSA. I wonder if other cancers have battled with this type of BS?",

I suggest you evaluate the treatment difficulty, the probable (not possible) side effects, the post-treatment recovery process. The main treatments have basically the same effectiveness. What was critical for me was to eliminate my prejudice (in my case about radiation). I heard rectal incontinence and that was a show stopper. With reading, discussing, and advice from experts I was able to be informed to the point of making a decision was easy. Ask questions, take notes, read all you can get your hands on, call guys and talk to them (feel free to PM me if I can tell you about my process. We are all here to support each other! Denis",

I had a tough day yesterday, too much reading /research. Today was a great day, time out with the wife on the motorcycle, a good round of golf, and spent some time working on my 1952 Chevy pickup.

However, I woke this morning and felt at peace and when I opened my email and saw a message from my doc that new labs were available I was in a very accepting place.

      "Content": "I have read numerous books, chatted with many online, met with multiple doctors, talked to a few who have gone before me and I am coming to a place of acceptance that I will eventually have treatment. The critical questions that remain are When and How will I know it is time? Active Surveillance\u0092s intent is to watch those that may have an indolent disease that may not be the ultimate cause of death, ensuring the window of opportunity is not missed, and delaying the side effects of treatment. My Uro considers my case low risk, even with a bit of 3+4, in one core <5%. Now contrasting Klotz and Epstein criteria; I would be a candidate for AS in Klotz model but not Epstein. I believe about 20% of confirmation biopsy upgrade stage and trigger intervention. That also suggests the reminder doesn't get upgraded. The researchers/experts in the field talk probabilities and fortunately paint a good picture about long term survivability for AS candidates. And they point out some die from the disease and /or have a more challenging disease to deal with. My summary of the readings that I have done in the last weeks suggests there is a very low risk of AS contributing to dying from PC, with definitive AS regime and clear trigger points. What\u0092s the debate? For me, it is less about side effects and more about the risk of surgery. I think the potential risk of surgery is equal to or higher than the risk of dying form PC with low-risk disease. Now that is my feeling, not a fact that I can scientifically prove. However, most of our decisions are informed feeling based. I have a friend who chose RP because the thought of cancer growing in him was not palatable. Now his outcome was great so in hindsight great decision. My internal debate can be more accurately described as a narrowing of my view as to the best course for me. I am trying to stay very open to other\u0092s opinions and experiences, even those who think I might be taking a big risk if I stay on AS. All information is important to inform the next decision. The next decision is the way I am going to manage this. Increased PSA informed the decision to do multi parametric MRI, which informed the fusion biopsy, which is informing the treatment decision. I am awaiting Decipher results to inform the next decision, which I think will be confirmation MRI / biopsy sometime later this year or early next. Some days I feel like I am deciding not to decide but that is not accurate. I am making incremental decisions based on new data and new education. I really feel I am in a gray zone, young enough to have a long life ahead, a cancer that is not in the \u0093very low risk\u0094 category, and I believe a great Urologist/hospital (Yale) that will guide and inform the next decision. I am attending a PC conference next week led my op Docs/researchers in the field, attending a weekend get away with fellow PC guys and their spouses in a few weeks, should meet with Uro soon to discuss next steps. These steps are all to help inform the decision. What I am clear on is there is no urgency to the \u0093get it out of me\u0094 feeling I had the day I was told I had PC. I am throwing a wide net to get information, which I can then narrow through discernment and counsel. I am getting more comfortable with the approach discussed and there are moments of \u0093what if you are wrong?\u0094 that concern me at times. I welcome any thoughts that may inform my journey.

      "Content": "I have read numerous books, chatted with many online, met with multiple doctors, talked to a few who have gone before me and I am coming to a place of acceptance that I will eventually have treatment. The critical questions that remain are When and How will I know it is time? Active Surveillance\u0092s intent is to watch those that may have an indolent disease that may not be the ultimate cause of death, ensuring the window of opportunity is not missed, and delaying the side effects of treatment. My Uro considers my case low risk, even with a bit of 3+4, in one core <5%. Now contrasting Klotz and Epstein criteria; I would be a candidate for AS in Klotz model but not Epstein. I believe about 20% of confirmation biopsy upgrade stage and trigger intervention. That also suggests the reminder doesn't get upgraded. The researchers/experts in the field talk probabilities and fortunately paint a good picture about long term survivability for AS candidates. And they point out some die from the disease and /or have a more challenging disease to deal with. My summary of the readings that I have done in the last weeks suggests there is a very low risk of AS contributing to dying from PC, with definitive AS regime and clear trigger points. What\u0092s the debate? For me, it is less about side effects and more about the risk of surgery. I think the potential risk of surgery is equal to or higher than the risk of dying form PC with low-risk disease. Now that is my feeling, not a fact that I can scientifically prove. However, most of our decisions are informed feeling based. I have a friend who chose RP because the thought of cancer growing in him was not palatable. Now his outcome was great so in hindsight great decision. My internal debate can be more accurately described as a narrowing of my view as to the best course for me. I am trying to stay very open to other\u0092s opinions and experiences, even those who think I might be taking a big risk if I stay on AS. All information is important to inform the next decision. The next decision is the way I am going to manage this. Increased PSA informed the decision to do multi parametric MRI, which informed the fusion biopsy, which is informing the treatment decision. I am awaiting Decipher results to inform the next decision, which I think will be confirmation MRI / biopsy sometime later this year or early next. Some days I feel like I am deciding not to decide but that is not accurate. I am making incremental decisions based on new data and new education. I really feel I am in a gray zone, young enough to have a long life ahead, a cancer that is not in the \u0093very low risk\u0094 category, and I believe a great Urologist/hospital (Yale) that will guide and inform the next decision. I am attending a PC conference next week led my op Docs/researchers in the field, attending a weekend get away with fellow PC guys and their spouses in a few weeks, should meet with Uro soon to discuss next steps. These steps are all to help inform the decision. What I am clear on is there is no urgency to the \u0093get it out of me\u0094 feeling I had the day I was told I had PC. I am throwing a wide net to get information, which I can then narrow through discernment and counsel. I am getting more comfortable with the approach discussed and there are moments of \u0093what if you are wrong?\u0094 that concern me at times. I welcome any thoughts that may inform my journey.

Guidelines suggested AS is appropriate with caution. We used the decipher data to help us evaluate the caution. Many AS protocols would not have considered me anyway. This data helped weigh the risk. My decipher score was not as favorable as many who have posted results and that helped me decide not to take the risk, due to 3+4. Denis",

      "Content": "I have read numerous books, chatted with many online, met with multiple doctors, talked to a few who have gone before me and I am coming to a place of acceptance that I will eventually have treatment. The critical questions that remain are When and How will I know it is time? Active Surveillance\u0092s intent is to watch those that may have an indolent disease that may not be the ultimate cause of death, ensuring the window of opportunity is not missed, and delaying the side effects of treatment. My Uro considers my case low risk, even with a bit of 3+4, in one core <5%. Now contrasting Klotz and Epstein criteria; I would be a candidate for AS in Klotz model but not Epstein. I believe about 20% of confirmation biopsy upgrade stage and trigger intervention. That also suggests the reminder doesn't get upgraded. The researchers/experts in the field talk probabilities and fortunately paint a good picture about long term survivability for AS candidates. And they point out some die from the disease and /or have a more challenging disease to deal with. My summary of the readings that I have done in the last weeks suggests there is a very low risk of AS contributing to dying from PC, with definitive AS regime and clear trigger points. What\u0092s the debate? For me, it is less about side effects and more about the risk of surgery. I think the potential risk of surgery is equal to or higher than the risk of dying form PC with low-risk disease. Now that is my feeling, not a fact that I can scientifically prove. However, most of our decisions are informed feeling based. I have a friend who chose RP because the thought of cancer growing in him was not palatable. Now his outcome was great so in hindsight great decision. My internal debate can be more accurately described as a narrowing of my view as to the best course for me. I am trying to stay very open to other\u0092s opinions and experiences, even those who think I might be taking a big risk if I stay on AS. All information is important to inform the next decision. The next decision is the way I am going to manage this. Increased PSA informed the decision to do multi parametric MRI, which informed the fusion biopsy, which is informing the treatment decision. I am awaiting Decipher results to inform the next decision, which I think will be confirmation MRI / biopsy sometime later this year or early next. Some days I feel like I am deciding not to decide but that is not accurate. I am making incremental decisions based on new data and new education. I really feel I am in a gray zone, young enough to have a long life ahead, a cancer that is not in the \u0093very low risk\u0094 category, and I believe a great Urologist/hospital (Yale) that will guide and inform the next decision. I am attending a PC conference next week led my op Docs/researchers in the field, attending a weekend get away with fellow PC guys and their spouses in a few weeks, should meet with Uro soon to discuss next steps. These steps are all to help inform the decision. What I am clear on is there is no urgency to the \u0093get it out of me\u0094 feeling I had the day I was told I had PC. I am throwing a wide net to get information, which I can then narrow through discernment and counsel. I am getting more comfortable with the approach discussed and there are moments of \u0093what if you are wrong?\u0094 that concern me at times. I welcome any thoughts that may inform my journey.

The researchers/experts in the field talk probabilities and fortunately paint a good picture about long term survivability for AS candidates. And they point out some die from the disease and /or have a more challenging disease to deal with. My summary of the readings that I have done in the last weeks suggests there is a very low risk of AS contributing to dying from PC, with definitive AS regime and clear trigger points. What\u0092s the debate? For me, it is less about side effects and more about the risk of surgery. I think the potential risk of surgery is equal to or higher than the risk of dying form PC with low-risk disease. Now that is my feeling, not a fact that I can scientifically prove. However, most of our decisions are informed feeling based. I have a friend who chose RP because the thought of cancer growing in him was not palatable. Now his outcome was great so in hindsight great decision. My internal debate can be more accurately described as a narrowing of my view as to the best course for me. I am trying to stay very open to other\u0092s opinions and experiences, even those who think I might be taking a big risk if I stay on AS. All information is important to inform the next decision. The next decision is the way I am going to manage this. Increased PSA informed the decision to do multi parametric MRI, which informed the fusion biopsy, which is informing the treatment decision. I am awaiting Decipher results to inform the next decision, which I think will be confirmation MRI / biopsy sometime later this year or early next. Some days I feel like I am deciding not to decide but that is not accurate. I am making incremental decisions based on new data and new education. I really feel I am in a gray zone, young enough to have a long life ahead, a cancer that is not in the \u0093very low risk\u0094 category, and I believe a great Urologist/hospital (Yale) that will guide and inform the next decision. I am attending a PC conference next week led my op Docs/researchers in the field, attending a weekend get away with fellow PC guys and their spouses in a few weeks, should meet with Uro soon to discuss next steps. These steps are all to help inform the decision. What I am clear on is there is no urgency to the \u0093get it out of me\u0094 feeling I had the day I was told I had PC. I am throwing a wide net to get information, which I can then narrow through discernment and counsel. I am getting more comfortable with the approach discussed and there are moments of \u0093what if you are wrong?\u0094 that concern me at times. I welcome any thoughts that may inform my journey. Thanks, Denis",

My decipher score was not as favorable as many who have posted results and that helped me decide not to take the risk, due to 3+4. Denis",

I read one study that said waiting a year makes no difference to the outcomes. I am not saying wait a year but you have time to make an informed decision. I wish you well. One other thought is the guys on this forum have a lot of experience (good and not so good) and we can learn from them by asking. Denis",

I have read about one brother who has passed from this disease, many who are suffering from SEs, and a few that are starting second round treatments because the beast came back. These stories affect me, at times, profoundly. I feel bad for those who are suffering, and I am sure worried that could happen to me. These forums are very helpful. I learned so much form you all and that helped me make an informed decision about my treatment. I also love sharing my journey with new guys, in the hope they may become informed. And there are days where the reality of the journey is heavy. Today it started to feel that way and I had an ah ha. I wrote to a friend \u0093remember one day at a time.\u0094 Now that is a cute saying and a very practical piece of advice, maybe I should follow it! For me, the battle is about the loneliness of having cancer. Sure, we all share, I talk with a few brothers occasionally, attend a support group occasionally, and most of the time I am alone with my thoughts about cancer. One trap I get into is thinking about how my cancer affects my wife! She lost her first husband to stomach cancer. The thought of her having to go through that again tugs at my heart. Few of us know what our disease will do in the future. Today is a day to be lived with gratitude and intention. I am blessed with a life second to none. A loving family, great friends, good health, lots of toys and a keen awareness of the importance of living today. Living today, for me, is about showing up strong, showing up ready to help others, loving those around me to the best of my ability. A good day is when I can reflect on the positive way I impacted those I crossed paths with that day. I have cancer and choose to not let cancer have me! I will continue to learn as much as I can about this disease and the treatments available, I will be there for guys who need my help, I will do the things I know can help me be the healthiest today, and I will live life to the fullest! We are fortunate folks in that we have a choice as to how we will show up today. Let\u0092s choose to be Alive and Thrive today!",

A good day is when I can reflect on the positive way I impacted those I crossed paths with that day. I have cancer and choose to not let cancer have me! I will continue to learn as much as I can about this disease and the treatments available, I will be there for guys who need my help, I will do the things I know can help me be the healthiest today, and I will live life to the fullest! We are fortunate folks in that we have a choice as to how we will show up today. Let\u0092s choose to be Alive and Thrive today!",

The author describes pre-surgery anxiety and post-surgery pain level beyond what I have heard. He took an air ambulance home and had both a visiting nurse and a nurses aide. I detest pain meds and really avoid them at all cost. For those who had surgery, what was your experience with post op and early at home discomfort, etc. ? Thanks, Denis",

The second round also had more discomfort after catheters were inserted, while with on radiation. Accepted pain meds but that was a mistake. I was goofy until bedtime. One good outcome of foley is I did not have to get up last night! Doc changed my meds from flowmax to Alfuzosin due to insomnia issues with Flowmax. I will see the doc in six weeks to ensure everything is on track and then at three months with first PSA. His plan is to then do PSA every six months until nadir is reached. I am really glad I chose this treatment, Dr. Biagioli, and Florida hospital. The medical staff are all amazing and they make treatment as comfortable as possible. Got to get this foley out so I can play golf today! Must have priorities. Denis",

      "Content": "Tuesday is my second treatment. So far I have had very few side effects. Perinium was sore for a week but I was able to play golf every day, starting the day after treatment. I had one day of high-frequency urination and the typical 2 days of urinary burning. I am told these symptoms might be a bit more intense after round two. I also had insomnia due to Flomax, and have stopped taking it. My decision to do HDR BT is summarised nicely in this except https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3746400/ Future directions for high dose rate prostate brachytherapy The radiobiological advantage of delivering a HDR per fraction to the prostate while sparing the rectum and bladder, together with the ability to make real-time adjustments to both source positioning and dwell times of the radioactive sources thereby allowing for optimal dose distribution, has led to interest in other indications in which HDR prostate brachytherapy might be applied. One of the main practical attractions of HDR over EBRT is the shorter treatment times, and thus more recent work has focused on HDR monotherapy. This has been predominantly applied for more favourable intermediate- and low-risk disease, in which LDR has been well established. Such treatment requires multiple fractions/implants, typically given over 2\u00963 days, with some centres also repeating the implant 1\u00962 weeks later. Thus, although the number of hospital visits is lower than with EBRT, they are more intense and require inpatient stay. While the results are not as mature as with HDR boost, monotherapy studies have reported freedom from biochemical relapse rates of 89\u0096100% in low- and intermediate-risk patients, which compare favourably with findings with LDR brachytherapy [70-76]. At present this approach is not recommended routinely, but should the long-term outcome data become favourable, this will undoubtedly help to establish HDR monotherapy as a credible option for localised prostate patients.",

My doc ordered an MRI to see if there is any urgency for the intervention. I am feeling both shocked and relieved. I feel like I have a direction and am in good hands at Yale.

      "Content": "ASA thanks for the thoughts and sharing your wisdom along the way. I now enter the second phase of my research and education. I will do a deep dive on other treatments. What is interesting to me is the last week or so I was in a very comfortable place with either AS or intervention. I have learned over the years that sharing, putting out my questions, concerns, and beliefs helps to sort out the fact from the fantasy. My PC education over the last couple of months yields a few things. One, there are no certainties in what we think is the stage of our disease. Two, being well-informed balances out the fear and impulsiveness to act. And three, finding a doc you trust, trusting your intuition, and allowing those trust to inform your plan of action is the course that yields most peace for me. There is little doubt, in my mind, that I wanted to be a good candidate for AS and buy time. I also believe that for a significant portion of men (even those eligible for AS) there will be an intervention. Yesterday the scales tipped towards not taking a risk of allowing a more aggressive disease to go undetected to a point of regret. I also know that intervention is no guarantee and has risks associated with it. In an odd way, this reminds me of my time on submarines. When, as an officer of the deck, I would give the order to \"make your depth 68 feet\" and we heading to periscope depth, it was time to focus and be all in on that commitment. Taking a submarine, particularly a missile boat, is a complex task to ensure safety and security. Making the decision to intervene, came with great study, awesome counsel and an internal check to ensure it was rational and not fear based. So the journey continues. Once again I appreciate everyone's advice, questions, and shared resources. Life is good and today I will play walk 18holes and play golf. I intend to enjoy chasing the little white ball!. Denis",

My doc RO is an HDR BT expert, 10years, more than 2000 and is doing procedures two days a week. SO expertise and currency are important to me. I also highly value the connection I have with the doc. If I cannot easily communicate and trust what my doc is telling me, I need a new doc. Lastly, I think we can at best triage docs into new, gaining experience and experts. Discerning them more than that is a gue in my opinion. so find an expert you feel comfortable with. Denis",

I have been walking the tightrope for a couple of months and time to start the process of deciding and actioning the intervention. I am leaning towards RP but still need to do a bit more study. My doc ordered an MRI to see if there is any urgency for the intervention. I am feeling both shocked and relieved. I feel like I have a direction and am in good hands at Yale. Hoping the MRI shows no change and we can put the surgery off until May 2018. We shall see. Denis",

      "Content": "ASA thanks for the thoughts and sharing your wisdom along the way. I now enter the second phase of my research and education. I will do a deep dive on other treatments. What is interesting to me is the last week or so I was in a very comfortable place with either AS or intervention. I have learned over the years that sharing, putting out my questions, concerns, and beliefs helps to sort out the fact from the fantasy. My PC education over the last couple of months yields a few things. One, there are no certainties in what we think is the stage of our disease. Two, being well-informed balances out the fear and impulsiveness to act. And three, finding a doc you trust, trusting your intuition, and allowing those trust to inform your plan of action is the course that yields most peace for me. There is little doubt, in my mind, that I wanted to be a good candidate for AS and buy time. I also believe that for a significant portion of men (even those eligible for AS) there will be an intervention. Yesterday the scales tipped towards not taking a risk of allowing a more aggressive disease to go undetected to a point of regret. I also know that intervention is no guarantee and has risks associated with it. In an odd way, this reminds me of my time on submarines. When, as an officer of the deck, I would give the order to \"make your depth 68 feet\" and we heading to periscope depth, it was time to focus and be all in on that commitment. Taking a submarine, particularly a missile boat, is a complex task to ensure safety and security. Making the decision to intervene, came with great study, awesome counsel and an internal check to ensure it was rational and not fear based. So the journey continues. Once again I appreciate everyone's advice, questions, and shared resources. Life is good and today I will play walk 18holes and play golf. I intend to enjoy chasing the little white ball!. Denis",

      "Content": "Here are my thoughts and feelings on the PCRI conference. I attended the PCRI conference for the first time. I was struck by the number of men with advanced disease and pleasantly surprised by the number of men on AS and many with G3+4. The keynote folks had one theme and that is seeking docs with high expertise. Caution on using someone who is a part time prostate doc, or said differently more focused on all urologic issues. The point was made there are 2000 published papers on prostate annually and there is no way a doc can keep up with all the literature unless they focus. I was also surprised by the facts that pathologists have a 30% intra and inter-rater reliability error rate, including Epstein. Epstein was asked does he look at all slides that come into JH. He had a tentative answer that if his signature was on it \u0093I should have looked at it\u0094 That did not give me a warm fuzzy. One statement, by one of the lead docs, was made that if your trust your Uro and he trusts the pathologist you should also. One interesting study was done in the UK, protect study, recently reported no sig diff in the 10-year survival rate of a purely random assignment of 1500 men to AS, Surgery, and radiation. They also reported that 40 % of the AS group had intervention within 10 years. That also means 60% of the AS men had no intervention and 60% of the other two groups had an unnecessary intervention. The presenters were critical of their field from a patient focus perspective and a bias towards their specialty for intervention. Many of the men I met had poor experiences with at least one doctor, some a few. Also, the danger of biopsy was discussed at length. Sepsis is a real threat and I met at least four guys who had it and were gravely ill. Many of the docs were discussing the overuse of biopsy. Many of the sessions and vendors were more about advanced stage cancer. Not one presentation or vendor or breakout group on surgery. Genomics was discussed a lot and many felt it and gene therapies are the future. I attended three AS sessions and the theme I gathered from most of the guys was a tug of war between acting too soon and not acting soon enough. However, there were many long term AS guys who said this feeling will pass. Virtually every guy who is new at this had genomic testing like Polaris, Oncotype or decipher. Most of the seasoned guys do 3-month PSA and periodic Doppler ultrasound or t3 MRI. Annual biopsy is on the decline. PSA doubling time seems to be the big warning sign. There was very little reference to Dr. Klotz\u0092s work in Canada. Bias seems to be the big threat to managing this disease. Bias by docs and patients. We need to be educated on our disease, be assertive in talking with our docs and at some point, trust our docs or if we can\u0092t get another doc. There was much discussion on diet and exercise. Common themes on diet were plant based, many guys went vegetarian, and low carb and eliminate dairy. Everyone seemed to agree that meat is out. I found the conference informative and supportive. I am glad I went. I am not sure anything dramatic happened for me. I am more confident in my current state and current thinking. I do believe many men on AS will have an intervention. There was one guy who shared after 7years he had a successful intervention and that intervention was not available when he was first diagnosed, so the AS delay worked in his favor. It was great to be around a bunch of guys in the same boat (800 attendees) and to have a variety of docs there to explain aspects of this disease. There were about 1/3 of guys with their spouses. It was a good investment and I may go back next year.",

I was going to see Patel, I think he is over 11,000 RP now and clearly the guy I would choose if RP was my choice. I was fortunate to See Dr. Biagioli at Florida hospital as part of my due diligence, and as the result choose HDR-BT. I am not suggesting this is right for you. I am suggesting that for me, once I spoke with Dr. B, the right choice for me became clear. I researched and saw numerous docs over a six month period to get the info I needed to be clear about the treatment plan I would choose. If you haven't seen an RO, Dr. B is awesome and has done thousands of HDR BTs. I wish you well in your decision making. Denis",

      "Content": "So I was surprised to learn that the meds I was prescribed for Urine flow may negatively affect glaucoma! What surprised me the most is both docs (Uro and Ophthalmologist) take extensive med and drug history. Apparently, neither looked at it. I discovered the issue by accident. I called my eye doc, and the good news is I have open angle glaucoma and the alpha-blocker is not an issue, more for those with closed angle. As the result, I stopped taking the Alfuzosin, about a week ago and see no change in my urinary pattern. Anyone know how long it takes to stop working? So if you have Glaucoma and are taking BPH meds call your ophthalmologist. Denis",

      "Content": "Thanks for the comments. We are using decipher to validate the current belief that there is no urgency to act. If the Decipher indicates a lower probability of disease progression (my words), we will go down the AS route. Their protocol is quarterly PSA/exam and then we will do a second multi parametric MRI and probably the second biopsy in the next 6 months. My first biopsy had complications so we need the prostate to calm down. I also may partake in a study where they do whole body scans. Not sure the study intent yet. The journey continues! Denis",

      "Content": "At times I have worried about my cancer. Did the treatment work, will it return, etc. ? What is clear to me is these are all fear-based thoughts. No facts to support them just a negative projection into the future. There is a great spiritual song \u0093fear is a liar!\u0094 that brings me back to reality. I just started rereading Dr. Walsh's 4th edition book and was struck by the frequency he uses the word \u0093cure\u0094. It got me to thinking about could I be cured? What is clear is my fear of reoccurrence and my hope for a cure are both guesses, neither has any proof today. So, what not live in the hopeful state? It is the holiday season, and many are celebrating a new life, and hope for the gift of life. There couldn\u0092t be a better time to choose life, choose hopefulness, and I mean really shift one\u0092s perspective to the positive. For me, this shift has a responsibility to act hopefully, talk with hopeful words, be grateful for the gift of treatment that will cure my cancer and so on. We really have the choice, today, to be a shining light to those around us or a vacuum that sucks the life out of everyone. I have really become aware of how much PC can affect those around me. In particular, my wife who lost her first husband to cancer. I have a responsibility to her, to our love to be a beacon of hope, even in times of doubt. I have to watch my tendency to get self-centered when the thoughts or SEs get me down that my behavior does not negatively affect those around me. We have the power to give ourselves and those we care about a great gift this holiday season, the gift of hope! Let\u0092s double our efforts to be that beacon, to love with all our beings, to go out of our way to bring peace to those who love us. I wish all of you a hopeful holiday season! Peace Denis",

      "Content": "Here are my thoughts and feelings on the PCRI conference. I attended the PCRI conference for the first time. I was struck by the number of men with advanced disease and pleasantly surprised by the number of men on AS and many with G3+4. The keynote folks had one theme and that is seeking docs with high expertise. Caution on using someone who is a part time prostate doc, or said differently more focused on all urologic issues. The point was made there are 2000 published papers on prostate annually and there is no way a doc can keep up with all the literature unless they focus. I was also surprised by the facts that pathologists have a 30% intra and inter-rater reliability error rate, including Epstein. Epstein was asked does he look at all slides that come into JH. He had a tentative answer that if his signature was on it \u0093I should have looked at it\u0094 That did not give me a warm fuzzy. One statement, by one of the lead docs, was made that if your trust your Uro and he trusts the pathologist you should also. One interesting study was done in the UK, protect study, recently reported no sig diff in the 10-year survival rate of a purely random assignment of 1500 men to AS, Surgery, and radiation. They also reported that 40 % of the AS group had intervention within 10 years. That also means 60% of the AS men had no intervention and 60% of the other two groups had an unnecessary intervention. The presenters were critical of their field from a patient focus perspective and a bias towards their specialty for intervention. Many of the men I met had poor experiences with at least one doctor, some a few. Also, the danger of biopsy was discussed at length. Sepsis is a real threat and I met at least four guys who had it and were gravely ill. Many of the docs were discussing the overuse of biopsy. Many of the sessions and vendors were more about advanced stage cancer. Not one presentation or vendor or breakout group on surgery. Genomics was discussed a lot and many felt it and gene therapies are the future. I attended three AS sessions and the theme I gathered from most of the guys was a tug of war between acting too soon and not acting soon enough. However, there were many long term AS guys who said this feeling will pass. Virtually every guy who is new at this had genomic testing like Polaris, Oncotype or decipher. Most of the seasoned guys do 3-month PSA and periodic Doppler ultrasound or t3 MRI. Annual biopsy is on the decline. PSA doubling time seems to be the big warning sign. There was very little reference to Dr. Klotz\u0092s work in Canada. Bias seems to be the big threat to managing this disease. Bias by docs and patients. We need to be educated on our disease, be assertive in talking with our docs and at some point, trust our docs or if we can\u0092t get another doc. There was much discussion on diet and exercise. Common themes on diet were plant based, many guys went vegetarian, and low carb and eliminate dairy. Everyone seemed to agree that meat is out. I found the conference informative and supportive. I am glad I went. I am not sure anything dramatic happened for me. I am more confident in my current state and current thinking. I do believe many men on AS will have an intervention. There was one guy who shared after 7years he had a successful intervention and that intervention was not available when he was first diagnosed, so the AS delay worked in his favor. It was great to be around a bunch of guys in the same boat (800 attendees) and to have a variety of docs there to explain aspects of this disease. There were about 1/3 of guys with their spouses. It was a good investment and I may go back next year.",

My Uro still thought I might be a candidate for AS but ordered Decipher genomic test which came back unfavorable. So treatment is warranted. As to which treatment, that is the really tough decision.

I asked my primary care doctor to request a PSA even though it wasn't in his original order, and in 4 months my PSA rose once again, this time to 9.77. Even though I'm not happy about having surgery in a few weeks if I was on AS this would stress me out to no end. I'm sufficiently stressed with the upcoming surgery! Is there any information that correlates PSA with the Gleason grade found? Stress is difficult. I wish you some peace these next days. I am hearing a lot of guys saying their PSA is not necessarily a linear change, more a bouncing number. This weekend I have met many guys on AS for many years and I am choosing to look at it as delayed treatment. Maybe they will perfect things like laser ablation or invent something new. Again I wish you well. Denis",

I was going to see Patel, I think he is over 11,000 RP now and clearly the guy I would choose if RP was my choice. I was fortunate to See Dr. Biagioli at Florida hospital as part of my due diligence, and as the result choose HDR-BT. I am not suggesting this is right for you. I am suggesting that for me, once I spoke with Dr. B, the right choice for me became clear. I researched and saw numerous docs over a six month period to get the info I needed to be clear about the treatment plan I would choose. If you haven't seen an RO, Dr. B is awesome and has done thousands of HDR BTs. I wish you well in your decision making. Denis",

      "Content": "I have cancer in my body and my job is to keep it out of my spirit! The shock of cancer can only be understood by those who have it. I have known many who had cancer and felt empathy for them but did not get the gut-wrenching shock until my doctor said, \u201cyou have cancer!\u201d My mind went to almost shut down as he talked, and I am sure I heard little of what he had to say. The first impact of cancer was a profound loneliness and a guttery level of fear that I have never experienced. The early days of being diagnosed were a mess of ignorance and fear, two forces which can do a number on your mind and spirit. I could distract the fear though information, reading and talking with others. However, there were those times like sleepless nights or just a flash of the possible treatments that could send me into a tailspin. Sure, there was comfort in reading other guys success stories and with that come the unsuccessful stories which seemed to overwhelm the success stories. Cancer is a lonely disease. Support groups, forums and the like take the edge off and there are just times that the Dis-Ease sets in in your heart and drags you down. The other force which makes it so difficult is the slowness of treatment decisions and how the medical system moves. I find it discomforting to hear \u201ctake you times, no rush, etc.\u201d While this is good advice to learn and understand your options, the fact that months must go by to get to a treatment decision is not comforting. Having cancer is a physical ailment and if I am not careful it will become a spiritual and mental ailment also. This is when fear overwhelms logic and trust. I have had hours of deep confusion and near despair because I let cancer get in my mind and in my spirit. And those around me also suffer due to my discomfort. It is critical for me and those around me that I show up strong and ready to be the best I can be today with cancer. I cannot change that fact, but I can choose how I show up today. I cannot predict how my disease will manifest, how effective the treatment will be and what side effects will happen in the future. But I can decide to be as healthy as I can be today. I can help those around me, be grateful for the life I have today. Yes, I can choose to be grateful with cancer! I have already met dozens of guys who share the disease and we have laughed and worried together, have share advice and experiences, and shared hope and courage. As Movember approaches and our disease will get some awareness, I am committed to keeping my spirit grateful, to be clear about being the best I can be today, and to move forward on the cancer journey.",

      "Content": "Had an awesome first visit with Yale Urologist, Dr. Leapman, an Associate Professor. He spent nearly an hour and a half with us and listened and answered our questions with expertise and compassion. The Dean of pathology revised my biopsy and identified a very small amount of 3+4, less than 5%. We are in agreement to AS and he has ordered a decipher test. He does not think this will change our near-term plan but wants to confirm their belief that AS is appropriate. We discussed interventions and if needed I am starting to think surgery is the best options. While there was some negative news it is by far the best doctor visit I have ever had. So the journey continues. Feeling good! Denis",

      "Content": "Today I was reading a few new guys posts and the wonderful feedback they were receiving. I reflected on my journey to date and was struck by the difficulty I had and time it took to get to a decision. What factors affected my decision? First my decision path was not linear, not rational at times, and certainly influenced by fear. I also was influenced by doctors, fellow PC patients, books I read, articles I read, conferences, retreats, and significantly by the journeys of those that went before me. What is most intriguing to me is how I waffled and even decided early on that I just wanted it out! This wanting it out closed my mind to other treatment possibilities. Being told I had cancer in me was a shock and naturally wanted it out! My first two docs were Urologists and surgeons and they recommended what they do. My urologist at Yale was amazing and recommended surgery. I wrestled with that because he was such a nice guy. Fortunately, I met an oncologist that was equally nice and offered alternatives that I became open to exploring. The forums I participate are dominated by surgery guys, or at least it feels that way. All very helpful, openly share their experience. So, another influence towards RP. The non-RP treatments for intermediate risk guys is infrequently discussed. I find myself comfortable with my decision to do HDR Brachytherapy. My decision centers around ease of the procedure, the simplicity of post-recovery and low impact side effects for most. I will say there have been a couple of times I wondered if this seems so good, why aren\u0092t there many others choosing it as a monotherapy? I have learned there is less money to be made for the docs and hospitals with HDRBT, so that influences the frequency of use. One of the confounding facts I came across was that HDRBT has declined in use due to the da Vinci RP and the increase in active surveillance. I get the AS but not the RP influence. Sure, da Vinci is better than open, but it is still major surgery with 6+weeks of recovery. Again, I am not arguing with anyone but myself. Clearly, for me, the road to the decision was long (6 months), complicated (saw 5 different docs), and complicated (much to learn). My one wish for new guys is to stay open-minded, take the time deeply learn about options and determine what\u0092s most important to you, and then make a most informed decision. Patience is something I did not seem to have but learned to accept the journey will be what it is and I should not try to push the rope! Thanks, and happy holidays everyone! Denis",

      "Content": "Today I was reading a few new guys posts and the wonderful feedback they were receiving. I reflected on my journey to date and was struck by the difficulty I had and time it took to get to a decision. What factors affected my decision? First my decision path was not linear, not rational at times, and certainly influenced by fear. I also was influenced by doctors, fellow PC patients, books I read, articles I read, conferences, retreats, and significantly by the journeys of those that went before me. What is most intriguing to me is how I waffled and even decided early on that I just wanted it out! This wanting it out closed my mind to other treatment possibilities. Being told I had cancer in me was a shock and naturally wanted it out! My first two docs were Urologists and surgeons and they recommended what they do. My urologist at Yale was amazing and recommended surgery. I wrestled with that because he was such a nice guy. Fortunately, I met an oncologist that was equally nice and offered alternatives that I became open to exploring. The forums I participate are dominated by surgery guys, or at least it feels that way. All very helpful, openly share their experience. So, another influence towards RP. The non-RP treatments for intermediate risk guys is infrequently discussed. I find myself comfortable with my decision to do HDR Brachytherapy. My decision centers around ease of the procedure, the simplicity of post-recovery and low impact side effects for most. I will say there have been a couple of times I wondered if this seems so good, why aren\u0092t there many others choosing it as a monotherapy? I have learned there is less money to be made for the docs and hospitals with HDRBT, so that influences the frequency of use. One of the confounding facts I came across was that HDRBT has declined in use due to the da Vinci RP and the increase in active surveillance. I get the AS but not the RP influence. Sure, da Vinci is better than open, but it is still major surgery with 6+weeks of recovery. Again, I am not arguing with anyone but myself. Clearly, for me, the road to the decision was long (6 months), complicated (saw 5 different docs), and complicated (much to learn). My one wish for new guys is to stay open-minded, take the time deeply learn about options and determine what\u0092s most important to you, and then make a most informed decision. Patience is something I did not seem to have but learned to accept the journey will be what it is and I should not try to push the rope! Thanks, and happy holidays everyone! Denis",

      "Content": "A month ago, I sat in a urologist\u2019s office, whom I had only one brief meeting with prior, and he said, \u201cwe have mixed news\u2026 you have cancer.\u201d Not sure I heard too much after that. Unfortunately, my wife was out of town, as we expected it to be nothing. I did hear the Urologist quickly review the options and clearly thought surgery was my best bet and he could do it before we left for Florida in October. I then went to schedule follow up meeting with him and could not get an appointment for 5 weeks. I left the office bewildered, alone and full of questions. He spent 15 minutes with me. Shock was the feeling I experienced the next few days. I had to call my wife and tell her and her first husband died of cancer. That was the hardest call I have ever made. What made it hard was I was lost, adrift in the sea of cancer. So, I embarked on learning about the disease and options. A good friend had just been through a scary bout with cancer and she recommends Yale-Smilow, which I considered and choose them. My data was in the low-risk category, I was to learn. Low PSA, low volume of cancer in the biopsy. I had a fusion biopsy after a multiparametric MRI, which showed a lesion. The biopsy focused on that and took 12 other samples. All came back Gleason 6, 3 or 4 positive cores out of 13, two <30% and 2 < 5%. Yale redid the pathology and believe one had a very small amount of G7 <5%. My Yale urologist spent nearly 1.5 hours with us and balanced the science with empathy. My wife and I came away feeling we were in good hands. He advocated for AS and wanted Decipher test to inform the decision. I am now waiting for that and continuing my study. I can say that the emotional roller-coaster is still twisting and turning. One day I feel good about AS, the next I think I should have an intervention. Based on what I have learned to date, I do believe AS is appropriate, even though John Hopkins protocol would probably not take me but other leading institutions world. I also believe there is a 50-50 chance I will have an intervention at some point. And there in lies the risk/reward bet! Metastasis is the real enemy, in my opinion. Side effects re the price of admission to prevent metastasis. The docs are very unsure when intervention is needed. Many have thoughts and philosophies about when and they always say, \u201cit is up to you!\u201d What I know: I have cancer, it is low risk, it is growing slowly. I am healthy and relatively young. My family history has no long-life males, I am the oldest surviving male at 65. I know interventions do not mean cure, it can come back. I know the medical community is working hard at new research and there will be better and better treatments as time goes by. What I feel: I have real confidence in my Yale Urologist, I feel he is balanced and clearly has my best interests in mind. I feel he will be clear about treatment when needed. I feel there is a low risk of metastasis getting away from us. And I worry about this! I am most worried about incontinence. So, lost in the sea of cancer is not totally accurate anymore. I now am in a lifeboat with a crude navigation chart. In Navy terminology, I am on a shakedown cruise trying to get comfortable with all the realities of PC and treatment options. I know I cannot sail alone and that my docs and support groups make up my crew. I know there will be rough water ahead and I know I will be ready! I hope I can see the beauty in the world while I am on this cruise. I have a wonderful life and I have cancer. It is not I have a wonderful life BUT I have cancer. Life is meant to be lived! Thanks for helping me along this journey! Denis",

      "Content": "Interesting. for me I really thought AS would be a viable plan until the second opinion of biopsy showed a small amount of 3+4. For me, it was a risk-reward choice. I also believe (and I may be wrong) that cancer progresses, however slow. My thought about AS was a delaying tactic, not a lifelong decision. I hoped I could delay intervention so the scientific community could advance practice. But the 3+4 changed that approach. I still think AS is a viable option for certain men and that it is critical to have a very ACTIVE approach. Denis",

      "Content": "I have cancer in my body and my job is to keep it out of my spirit! The shock of cancer can only be understood by those who have it. I have known many who had cancer and felt empathy for them but did not get the gut-wrenching shock until my doctor said, \u201cyou have cancer!\u201d My mind went to almost shut down as he talked, and I am sure I heard little of what he had to say. The first impact of cancer was a profound loneliness and a guttery level of fear that I have never experienced. The early days of being diagnosed were a mess of ignorance and fear, two forces which can do a number on your mind and spirit. I could distract the fear though information, reading and talking with others. However, there were those times like sleepless nights or just a flash of the possible treatments that could send me into a tailspin. Sure, there was comfort in reading other guys success stories and with that come the unsuccessful stories which seemed to overwhelm the success stories. Cancer is a lonely disease. Support groups, forums and the like take the edge off and there are just times that the Dis-Ease sets in in your heart and drags you down. The other force which makes it so difficult is the slowness of treatment decisions and how the medical system moves. I find it discomforting to hear \u201ctake you times, no rush, etc.\u201d While this is good advice to learn and understand your options, the fact that months must go by to get to a treatment decision is not comforting. Having cancer is a physical ailment and if I am not careful it will become a spiritual and mental ailment also. This is when fear overwhelms logic and trust. I have had hours of deep confusion and near despair because I let cancer get in my mind and in my spirit. And those around me also suffer due to my discomfort. It is critical for me and those around me that I show up strong and ready to be the best I can be today with cancer. I cannot change that fact, but I can choose how I show up today. I cannot predict how my disease will manifest, how effective the treatment will be and what side effects will happen in the future. But I can decide to be as healthy as I can be today. I can help those around me, be grateful for the life I have today. Yes, I can choose to be grateful with cancer! I have already met dozens of guys who share the disease and we have laughed and worried together, have share advice and experiences, and shared hope and courage. As Movember approaches and our disease will get some awareness, I am committed to keeping my spirit grateful, to be clear about being the best I can be today, and to move forward on the cancer journey.",

      "Content": "I have cancer in my body and my job is to keep it out of my spirit! The shock of cancer can only be understood by those who have it. I have known many who had cancer and felt empathy for them but did not get the gut-wrenching shock until my doctor said, \u201cyou have cancer!\u201d My mind went to almost shut down as he talked, and I am sure I heard little of what he had to say. The first impact of cancer was a profound loneliness and a guttery level of fear that I have never experienced. The early days of being diagnosed were a mess of ignorance and fear, two forces which can do a number on your mind and spirit. I could distract the fear though information, reading and talking with others. However, there were those times like sleepless nights or just a flash of the possible treatments that could send me into a tailspin. Sure, there was comfort in reading other guys success stories and with that come the unsuccessful stories which seemed to overwhelm the success stories. Cancer is a lonely disease. Support groups, forums and the like take the edge off and there are just times that the Dis-Ease sets in in your heart and drags you down. The other force which makes it so difficult is the slowness of treatment decisions and how the medical system moves. I find it discomforting to hear \u201ctake you times, no rush, etc.\u201d While this is good advice to learn and understand your options, the fact that months must go by to get to a treatment decision is not comforting. Having cancer is a physical ailment and if I am not careful it will become a spiritual and mental ailment also. This is when fear overwhelms logic and trust. I have had hours of deep confusion and near despair because I let cancer get in my mind and in my spirit. And those around me also suffer due to my discomfort. It is critical for me and those around me that I show up strong and ready to be the best I can be today with cancer. I cannot change that fact, but I can choose how I show up today. I cannot predict how my disease will manifest, how effective the treatment will be and what side effects will happen in the future. But I can decide to be as healthy as I can be today. I can help those around me, be grateful for the life I have today. Yes, I can choose to be grateful with cancer! I have already met dozens of guys who share the disease and we have laughed and worried together, have share advice and experiences, and shared hope and courage. As Movember approaches and our disease will get some awareness, I am committed to keeping my spirit grateful, to be clear about being the best I can be today, and to move forward on the cancer journey.",

      "Content": "Well, I thought I would start my HDR brachytherapy 1/2/18 but just found out my RO wants a colonoscopy prior to treatment. So everything gets pushed a few weeks. My journey started in last August. I sought a few opinions, visited a few docs, read a great deal and learned much from you all. It will be six months from diagnosis to treatment. I am an action-oriented guy and maneuvering this disease has tested me for sure. On the brighter side, I am grateful that I went down this winding road because it brought me to a treatment, that I wasn't even aware of the last August. My first uro wanted to schedule surgery the day he told me I had cancer! Here is an interesting coincidence. In my foursome yesterday on the final day of a two-day tournament, 2 guys had RP and one was going to the VA after the round because they think he has PC. So all four of us are int eh club. I explained HDR brachytherapy and the two RP guys wished they were presented that option. I don't suggest anything to anyone else. We each value different things. HDRBT is my choice. P.S. in our foursome we captured the top three spots in the tourney. I cam in second, it was a good day!",

      "Content": "Yes, the colonoscopy is mainly to ensure there are no complications with eh radiation treatment. As to bias, I find that comment on this forums occasionally. We are all biased. Decision making is defining the outcome priorities that are the goal, decerning best path to gather information to support decision making and discern the options to yield the best path to achieve the outcome. PC has three most common treatments, each of us will choose based on the info we gather. In the end, WE choose, based on our beliefs and values, which is clearly biased. I have been in this process for nearly 6 months and it was a meandering path. A few weeks ago surgery seemed the best choice but with new information and a new doc that we like, the decision shifted and it feels good and solid for our goals. Bias is often used in a negative connotation and I humbly suggest it may be offensive to some. it is gee if I am biased and I making the wrong decision. All decisions about treating PC are biased and I suggest if we have done our due diligence it can be a positive bias. I have met many men over the last months who abdicated to their docs, so no bias, and regretted not taking time to learn more. I do not know what the percentages of treatment choices are but it seems there is a strong bias towards surgery on these forums. Clearly more posts about surgery than other treatments. I am happy for those who choose surgery to have fellows to share their experience. I do not think each of those who choose surgery was biased in a negative way. They arrived at their decision in a way that felt right to them. While I am happy with my path and decision, I still wonder occasionally about the choice. I have little doubt choosing treatment seems to be the hardest part of this disease. And I am certain the choice I made is the right one for me and my family. So I choose HDR BT. Denis",

What I am learning, the hard way is to watch my expectations. My genomics test came back less than favorable, which was a let down in a way but helped tip the decision scales to treat, which was the reason we did the test. I do hope your test comes out favorable. Stay busy to keep your mind off PC, easier said than done. Be well. Denis",

As ASA suggested it is not new, newer as a monotherapy. One of the big questions I had to my doc was if this is so easy and effective, why aren't more folks doing it? He said with a smile there is not much money to be made. Two treatments and done. Statistically, it is as good as other primary treatments. If there is anything I can do to help let me know. It took me about 5 months to make a decision, and once we truly understood the options it was an easy choice for us. I am not suggesting this is the right answer for everyone but do your research and the right choice will appear. Denis",

      "Content": "My journey to date concerning PC has been typical based on what I hear from other men. However, during the journey, nothing feels typical. This was my first serious medical condition at age 65. I have been living a healthy lifestyle for decades and felt good about life. When the doctor told me \u0093I have mixed news, you have cancer\u0085\u0094 my spirit shifted, my inner being was bitch slapped! These last seven months have been quite the trip. I saw a post today from a new guy about treatment decision and boy could I connect with his concern, his fear, and his panic to act! My first Uro was willing to schedule surgery during that first visit! I am usually a very decisive man, let's get on with it and take action has served me well my entire life. As a retired Submarine Officer, we were trained and paid to act. What I had to shift in my mind, in my being was that researching, learning, and investigating are actions. I would suggest it is the most important form of action. PC is a complicated disease, treatments are varied, and individual needs and values play a big role in how to proceed. I needed time to sort through all of this. Even though the number of delays I faced seemed, at the time, to be unbearable, the truth is those delays gave me time to settle into my situation. It did not take long for me to get the implications of having cancer. It is simple to understand that most of us will not die from this disease. However, I detest the comment, \u0093well if you are going to have cancer, have PC!\u0094 Sure, there are more devastating diseases, PC is serious enough for me. My journey, to date, is one of shock, fear, confusion, clarity, more confusion, and finally clarity. We need not minimize the shock. Cancer is a bad word! Then there is the double shock, once one learns of the side effects and treatment complications some experience. But for this patient, the biggest dilemma is the unknown state of one\u0092s disease. We have our Gleason scores; PSA and we regularly hear about post-treatment upgrades and reoccurrence. This is what cancer is about. Yes, that\u0092s the elephant in the room, will it come back? What I know at this stage is that is a question that has no answer and there is nothing I can do to address it, so I am going to stay the course, live life to its fullest and do the next right thing. My first treatment is next Tuesday. I am going the HDR BT route. Two treatments over two weeks. I am so at peace that it surprises me. I have many to thank for this current state. My wife and kids, friends who know my journey, PC friends who have shared their journeys/insights with me, the Docs who took their times to help educate me, and for these forums. I am sitting on a plane, listening to John Denver songs, on my way to ski with my oldest son. I just left Florida, where we live in the winter and where my amazing wife and I live a full life, my wife and are blessed with 7 kids between us and 7 grandkids! Life is awesome! Cancer tried to take that peace and gratitude from me and with your help, it did not win. I do not know what my PC journey will be but I know I have an amazing life and family friends who make life joyful. Let\u0092s not forget the goodness, keep cancer out of our spirits! I wish you all peace! Denis",

      "Content": "Got an unexpected call from my ROs office for a preop call. The nurse was great and went over everything in detail and it is pretty simple. I was caught off guard, in part, due to I have had PC out of my mind mostly for a couple of weeks. Having made the decision treatment I guess brought relief. And the call snapped me back to the reality that it is still there and needs to be treated. I am in a good place and actually want it to be over with. 7 months waiting is a long time for me. 10 days to first treatment and then two weeks later for the secind round. The procedure is pretty simple. Under general anesthesia, they insert the caterers in the peritoneum. Bring you back to consciousness and then in another lab insert the radiation source for a fixed amount of time. They then knock you out again and remove the caths. about a half day event, I am told. The only minor issue was the dates got screwed up and I have to cut my ski trip short by one day. I will be in Utah with my son for a couple days os skiing prior to the surgery. Glad this next phase of the journey is about to happen. Denis",

Some years ago, a friend shared with me about another disease I have a useful tool. Ask yourself two questions when you are fearful. What do I know and what do I think? Fear is often triggered by what we think not what we know. For many, it launches us into projecting the future and often it is dark future. However, we can focus on what we know which is more a cognitive process based on reality, which can lead to a more rational assessment of our current condition and the next steps we need to take, which can help us lead a more peaceful life today. Being in today is the goal, in my opinion. My experience with PC for the last almost 18 months were periods of shock, confusion, fear, understanding, decision making, treatment, and many more days of peace since treatment. I continue to find talking with other guys with PC very helpful. The gift of sharing your experience and letting newer guys know these phases are normal is a gift to self and to them! In the field of Alcoholism, there is a common belief that it is a three-fold disease of mind, body, and spirit and that a threefold recovery is needed. I suggest this is not too far off for us with PC. For most of us there are few body symptoms but once diagnosed many of us are challenged trying to understand, trying to make decisions, feeling alone at times, etc. I practice sharing, meditating, and trying to be there for other guys as part of my way of dealing with this disease and find it uplifting. I also continue to study this disease to be armed with facts. I have one friend with G9 who a great inspiration to me, as he goes through his road of treatments. I hope I give him some comfort in our sharing. I doubt that I will ever think getting PC was a good thing but clearly, there have been benefits of friends, of a self-awareness of how I need to show up to my family and friends, and a peacefulness most days because my clear goal is to live life today to the best of my ability. So today let\u0092s choose life and continue to support each other!",

      "Content": "Had a great preop meeting with RO. I will be doing two fractions of HDR-BT, 13.5 gy, two weeks apart. The procedure entails basically three steps. Under propofol, they will use a transrectal ultrasound to insert catheters, I think 20, into the prostate. They also will insert a urinary catheter for the procedure. I then will be awake for the insertion of the radiation probes. They will do an MRI to ensure the catheters are correctly placed and then the technician and physicist will inset the radiation source. I then will go back under and the catheters will be removed. Two weeks later the same procedure. Doc says to expect some urinary discomfort for a couple of weeks. The plan then is to monitor PSA drop over the next year or so. He warned me there could be a bounce in PSA. They are not sure why this occurs but also said bounce patients seem to do better. I am grateful for my doc, easy to talk to and I totally trust him. He has done over 1,000 HDRBTs. I am at peace and comfortable with this next phase of my health journey.",

If there is anything I can do ask. I live in Clermont. My first treatment was a non-event. Second I had more discomfort during the procedure and let them give me pain meds and that made it worst as I may be allergic to the pain meds. And the pain meds contributed to needing a cath for 12 hours. Other than that it was an easy procedure. I played golf the next day on both occasions. I did not have space oar and doc said not needed.

I was caught off guard, in part, due to I have had PC out of my mind mostly for a couple of weeks. Having made the decision treatment I guess brought relief. And the call snapped me back to the reality that it is still there and needs to be treated. I am in a good place and actually want it to be over with. 7 months waiting is a long time for me. 10 days to first treatment and then two weeks later for the secind round. The procedure is pretty simple. Under general anesthesia, they insert the caterers in the peritoneum. Bring you back to consciousness and then in another lab insert the radiation source for a fixed amount of time. They then knock you out again and remove the caths. about a half day event, I am told. The only minor issue was the dates got screwed up and I have to cut my ski trip short by one day. I will be in Utah with my son for a couple days os skiing prior to the surgery. Glad this next phase of the journey is about to happen. Denis",

Also does the supplement cause other damage has to be considered. It seems logical that how we fuel our bodies has an impact on health and healing. And research into PC always takes a very long time. For those of us in our sixties and seventies, the timeline for proving research may be too late to help us, so do we gamble a bit and try promising ideas? Thanks, guys for the thoughts. Denis",

      "Content": "great discussion. I have not been a supplement guy. The issue is the double edge sword. Does the supplement actually help or just delay? Depending on age delay may be a good thing. Also does the supplement cause other damage has to be considered. It seems logical that how we fuel our bodies has an impact on health and healing. And research into PC always takes a very long time. For those of us in our sixties and seventies, the timeline for proving research may be too late to help us, so do we gamble a bit and try promising ideas? Thanks, guys for the thoughts. Denis",

Second I had more discomfort during the procedure and let them give me pain meds and that made it worst as I may be allergic to the pain meds. And the pain meds contributed to needing a cath for 12 hours. Other than that it was an easy procedure. I played golf the next day on both occasions. I did not have space oar and doc said not needed.

      "Content": "On this day of gratitude, I find myself at peace and grateful for my life, my family, my friends, and my cancer! For me, I must accept all my life and be grateful, because if I am selective about what I am thankful for, my reservations hold me back from being truly grateful. Gratitude needs to be all in! Cancer has brought me many new friends, great docs and medical professionals, and allowed me to reconnect with the truly important things in life which include family friends and being of service to those I encounter each day. I have had the honor to share 1/1 my cancer journey with a handful of newly diagnosed guys and am very grateful for that. Many of you have supported me in times of confusion, for which I am extremely grateful. Gratitude is both a gift and a choice in my opinion. How I choose to look at my life in this moment is where I have power. I choose to be grateful for the many gifts and challenges. I choose to show up today grateful and show my gratitude to those I encounter. As I sit here this early Thanksgiving morning, reflecting on my life and the gifts I have, it is easy to be grateful. I wish you and your families a grateful day and thanks for being there for me and other guys! Peace Denis",

I have only been dealing with PC for 1 year and at times I let it darken my spirit and my thinking. I have been selfish and inconsiderate to those around me. I have allowed the disease to take away some of todays because I was worried about tomorrows. There are days when I read others posts and allow the darkness to creep back in. I feel the pain in love ones, the fear of those with the disease and I get it! We all deal with this disease in different ways and I am clear that what works best for most of us is sharing our journey, connecting with others and allowing our fears and pain to be out in the open. I also believe and am trying to practice not allowing this disease to take today from me and my friends and family. Cancer can be lonely and scary! I get trapped some days thinking about what might happen and it is usually a negative thought. Why don\u0092t we project positive outcomes, cures? Because of fear! I stumble across a great song lately called \u0093Fear is a liar!\u0094 That title is what I need to lean on. I have no clue what the future brings, never have and never will. However, when I look back at all the life hurdles I have faced, the outcomes were always way more positive than I projected. We have the power to be in today, in this moment and relish the gifts in front of us right now! I get some of us are really sick, and the treatments are hard, and I wish peace for each of you today. Let\u0092s be a force of good, of helping those around us live with dignity and gratitude today. We can look for goodness each moment and try to be there for others. Sure, there will be days of anxiety, sickness, pain, and worry. Let\u0092s try to shrink those to moments and look for the gifts, not the trials. Today I was experiencing some SEs and feeling sorry for myself. Then we played golf with my one son and later in the evening we had dinner with my 5 kids and 5 grandkids. Got to put the little ones on a merry go round, bought them ice cream and I just loved them. My kids were laughing and kidding each other, none of them was thinking about my cancer. I had the chance to see the awesome life I have with cancer. I am grateful for my life today and cancer is part of that I today I will not let it take my spirit! Together we can be strong and when needed lean on each other. Together we can learn together and help each other navigate this cancer journey. Together we can be a beacon of hope for those that come after us and a light of peace to those at the end stages. So today let us join together to say yes, we have cancer and we will not let it take our spirit, our peace of mind, and our ability to be the best men we can be for those around us!

      "Content": "My understanding and much discussion on this topic at the prostate conference are one PSA is the best measure we have and it is not perfect. Many guys have strong fluctuations in PSA levels. One guy shared he had swings as much as 10 points. PSA trend or doubling time may be the best indicator of progression. There was a lot of discussions and a presentation of prostatitius and its impact on PSA, so the other metric that may be important may be PSA density. Large prostates produce more PSA than small ones. So PSA / prostate size is something to watch and discuss with doc. virtually all men have an increasing size of their prostate as they age. Finally, once we know we have PC, we are now in the mode of monitoring signs of progression and indicators that action is needed. Often the action is more tests like doppler scans or MRI, and possibly follow up biopsies. Denis",

      "Content": "I am a few weeks post-HDR BT. I choose it due to the simplicity of the procedure, the success rate and the minimal SEs. The first procedure was a non-event. I was sedated, catheters inserted (15) in the perineum. Then I was awake for an hour or so and during this time they inserted leads n the catheters and then the radiation. I was then repeated to remove the catheters. I woke feeling good and once I urinated was able to go home. I played golf the next day. I bottom was a bit sore for a week. The second treatment was the same except a bit more discomfort in the perineum. I had no pain meds with the first round. While I was awake int he second round they gave me pain meds and I found them to be worse than the pain. The biggest post-op issue I had was urinary burning for a few days. The second round the doc had me double up on AZO (an OTC med) and there was little to no burning. The other minor SE is I cannot stop urination when standing, I have to wait until the bladder is nearly empty. Doc says this will pass in a couple of weeks. Again I played golf the next day after. I am now as normal as I get. I take Alfuzosin to help urination but I am not sure I need it. If you would like to talk about this, private message me and I will share my phone number. I am absolutely pleased with my treatment choice and I am certain it is a good choice for many others. I wish you well. Denis",

One peer-reviewed article offered \"RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 5 years (range, 0.2-15.3).

BC at 5 years for Group I patients was 96%, for Group II 88%, and for Group III patients 69%. CSS at 5 years was 100% in Group I, 99% in Group II, and 95% in Group III patients. In univariate and multiple regression analyses for BC, risk group, stage, iPSA, and GS were significant in predicting failure. However, age, follow-up interval, and ADT did not.\" I have read this article before but never focused on \" and cause-specific survival (CSS) was 96% and 92%\" I have not seen CSS mentioned in any other discussion. Here is a definition: cause-specific survival listen (kawz-speh-SIH-fik ser-VY-vul) The length of time from either the date of diagnosis or the start of treatment for a disease, such as cancer, to the date of death from the disease. Patients who die from causes unrelated to the disease are not counted in this measurement. In a clinical trial, measuring the cause-specific survival is one way to see how well a new treatment works. I also found form the ACS Survival rates for prostate cancer According to the most recent data, when including all stages of prostate cancer: The 5-year relative survival rate is 99% The 10-year relative survival rate is 98% The 15-year relative survival rate is 96% So the news or odds are pretty good for the vast majority of folks. For those of us who caught it early, I suspect the odds are a bit better. My point was to remind myself and others that we have a good chance of many years of disease-free living. I had a terrific day yesterday and am feeling extra encouraged. Ran a sub 30 minute 5K and shot 78 on the golf course. These are numbers that make me feel great! Have a great day all.",
