      "Content": "Hi guys, Thanks google let me find this place. I have been browsing this forum for few months and learnt a lots in here. Back to my story, my partner is turning 44 in this Aug. His abnormal pas was picked up in 06/16 (psa 2.9, fpsa 0.39, psa ratio 13%), we were referred to urologist, repeated PSA in 11/16 (psa 3, fpsa 0.31, ratio 10%), MRI done nothing detective (PI RADS 2), DRE negative. The latest PSA was done in this March (PSA 3, fpsa 0.26, ratio 9%). The current urologist suggested monitoring every 3 months. But I did a lots of reserach and understand PC is curable if detected at early stage. So we changed to a new specialist, he is A/professor (i think he would be more knowledgable and more experienced compared with normal specialists?!)and consulted with him on this Monday, he strongly recommended BIOPSY to my partner because of two red flags \u0096 low ratio and high psa at his age and if biopsy comes negative, it will double power to clear our mind. The biopsy is scheduled for next Wed. I still very worry even though he is very honest to us said 20%-30% chance of PC. Is 20-30% chance is still high possibility? My mind keeps thinking what would happen on the day we picked up the result. I feel very nervous and stressed, I can't focus on my work and life at all. On the other hand, I have to hide my emotion in front of people....",
