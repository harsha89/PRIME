      "Content": "It was the urologist who told us the stage T2b. And no, he had never had a PSA test and never a biopsy...ever. Problems with urination started two or three years ago....kept getting worse....went to regular physician in March....who found his PSA at 51.7 and sent him to urologist. Sometimes it is still hard to believe this is really happening. The biopsy looks so bad.....and he feels so good......so far. We both feel we have very good doctors and trust them....so that is not a problem. I have just researched so much lately....and wonder how long this \"good\" can last.",

He had 40 radiation treatments also is getting a calcium infusion every 4 to 8 weeks to strengthen bones current PSA is 0.1 age 74 Doctor said his stage was T2b......but I thought since the cancer is not confined to the prostate...it was stage 4 ????
