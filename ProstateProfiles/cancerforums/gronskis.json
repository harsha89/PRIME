      "Content": "I have just recently joined this forum, and I would like to share my story, and ask for help or information with an outstanding question: I have two brothers both diagnosed with Prostate Cancer, so I have been watching my PSA levels carefully, since 2002. In late 2013, my PSA level rose to 4.90 ug/L, and my family doctor referred me to a urologist, who subsequently arranged a biopsy. February, 2014: My first TRUS biopsy detected a very low volume of low grade (Gleason 6) adenocarcinoma in 2 of 12 cores taken. My medical situation was judged to be of very low risk and I opted for an active surveillance program, under the supervision of Dr. Laurence Klotz at Sunnybrook Hospital, in Toronto Canada. This involved PSA testing every 3 months and another biopsy within one year. November, 2014: A second TRUS biopsy found no adenocarcinoma in any of 12 cores taken. This seemed to be very good news, except that my PSA was rising rapidly and projecting a doubling time of about two years. September 2015: In view of the rapid rate of increase in my PSA, Dr. Klotz ordered an MRI of the prostate. June 2016: The MRI of the prostate was done, and indicated an 'equivocal' (ambiguous or indeterminate) area of 7X13mm which, according to the radiologist, 'did not have the typical appearance of cancer'. August 10, 2016: An MRI guided TRUS biopsy was performed. This technology allows cores to be extracted specifically from the 'equivocal' area, as opposed to the simple TRUS procedure (which provides relatively poor imaging and amounts to an almost random sampling of cores from the various sectors of the prostate). August 24, 2016: Dr. Klotz reported that no adenocarcinoma was found in any of the 5 cores taken from the 'equivocal' area. This is certainly the best news I could have received. However, my PSA has almost doubled in the past two years, and the increases over the past months can be described as exponential. The most current value, July 19, 2016 was 11.44ug/L. I have been researching the (non-cancerous) reasons for elevated PSA, but I cannot find anything that seems to apply to my situation. My concern is that adenocarcinoma may still be lurking within the prostate, and has not yet been discovered in the three biopsies. My question to the forum members is where do I go from here? What are the next logical steps, medical tests etc. that I should take to determine what is actually causing these precipitous increases in PSA levels.",
