      "Content": "Hi all. I'm new to this forum but not to this site or cancerous diseases. I'm currently personally battling Non Hodgkin's lymphoma, DLBCL. All the info is in my signature. I just found out my dad has prostate cancer( after losing my mother to DLBCL 20 years ago) good times huh? Well my dads doctor said he wasn't going to do surgery but most likely would do radiation and or irradiated prongs inserted near the site. His doc said it's a small \"spot\" a d was caught really early. Can anyone here give me greater detail on these treatments as I know nothing about this cancer I'm more lymphoma expert. Thanks -Sean",
