    "Content": "Hi! (My username is a definite psuedonymn, I'm an active member of the community already but my daughter is also on here and I don't want her to know I lost my job) Recently, I have lost my job meaning my health insurance. I've fallen on very tough financial times and I know that ordering medication online isn't the smartest thing but I don't have another option and I would be paying half price to order Flomax online rather than keep trying to buy it. I am desperate. Please, can someone tell me if generics are as effective as regular meds? this is where I am ordering the medicine if it helps canadapharmacyrx.com/generic-flomax.html thank you! (and please, if youve figured out who i am on my *real* account, don't call me out..my daughter doesn't need the stress of knowing I've lost my job)",
