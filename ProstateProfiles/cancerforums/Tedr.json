      "Content": "I have not taken either of these, but my urologist prescribed Flomax. I am going to give Naka Prostate a try first. It is compound of saw palmetto and other natural bits that are reputed to be effective. I doubt the natural product will work. The Mayo clinic site says there was a study that showed saw palmetto was helpful, and a later study that showed it was no more effective than a placebo. I consider my urinary problems to be mild so I'm ok with experimenting with saw palmetto. If there is no improvement I can always get Flomax. My wife is a great believer in natural remedies and she always wants me to try natural products before prescription medications. This time I am willing to follow her advice because for me there isn't much risk at this point. Like you I am interested in what others might have to say from their experiences.",

      "Content": "Hi: I'm a new member and I have been reading posts for a little while. I am very impressed by the willingness of forum members to give advice and the level of knowledge being shared. I have had quite a few PSA results over the years which are listed below. I have had many DREs which have all been normal. That is, no nodules or hardness have been detected. One Uro described my prostate in 2006 as \"enormous\" (whatever that means). I had a biopsy in 2006 and no abnormal cells were found. I am 67 years old, 5'8\" tall and weigh 155 lbs. if that matters at all. Here are my numbers over the years. I hope this is not overkill...

My new family physician referred me to a new Urologist who is recommending a biopsy. The Uro didn't examine me, but his intern did and he seemed thorough and competent. The Uro wants me to have a biopsy. He is also sending me for a urine test. I know a biopsy is no big deal, but I also understand there is a limit to how many biopsies one can have in a lifetime. I'm also aware that at 67 I may not need to worry about this too much. I would appreciate opinions as to whether or not a biopsy makes sense at his time. Thanks, Ted",

      "Content": "Hi: I'm a new member and I have been reading posts for a little while. I am very impressed by the willingness of forum members to give advice and the level of knowledge being shared. I have had quite a few PSA results over the years which are listed below. I have had many DREs which have all been normal. That is, no nodules or hardness have been detected. One Uro described my prostate in 2006 as \"enormous\" (whatever that means). I had a biopsy in 2006 and no abnormal cells were found. I am 67 years old, 5'8\" tall and weigh 155 lbs. if that matters at all. Here are my numbers over the years. I hope this is not overkill... Date PSA Age 1997 1.0 50 1999 0.9 52 2001 2.6 54 2002 2.7 55 2003 3.0 56 2005 4.9 58 2005 5.0 58 2006 4.7 59 2006 5.4 59 2006 4.6 59 2007 4.3 60 2008 7.3 61 2008 5.0 61 2009 4.5 62 2011 5.3 64 2013 7.3 66 2014 8.0 67 Recently my family physician and the Urologist who did my biopsy in 2006 have both retired. My new family physician referred me to a new Urologist who is recommending a biopsy. The Uro didn't examine me, but his intern did and he seemed thorough and competent. The Uro wants me to have a biopsy. He is also sending me for a urine test. I know a biopsy is no big deal, but I also understand there is a limit to how many biopsies one can have in a lifetime. I'm also aware that at 67 I may not need to worry about this too much. I would appreciate opinions as to whether or not a biopsy makes sense at his time. Thanks, Ted",
