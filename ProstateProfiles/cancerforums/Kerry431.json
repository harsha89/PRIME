      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi, Welcome to the forum with a reluctant acceptance to \"the club.\" Another thing that elevates the PSA is an enlarged prostate. Although this probably would not explain all of your PSA reading, it does account for some of it. There could also be an infection that is contributing. The cystsoscopy is painless and just takes a moment or two. The doctor will just check the inside of your bladder and the urethra. The day before my surgery, my doctor also performed one on me to get a sneak preview of everything. As others have noted, many prostate cancers are slow growing. So, if you should be DX'd with it, chances are that it can be taken care of. Please let us know your test results as them come in and we'll be happy to offer our advice, experiences & knowledge. Take care, Chuck Thanks for the kind words Chuck, I am always expecting the worst but hoping for the best.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by lancepeace Hi. The DRE can raise PSA somewhat, better to draw blood before DRE. Many cases of prostate cancer are slow growing. We might be able to say more after you receive pathology report from biopsy. Hang in there. Thanks for the comment, I should say that the Urologist had me do another PSA test 2 weeks after he examined me and it was pretty much the same reading. As you say though I will wait until I get the report.",
