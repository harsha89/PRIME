      "Content": "Thank you for your information. I found a operating urologist and have an apt 1/19. I'm also a vet and am trying to get the VA to schedule a consultation. I'm told my original urologist I saw is kind of a general urologist. So, my 2nd and 3rd looks at this are coming up. Answer me my biggest concern. Urologist was \"puzzled\" that all of the samples had some degree of cancer and yet my psa is 6.61. Is there an explanation for that. He was also worried because one of the samples is close to a \"nerve\" and found an urgency to get moving. It takes time to see these guys. 2nd consulation is 1/19 and waiting for the VA to answer. Should I be concerned about getting this done like now? Do I have a month? Sorry, but the thought of this thing growing really aggravates me. I think my biopsy results will show below in my signature. Thanks, I picked up on how to do from another post. Chuck O (Chasisme)",

Biopsy revealed some degree of cancer in all 12...gleason 3 + 4 (7). Bone scan showed cancer not in bones. Uro wants to do hormone treatment, radiation and seeds. Was recommended to another uro who is more specific to prostate cancer and does robotic surgery. So that appointment is coming up. Original urologist is more of a general urologist. Contacting the VA(Veterans Administration) now, today, to see what they suggest/offer. Given their most recent issues but at the same time suspect a lot of veterans have been treated by the VA and suspect since the feds have unlimited money, they might have the most super duper zapper. I'm really in a confused state. The more info I get the more confused I get. Would appreciate any guidance, help, information anyone can offer.",
