      "Content": "For most of my life, I've always been active and worked out. I learned (hard way lol) that its not good idea during treatment ... especially anything that is core related (hint - you'll be peeing every 3 1/2 minutes ... no kidding ... from the additional irritation to the area). But now that we've put some time and distance ... what are your experiences, advice, and medical feedback. I've been told to \"give myself a break and take it easy\". I get that. But it's hard for me as I am sure many. I really don't enjoy working out - I just like the results and free endorphin high (lol). BUT - if I'm going to do it .. then I'm going to do it, and push myself. I don't know if its the radiation or Lupron side effects ... but I'm achy in varying places (achy .. not pain). I was in great shape before - so I know its not respite during treatment. I find more I work out (or harder) .... less I seem to ache post workouts. I had to lay off for week due to travel ... and I seemed to ache more. What I don't want to do and am afraid of ... is work out too intensely or often. Listening to doc and nurse (take it easy, etc) I simply do 30 minutes of circuit/station training: weights, row machine and treadmill (I hate running - especially since Army .. so I just fast walk at incline) ... aside from rowing I stay away from core-isolating exercises (kettle bells, etc). My THR maintains about 130 +/- ... I'm not running marathons or a sprinter ... so that's fine with me. What do you all do? Thoughts? Am I overdoing it - or ok? Thanks!!!!!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by goatts I've continued to work out even though they've fed me the same \"take it easy\" BS. I think the exercise counters the Lupron SE's. The radiation has caused me some issues but that's to be expected. Just have to roll with it. Tom Ya ... makes sense. Feel better working out. Only real issue I have is sleep. I cannot sleep more than couple hours at a time ... and its not getting up to pee thing. Not sure if that's any side affect or just nerves .... I don't have sleep apnea or anything .... never slept well past few years ... weird.",
