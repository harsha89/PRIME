      "Content": "Hi board, I have been lurking for a bit now. Here's my deal. I am 38 which I know already makes me a low risk for prostate cancer but I have been dealing with blood in my semen for going on three months now. First visit to the doc led to a course of antibiotics and it went away and then came back within 2 weeks. Took a second round and it went away and then came back in a few weeks. Now I am on my third round and the doctor has ordered a transrectal ultrasound for next week. I am sure that will be a lot of fun. He was on the border of whether or not to do a biopsy and I think he will want to do one if the ultrasound does not show anything. My PSA was a .7 . DRE was normal. I have been having some minor fatigue as well and generally just do not feel like myself. I have no other prostate related symptoms, but this has been a weird year for me. Had a few weeks of night sweats that a cause could not be determined. Had a few weeks of a mild night time fever that no cause was ever determined for. I also had two occurrences of rapid onset chills and fatigue than came and went away within 24 hours. One of those led to an emergency room trip. No cause determined. So, what do you think. Should I be getting a biopsy with a PSA so low or is there anything else I should be looking into. Thanks in advance",
