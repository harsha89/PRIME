      "Content": "I am 53, had davinci prostectomy 3 1/2 weeks ago, everything went exceedingly well with that. No (serious) problems with incontenance and working on the sexual function which looks like it will be fine. A week ago, I suddenly developed SEVERE groin pain, Drs. don't know what it is yet. Had ultrasound, yesterday a CT scan (results not back yet.) Pain was so bad, I had to go to ER a day after starting back to work. My symptoms appear if I walk around and do very minor things for about 5 minutes. I can feel the pain coming on and run to the sofa to lie down and put a heating pad on it. I don't have an infection, WBC normal. No kidney stone. I can't go to work or do more than very simple activities. Can I expect this pain to go away? Has anyone had this and can I expect it to go away? If you had this an it went away, what did you do to resolve it and how long did it take for you to recover?",
