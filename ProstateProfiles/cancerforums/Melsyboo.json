    "Content": "My dad had a biopsy Wednesday. He had blood in urine for a couple of days, then today he started passing clots. It was hard for him to urinate at first, but once they started to pass it was fine. I did call his surgeon to ask about the clots. He said it is normal and as long as there is no fever or a toilet full of blood, all should be fine. Is this normal? It was alarming of course to see them. His urine is clearing but the clots that come with it are a bit unnerving for him. There is no fever and no rectal bleeding at all.",
