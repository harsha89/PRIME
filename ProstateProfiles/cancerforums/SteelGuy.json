I'm reading Walsh, setting up appointments and getting to the bottom of the situtation. Feel like i already know many of you. Right now trying to arrange medical insurance so that i can go out of state to U Mich cancer center instead of my regular small town hospital. Making appointments for next week ... I'm sure i'll have lots of questions as they come up ... first is insurance details, then getting ready for first appointments with specialist, biopsy, etc. ----------------- 2006 PSA 'normal' 6/9/2012 PSA 36.3 6/22/2012 PSA 31.2 age 49 Dx",

      "Content": "yes, I'm scheduled for consult with my 'local' hometown Urologist on Monday (took three weeks to get the appointment and then they tried to reschedule/postpone already) -- problem is that my local urologist and insurance is a $500 plane ride away. Got to call them and make sure they understand that they'll be doing biopsy Monday too, not another three weeks. The U Mich specialists are down the street from my work -- much easier to deal with them during the week. One way or the other, got to get the biopsy next week. Yes, provisional membership for now ... we can only pray and hope. Thanks for the hope you all give me.",
