      "Content": "Hi Tom, Wish you were not here. Before you do surgery, you should get a look at the biopsy report to see whether the % cancer was low meaning 5-10% or high meaning 50%+ since those numbers will influence the better choice for you. The cost of getting a second opinion on your biopsy is low, and the importance of accuracy is high, so on a cost-effectiveness scale, you want to confirm that you indeed have a 6. I suggest that you research the Side Effects of the alternate remedies. A good number of surgeons focus on successful removal of cancer, and don't spend much time telling you that, on average, their patients have 50% rate of either incontinence or impotence. You should have a good grasp of the pluses and minuses of Active Surveillance, seeds, and even my therapy, HIFU, before you select surgery. Good Luck",
