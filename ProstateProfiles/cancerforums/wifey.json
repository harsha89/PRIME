      "Content": "Just in case it's any help to you chaps. Viagra and cialis aren't covered under our insurance. After a lengthy talk with my insurance company (UHC), they told me that they have a contracted rate with CVS whereby it's still not covered but it's a hell of a lot cheaper. I did have to push for this and the initial answers were \"no it's not covered\". Sure enough I filled the RX yesterday and with his pain meds, bactrim, stool softener and cialis it only came to $75. So if you're having issues I highly recommend you talk to your insurance company about the contracted rate and which pharmacy they have it with. Hope this helped.",

      "Content": "This is where I get confused. Initially the doc we saw said it was Gleason 7 with 3+4 and then he said it was 3+3 then he said it was mainly 3+3 with some 3+4. I'd taken a note book in to take notes but he was glaring daggers at me and I was so stunned by everything that I didn't take notes. I've spoken to Mass General and they will see him. I'm getting as much of his lab work as I can and Mass General said 3 docs review it all and we'll meet with them. I think it's a radiation oncologist, a urologist oncologist and one other. My husband is understandably very down about it all so I'm setting up the appointments for him and doing as much research as I can so we go in with as full an understanding as we can. I'm trying to encourage him to come on these forums so he can read positive as well as realistic reviews from people like you who have been through it",
