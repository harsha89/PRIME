      "Content": "I read a few of the posts before I joined this forum and saw some interest and info on prostate cancer. I was just diagnosed. Haven't set up a treatment plan yet. I am considering Seed Therapy, my best friend who is a doctor highly recommends Da Vinci surgery technique...cut it out and be done with it. Me, I am freaked out. I have a PSA of 4.12, small lump on rt side of my prostate, two hits in the biopsy scored 3+4=7/10 on the Gleason scale as Active Prostatic Adenocarcinoma. I have only begun to understand what the repercussions of each option I have considered. As for the ones I haven't researched yet...proton, radiation, radical open prostatectomy...my anecdotal information is nothing short of scary. Is there a specific Prostate Cancer Support Group and Info on this Forum? I am trying to soak up all I can before I make a decision. Look forward to hearing from ya'all! Alex",
