He had to measure his own urine and once he output enough he could eliminate the catheter. Now his stream is very strong however he still urinates a lot at night. We found out his prostate is 3X the size it should be via the doppler and it is pushing into his bladder.

      "Content": "I am happy to announce that my Dad made a decision and I flew to Florida this week to kick off the precursor to the treatment! As soon as he was diagnosed he started on Firmagon right away. He has had 4 shots, his PSA is down to 4.2 (it may be even lower but this last lab was different from the other 4 tests he has had done). Everyone told my dad that he was a candidate for surgery or radiation. He decided to go with Dr. Dattoli and do external beam radiation, seeds, and follow-up radiation. As a result of seeing different doctors for multiple consultations, my dad has had: 1 Pelvic MRI, 1 MRI from the throax to the pelvic area, 1 3T Prostate MRI, 2 Cat Scans, 1 F16 Fluoride Pet Scan, and 2 Bone Scans (between July - October). All showed no spread. Dr. Dattoli used a color droppler, ultrasound and BOOM the cancer had escaped the capsule in multiple places! He also think there are a few Lymph Nodes involved - he said it is difficult to judge b/c he has been on hormone treatments for 4 months but he has been doing this long enough to be rather certain that specific lymph nodes were involved. I think we landed in the right place with the right doctor. As we know now, if he did have surgery he would have had to have radiation anyhow. The team is AMAZING and the doctor is innovative and an inventor of a specific prostate seed, conducts countless studies and so on. We took our time getting here but feel comfortable moving forward! My dad goes for a dry run tomorrow and starts DART on Monday!",

      "Content": "Can you explain what impact radiation can have over urinary function? Originally Posted by RobLee Not so much of a deadline but more of a milestone. There have been studies which show that RT is most effective within the first 21 months post-op. I infer from that essentially \"the sooner the better\". Initially, ART was scheduled to begin last March 1st and was postponed due to incontinence. Then I was put into PT with a kegel coach. When that did not yield significant improvement I had to decide whether to get the AUS, which also meant allowing at least six weeks to heal AND accommodate the 25% potential revision rate... which of course, also happened to me as well. I could have put these things off forever... and then of course blame myself somewhere down the road for allowing the cancer to get the upper hand.",

      "Content": "WHY CAN'T MY DAD PEE? My dad discovered he had prostate cancer a month back because he could not pee. He had a foley put in and after he started flomax (before he was diagnosed) they removed the catheter. He didn't even last a day before he was in pain and at the hospital getting a catheter put in again which has remained in place. Since then he was diagnosed and started his first round of Firmagon hormone treatments. He has had a catheter in the entire time. Today they removed it to see if he can pee on his own. He has a light stream, but drank 3 bottles of water so he knows his urine isn't correct and is having pain in his stomach. He is going back to the doctor at 3 pm, so shortly where it will obviously be put back in. But why can't he pee? Because the prostate is cancerous and enlarged? Hormone Treatment not shrinking it? Or are there instances where other issues separate exist that needs to be analyzed like a bladder stone? Trying to determine why he cant pee and if there are other questions/things we should be asking the doctor to look at? PSA 144 Gleason 4+3 no bone mets and no spread shown on pelvic MRI",

      "Content": "Just another day and another hiccup. My Dad has Medicare Complete, PPO, no supplement. Found out today Moffit is \"out of network\" so urology visits are classified as \"specialist\" and are affordable, I think I noted $75. But surgery and radiation would be 40% of my father's responsibility where as if he stayed in house, his responsibility would be down to 20%. So anyone with Medicare that has experience or can share costs incurred so we can brace for impact appreciated. I do not want money to drive our decision but it will likely play a role because 40% of $100,000 is very different than 20% of %100,000. Thanks, Danielle",

      "Content": "For those following our progress, here is a LONG summary of our four opinions gathered last week in Florida. Last week I traveled from VA to FL to be with my dear father to go gather our second, third, and fourth opinions. If you are newly diagnosed take note \u0096 1. These visits are emotionally taxing and left us depleted. Put work and other obligations on hold (I thought I would work in the evenings, ha!) 2. Do not just book \u0093facilities\u0094 to get opinions from \u0096 research and request specific doctors \u0096 I wish I did a better job of this. Day 1/Dr. 1 (current Uro): Told us we have 3 options 1. Just hormone treatments 2. Surgery plus hormone treatments or 3. Radiation plus hormone treatments. He told us Dad would ALWAYS be on hormone treatments. He stated option #2 provides better quality of life providing ability to urinate (this all began w/ my dad unable to urinate and on a catheter for over 2 weeks. He IS urinating on his own again). Said #2 provides better long term survival not cure. Did not like that he nonchalantly said he \u0093is stage 4\u0094 even though on paper he is T2C. Did not like that he said \u0093bone scan and MRI of pelvic area are meaningless\u0094 regardless of tests he said \u0093he has metastatic cancer due to PSA\u0094. Did not like he said \u0093he will live for 5 years\u0094 (yes I want 5 years but we want lots of life beyond 5 years too. I also did not like that when I asked him if Dad should have a cardio work up to determine suitability before surgery (since he hasn\u0092t had one in YEARS) he shrugged it off, said sure, but because he can easily walk over a mile briskly he doesn\u0092t really need it. Generally I don\u0092t like him. He doesn\u0092t show much compassion and is so medical with his replies that they are very hard to understand. With that said, he has down over 3,000 surgeries. Day 2/Dr.2/Radiation Oncologist: Doctor believes 144 was not his true baseline PSA due to DRE 7 days before test, catheter for one full week and then pulled out hours before test, and DRE hours before test. No scientific evidence as to whether it was 50 or 90 \u0096 still high risk but probability of metastatic microscopic spread lower. He said he is not a candidate for seeds due to entire prostate being filled with cancer and I think size. To note, size measured by MRI was 4.2 X 5.3 X 6.9. He suggested best course of action was surgery + radiation 3 \u0096 6 months after (once best possible urination reached). Said external beam IMRT will help rid of any remaining cancer. He would keep dad on hormone therapy but not for rest of life, maybe 1 \u0096 2 years following treatments. Also mentioned \u00935 years of life\u0094. Although not in agreement with many things I shared that Dr. #1 has said/done thus far said he was a good surgeon. They are both in the same \u0093umbrella\u0094 of healthcare if that matters. Day 3/Dr. 3/Moffit/Uro: Doctor also believed baseline PSA not accurate and not indicative of the Gleason 3 + 4=7, but it is the data we have and what we need to work off of, as he said. He was the only doctor to not view my dad at an extremely high risk, aggressive case. First doctor to focus on more of a cure result as opposed to a way to manage and keep him alive. Stated he had option or surgery OR radiation. He wants a MRI of prostate done and a Cat Scan of chest area done to further confirm no spread. If he decides on surgery he would take him of hormone treatments, they make the prostate \u0093mushy\u0094 more difficult to operate on plus once removed want truer read on what was happening inside. If surgery is a go he would have Dad see anesthesiologist to clear him for surgery and then have him see a cardio specialist for EKG. Overall had great \u0093bed side manner\u0094 HOWEVER he is out of his residency and fellowship. He has done UNDER 100 surgeries\u0085My dad is about to be 70. We can\u0092t put our faith in someone who is still honestly learning to do such a complicated surgery correctly. Day 4.Dr.4/Radiation Oncologist \u0096 Dr. Dattoli: Recommend no surgery. Seeds plus external beam. Would remove off hormone treatment anywhere from 1 \u0096 2 years due to long term side effects. Stated highest cure rates in the world. States size of gland not massive, just enlarged mostly the tumor. Cons: Long term urinary issues which he is just overcoming but may likely worsening with such radiation. Is knowledge really powerful? No doctor really approached our discussion the way we wish it had happened. Most spent SO MUCH TIME validating their resume rather than focusing on Dad\u0092s specific treatment and case. Dad still unsure (as well as me too) best way ahead. Scheduled to go back to Moffit in early September to meet with head URO of department who does 2 \u0096 3 prostate surgeries a week\u0085maybe that is where the answer lies? Read he is incredibly compassionate and patient and speaks in a way in which you can understand. Also hunting down other doctors who may give phone consultations.",

      "Content": "Hi Joel, I am not sure what other medical issues my dad had leading up to this point? He hasn't even gone to a doctor for 20+ years (part of what got him into this mess) but granted, he hasn't had anything significant for him to be treated. The first issue there was a significant problem with his health is when he stopped being able to urinate. All the blood work he has had to this point other than his PSA has been normal. The physician who has seen my Dad has only seen him since July so he knows him for a few weeks and only with an isolated view of his urology - no more or less really than anyone else at this time. I will not make a decision for my dad but I know he is not capable of researching and learning the options and side effects of each treatment plan. My role is to capture that information, get him infront of experienced doctors who can present options, and for him to have OPTIONS to make the best decision for himself. Originally Posted by Joe1 Hi Tinkerbell I've been following your story and posted a few times along the way. I know you are trying to do what is best for your dad because you love him so. If I could make a gentle observation that you should feel free to disregard. From your first posts it seemed your 69 year old father had a number of medical issues in addition to the PCa diagnosis, from your description of the consults it may be that you (and him?) have decided on the treatment you want him to have. The physician who has seen your dad and knows his medical history the best and is not focused on \"cure\" is the one you like the least.....Aggressive treatment in a 69 year old with the co-morbidities you described in your earlier posts does not always end well. Every one has to make their own treatment choices, again trying not to be critical, I'd suggest you sit down and have a heart to heart with your dad to find out what HE wants and not what he thinks you want for him. I have a young wife and daughter and know how difficult it can be to do whats best ultimately for them when dealing with what they want for me now. There are many options available and reading into your care and concern I think you need to go the extra mile for both of you in assuring he makes the right choice for him no matter how hard that may be for you.... Good luck and God Bless",

I am my father's life line, I am going to help manage his care (from afar - he is in FL and I am in VA). We are best friend...none of that matters with a looming diagnosis but it does matter with HOPE and attitude and something to hold onto. Over 2 weeks ago he could no longer pee. Had symptoms of frequent night urination for a long time. Hospital catheterized him and told him he had an enlarged prostate, go see urologist. Went to see Urologist and told his prostate is enlarged and firm. Sent for PSA test. Results came in at 150. (caveat: he had a DRE before the PSA and had a catheter in for 8 days until PSA test) Biopsy is tomorrow. I have read and read and it just seems that the news of a firm, large prostate and a 150 PSA are all doom and gloom. So I am hoping to hear stories that will give us something to hold on to...",

      "Content": "It is hard to believe I found this board just 2 weeks ago and today so quickly we have my fathers biopsy results in. I am looking for words of encouragement to share with him and also any suggestions on next steps and general opinions about treatments. To this point I have researched and prepared for the diagnosis. I\u0092ve done very little research on treatment options. So here is what we are working with: Age 69 Frequent night urination; symptom that let to ER visit was inability to urinate DRE firm, irregular, bilateral volume PSA 144 21 tissue samples taken, all 21 positive for cancer with volumes ranging from 70 \u0096 100% Gleason score of 4 + 3 = 7 Next steps per doctor (urologist): Start Firmagon immediately; get bone scan and MRI of Pelvic area. The doctor said he wouldn\u0092t jump to removal of prostate likely hormone therapy + radiation but won\u0092t confirm treatment until bone scan My next steps: wait for bone scan results and take PSA, Biopsy, and Bone Scan and send to Dr. Dattoli (Sarasota, Fl). He is world renowned and specialized in prostate and is a radiation oncologist. Then get biopsy slides and send to Dr. Epstein for another read. What other next steps should I consider? Also, treatment options \u0096 based off his prognosis where should I focus my attention? Holding on to hope that we still have many years of life and memories together with my Dad!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by RobLee When you're talkin' 4+4 you're talkin 'bout me! Anyway, I'd say the RO is now you're Dad's doctor. The MO won't be needed unless the bone scan turns up mets. The RO does primary radiation treatment \"of your choice\" (IMRT, SBRT, \"seeds\") ... there's a baker's dozen when it comes to primary RT, which is often chosen if there are complicating medical conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. The RO may also come back into the picture if your dad has surgery, as often is the case of grade 4, the cancer has become \"locally advanced\" also known as stage 3, meaning the cancer had escaped the prostate capsule and become embedded in the pelvic floor. I'm guessing he will end up with radiation anyway, whether as primary treatment or as either adjuvant or salvage radiation following prostatectomy, if for no other reason because of his age and very high PSA. ROBLEE: So when \"shopping\" for multiple opinions do I shop just among Radiation Oncologists which I assume is what RO stands for? Also, I was surprised his urologist said surgery/removal of the prostate was unlikely from his perspective, for now. Said wanted to wait for bone scan. His Urologist is saying he has \"high grade, high risk, metastatic prostate cancer\". I am not sure how he knows it has metastasized - he said even if the bone scan was negative there are many time cancer sells embedded missed. But I think he is assuming it has spread based on the PSA, DRE, and 21 of 21 all cancerous.",

Regarding his Gleason score, the urologist said I shouldn't really read the report as 4 + 3 = 7 I should read it as 4 + 4 = 8; he said they had to document the 3 because they saw some but that it was predominately 4's. I need serious help determining how to forge ahead with a treatment plan and options. What is the difference for example between a radiation oncologist and a medical oncologist? Also his urologist yesterday when talking made a comment almost how we want to steer away from these oncologists who will pump full of even more toxins that will kill him instead...

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I know I have been a bit absent and so much appreciate your thoughts and memory of what I have shared thus far. I have been a bit absent because after the diagnosis and weeks of research, shock, hormone treatments, my dad DID go to Costa Rica with us WITH the catheter in! I was so proud of him \u0096 he was so brave and it was such a relaxing trip where we DID NOT focus on his health but rather focused on our time and enjoyment together. After the trip he learned to self catheterize! I was SO PROUD OF HIM!!!! And he followed instructions and he down to one self cath. a day and peeing on his own now. Frequently, but on his own!!!!!!!!! Then we got his PSA results which were down from 144 (initial) to 23.5 \u0096 all good news. But now, here I am in Florida and we are punched in the face with the reality that we need to get back to work and seeing the doctors has been overwhelming with emotions. Yesterday we met with my dad\u0092s urologist, the doctor who has first diagnosed him and who he has worked with since. I don\u0092t really like his \u0093bed side manner\u0094. However he is recognized as one of the best surgeons in the area. We are mature enough to understand personality doesn\u0092t always matter if he operates, talent and frequency of this type of surgery is more important. This appointment was for his next hormone treatment (Firmagon) + suggested treatment plan. I came scrambling for recommendations for doctors because: I didn\u0092t like his general demeanor. He seemed to only give information based on what we ask, not sharing of information freely. When I asked him what stage he was he came out the gate \u0093stage 4\u0094 this is even with no evidence of spread in bone scan and MRI. He said based on his PSA and his gleason and him KNOWING it has spread regardless, he is a 4 BUT on paper he is actually a T2B. Regarding surgery, I asked if he needs a full workup to determine if he is a candidate \u0096 my father hasn\u0092t had a physical in 20+ years just like we didn\u0092t know if he has prostate cancer we don\u0092t know if he has a heart problem etc. He was dismissive and said he can easily walk a mile, he doesn\u0092t really need the cardio work up BUT I WAS PERSISTENT about it. He also is NOT an advocate for radiation after surgery even with this aggressive form of cancer. SO I PANICKED. Today we met with a radiation oncologist \u0096 he was better in that he SAT and spent a lot of time with us and had papers and images to show us and help us walk through and learn more. Surprisingly he agrees that my dad\u0092s chance out elongated survival is surgery, hormone treatments, AND post op radiation. Although I liked him better he too was very business like. I guess I should recognize it IS there business, but we are HUMAN beings. At one point when my dad beat around the bus about survival rates associated with the different options he said \u0093well you can expect to live at least another 5 years\u0094\u0085oh thanks, that is awesome, 5 years. That doesn\u0092t excite this man who looks so healthy and LOVES life and has so much to LIVE FOR. So we have Moffit lined up on Thursday \u0096 will see a urologist and waiting to hear back from Dattoli\u0092s office for our consultation.",

I have researched a ton and my dad is still getting opinions and deciding what treatment will be best for him (surgery + radiation or radiation + brachytheraphy). Anyhow, if you would like to chat over the phone to get a quicker data dump of what knowledge I can share, let me know. You can email me at dkoub27 at gmail dot com I just connected with someone today on another message board that had similar \"states\" to my dad and lives in this area and followed the radiation + brachytheraphy path and had a GLEASON 9 like your dad. We are scheduled to chat on the phone tomorrow. Random strangers willing to help one another out. But in agreement, figure out how to edit your \"signature\" so that we can learn more info on your dad and not have to constantly ask. What I learned is Prostate Cancer is a bad cancer but a cancer with options and when one treatment fails another may work. Even if no cure for our Dad's there are many options to give length of quality although different than normal, LIFE and Memories for YEARS to come. Hang in there!",

I think being informed helps you feel somewhat in control of what choices we can make to improve my Dad's health and lessen all of our fears. I have some more questions: He has his biopsy on Thursday of this week - -His biopsy is in the doctors office and he will be awake for it. Is it normal for this not to be done in a hospital? -What happens during a biopsy? Do they take samples of JUST the prostate? Do they take samples of other organs around it? -What is recovery like from the biopsy? -Do you get the results the same day? How long does it take if not same day and do they bring you in, call you? -What is the biopsy is POSITIVE? THEN what? I keep reading there will be more tests and scans to identify stage but what is the typical process? -Does he then seperate so to speak from the urologist and find an oncologist? THANK YOU",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I know I have been a bit absent and so much appreciate your thoughts and memory of what I have shared thus far. I have been a bit absent because after the diagnosis and weeks of research, shock, hormone treatments, my dad DID go to Costa Rica with us WITH the catheter in! I was so proud of him \u0096 he was so brave and it was such a relaxing trip where we DID NOT focus on his health but rather focused on our time and enjoyment together. After the trip he learned to self catheterize! I was SO PROUD OF HIM!!!! And he followed instructions and he down to one self cath. a day and peeing on his own now. Frequently, but on his own!!!!!!!!! Then we got his PSA results which were down from 144 (initial) to 23.5 \u0096 all good news. But now, here I am in Florida and we are punched in the face with the reality that we need to get back to work and seeing the doctors has been overwhelming with emotions. Yesterday we met with my dad\u0092s urologist, the doctor who has first diagnosed him and who he has worked with since. I don\u0092t really like his \u0093bed side manner\u0094. However he is recognized as one of the best surgeons in the area. We are mature enough to understand personality doesn\u0092t always matter if he operates, talent and frequency of this type of surgery is more important. This appointment was for his next hormone treatment (Firmagon) + suggested treatment plan. I came scrambling for recommendations for doctors because: I didn\u0092t like his general demeanor. He seemed to only give information based on what we ask, not sharing of information freely. When I asked him what stage he was he came out the gate \u0093stage 4\u0094 this is even with no evidence of spread in bone scan and MRI. He said based on his PSA and his gleason and him KNOWING it has spread regardless, he is a 4 BUT on paper he is actually a T2B. Regarding surgery, I asked if he needs a full workup to determine if he is a candidate \u0096 my father hasn\u0092t had a physical in 20+ years just like we didn\u0092t know if he has prostate cancer we don\u0092t know if he has a heart problem etc. He was dismissive and said he can easily walk a mile, he doesn\u0092t really need the cardio work up BUT I WAS PERSISTENT about it. He also is NOT an advocate for radiation after surgery even with this aggressive form of cancer. SO I PANICKED. Today we met with a radiation oncologist \u0096 he was better in that he SAT and spent a lot of time with us and had papers and images to show us and help us walk through and learn more. Surprisingly he agrees that my dad\u0092s chance out elongated survival is surgery, hormone treatments, AND post op radiation. Although I liked him better he too was very business like. I guess I should recognize it IS there business, but we are HUMAN beings. At one point when my dad beat around the bus about survival rates associated with the different options he said \u0093well you can expect to live at least another 5 years\u0094\u0085oh thanks, that is awesome, 5 years. That doesn\u0092t excite this man who looks so healthy and LOVES life and has so much to LIVE FOR. So we have Moffit lined up on Thursday \u0096 will see a urologist and waiting to hear back from Dattoli\u0092s office for our consultation.",

He is on flomax (every day) and is getting Firmagon (a hormone shot) every 28 days. He was also on antibiotics. I think all 3 helped resolve the issues. He still wakes 2 - 3 X a night to pee though.

I appreciate all your words it uplift me somehow. Also i would like to ask. Is there a chance for my dad to be able to pee again? What did you do or what medicines did you take. I know that i will have to ask the doctor regarding this but i want to know other people's experience. Again thank you guys and God bless us all.

I've read something like if the cancer has metastasized, you have a better outcome if it is in less than 5 spots? Is that true and why? 4.

      "Content": "Looking for advice, similar experiences for my dad. He had brachytheraphy on Feb 22 of this year. Prior to that he had 40 rounds of external beam radiation. The seeding went well with minimal immediate side effects EXCEPT his urination has turned terrible. He is up to pee 10+ times a night and during the day can pee better but isn't fully emptying his bladder. He is not a good sleeper to begin w/ and this has made it worse. I'd like to add that how my dad ever got diagnosed with PC was his urination STOPPED. After having a catheter inserted for several weeks and then learning to self catheter, he was able to wean off and pee again really well. Even throughout radiation his urination did weaken but was tolerable. Now it is not. His radiation oncology nurse keeps telling him to hang on for a bit, symptoms should get better but he is losing his patience. And because of how this all started with urination problems I feel like whatever the seeding did really irritated or obstructed his ability to urinate. On the flip side, I am unsure of why a few weeks of catherter use prior to treatment, he was able to successfully resume urination on his own. Will add he was recently diagnosed through urgent care with a UTI. He is on strong antibiotics. His urination has not improved. Any help? advise? similar experiences?",

He is on flomax (every day) and is getting Firmagon (a hormone shot) every 28 days. He was also on antibiotics. I think all 3 helped resolve the issues. He still wakes 2 - 3 X a night to pee though.

I try to be but sometimes when i am not with my dad i cry. But i dont him to see that. Tomorrow we will have the bone scan. I will update here once i have the result. I appreciate all your words it uplift me somehow. Also i would like to ask. Is there a chance for my dad to be able to pee again? What did you do or what medicines did you take. I know that i will have to ask the doctor regarding this but i want to know other people's experience. Again thank you guys and God bless us all. I pray for healing to all of us both from the disease and the loveones as i know the burden and emotions are tough also.",

      "Content": "Hello All, My father is 69 years old. Last week he could not pee and he was in excruciating pain. He drove to the ER where they: conducted an ultrasound of his stomach; conducted a rectal exam; inserted a catheter; and conducted blood work and a urine sample. At the ER they said his prostate was enlarged. They said depending on his blood work and urine hey would either keep him or send him home. They said since his blood work came back clear, they would discharge him with a catheter and schedule an appointment for a urologist. We later learned they did not do a PSA at the hospital, I am not sure what type of blood work they did and were looking for at the time to clear him for discharge. Note: For a long time my father woke regularly at night to pee. He has also had slow flow of urine (which he only told me now). He has also felt something on his butt and though it was hemorrhoids. My dad has avoided doctors for some time, unfortunately... My dad had the catheter in for 7 days at home while on Flomax and an antibiotic. He said it stung while he peed into the catheter and there was some blood in his urine (that he could see in the bag). My dad went to see the urologist 7 days later who conducts the rectal exam, removes the catheter, does another ultrasound, and THEN sends him for the PSA lab work. Hours later my dad gets the results that his PSA was in the 100's (didn't give me the exact number) and a biopsy of the prostate and surrounding areas is scheduled for Thursday. 24 hours later he is having trouble peeing again. At first when the catheter was removed he said \"I haven't peed like this since I was 40\" now he said the flow starts and stops. He said he has bladder feels tender when has has to go and then feels relieved when he gets any pee out. My dad is not goo at taking information in so I have bits and pieces. He did sign the waiver so I can call the doctor and talk to him tomorrow - I am States away from my dad so not present (for now) at these appointments. QUESTIONS: -Everything online seems bad with a PSA in 100s almost guaranteeing cancer. What are the experiences of folks here? Could it be a severely infected prostate or is that option truly not likely? -I've read you should wait WEEKS to have a PSA done after the DRE and Catheter removal both can cause \"significant higher\" PSA scores. My dad had TWO DREs done in one week and a catheter in for 7 days and removed prior to his PSA lab - does it really carry any impact? -My father is scheduled to travel at the end of July with me out of the country with his grandkids (Costa Rica). The doctor is aware and actually said he wants my dad to go hence making the PSA and biopsy quickly to figure out everything prior to. I felt comfortable taking my dad but not if he is still having peeing issues. I assume him traveling is a bad idea? -Is there any interim solution to resolve the pee issue? If in fact this is it, and his life may end in the near future this trip would mean so much to him as it would me and my family. It has been a dream of ours to do before he got \"really old\". My father is my best friend, my anchor in this world. I want to help educate him, give him tools, and give him and US hope.",

So I was not at the biopsy but as noted was told Doctor will call me and Dad w/ results this week but already has an appointment for in office next Monday - I assume that is to discuss treatment?

My Dad call, he is beginning to feel less pain - Thank Goodness.",

      "Content": "My dad just had his biopsy. He is in Fl and I am in VA. Thought it was interesting that he did not have the standard 12 samples pulled, he had 23 pulled. My dad is in a lot of pain - said he cannot sit. He was told to only take Tylenol. He also had a Valium earlier this morning in advance. 1. For those that were in pain following the biopsy, how long until you felt relief? Any other suggestions? Icing? Hot showers? Anything he can do? Also, was told the doctor will have the results in 3 - 4 days. They will call my phone and I will patch my dad in. I know he will shut down and not even know what to ask or what to take in. 2. What should I ask when the biopsy results are revealed? I need a script because although prepared for the worst (PSA 150) I know I will still be in shock. 3. My dad was in the ER on June 24 and July 4. I looked at his blood/urine tests online and both dates show an \"abnormal UR Ketones\" On the 24 it was 15 mg and on the 4th it was .5 mg. Is this connected to the prostate or something separate? 4. Dr. today (urologist) wanted to check his urine again but said he couldn't since he has an ongoing catheter in. Why would they want to check it again on the day of the biopsy - any ideas?",

So I was not at the biopsy but as noted was told Doctor will call me and Dad w/ results this week but already has an appointment for in office next Monday - I assume that is to discuss treatment?

Obviously I need to listen - I want to hear what they have to say in terms of how the treatment plan they recommend, but what do I want to ensure I ask?...I am heading to Fl next week so we can hear the recommended treatment plan from his current urologist who has has been seeing.

Does a urologist who does the biopsy recommend you seeing a oncologist and radiation oncologist?...Once I can figure out how to update signature I will, but for now a \"reintroduction\" of my dad's stats: Age 66; PSA 144; 21 tissues biopsied, all 21 cancer, volume 70 - 100%; Gleason 4+3 = 7 Diagnosed last Tuesday, July 11 Firmagon shot I believe on Thursday, July 12 (double dose) Bone scan scheduled for tomorrow; MRI scheduled for Thursday (July 20) Week of July 22 - 29 vacation with daughter on planned trip to Costa Rica (all doctors are telling him to go one week won't impact treatment plans...Dad still unsure about going now) Week of August 1 will meet with current urologist and review bone scan, mri and get staging and his suggested treatment plan Week of August 1 have consultation with Radiation Urologist who specializes in Prostate - Dr. Dattoli (Sarasota, Fl) get SECOND OPINION Week of August 7 get PSA test done again August 14 get second Firmagon injection August 15 meet with Dr. Slyverst (Lakewood Ranch, Fl) Radiation Urologist who specializes in Prostate get THIRD OPINION August 17 meet with doctor from Moffit cancer center in Tampa Flordia starting with their urologist they assigned who is also affiliated with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center....Does a urologist who does the biopsy recommend you seeing a oncologist and radiation oncologist? Are they sometimes housed within the same facility working together?...Once I can figure out how to update signature I will, but for now a \"reintroduction\" of my dad's stats: Age 66; PSA 144; 21 tissues biopsied, all 21 cancer, volume 70 - 100%; Gleason 4+3 = 7 Diagnosed last Tuesday, July 11 Firmagon shot I believe on Thursday, July 12 (double dose) Bone scan scheduled for tomorrow; MRI scheduled for Thursday (July 20) Week of July 22 - 29 vacation with daughter on planned trip to Costa Rica (all doctors are telling him to go one week won't impact treatment plans...Dad still unsure about going now) Week of August 1 will meet with current urologist and review bone scan, mri and get staging and his suggested treatment plan Week of August 1 have consultation with Radiation Urologist who specializes in Prostate - Dr. Dattoli (Sarasota, Fl) get SECOND OPINION Week of August 7 get PSA test done again August 14 get second Firmagon injection August 15 meet with Dr. Slyverst (Lakewood Ranch, Fl) Radiation Urologist who specializes in Prostate get THIRD OPINION August 17 meet with doctor from Moffit cancer center in Tampa Flordia starting with their urologist they assigned who is also affiliated with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
