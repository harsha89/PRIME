      "Content": "My husband had a CT scan prior to his surgery last month and \"something\" was noted on his liver and he was advised to get it checked at a later date. Surgeon's nurse said if it was at all \"suspicious\" the radiologist would never allow it to go without immediate follow-up. Hope so. Just realized I posted while my husband is logged in. Oops.

      "Content": "I wanted to share a peak into the unknown for those of you awaiting for this day to happen Thursday, Day of surgery 2/13: I arrived at the hospital at 6:00 am for prep with an 8:00 am surgery. My weigh-in at surgery was 201.5 lbs/6' tall. I walked into the OR and felt as though I was on a space ship abducted by aliens. It is not a familar looking space but the Team was very keen to calm me as they prepped and explained the events about to unfold. I was very impressed with the Robot; I wanted to shake one of his arms. When the Doctor entered I first smelled his cologne, then I felt a veil of calm and serenity pour over me from his appearance, his eyes, his voice, his handshake and assurance that he was going to take good care of me. And that he did. After 3 1/2 hrs of surgery I woke up feeling weak, bloated w/gas, abdominal pain and catheter discomfort. Approx 3hrs post surgery the nurse got me up to walk. I shuffled from hospital room window to the hallway door, felt dizzy and nauseous. Nurse said \"breathe\". Best advice. In thru nose out thru mouth and went back to bed. At midnight I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep. I felt anxious with abdominal and catheter pain. I elected for two Percocet and fell asleep after an hour. I woke up at 4 am, was greeted by the nurse asking if I wanted to walk. I said yes. I made 2 laps around the nurses station, went back to bed, passed gas and stained the bed pad getting back into bed; embarrassing but felt great. Next day, Friday: always walking around nurses station with a goal of 5 laps for each outing. I was discharged at 2pm with 2 Percocet for anticipated pain getting in and out of cab. Abdominal pain was primary pain, catheter was secondary. 2nd day post op, Saturday: Bowels began to function as gas and diarrhea. Felt like a King. Finally allowed to eat solid food. Walked hallways at Hope Lodge and ventured out to the city streets 4 doors down to deli for first taste of solid food since previous Tuesday. 3rd day post op Sunday: abdominal pain subsiding, using only Advil pain much less than expected. Walking hallways at Hope Lodge and city streets. Walking helped reduced abdominal pain, increase blood flow and stronger bm's. Took well deserved shower. 4th day post op Monday: BM's more structured. Experienced soft erection during the night 3/10. Walking morning and afternoon. 5th day post op Tuesday: BM's solidified followed by blood in urine (cranberry colored) runs clear between BM's. This is common as per Doc. Frame of mind very strong. Experienced moderate erection 6/10. Abdominal discomfort minimal and stomach swelling significantly reduced. Longer walks twice daily. Stopped taking Advil. 6th day post op Wednesday: continue feeling stronger. Solid BM's. Woke up with stronger erection. 9th day post op (Saturday). Minimal stomach swelling, no Advil needed since 5th day post op., nightly erection continues to put a smile on my face. I drink copious amounts of liquids: water, coconut water, decaf tea & coffee. Twice daily walks are longer in distance, pace and duration. My diet is simple as to not tax my digestive tract. Oatmeal, fruit, eggs, pasta, vegetables, salad, soup and a daily sweet or two. No meat. Sleep is restful. Urine is clear even after BM. The catheter is not an issue and I continue to be awakened out of my sleep with a welcomed feeling of bliss knowing that my cancer is gone and I can still function as a man for my loving wife of 33 years. Started antibiotic and Flomax for bladder spasims 24 hrs before meeting with Dr. Tewari on 2/24 for the removal of the cathetar and pathology reports. No pain or discomfort felt during removal of cathetar; just a feeling to pee which I did. I left his office with my pad in place and head held high walking down the streets of New York City with a renewed confidence. That night I was up every 1-2 hrs to pee. Thanks to the expertise of the Doctor I did not experience any incontinence that day or night. I returned to the doctors office on 2/25 am for another bladder scan to ensure that the bladder emptied. I was good to go with a pad in place and an extra cathetar just in case I had to self-catheterize on the return flight home. Arrived home late afternoon on 2/25. I got up twice during the flight to walk the aisle and to pee. The flight was uneventful. I was able to maintain bladder control and free of any discomforting pain for the duration of the flight. Today is 15 days post surgery and 4 days after the removal of my cathetar. The bladder spasims have passed, I am essentially cancer free (still have to wait for 1st PSA results 6 wks after surgery), pain free, my urine stream is getting stronger each day and I have not experienced any incontinence since the removal of the cathetar. I continue to walk 4-5 miles per day split between the morning and afternoon. Erections continue naturally, although discourged during the healing process, they do a lot for your frame of mind. I am a happy man with a loving, supporting wife wishing the same for all that are drawn to this thread for their cure and recovery.",

Experienced soft erection during the night 3/10. Walking morning and afternoon. 5th day post op Tuesday: BM's solidified followed by blood in urine (cranberry colored) runs clear between BM's. This is common as per Doc. Frame of mind very strong. Experienced moderate erection 6/10. Abdominal discomfort minimal and stomach swelling significantly reduced. Longer walks twice daily. Stopped taking Advil. 6th day post op Wednesday: continue feeling stronger. Solid BM's. Woke up with stronger erection. 9th day post op (Saturday). Minimal stomach swelling, no Advil needed since 5th day post op., nightly erection continues to put a smile on my face. I drink copious amounts of liquids: water, coconut water, decaf tea & coffee. Twice daily walks are longer in distance, pace and duration. My diet is simple as to not tax my digestive tract. Oatmeal, fruit, eggs, pasta, vegetables, salad, soup and a daily sweet or two. No meat. Sleep is restful. Urine is clear even after BM. The catheter is not an issue and I continue to be awakened out of my sleep with a welcomed feeling of bliss knowing that my cancer is gone and I can still function as a man for my loving wife of 33 years. Started antibiotic and Flomax for bladder spasims 24 hrs before meeting with Dr. Tewari on 2/24 for the removal of the cathetar and pathology reports. No pain or discomfort felt during removal of cathetar; just a feeling to pee which I did. I left his office with my pad in place and head held high walking down the streets of New York City with a renewed confidence. That night I was up every 1-2 hrs to pee. Thanks to the expertise of the Doctor I did not experience any incontinence that day or night. I returned to the doctors office on 2/25 am for another bladder scan to ensure that the bladder emptied. I was good to go with a pad in place and an extra cathetar just in case I had to self-catheterize on the return flight home. Arrived home late afternoon on 2/25. I got up twice during the flight to walk the aisle and to pee. The flight was uneventful. I was able to maintain bladder control and free of any discomforting pain for the duration of the flight. Today is 15 days post surgery and 4 days after the removal of my cathetar. The bladder spasims have passed, I am essentially cancer free (still have to wait for 1st PSA results 6 wks after surgery), pain free, my urine stream is getting stronger each day and I have not experienced any incontinence since the removal of the cathetar. I continue to walk 4-5 miles per day split between the morning and afternoon. Erections continue naturally, although discourged during the healing process, they do a lot for your frame of mind. I am a happy man with a loving, supporting wife wishing the same for all that are drawn to this thread for their cure and recovery.",

      "Content": "I wanted to share a peak into the unknown for those of you awaiting for this day to happen Thursday, Day of surgery 2/13: I arrived at the hospital at 6:00 am for prep with an 8:00 am surgery. My weigh-in at surgery was 201.5 lbs/6' tall. I walked into the OR and felt as though I was on a space ship abducted by aliens. It is not a familar looking space but the Team was very keen to calm me as they prepped and explained the events about to unfold. I was very impressed with the Robot; I wanted to shake one of his arms. When the Doctor entered I first smelled his cologne, then I felt a veil of calm and serenity pour over me from his appearance, his eyes, his voice, his handshake and assurance that he was going to take good care of me. And that he did. After 3 1/2 hrs of surgery I woke up feeling weak, bloated w/gas, abdominal pain and catheter discomfort. Approx 3hrs post surgery the nurse got me up to walk. I shuffled from hospital room window to the hallway door, felt dizzy and nauseous. Nurse said \"breathe\". Best advice. In thru nose out thru mouth and went back to bed. At midnight I woke up and couldn't get back to sleep. I felt anxious with abdominal and catheter pain. I elected for two Percocet and fell asleep after an hour. I woke up at 4 am, was greeted by the nurse asking if I wanted to walk. I said yes. I made 2 laps around the nurses station, went back to bed, passed gas and stained the bed pad getting back into bed; embarrassing but felt great. Next day, Friday: always walking around nurses station with a goal of 5 laps for each outing. I was discharged at 2pm with 2 Percocet for anticipated pain getting in and out of cab. Abdominal pain was primary pain, catheter was secondary. 2nd day post op, Saturday: Bowels began to function as gas and diarrhea. Felt like a King. Finally allowed to eat solid food. Walked hallways at Hope Lodge and ventured out to the city streets 4 doors down to deli for first taste of solid food since previous Tuesday. 3rd day post op Sunday: abdominal pain subsiding, using only Advil pain much less than expected. Walking hallways at Hope Lodge and city streets. Walking helped reduced abdominal pain, increase blood flow and stronger bm's. Took well deserved shower. 4th day post op Monday: BM's more structured.
