      "Content": "Hello everyone. So glad we've found this community. Already the information has been very encouraging and helpful. My husband of 19 years (age 63) received this Dx earlier this month, and we are waiting surgery middle of December. I've read a tremendous amount regarding the logistics of surgery, etc, but I am curious as to any information regarding depression issues. This may seem trivial with life/death issues such as cancer, but I am very concerned with how my husband is going to handle this. We know there is nerve involvement on the right side of the prostate, so there will be no saving that nerve bundle, and I understand saving the nerve bundles are directly related to regaining sexual function. Did any of you go on depression meds to help you cope with these life changes? Should I mention my concerns to my husband's doctor? I really appreciate any and all information you can give me. Thank you in advance.",

      "Content": "Hello everyone. So glad we've found this community. Already the information has been very encouraging and helpful. My husband of 19 years (age 63) received this Dx earlier this month, and we are waiting surgery middle of December. I've read a tremendous amount regarding the logistics of surgery, etc, but I am curious as to any information regarding depression issues. This may seem trivial with life/death issues such as cancer, but I am very concerned with how my husband is going to handle this. We know there is nerve involvement on the right side of the prostate, so there will be no saving that nerve bundle, and I understand saving the nerve bundles are directly related to regaining sexual function. Did any of you go on depression meds to help you cope with these life changes? Should I mention my concerns to my husband's doctor? I really appreciate any and all information you can give me. Thank you in advance.",

      "Content": "Wondering if you all could provide some information on your physical symptoms prior to your DX, surgery, etc. My husband is very uncomfortable, having to sit \"gingerly\". The urologist explained that his prostate is 3 times the normal size, and in his words, \"it's tight as a tick in there\", and the doc is saying that he is hopeful that my husband will be one of those, who physically, feels MUCH better after surgery. He feels exhausted right now, and doesn't have much in the way of energy. We are hoping, once surgery is done, to see these areas of energy improve. But anyway, I was hoping some of you might share how you fared with your \"other\" physical symptoms, if you had any, other than the obvious regaining continence, sexual functions. Thanks in advance.",
