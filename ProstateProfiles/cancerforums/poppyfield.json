      "Content": "Hi lovely and helpful people, I am so pleased something like this exists to help concerned family members. It is so tough being someone of huge importance but not at hospital appointments to ask your own questions! So, we found out this week that Dad has prostate cancer. He is 67, fit and otherwise healthy. Late last summer he mentioned urination problems so of course we urged him to get to the doctor. He also complained of fatigued muscles/muscle wasting but that could have been due to a lack of physical work which he was used to. He did not want to tell us the bad news over Christmas but they found out in early December that it is indeed cancer. This is the facts that I know and I would LOVE for someone to cast an eye and tell me anything more about the stage he's at and what the out look appears to look like: PSA was 138 at first check The cancer is in ONE lymph node near by. Apparently they tested two, is this right/normal? The cancer is NOT currently in the blood or bones. He has a testosterone blocker implant in place under the skin and has responded very well to this and the PSA at last check was down to 38 and the tumor on the prostrate has shrunk. He briefly mentioned the Gleason score due to the +lymph node is \"7 or 8\".... I don't think he wants to worry us, but I googled and 7 is very different to 8. Scared. Chemo starts in 2 weeks and he needs 6 rounds (3 weeks apart) followed immediately by 7 weeks of daily radiation. Does that sound par for the course please? Can anyone give me further information regarding the cancer being found in one lymph node? Is this how it can travel around the body? If so how quick and will chemo do the job of mopping up all those potential strays? Does chemo kill the cancer in that lymph node AND the prostate gland? It's SO so scary, we are a very close family and feel like we've been kicked by a horse and had the wind knocked out of us. We live in England so are using the good old NHS. Thanks so much in advance.",

Should this not be routine if it is so simple to spot? It seems unless you are private and want to pay for regular check ups you only get tested for things if you already have symptoms. Something I have now told my husband, as soon as he experiences any issues DON'T WAIT and also will happily pay for him now to go along and have a full check up, just as ladies do with cervical screening every few years. I love that you said this isn't the end, thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi lovely and helpful people, I am so pleased something like this exists to help concerned family members. It is so tough being someone of huge importance but not at hospital appointments to ask your own questions! So, we found out this week that Dad has prostate cancer. He is 67, fit and otherwise healthy. Late last summer he mentioned urination problems so of course we urged him to get to the doctor. He also complained of fatigued muscles/muscle wasting but that could have been due to a lack of physical work which he was used to. He did not want to tell us the bad news over Christmas but they found out in early December that it is indeed cancer. This is the facts that I know and I would LOVE for someone to cast an eye and tell me anything more about the stage he's at and what the out look appears to look like: PSA was 138 at first check The cancer is in ONE lymph node near by. Apparently they tested two, is this right/normal? The cancer is NOT currently in the blood or bones. He has a testosterone blocker implant in place under the skin and has responded very well to this and the PSA at last check was down to 38 and the tumor on the prostrate has shrunk. He briefly mentioned the Gleason score due to the +lymph node is \"7 or 8\".... I don't think he wants to worry us, but I googled and 7 is very different to 8. Scared. Chemo starts in 2 weeks and he needs 6 rounds (3 weeks apart) followed immediately by 7 weeks of daily radiation. Does that sound par for the course please? Can anyone give me further information regarding the cancer being found in one lymph node? Is this how it can travel around the body? If so how quick and will chemo do the job of mopping up all those potential strays? Does chemo kill the cancer in that lymph node AND the prostate gland? It's SO so scary, we are a very close family and feel like we've been kicked by a horse and had the wind knocked out of us. We live in England so are using the good old NHS. Thanks so much in advance.",
