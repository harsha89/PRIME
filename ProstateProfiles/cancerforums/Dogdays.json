      "Content": "Anthony, The first thing to do is for both you and your dad to take a deep breath and relax. You've been given great advice from others on here already. Pca is a slow growing cancer and you have some time to make an educated decision on what your treatment plan will be. Make sure you get a copy of his path report. And possibly a second opinion on it. Epstein at Johns Hopkins is an expert in the pathology field regarding Pca. Any appointments your dad has, with any doctor, someone should accompany him. We have all had the deer in the headlights look when we're told we have cancer and too many important items during a doctor visit get missed. Take notes and keep a folder of everything. Get as educated as you both can on the different treatment plans available. Adding his stats and history will be very helpful in allowing advice from other forum members. His biopsy pathology report especially. The amount of cancer and the Gleason score will pretty much define what his best treatment options will be. Most urologists are surgeons and will recommend surgery as a treatment. You need to also speak to a radiation oncologist. Your dad will need to decide which option or options best fit his lifestyle. Both generally have the same results in success, where radiation SE's come on later in years and surgery sooner. Be your own best advocate. Search, read, ask questions on this forum and others. We've all been there. You'll find that guys and their families who go through this are like a band of brothers. We'll be with you to answer any questions or concerns you may have. Best of luck",

Have you had any discussions with any other surgeons or radiation docs on other treatments? Have you done any homework at all regarding possible side effects? Not only from surgery, but radiation as well. ASAdvocate said it perfectly when he mentioned treatment regret. Guys who didn't fully understand the outcomes or didn't fully vet their doctors. Do some homework before you make a decision you may regret. It probably the most important decision you will have to make regarding your life. Whichever treatment you decide to go with, best of luck",

      "Content": "Bulldog, I started my triple play of ADT, Seeds and SBRT in February of 2017. My treatment was dine by MSKCC in Manhattan and New Jersey. Timeframe: First ADT shots were in March and April of 2017. I am now getting Lupron every 3 months, which should end October 2018 . LDR Brachy was done in July of 2017 SBRT done in 5 treatments started and completed August 2017. The toughest part actually was preparing for the Brachy with the cleanse they want you to drink. Tough stuff. The brachy was completed in about 3 hours. Recovery room time was a little long. I Was in there for about 5 hours while they waited for me to void. Some blood clots in voiding, but the worst part was the dizziness. I was seriously dizzy for hours and needed help standing. Maybe I was dehydrated. I don't know. Even on the way home, I needed to stop to use a bathroom. If my son in law wasn't there to hold me up, I would have face planted. So be sure to rehydrate and drink as much as you can after the procedure. Bring a urinal with you in the car for the trip home. Just in case. Recovery from the brachy was about 2 weeks before things calmed down, like burning on urinating, soreness, etc. Fiducial markers were also placed when seeds were done. My SBRT started with a simulation to have tattoos done and a catheter put in for the simulation. Before they do the simulation, ask if they will be inserting a cath. Sometimes they don't. If they do, ask if they have clamped the tube. I didn't and they did. Cause if you feel the need to pee while.they are doing the simulation or MRI, it will be a problem. Urine will be forced around the cath tube and you'll have a mess on your hands. A few weeks later, I started SBRT. Daily enemas are no fun at all. But its only 5 if that is your treatment plan. I had no problem holding the required amount of fluids necessary during the radiation. Actual time on the table was about 15 minutes. No daily side effects, although a few days after treatment ended, did have very loose and very frequent bowel movements which lasted about 2 days. I still have frequent bowel movements, more than before SBRT. I am now 6 months out from completion. Aaahhhhh.....ADT. Another story altogether. Shots are a non issue. It's what they do thats a problem. Within 2 weeks of the first shot, I began having hot flashes, which are still ongoing. Maybe about 2 or 3 times a day. At night when I'm trying to sleep is the worst time. I have gained over 20 pounds. Part of this is due to bad knees and a sciatica which won't quit. They have limited my ability to walk as exercise. The worst side effect is fatigue. I am constantly tired and have no real stamina. My testosterone is very low. I believe around 9, so the ADT is doing its job. My PSA, which isn't really relevant since I'm on Lupron is currently <0.05. I can only hope it stays that way. If you have any questions about my journey so far, feel free to ask. Best of Luck",
