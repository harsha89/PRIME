I have added 2 Tbsp. of flaxseed /day to the regimen. 2 x 500 mg Metformin, 40 mg Atorvastatin. I am about to add Artemisinin and iron as an additional adjunct based on some research I have read. Any thoughts from anyone. I am not a doctor, but I am a scientist with an MA in Biology and a lot of chemistry.",

It is one of the last gifts my father gave me, so a lot of my troubles are of my own making. At my stage Gleason (4+5) 9 and stage IV surgery was out of the question. I already had lymphadenopathy and bone mets to cervical and lumbar spine, many ribs, hips and femurs. Ten cycles of EBRT on hips and femurs to prevent pathologic fractures February 2015.

      "Content": "As noted before I have found a new group to deal with me. I am now much happier. After I was started on Casodex on June 29th and my urologist could not or would not tell me about side effects other than to look it up on the internet. When I came up with diarrhea as a result I was told to go to my PCP. I found a new group much more in touch with treatments and possibilities for me. We discussed several options including Provenge and Xofigo. The decision has been made to try the Provenge first. I have now had two treatments with the third coming on November 18th. My PSA had gone up to 1.45. but last month it had come down to 1.28. I understand that PSA may not come down initially, but I can live in hope. We will see about a CT scan at the end of December. If anyone has had experience with Provenge immunotherapy, I would like to hear their results. I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer November 10th 2014. I have highly active Adenocarcinoma of the prostate with lymphadenopathy and bone mets. Gleason (4+5) 9, stage IV. Treatment was Firmagon Nov 10th 2014 followed by Taxotere December 1st 2014 for 6 cycles 3 weeks apart.

      "Content": "I noted after my second cycle with Taxotere that I had a loss of sensitivity in my fingers, down the front of my legs and out onto my feet. I was asked about it and did not admit to it because I did not want to stop the Chemo, putting my life at risk. Since the Chemo was finished and more recently the loss of sensitivity has gotten worse as has my loss of balance. Has anyone else had this reaction or side effect? Has it improved over time? What kind of treatment has been initiated? I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer November 10th 2014. I have highly active Adenocarcinoma of the prostate with lymphadenopathy and bone mets.

      "Content": "Everything seems to be moving in the right direction. My only question in the last 2 reports is the prognosis which states that it is \"guarded\". The bone scan in September was \"improved\". If the bone mets are being attacked by the treatment how can the prognosis be \"guarded\". What are the thoughts on the length of the runway? I have now survived 2 years on ADT plus chemotherapy. My replaced knee seems to be working better and better. My vision after cataract surgery is now 20/20. It was never that good. I am looking forward to the third Provenge infusion a week from tomorrow. After that I hope my cells will do the job and reduce my bone mets, main tumor and the circulating tumor cells. Only time will tell.",
