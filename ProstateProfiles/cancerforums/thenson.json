      "Content": "Greetings. My PSA scores have been under 2.0 until August of this year when it jumped to about 4.7. My doctor prescribed an antibiotic in case I had a prostate infection the did 2 other PSA tests and each time there was a little increase until it was 5.12 at the end of November. December 20th biopsy showed 9 out of 12 cores with cancer and the Gleason scores were 3+3 Full body bone scan showed \"negative for metastatic disease\". Abdominal CT scan showed \"negative for metastatic disease\". I have a second opinion appointment scheduled for the 25th of January. QUESTIONS: 1. with the PSA going from 2.0 to 5.1 in 13 months, does that indicate that my cancer has developed quickly? 2. even with low Gleason scores of 3+3, does the fact that 9 out of 12 of the biopsy tissue samples showing up as having cancer cells, does that increase the severity level or risk potential of my cancer? 3. since cancer was confirmed with the December 20th biopsy and that about 75% of my prostate could be cancerous, does the risk of cancer metastasizing outside the prostate increase significantly with each month we delay surgery or treatment? I guess what I'm asking is whether each month I delay having surgery am I significantly increasing the risk of it metastasizing? or would it take a 6 month delay to significantly increase that risk? and is there a risk rating system that takes into consideration the number of biopsy cores with cancer? thanks, thenson",

      "Content": "Thank everyone for the good, clear information, advice and encouragement. Someone ask my age. I am 62. Also, here is a summary of the biopsy pathology report: DIAGNOSIS: A. Right base x2 - Benign prostate tissue biopsies. B. Right mid x2 - Gleason grade 3+3 adenocarcinoma noted in 1 out of 2 tissue biopsies representing 20% of biopsy volume. C. Right apex x2 - Gleason grade 3+3 adenocarcinoma noted in 2 out of 2 tissue biopsies representing 60% of biopsy volume. D. Left base x2 - Gleason grade 3+3 adenocarcinoma noted in 2 out of 2 tissue biopsies representing 15% of biopsy volume. E. Left mid x2 - Gleason grade 3+3 adenocarcinoma noted in 2 out of 2 tissue biopsies representing 25% of biopsy volume. F. Left apex x2 - Gleason grade 3+3 adenocarcinoma noted in 2 out of 2 tissue biopsies representing 50% of biopsy volume. One more question. All of the above information comes from me seeing my local urologist which I have only seen twice since this started. He is the Dr. that did the biopsy and is the surgeon that is recommending a complete prostatectomy. At the end of this week I am seeing a Dr. at the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Klein and the more I read or hear about him, he is the surgeon I want to do my surgery... But, I just found out that although he might be rated as one of the \"Top Doctors\" in the US, and has an immense amount of experience, he only does the \"Open\" method for prostatectomy\"... And as I began to gather information about all of this, I was seeing and hearing wonderful things about the Da Vinci procedure and how much better it is... but then as I sought articles that compare the actual differences and which method is better, most direct studies will say that there is \"no statistically significant\" differences in the long term success of the surgery... I realize that the recovery might be a bit longer, but I think that what I'm seeing... is that you would be better off with a leading expert surgeon that does the \"open\" method than with a lessor experienced surgeon using the Da Vinci method??? Would appreciate your comments and inputs on this issue too... Dr. Klein may not recommend a prostatectomy... but another reason I'm going to the Cleveland Clinic is that they have multiple other options for treating PC. And, since Dr. Klein is the head of the urology department and was involved in hiring most of the other doctors, I'm sure he will have confidence in whichever other doctor or treatment method he ends up recommending... Dr. Berglund is another doctor that was recommended and he does a lot of Da Vinci method surgeries from what I hear. But I am also making the assumption that for a clinic to be rated number 1 in the nation must have all good doctors... Any comments about Dr. Klein or Dr. Berglund at the Cleveland Clinic? thanks again, Terry",
