The right side went smooth but the tumor was very close to the nerve on the left side. He spent extra time on that side. Had to take about a millimeter of the nerve. I feel pretty good and came home this afternoon. Belly is a bit sore, but so far haven\u0092t taken any thing stronger than a couple Tylenol. Worst part is feeling I have to pee, but obviously have a catheter in. We will see how the first night at home goes, but so far so good. Thanks for all the support and info.

      "Content": "Well yesterday and surgery came and went. The doctor and team at St. Luke\u0092s was great. Surgery itself was a little longer than the doctor thought it would go. The right side went smooth but the tumor was very close to the nerve on the left side. He spent extra time on that side. Had to take about a millimeter of the nerve. I feel pretty good and came home this afternoon. Belly is a bit sore, but so far haven\u0092t taken any thing stronger than a couple Tylenol. Worst part is feeling I have to pee, but obviously have a catheter in. We will see how the first night at home goes, but so far so good. Thanks for all the support and info. I felt like I knew what was coming at me Ralph",

      "Content": "I met with my surgeon today, 6 days post RALP. Dr. Said I was healing nicely and removed the catheter. That was 5 hours ago, as so far still dry. I have urinated twice also during that time. I am encouraged so far. The last two days I walked 2 miles each day. Final pathology had no real surprises. Tumor was Gleason 3+4 =7. 30% of prostate was involved by tumor. Weight was 42.8 G. The Dr. shared with me that the surgery took about an hour longer than planned due to the tumor pressing up against the nerves on the left side. He said he spent a fair amount of time on this section but was able to save 70% of the left nerve. The right nerve was fine with normal margins. So now I try to get a handle on how how incontenance will effect me and start the 90 day countdown to the first PSA test. Thanks again for all the support. Ralph",
