      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi TMCM, We're glad you found us although not happy that you need to be here. You have received wonderful advice from a bunch of us already & I pretty much agree with all that has been said. I think there is great reason to hope the cancer is still confined to your prostate because your PSA is not anywhere near double figures, which \"suggests\" an organ confined status at this time. I am pretty certain that your bone and CT scans will come back clear. With Gleason 8, of course, time is of the essence to get rid of it while it might still be confined to the prostate. It is possible that radiation could take care of it, but if the additional tests suggest it is still restricted to the prostate, I would go the route you are already considering -- surgery. And, as has been indicated, do NOT go with any surgeon who has not done at least 300 of them, whether it is robotic or open. You probably have a good chance of being cured with timely treatment. Please let us know how things are going. Chuck Highlander, You said exactly what My Urologist stated. He said that I still may have containment due to My PSA score being 5.13, I had already obtained Dr Walsh's book and have basically devoured the information. I find it hard to believe there are just so many variables. I am currently researching the amount of Robotic Surgeries that have been performed at Geisinger Medical Center, I know they have 3 DaVinci Robots and am also reading back round info on many of the surgeons.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi TMCM, We're glad you found us although not happy that you need to be here. You have received wonderful advice from a bunch of us already & I pretty much agree with all that has been said. I think there is great reason to hope the cancer is still confined to your prostate because your PSA is not anywhere near double figures, which \"suggests\" an organ confined status at this time. I am pretty certain that your bone and CT scans will come back clear. With Gleason 8, of course, time is of the essence to get rid of it while it might still be confined to the prostate. It is possible that radiation could take care of it, but if the additional tests suggest it is still restricted to the prostate, I would go the route you are already considering -- surgery. And, as has been indicated, do NOT go with any surgeon who has not done at least 300 of them, whether it is robotic or open. You probably have a good chance of being cured with timely treatment. Please let us know how things are going. Chuck Highlander, You said exactly what My Urologist stated. He said that I still may have containment due to My PSA score being 5.13, I had already obtained Dr Walsh's book and have basically devoured the information. I find it hard to believe there are just so many variables. I am currently researching the amount of Robotic Surgeries that have been performed at Geisinger Medical Center, I know they have 3 DaVinci Robots and am also reading back round info on many of the surgeons.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi TMCM, We're glad you found us although not happy that you need to be here. You have received wonderful advice from a bunch of us already & I pretty much agree with all that has been said. I think there is great reason to hope the cancer is still confined to your prostate because your PSA is not anywhere near double figures, which \"suggests\" an organ confined status at this time. I am pretty certain that your bone and CT scans will come back clear. With Gleason 8, of course, time is of the essence to get rid of it while it might still be confined to the prostate. It is possible that radiation could take care of it, but if the additional tests suggest it is still restricted to the prostate, I would go the route you are already considering -- surgery. And, as has been indicated, do NOT go with any surgeon who has not done at least 300 of them, whether it is robotic or open. You probably have a good chance of being cured with timely treatment. Please let us know how things are going. Chuck Highlander, You said exactly what My Urologist stated. He said that I still may have containment due to My PSA score being 5.13, I had already obtained Dr Walsh's book and have basically devoured the information. I find it hard to believe there are just so many variables. I am currently researching the amount of Robotic Surgeries that have been performed at Geisinger Medical Center, I know they have 3 DaVinci Robots and am also reading back round info on many of the surgeons. Thank You All again! Regards TMCM",

I have had continuous DRE 's for the past 3 years and My PSA has risen from 2.5 in 2014 , 3.5 in early 2015 and 5.13 as of 2016 (April) The Urologist found no lumps on the DRE. I have had been prescribed Cipro 3 X's and My PSA did drop back in 2015 to 3.1. I know that the G = 4+4 is serious. I am praying that the PCA was contained. May 5th cannot arrive soon enough.
