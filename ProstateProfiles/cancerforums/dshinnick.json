I was actually amazed that I was able to schedule the surgery at all! I was sure they'd have a two-year waiting list to see one of the top prostate surgeons in the world. And Dr. Allaf recommended Dr. Carter, if I wanted to go with \"open\" rather than RP. Why did you choose open? I had some abdominal surgery when I was 7, which might rule out RP for me, but they won't really know until they get inside and have a look. Feel free to send a PM if you'd like, and we can commiserate with each other. :0) best wishes- dave",

This morning, though, as I sit outside with coffee and laptop, I feel/see what appears to be a tan-colored mushy-looking stuff oozing out from the tip of my penis around the catheter. Not a lot; maybe the size of 2 BB's. And I feel a slight \"need to go\", though I've felt that before and it has passed. Been filling the urine bag well, and the urine looks healthy. Any thoughts on this? Wondering if it might be a sign of infection, but other than that feeling of needing to go, nothing else \"feels bad\". Thoughts? thanks- dave",

I was told nothing to eat for 24 hours prior except clear stuff like coffee (yay), clear jello or popsicles (still have some of those left). They should have given you a prep sheet which describes all this. Bottle of magnesium citrate the evening before, then NOTHING after midnight, except for 8 ounces of water about 4 hours before surgery. And, yeah, the enema, but that was just no big deal.

Over that period of time, PSA went from 5.2 to 6.0. So, I'm figuring on visiting \"the knife\" and just have it gone. We're full-time motorhomers on a trip up the east coast right now. I figure maybe by early September we'll be in the northeast. I can find a good surgeon, drop anchor in a park for a month, get the surgery, and have the month to recover; more if necessary. Then resume our travels back south for the winter. Coupla questions: 1. Does it seem right that, having the PC grow like that in a year, I would still be a G6? 2. When I told the Doc I'd probably have the surgery in 6 months or so, he seemed fine with it. Does that seem ok, or should I do it sooner? Obviously, I don't want to risk it growing outside the prostate. But, if the G6 is accurate, I'm thinking that won't be a concern. Thoughts? Advice? Thanks- Dave",

      "Content": "I know I was anxious to read about other guys' experiences regarding what I was about to go through, so I guess it's my turn to share. Thursday morning, two days ago, I showed up for my RP with Dr. Mohamed Allaf at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. Highly competent doctor and hospital; I considered myself very fortunate to have insurance which allowed me to be treated by this esteemed institution. The pre-op was insignificant except that person after person kept asking me the same questions! An abundance of caution, they said, and I guess I can be grateful for that. I was wheeled into the OR and was amazed at the equipment, the technology, the number of folks in the room! I felt somewhat humbled that all these experts would give of their expertise to help solve my problem. I saw Mr. Robot sitting in the corner, his mechanical arms just waiting for permission to begin his life-saving work on my behalf. JH is a teaching hospital and there were several residents there to observe and learn. I was glad that my experience will, through them, benefit others. They started attaching things to my legs, and arms, and chest. Nothing hurt. Then I was told to start sucking pure oxygen from a plastic mask held over my mouth. They apologized that it smelled so plasticky. All the JH folks were forever apologizing for the most mundane things; they know what a trying experience this is and they try to make it go as comfortably as possible. After 4 or 5 sucks of pure oxygen, I heard \"We're going to put you to sleep now\". And they did. I woke up in recovery. My biggest complaint was sleepiness! I could barely keep my eyes open. So, I stopped trying, and drifted in and out for awhile. I felt for the catheter, which was in place, which told me they had completed the operation and didn't have to abort for some reason. Zero nausea, and relatively little pain. So thankful for that! After awhile I was wheeled up to my (private) room. Nurses came and went, I was on a continuous IV of fluids to keep me hydrated and peeing, and really the worst pain I felt was in the small of my back from the bed! Maybe it was just at a bad angle, or too firm. I can't blame them; I sometimes get a bit of back pain while lying in bed at home, or in my chaise lounge. I wasn't in the mood to read so I hooked my phone up to power (should have brought an extension cord), and began listening to podcasts. After an hour or two a nurse commented that later on I should try walking, which I knew was important from this forum. So I said, \"I'm ready; let's do it!\". So she helped me up, closed up the rear-view of my hospital gown, and I was off and walking. Made it around 2 1/2 times before I figured that was enough for the first time. I began passing gas after a couple of hours, which the nurses celebrated like it was my birthday. They brought me an frozen Orange Mango treat which went down just fine. End of day 0. Slept very little overnight. That minor back pain, plus I just wasn't as sleepy as I thought I would have been! Oh well. I watched the clock make its relentless march toward daylight. Good thing I was loaded up with podcasts. Nurses came in to empty the urine bag, replace my IV bag, and take one blood sample. The overnight nurse seemed perfectly competent, but...well...kinda ghoulish. Guess that can happen when you have a steady diet of \"graveyard\" shifts. The next morning I ordered coffee and cream of wheat. Both were small servings, but went down just fine with no negative effects. One of the attending physicians, who had been in the OR, said that Dr. Allaf reported that the prostate came out whole, with no evidence that the cancer had escaped, and that he was very pleased. Well, if he's pleased, so am I! And he informed me that I would be able to go home that day, so only one night in the hospital, instead of the planned two nights. The rest of the day was pretty uneventful. Nurses, bag emptying, walking, podcasts, and some book reading. Around 4PM the nurse gave the tutorial on catheter care and the like. Easy. The wife came about five o'clock, I was wheeled out to the car, and off we went. End of day 1. It's now 9:30AM, day 2. I slept quite well last night, which was really nice. Emptied the quite-full bag once during the night, and again this morning. Went out for a walk, got tired after about 10 minutes, and came back to my recliner, my coffee and my laptop. So, bottom line? It ain't pleasant. I don't think this experience will ever become an attraction at Disneyland. But it's not terrible. You just have to remind yourself that \"tough times don't last; tough people do\". And most importantly, keep reminding yourself that you're very likely to now be cancer-free, and that this is NOT that great a price to pay to be able to say that. I kept thinking, \"You clod. Why did *you* have to be one of the one-in-seven who gets this?\". Look for the occasional light side, try to laugh at yourself just a little, and know that, as everyone says here, it will get better, day by day. Dave",

      "Content": "....though this membership I could have passed on.... :0) Had my first PSA on a whim, just for the heck of it, about 2 months ago. 2 weeks ago had a 12-sample biopsy, during which DRE was normal, as was the visual inspection. I'm scheduled for a CT abdomen and pelvis, and a bone scan next week. The rest is in my signature. New to all this, of course, with a few questions. In my biopsy results, in the little graph showing the location of the two bad areas, there's a dark oval in the upper center, which is not labelled. What is that? Also, as far as reading is concerned, I see folks talking a lot about Dr. Walsh's, \"Guide to Surviving...\". But I see it's over a year old, and a lot can change in a year. Is there a newer resource book which is recommended reading? For example, on Amazon, I see: \"Prostate Cancer Breakthroughs 2014: New Tests, New Treatments, Better Options\", by Jay Cohen. Any thoughts? Thanks- Dave",

But....within just the last couple of days I've been getting a dull ache in the general area of the two right-most incisions. It comes and goes, is never a sharp pain, and does not respond to touch; it doesn't hurt when I press on it. But I would say the dull ache can sometimes be significant; maybe a 3 on a scale of 10. Certainly enough to keep me off the tennis court. If it had been sore ever since the procedure, I would think it's just being slow to heal. But up til a few days ago I had no pain there at all. I'm contemplating making an appt at a local walk-in clinic (we're motorhomers and don't have a regular MD), but thought I'd run it by the gang here first. Any thoughts / experience like this?",

      "Content": "I am five weeks post-RP today, and have been doing exceedingly well. Almost like it never happened. But....within just the last couple of days I've been getting a dull ache in the general area of the two right-most incisions. It comes and goes, is never a sharp pain, and does not respond to touch; it doesn't hurt when I press on it. But I would say the dull ache can sometimes be significant; maybe a 3 on a scale of 10. Certainly enough to keep me off the tennis court. If it had been sore ever since the procedure, I would think it's just being slow to heal. But up til a few days ago I had no pain there at all. I'm contemplating making an appt at a local walk-in clinic (we're motorhomers and don't have a regular MD), but thought I'd run it by the gang here first. Any thoughts / experience like this?",

Three questions. 1. Does it seem reasonable that I could go from 1 core to 5 cores, in about a year, and still be a G6? I know the first biopsy might have missed one...or two....but to go from 1 to 5 indicates to me a more aggressive growth than a G6 would indicate. 2. I'm planning on RP in about 4 months. Ok to wait that long? Don't want to risk it escaping the capsule, of course. I know I need to wait minimum 6 weeks from biopsy, not sure if 4 months is too long. 3. A week or so after the second biopsy, semen was very dark, quantity about \"normal\". A week later, still dark, but quantity considerably less. Today, about three weeks since biopsy, still dark, quantity about 1/3 of normal. Any thoughts on this? Thanks much, guys! dave",

      "Content": "I had my first biopsy a year ago, and was asked to do a double enema the morning of. During the biopsy, the doc mentioned that he saw the effect of having done the enemas, and, as I remember, said it made it easier to do the biopsy. I have my next biopsy scheduled for Friday, and the Doc said that an enema was not necessary. Kinda makes me wonder why. Does he really think it'll be of no significant benefit? Might this make you question his competence? (though he seemed ok to me). And, should I go ahead and do it anyway? I don't mind; it wasn't that big a deal. And if it might possibly help ensure a more reliable biopsy, I'm sure willing. Thoughts? dave",
