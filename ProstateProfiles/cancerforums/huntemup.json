Also had DRE at least 3 times in that period of over 10 years. 8-2012 PSA 2.4 8-2013 PSA 2.8 8-2014 PSA 3.2 8-2015 PSA 4.3 Was DRE in Oct 2015 Urologist said he felt a nodule on right side. Doc said I needed a biopsy. I said ok and waited till after the new year for insurance reasons. When biopsy he asked if I ever had a urinary infection. Due to calcified area were he thought was nodule. He said no nodule. And I said no never had one that I am aware of. He said I would have remembered if I had one. My location is WI 60 miles away from any lap scope surgery so open would be my choice. My Urologist has done many and it would be within 2 miles of home. Was planning another PSA in April. So I meant not to mean wait and see. I would continue active surveillance.",

      "Content": "As stated this will be my last post after my 2-09-16 Radical Prostatectomy Surgery. Day 13 no urine leaks past 2 days. No pad. Kegel exercises working and a good Surgeon. Taking Viagra 3 days now no erection at this time. Not giving up on ED but was never my main concern. Urine leaking was my number one goal to avoid for recovery. No pain medication since 2-15-16 Final path report Gleason score went to 7 as stated last posting. Cancer of Prostate with low recurrence risk T1-2a Gleason <7 & PSA < 10. 30 percent of Prostate full of Cancer. Doc told me 2-18-16 when staples came out. Was good that I did surgery when I did. He feels another year and the Cancer would have been out of the box. Other than that I feel great. Looking forward to getting back to my weight training in 2 more weeks and some Harley rides. Thank you all for sharing your thoughts. And may you all have a good long life of Cancer free ahead. And may we all remind our fellow man the importance of a PSA at age 40 and above each year. Take care all this is my final posting. Sincerely Steve",
