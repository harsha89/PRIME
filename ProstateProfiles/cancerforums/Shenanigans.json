      "Content": "Things never go the way I hope and plan but no matter its done. I planed for one surgery but ended up with a open radical. My surgeon wasnt feeling well but after I went to sleep he became very ill and his assistant and partner became my surgeon. Next as they were positioning me head down my Blood pressure dropped to a point that it was not safe to do as I wanted but stabilized when they flatted the table back out. So radical was done. In recovery I felt fine. Used local around the incision site. The BP thing earned me a night in Medical ICU. Thing that bothered me most that night was back pain. I freaked the nurse out by telling them I had to get up and walk and I did. I had the surgery on Friday and was out by noon on Monday. Sleeping could not use the chair so had to figure the ins and outs of getting into bed but each and every day things became easier to do. Cath and drain was pulled the next week on a Monday. Winter storm hit the same week. This has made leakage some what a problem as the first time the cold air hit me there was no stopping it. I just turned around and went right back in. Things continue to improve and will have inplant surgery soon. Think Im dreading it more than the first surgery. If you are new to this board I am very sorry but the good news is this board has a wealth of knowledge. Read. A few tips that I have found very useful. 1. Start doing kegaling right now as you will need to do this for some time to come. 2. Get pads/undergarments before you have your surgery. Stock up on personal hygiene wipes to clean your self esp. after cath comes out. 3. Follow rules they give you to a T. 4. NEVER forget where your cath. bag is. I guarantee you will only do it once. 5. Walk, Walk, Walk. This gets everything moving! 6. The day they are to take cath out take pads with you. Actually put two in your back pockets for backups. 7. It will get better just takes a little time. 8. Almost forgot. Ask for local or a marcain pump around the incision site. Help Last week the path. report came back. Good news and a surprise. Suprise was that the cancer that they though was small took up 1/4th of the prostate. Good news is they found no cancer anywhere else. I had planned on doing a daily note here but you will have much to do. Trust and Believe.",

      "Content": "Monday Everything was going as scheduled. Ekg, labs, all the forms done. Tues. Clear liquids all day. Surgery called and told me to come in at 10am Wed. Morning. Was told to take the Mag. Citrate at 4pm. Done. Tues. at 4:30 I was called and told my surgery had been cancled and that I needed a cardiac workup. EKG showed a little abnormality. In the last 3 weeks I have seen no less than 4 Dr.'s no one said anything about another workup. Had stress test a year ago due to this. Anyway, ended up going to Cardiologist Wed. and got the clearance for the same thing. Anesthesia said fine but no to the robotics. Said he didnt like the idea all the pressure put on my heart. So was placed back on schedule for a open tomorrow. Disappointed but better safe than sorry.",

I didn't realize how long I had been there and told him how sorry I was his reply was \" Don't worry about the time, this is about you.\" He gave me his cell number and said if I had any other questions to call him. LOL I had planned to have my surgery in three weeks. His schedule was full. Looked at me and said, \" How about this coming Wednesday. Took a couple of deep breaths and said yes. This Monday I will see the anesthesiologist to be cleared for surgery and If cleared then Wed. morning will have my surgery. Lots to do in a very short time.",
