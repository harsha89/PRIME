      "Content": "Please help if you can! I was floored when I found out 3 weeks ago after a prostate biopsy that I do actually have prostate cancer especially since my PSA was only 0.7. and my urologist said I only had a 1 in 6 chance of the results being positive! It was the digital rectal exam that that brought this about (at least it was good that I did have the DRE done or the biopsy would have never taken place). However, having been on testerone for the past 2yrs. with my bioavailable score being on the real high side, I really expect that had something to do with it though my Dr. didn't necessarily agree. I am scheduled to have the Davinci robotic surgery performed here in So. Cal by one of the top urology surgeons in the United States in 2 months. I am told with a 0.7 psa, Gleason at 6, and stage T2a-b1 that I am a very good candidate for this \"nerve sparring\" procedure and in the hands of a world class surgeon my chances for any sexual dysfunction or real incontinence issues are rather small. I sure would like to believe this as I always have been a pretty active guy and still feel and think very young-I am 67 yrs. old but look a lot younger. I'm told that my doctor uses the newest Davinci \"S\" robot and creates 6 ports in the lower stomach region rather than 5 ports. If anyone has a similar profile and has had this procedure within the last 1 year I would sure appreciate hearing from you re:your results. Much appreciated, Mark Mark",
