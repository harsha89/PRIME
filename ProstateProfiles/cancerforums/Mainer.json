My husband is 56, just diagnosed with prostate cancer 3+4 'intermediate' dr says we can 1/actively monitor 2/radiation 3/prostatectomy With the little research i've done (a lot from here, thx again!) I can't see any reason at all to consider radiation over the prostatectomy. My husband isnt afraid of the surgery and it seems like, let's just get that sucker out of there. the tumor appears to be confined in his gland. Can anyone say why he should consider radiation? to complicate the matter, i've just quit my job and we had planned to travel in our RV for 7 months (!). so now with our HMO we have to stay in CA to finish treatment. doc sez radiation would be 5x/wk for 8 wks. seems if we can get the surgery scheduled sooner than later, it would be quicker. i realize he'll need to heal/rest/deal with catheter etc. but just really wanting to move forward and give him the best chance of survival.
