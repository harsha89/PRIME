      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Chard, Welcome to the forum -- with a very high probability that you won't have to join the PC Club. It is EXTREMELY rare for an 18 year-old to have prostate cancer. There is no absolute normal for PSA readings, but generally anything under 4.0 is considered normal for a man in his 50s. Anything under 3.0 is considered normal for anyone in their 40s or younger. In your case, this could simply be your normal PSA. It is also possible that there is a urinary tract infection, etc., that is causing you to hit the toilet so often and giving you that particular PSA number. Having a 0.8 reading at age 18 is probably due to other things instead of PC. Here are a few links that I found on Google for you to check out: http://www.everydayhealth.com/prosta...-are-high.aspx http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-c...-20048087?pg=2 http://www.webmd.boots.com/prostate-...rostate-cancer http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Prostateh.../psa-test.aspx The second link is info from Mayo Clinic showing SEVEN NON-cancerous reasons for having elevated PSA numbers. Hang in as others will be coming along with their own thoughts & advice. In any event, I'm sure you are going to be just fine. Take care, Chuck Thanks so much for the reply Chuck! Yeah I don't think I have cancer, it's got to be chronic prostatitis!! I have all the symptoms but they won't take me seriously because of my anxiety. I will try my best this week in my app with the urologist to further investigate... No one should have prostate problems but especially at my age!",

      "Content": "I don't know where to go on the Internet and somehow landed here... For 3 years I've had every symptom of chronic prostatitis, I've seen 3 urologist's but because I have ptsd they tell me I'm crazy.. I peed 17 times yesterday im at such a loss.. I convinced my md to put in a psa blood test, it was 0.8 and I have a urology app this week and I won't let him dismiss me. Question is, is this psa \"normal\"? Or should It be 0 at my age? Thanks",
