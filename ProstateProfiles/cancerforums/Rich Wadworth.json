I also got injections to relax my back and it didnt do a lot.",

      "Content": "I am 29 years old. Married with 2 kids. Just applied to medical school. I am a little scared. The area between my testicles and anus up inside aches, almost like a burning dull ache, like maybe there is pressure deep inside. Especially at night. The aching even goes down into my testicles. I am having trouble urinating with the kind of pressure that I used too. The stream is weak and it feels kinda different, almost like I have a bladder infection but not really exactly. I keep having to pee a lot at night. I have insomnia. I feel weaker than normal. I have been having lower stomach pain. Loss of appetite. tiredness. My back aches so bad and nothing fixes it. I have tried getting muscle relaxant shots and seen a chiropractor and nothing helps my lower back feel better. The doctor gave me some heavy antibiotics that I have been taking for a week now and there is no difference or it is worse. Do I have stage 4 prostate cancer that has metastasized into my lower back??? Or is something else going on? What could explain these symptoms. The back pain is weird, it hurts when I bend over mostly.",
