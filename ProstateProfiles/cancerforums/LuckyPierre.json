      "Content": "Hello All, New guy here seeking some wisdom/advice. I am a 55-yr old male ,with a father that had PC, two brothers who had PC with prostatectomies, and a third brother with PC scheduled for prostatectomy in a few weeks. I am scheduled for blood work tomorrow to check PSA. Last test was 03/14 and was 1.7. I called Mass General Urology Dept. hoping to get in and see someone on the team, and was told I had to have an elevated PSA, and referral from my PC physician. Needless to say I am slightly nervous and not confident in the PSA testing, and would like to have a biopsy to confirm anything. But to get there might be tough with my healthcare provider. Any comments are greatly appreciated. Enjoy, Pierre",
