After 4 years of hormone therapy and radiation, my PSA remained relatively low (2.0) for a long time. It then started going up last year to 36, upon which I did chemotherapy. This lowered the PSA to 1.7, but has quickly risen to 13. Talking provenge now. Based on the average increased 4 months of life, it hardly seems worth it. Are there any other options out there????
