It would seem to me, however, that in the grand scheme of things, the benefits of getting all the necessary data to make an informed decision about whether to treat, if and so, what treatment to use, would easily outweigh the speculative risk of some cancer cells spreading. Interesting that they did a 3DMB in the first place. I think you're right, the more info is worth it if necessary.",

Since you are not considering surgery, are you thinking of radiation? Both are equally curative, although you should probably consult with top experts in both treatment types just to cover all the bases. Yes, I'm thinking of radiation, maybe cryo. Surgery scares me and I've had a lot of surgery already. I'm still talking to various doctors. From what they saw on the MRI and the 3+4 Gleason score, I don't think I will be doing the AS. Thanks!",

Cryo has the downside of near-total ED. I had discussed this with the leader of a cryo clinical trial at Johns Hopkins. Not for me, please. Regarding the three forms of radiation that I suggested, please try to consult with a specialist in each one, and not let others describe those they don't perform. There is often a surprising knowledge gap about other specialties. OK, thanks. I made an appt. today to see a brachytherapy doc.

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, Thank you for the warm welcome. I have been researching all treatment options and Cryo interests me. It seems that Cryo is one of the new kids on the block (along with HIFU) that does not yet have a lot of studies. And the studies that are out there are limited in duration. Consequently, it isn't surprising that it is not an Accepted Treatment. There is a 2017 study out by Dr. Al Barqawi, el al, who just happens to be one of my doctors here in Denver, that is very encouraging regarding low side effects of treatment, which of course is a major concern, along with cure rates. But it too is limited in duration and total patients enrolled (393 men from 2007 - 20015). It is interesting to me that Cryo is accepted as the salvage treatment for failed radiation therapy, whereby additional radiation may not be possible and surgery would be risky. If the cure rates would be comparable to other treatments and both short term and long term side effects reduced, then it may prove to be additional option for primary treatment. I am scheduled for a prostate MRI at the end of next week and I have also had my biopsy slides sent out for an Oncotype DX test. Hopefully, all of this information will give me a better idea of where I stand and what options are best available to me. Until then the research and reading goes on...and on....and on....and on................. All the best, John",

      "Content": "Hi Chuck, Thank you for the warm welcome. I have been researching all treatment options and Cryo interests me. It seems that Cryo is one of the new kids on the block (along with HIFU) that does not yet have a lot of studies. And the studies that are out there are limited in duration. Consequently, it isn't surprising that it is not an Accepted Treatment. There is a 2017 study out by Dr. Al Barqawi, el al, who just happens to be one of my doctors here in Denver, that is very encouraging regarding low side effects of treatment, which of course is a major concern, along with cure rates. But it too is limited in duration and total patients enrolled (393 men from 2007 - 20015). It is interesting to me that Cryo is accepted as the salvage treatment for failed radiation therapy, whereby additional radiation may not be possible and surgery would be risky. If the cure rates would be comparable to other treatments and both short term and long term side effects reduced, then it may prove to be additional option for primary treatment. I am scheduled for a prostate MRI at the end of next week and I have also had my biopsy slides sent out for an Oncotype DX test. Hopefully, all of this information will give me a better idea of where I stand and what options are best available to me. Until then the research and reading goes on...and on....and on....and on................. All the best, John",

My RO is saying there might be some benefit to me to do a 4 month course of ADT in conjunction with SBRT since my genomic score came back showing an unfavorable intermediate risk. He said it is my decision. I've read about all the bad side effects ADT causes, some pretty serious including possible liver problems. Of course, I don't even know if my insurance company would even pay for ADT given my biopsy results and of they did, if that would affect whether they would then approve SBRT. I was wondering of anybody with intermediate Ca had to make this choice and how they tolerated the ADT. Thanks",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ezhoe First off I'm a total rookie on this, but if your stats are correct you are ..not. unfavorable intermediate risk.. the standard of care for UF risk includes at least short term ADT. if I plug in my stats to a risk program it shows 20% + chance of Lymph node and SV invasion, plus small chance of distant METS. so Adt would be strongly suggested. In your case you may not need ADT.. They are giving me Tomotherapy because of my history of BPH and several years of urinary issues. I got 6mo eligard shot 2 months ago and only 4 treatments of Tomo so far.. SE's are not horrible .. mostly night sweats good luck.. Ed Hey Ed, well the UI comes from the OncotypeDX report. Seems borderline to me, but it's there. Hence the discussion of ADT. I think it could be argued either way, it would have been better for the OCDX report to have come back as just FI. But the consideration is to get the best possible outcome and the short course of ADT is an option. Good luck to you and thanks for the info!",

He has written other pieces in the past with the same opinion from different studies. Perhaps you should google \"allen edel adt sbrt\" to find some of his other articles. https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2...-low-toxicity/ Great article! Thanks, I hadn't seen it. I'll certainly search some more for his articles.",

Titled: \"SBRT has excellent outcomes for intermediate risk patients\" https://pcnrv.blogspot.com/2018/10/s...mp%3B+Views%29 I have a friend/neighbor who was treated by a \"Guru\" in NYC with SBRT about 6 years ago. His recovery was fairly rough but is now doing fine. He did not have ADT. Talk to the URO RO about the recovery process and realistic expectations. I would also ask to speak to 3 patients about their experience. (This is standard regardless of one's treatment decision) Good luck! MF Very encouraging indeed. Thanks!",
