His quality of life was pretty much gone, in and out of the hospital due to low white blood count, pneumonia, blood clots, etc. My father told me if he had the choice again he would decide against Chemotherapy for the extra few month.

It became hormone ref. about 2 years ago and the cancer metastized into his liver and other places. Still he was determined to fight.

My father is in his last stage of cancer now and doctors said he will not have much time left. a few days or weeks maybe. He is very weak, cant get out of bed, but he fought all the way to the end.
