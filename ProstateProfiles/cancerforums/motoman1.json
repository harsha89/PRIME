Had second one at the urologist. Still awaiting results on that one. Thanks andy12, I do tend to get ahead of myself, just worried as this PSA number seems so high compared to others I have seen and I assume the worst. Doesnt statistically say at this high number generally points towards a higher cancer risk?",

      "Content": "Hello, I am so glad I found this support forum. Here is a quick background as to why I am writing here. I am 54, and started having an urgency to urinate that progressed to frequent urination then to painfull urination. My doctor ran a UTI and came back negative and a DRE. he said my prostate was ever so slightly enlarged. Then performed a PSA test. Results came back to 47.3! He recommended a urologist. Urologist performed a PSA first then a DRE and again stated what my doctor said about my prostate that its minimally enlarged. He said he wanted a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast plus delays. I will be having this CT scan next week and have alot of questions regarding possible outcomes. Does this high PSA likely statistically mean cancer? What questions should I be asking? What should I expect from the CT scan? Hope you can help as I am at a loss right now.",
