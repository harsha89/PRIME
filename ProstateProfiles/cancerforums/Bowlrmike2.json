In September of this year, my blood work showed high PSA count, Specific PSA count was alarming so had biopsy. Wow, what a pain. Showed that 6 on right side was cancer. Had MRI and confirmed that 90% cancer and beginning to protrude. Spoke with Oncologist and Surgeon and have decided to have prostate removed upon both of their recommendations. He said Erections are possible but takes therapy and exercises which I am doing now. However because of no testosterone, I have no desire for sex and think I will just feel like giving up on all that. I am wondering as far as pain, catheter and recovery what is realistic from someone who has gone through it. Surgery is December 22.",
