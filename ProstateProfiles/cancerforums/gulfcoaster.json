      "Content": "I was diagnosed with PC several years ago. My Urologist reviewed all my choices with me. I have read forums about all the various types of PC treatments. I found it strange that there is not one preferred procedure to treat PC. Seems like If you live west of Mississippi they love radiation. east of the Mississippi they love Divinci and radical surgery. Is there one recommended procedure the cancer society can endorse? Are there any stats to compare the various procedures. I was floored that the doctor left this choice up to me. I have no access to these stats and data bases the doctors have available to them and yet I have to make the choice. What is being done to provide national guidelines for treatment? Obviously a doctor will follow the procedure he has been trained in and most likely makes him bias. Can anyone post a comparison of all the procedures with stats showing success, failure, after effects, etc. on a side by side chart? As for me, I have chosen AS in hopes of a preferred or new breakthrough in treatment of PC. It's strange, my PSA is raising each year an is currently at 10. I have 2 cores at 10-20% for the first 2 years of biopsy. For some strange reason my latest biopsy came back negative. I can't explain why that happened. My thoughts are perhaps human error in the diagnosis. Scheduled another PSA in 4 months.",

      "Content": "Several years ago my PSA started to raise above 4. My urologist suggested I have a biopsy performed and found 2 of the 12 cores with 10-20% cancer. Over the last 3 years My PSA has raisin from 4 to 6 to 10. The cancer was slow moving ( thank goodness ). The second year followed about what the first year results showed. Now the mystery begins. This week I received a call from my urologist and he informed me the current results did not show any cancer. This should be great news but in the back of my mind someone must have screwed up. My PSA is at 10. Any idea as to what's going on? I am scheduled for another PSA in 4 months.",
