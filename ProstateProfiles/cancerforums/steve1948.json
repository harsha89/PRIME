      "Content": "I had prostate surgery 8/5/14 and am struggling with incontinence. I am 66 years old. I started back to work on 9/2/14 and wear Depend underwear 24-7. I am continuing to do kegel exercises but have to slack off sometimes because of soreness. I have read comments that incontinence can take a year to improve. Seems like the general opinion is to have patience, it will improve eventually. Question I have is do the pelvic muscles and other muscles that control urine flow heal themselves from surgery over time whether I do kegel exercises or not? Thanks for your comments.",
