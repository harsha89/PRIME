      "Content": "My understanding is that the PSA result is generally an indication of the size of the prostate. That will increase with trauma, infection, age and cancer. Things like a DRE, bike riding and sex MAY all irritate the prostate inflaming it somewhat and thereby result in a higher reading. I had a prostate infection (had no idea you could get one) and they did a PSA. It read 15, up from my \"normal\" 4.5 from the year before. Once the infection was cleared the PSA was retested and came in at 8. Still high for me but obviously WAY down from the swollen with infection reading. And yes, a biopsy after that 8 reading came back positive for Gleason 6 cancer. If you're getting your PSA each year try and do it at the same time of day with no unusual activities that might irritate the organ. My 2 cents.",

I'll continue to soldier through it and do all I can to progress but this whole dealing with pads and such keeps me tense, as my wife has gently pointed out. I am truly enjoying the Man O War piss ability PDV mentions. I stepped out to the yard with the dogs and relieved myself. The stream landed 4 feet in front of me. Had to pace it off and brag to the wife. She was not overly impressed but seemed happy for me! Its those little things you have to be grateful for! I'll post updates in the weeks ahead.

      "Content": "Incontinence has been the frustrating part of all this so far for me. Getting info from others is only anecdotal but it helps to know you're not alone. That's what prompted me to post this. Hope it helps others. Surgery was August 25th. Doc is Alex Philpott at Urology Center of Colorado. Went well overall. Had the cath in for 8 long, irritable days. You get into a rhythm after a while, like anything else. Being 50 with no prior incontinence issues of any kind I had hoped to get past that post op phase fairly quickly. Let me say, it's a slooow go for most guys. I've been a Kegel maniac since a month before surgery. Usually 3 sets of 10-15 (10 second holds) 3 times a day. Been doing \"clam\" type leg lifts for last 3 weeks. I get in a 1/4 to 1/2 mile walk twice a day. Meaning, I completely soak a fresh pad twice a day. Here's where I've been so far. Week 1: Catheter in. Leaks around catheter. Lying down is only relaxing position. Have to sleep on your back. Week 2: Catheter out. OH YEAH! Glad to see that go. Pretty much ZERO urine control. Unless I'm sitting, it's dripping. Lying down is ok. Walking creates a steady stream. Week 3: Just like week two. No noticeable progress. Went to PT appointment to get Kegel instruction. Apparently I'm a natural. Week 4: Venturing out to work half days. Home napping in afternoon. I have a desk job so I just walk to my office and sit. I only get up for a restroom visit or to leave. If I worked on my feet I would have stayed home. Week 5: Another week of half days. Had a good afternoon Monday with some ability to stand with limited leakage and even walk without a total bladder evacuation. It's the first time I sensed any non-conscious support from my urinary tract. Not much but it's SOMETHING! Then backslide. Rest of week is back to week 4 status. Week 6: Getting some sense of natural help from the muscles again. Able to stand still with little leakage. Ditched the pull up pads (except for convenience at night and hell, I paid for those damn things!), just using thick insert pads. Moving around is still not good. Even pinching tight as I can I'm getting major leakage on slow, careful walks to the men's room. Week 7: Best so far. Standing no longer a big concern. Need to be careful about quick movements. Walking more than a few dozen yards is just not practical. Still lots of leaking. Being on my feet to work in the garage, walk around the mall or whatever is not a good experience. For the most part though, the \"gushers\" are gone and control is feeling like a possibility in near future. I've got my 6 week (7 really) PSA test and doc conference this week. Hoping for low to no PSA and further incontinence improvements. Planning work travel for end of October so wish me luck!",

Even pinching tight as I can I'm getting major leakage on slow, careful walks to the men's room. Week 7: Best so far. Standing no longer a big concern. Need to be careful about quick movements. Walking more than a few dozen yards is just not practical. Still lots of leaking. Being on my feet to work in the garage, walk around the mall or whatever is not a good experience. For the most part though, the \"gushers\" are gone and control is feeling like a possibility in near future. I've got my 6 week (7 really) PSA test and doc conference this week. Hoping for low to no PSA and further incontinence improvements. Planning work travel for end of October so wish me luck!",

      "Content": "Incontinence has been the frustrating part of all this so far for me. Getting info from others is only anecdotal but it helps to know you're not alone. That's what prompted me to post this. Hope it helps others. Surgery was August 25th. Doc is Alex Philpott at Urology Center of Colorado. Went well overall. Had the cath in for 8 long, irritable days. You get into a rhythm after a while, like anything else. Being 50 with no prior incontinence issues of any kind I had hoped to get past that post op phase fairly quickly. Let me say, it's a slooow go for most guys. I've been a Kegel maniac since a month before surgery. Usually 3 sets of 10-15 (10 second holds) 3 times a day. Been doing \"clam\" type leg lifts for last 3 weeks. I get in a 1/4 to 1/2 mile walk twice a day. Meaning, I completely soak a fresh pad twice a day. Here's where I've been so far. Week 1: Catheter in. Leaks around catheter. Lying down is only relaxing position. Have to sleep on your back. Week 2: Catheter out. OH YEAH! Glad to see that go. Pretty much ZERO urine control. Unless I'm sitting, it's dripping. Lying down is ok. Walking creates a steady stream. Week 3: Just like week two. No noticeable progress. Went to PT appointment to get Kegel instruction. Apparently I'm a natural. Week 4: Venturing out to work half days. Home napping in afternoon. I have a desk job so I just walk to my office and sit. I only get up for a restroom visit or to leave. If I worked on my feet I would have stayed home. Week 5: Another week of half days. Had a good afternoon Monday with some ability to stand with limited leakage and even walk without a total bladder evacuation. It's the first time I sensed any non-conscious support from my urinary tract. Not much but it's SOMETHING! Then backslide. Rest of week is back to week 4 status. Week 6: Getting some sense of natural help from the muscles again. Able to stand still with little leakage. Ditched the pull up pads (except for convenience at night and hell, I paid for those damn things!), just using thick insert pads. Moving around is still not good. Even pinching tight as I can I'm getting major leakage on slow, careful walks to the men's room. Week 7: Best so far. Standing no longer a big concern. Need to be careful about quick movements. Walking more than a few dozen yards is just not practical. Still lots of leaking. Being on my feet to work in the garage, walk around the mall or whatever is not a good experience. For the most part though, the \"gushers\" are gone and control is feeling like a possibility in near future. I've got my 6 week (7 really) PSA test and doc conference this week.

      "Content": "Incontinence has been the frustrating part of all this so far for me. Getting info from others is only anecdotal but it helps to know you're not alone. That's what prompted me to post this. Hope it helps others. Surgery was August 25th. Doc is Alex Philpott at Urology Center of Colorado. Went well overall. Had the cath in for 8 long, irritable days. You get into a rhythm after a while, like anything else. Being 50 with no prior incontinence issues of any kind I had hoped to get past that post op phase fairly quickly. Let me say, it's a slooow go for most guys. I've been a Kegel maniac since a month before surgery. Usually 3 sets of 10-15 (10 second holds) 3 times a day. Been doing \"clam\" type leg lifts for last 3 weeks. I get in a 1/4 to 1/2 mile walk twice a day. Meaning, I completely soak a fresh pad twice a day. Here's where I've been so far. Week 1: Catheter in. Leaks around catheter. Lying down is only relaxing position. Have to sleep on your back. Week 2: Catheter out. OH YEAH! Glad to see that go. Pretty much ZERO urine control. Unless I'm sitting, it's dripping. Lying down is ok. Walking creates a steady stream. Week 3: Just like week two. No noticeable progress. Went to PT appointment to get Kegel instruction. Apparently I'm a natural. Week 4: Venturing out to work half days. Home napping in afternoon. I have a desk job so I just walk to my office and sit. I only get up for a restroom visit or to leave. If I worked on my feet I would have stayed home. Week 5: Another week of half days. Had a good afternoon Monday with some ability to stand with limited leakage and even walk without a total bladder evacuation. It's the first time I sensed any non-conscious support from my urinary tract. Not much but it's SOMETHING! Then backslide. Rest of week is back to week 4 status. Week 6: Getting some sense of natural help from the muscles again. Able to stand still with little leakage. Ditched the pull up pads (except for convenience at night and hell, I paid for those damn things!), just using thick insert pads. Moving around is still not good. Even pinching tight as I can I'm getting major leakage on slow, careful walks to the men's room. Week 7: Best so far. Standing no longer a big concern. Need to be careful about quick movements. Walking more than a few dozen yards is just not practical. Still lots of leaking. Being on my feet to work in the garage, walk around the mall or whatever is not a good experience. For the most part though, the \"gushers\" are gone and control is feeling like a possibility in near future. I've got my 6 week (7 really) PSA test and doc conference this week. Hoping for low to no PSA and further incontinence improvements. Planning work travel for end of October so wish me luck!",

      "Content": "Good to hear some similar tales. Like oshguy I too am not a patient man. I'll continue to soldier through it and do all I can to progress but this whole dealing with pads and such keeps me tense, as my wife has gently pointed out. I am truly enjoying the Man O War piss ability PDV mentions. I stepped out to the yard with the dogs and relieved myself. The stream landed 4 feet in front of me. Had to pace it off and brag to the wife. She was not overly impressed but seemed happy for me! Its those little things you have to be grateful for! I'll post updates in the weeks ahead. Others please do too.",
