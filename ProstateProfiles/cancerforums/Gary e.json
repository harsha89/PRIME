Via the liver or kidney or does it become dormant in the body until it awakens 3 years from now and will become a psa number just when we think it was defeated.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Looks great so far Gary e! The HT likely has a role in this rapid 16 x decline in PSA - which is exactly what is supposed to happen. HT, by some mechanism of action, causes PCa cells to be more susceptible to radiation. I suspect that your #s will continue to decrease to \"<\" 0.01 ng/ml. May they remain there permanently! How are you feeling so far? MF Thanks for the info mike. Doing rather well with usual hot flashes wondering how low can it go unless a micro psa test is required next time. I hope your word permanent is realistic as previous guys answered my ? About c cells leavingn or just becoming dormant. My take from this is when we get off ht firmagon in my case does the testosterone come back for dormant c cells to feed on and again multiply. Perhaps the doctor can in a way snip the source of testosterone so we can keep low. I guess losing twins down their is better than going thru ht. and IMRT again if needed. : Gary e",
