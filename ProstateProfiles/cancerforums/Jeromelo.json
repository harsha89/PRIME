      "Content": "Info for me Jerry as of 10/2011 54 Male, 5'-7\" 140lbs PSA .50 No health issues, no erectile dysfunction, no urinary issues, no family history of any cancer, eat very healthy, very active. I had a clean colonoscopy the doc said I had a nodule on my prostrate and suggested I get it checked out. Doc suggested a 12 point prostrate biopsy. Results found a \"microscopic focus of invasive prostatic adenocarcisonoma 3+3 gleason 6. After explaining options he recommended surgery or pellets not watchful waiting or active surveillance. After researching I decided to ignore him and go on with my life with no further doctor visits until lately. Info for me 10/2016 (five years later) same as above, except getting allergy shots obvious reasons. PSA .60 instead of .50 five years previous. I got a prostrate MRI that will be found below. The doctor had his PA call me that he wants to do a focused biopsy using the MRI as a template. Before I meet with him I want opinions on my MRI results. From the information I've been able to obtain there seems to be a good argument for not getting this biopsy. I'd appreciate any comments/info you can provide Thx. -Jerry EXAMINATION: MRI Prostate WO Cnt, 10/12/2016 9:24:00 AM COMPARISON: None INDICATION: Nodule TECHNIQUE: MRI prostate without contrast includes the following sequences: -Coronal T2 fat-sat whole pelvis -Axial T1 FSPGR whole pelvis -Coronal T2 small field-of-view -Axial T2 small field-of-view -Sagittal T2 small field-of-view -Axial DWI B. 50, 450, 1000 and 1500 FINDINGS: Of note, this exam is mildly limited by exclusion of the prostate apex from the field-of-view. Prostate volume: The prostate measures 2.8 x 4.5 x 2.7 cm (AP x LR x SI), for a total volume of 17.8 cc. CENTRAL GLAND Heterogeneous signal within the central gland, within expected limits. No focal convincing tumor identified. RIGHT PERIPHERAL ZONE Base: Normal T2 signal. Mid gland: There is mildly decreased T2 weighted signal demonstrated in the right mid gland extending inferiorly into the apex, measuring approximately 1.3 x 1.0 cm and 1.3 cm cranial caudal. Moderately decreased ADC signal is demonstrated in this distribution. There is associated mild bulging of the capsule without direct extracapsular extension. Apex: As above. LEFT PERIPHERAL ZONE Base: Normal T2 signal. Mid gland: There is amorphous mildly decreased T2/ADC weighted signal lesion in the lateral aspect of the mid gland, measuring 0.9 x 1.2 cm,. This lesion extends inferiorly into the right lateral apex Apex: As above Seminal vesicles: The seminal vesicles are symmetrically distended. There is no seminal vesicle nodule or mass. Lymph nodes: No pathologic lymphadenopathy Bone marrow: No abnormal marrow signal to suggest osseous metastatic disease in the pelvis. Moderate bilateral hip joint posture arthritis is demonstrated, left greater than right. Other: There is no free fluid in the pelvis. IMPRESSION: 1. Right peripheral zone mid gland and apex lesion measuring 1.3 x 1.0 x 1.3 cm, PI-RADS 3. There is capsular bulging without extracapsular extension. 2. Left peripheral zone mid gland and apex lesion measuring 0.9 x 1.2 x 1.0 cm, PI-RADS 3. There is left lateral capsular bulging without extracapsular extension. This exam was separately processed on the DynaCad server for MR ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy.",
