      "Content": "As I posted last week I have had a prostatectomy (4th March) and was told that I would have to have a catheter in place for 3 weeks. When my appointment came through for a TWOC it was 3 weeks and 5 days later (should be removed today). On phoning the hospital for an admission time I was told they didn't have a bed for me and I now have to wait until Monday ... 4 weeks post surgery. I am already worried about the incontinence and want to begin the kegel exercises again. Is it going to make it worse by leaving the catheter in place for this long? Just about everything has gone wrong - keyhole surgery was abandoned and after 2 hours in theatre the surgeon had to resort to full open surgery, wound opened up after 12 days, urinary infection and now an extra week with catheter. Is anything going to be straightforward for me I wonder!",

Being in UK my op was carried out under the NHS so no choice of surgeons although my surgeon is highly respected as a specialist in the field. It looks like your PSA test results are all over the place!!",

      "Content": "I haven't been on here for some time and just thought I would post an update on my condition. Basically I've had a hell of a time since my prostatectomy. If you've read previous threads you'll know that I've suffered with wound opening, catheter in for just over 4 weeks, infections and very slow to pass urine. Well the list goes on ... I have had constant infections, catheter back in for a further 2 weeks, severe strictures which prevent urine flow completely culminating in a 2 night hospial stay last week after the district nurse attempted to insert 3 different sized catheters at home with no luck then the nurse at hospital tried 2 more and called the doctor who also had a go!!! Between them they must have nudged something and I began to drip (literally) urine which relieved the pressure. I am now booked in for another operation in 2 weeks time to hopefully sort the problem out. I'm just keeping my fingers crossed because I can't go on like this. I am pleased for most of you on this site who have had a prostatectomy as it seems the vast majority come through unscathed but let my story be a warning to anyone weighing up the pro's and cons of surgery. We don't all come through recovery text book style and there ARE problems and related health issues to be aware of.",

I am only able to dribble when I pee. My bladder feels full but the flow is painfully slow. It can take up to 5 minutes to empty. Does anyone else have this problem? I have an apt to see my consultant on 8th May and have seen my GP several times over the past few weeks but he's not a great help ... hasn't once examined me, just pushes pills. Any advice?",

      "Content": "Yes I agree with newporter, it sounds like it could be either infection or urethral stricture. I sincerely hope it's infection. I had my prostatectomy 3 months ago and have been plagued with strictures. If this is what it is you will have increased urge to urinate, flow will be restricted, gradually decreasing and it will be painful to pass. I have been dilated once, had several catheters, been taught self dilation and still get a stricture once every 2 weeks. I am now waiting for further surgery so my fingers are crossed that a course of antibiotics will relieve your symptoms!",

Catheter was removed 2 weeks ago and since then he has been getting up to pee anything between 6 and 12 times [U]a night[U] I have done a little research on the internet but find that people complain if they are up 4 times a night . He has an infection which he is taking antibiotics for but he had this problem before he started taking them and it is continuing and not getting any better. Are we expecting too much? Is 6 to 12 times excessive at this stage? Other than that he does not leak at all which is good but the lack of sleep can't be good for him??",
