      "Content": "Thank you guys. I don't know if you remember, but my guy has a similar story to yours in that his prostate was, I think, about 100 gr. His surgeon said it was the size of his head but I'm sure that's an exaggeration. :-/ That caused difficulties before surgery so his nerves took a beating I'm sure. He gets a partial erection, but not usable and we are 23 months out. It's hard not to believe the odds are against us, but I know there are options out there. Another problem is that he has never been very cooperative in following the doctor's directions on penile rehab. I'm not inclined to nag, but have encouraged him to use the pump for rehab. He's a grown man and it's up to him to do this, but I wonder how much it really helps anyway.",

He is still showing undetectable PSA's almost 2 years post RP. He is totally continent but ED is still very prevalent. We are both thinking that ED will not be going away due to the time that has passed but the VED works well for us. I can tell it bothers him and because of that, I have to make the moves to get things started, but he is willing. I wish he felt as enthusiastic about sex as I do but he said he is still tramautised. Damn this disease Oh a happy note, we are crazy in love and he's alive. That's really all that matters.",

      "Content": "Hey friends: My guy is one year post RP and still experiencing ED. I know that is not uncommon so I'm not worried about that. I want to make sure we are giving him the best opportunity for near normal love making. We currently use the VED successfully. He gets about half mast during foreplay, but we've seen no difference with or without generic Viagra. He is hesitant to take a full 100 mgs, but has done so with no real difference. The half mast doesn't last long enough nor is it hard enough for intercourse. My questions: 1) The generic V we got from an online source from India. I won't post the name of the company since I'm thinking it's not allowed, but the name starts with an A (hint). I've heard the company is reputable, but I've also heard there is no real generic V and the pill could be dangerous. Thoughts? 2) Can he take the pill and have a small meal afterwards instead of starving? If so, how long after? I wonder if his stomach is really empty when taking it a couple hours after dinner. Thanks for your help and advice.",

Just remember guys, if you treat us well and can hold us, kiss us, and caress us that goes a long way for a woman. If you're having problems in this area, don't spill the beans on the first date. Let us fall for you and then, when the time is right, let us know about your ED. It's not deceit, it's good timing. If we love you, we'll stay, but you have to let us love you first.",

I wanted to share our happy news that he asked me to marry him on Christmas day. This marks a huge milestone in his healing. We all know what this PC thing can do to a man's self esteem. The ED is still there but he is realizing that you can still have a full life while living with the side effects of a prostatectomy. ( He had the nerve sparing procedure and is 13 months out, so there is still hope.) He remains cancer free and that's all that really matters. We are truly blessed.",
