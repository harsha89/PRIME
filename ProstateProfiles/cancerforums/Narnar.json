      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi Ron! So on another note, How are you getting along? MF Seam to be doing quite well, not having any problems or symptoms. As a matter of fact I feel better than I have in a few years. I started going to the gym and changed my diet. As a result I have dropped about 35 lbs. That in turn enabled me to get off my blood pressure meds altogether.

The purpose of Thur trial is to see if localized treatment in metastatic cancer helps improves life span. I accepted and was randomized today into the group that receives treatment. As you can see from my signature I have local mets of 1 spot on the spine. My options are have my prostate removed by Dr. Chapin or have radiation by the team RO to destroy the leasons in my prostate. This is a difficult decision to make, however I am leaning to removal after ready a report by Dr. Walsh who feels like it is bennifical to temove the primary leason. He thinks it will slow down the spread of mets. Any thoughts or comments on this. Ron",

The hot flashes, being tired most of the time and waking up with my mouth feeling like I been eating cotton, just to name a few of the new things in my life. However overall I am doing ok. My PSA has been dropping every since I had my surgery in April of 2017. It\u0092s currently at 0.1 and it started at 62. My last 2 scans show my tumors have shrunk so the surgery and the lupron are working. I just pray they continue to work for a long time. I want to thank everyone for all the info, prayers and support I have received the past couple years. Kindest Regards, Ron Smith",

My surgery is scheduled for Tuesday morning I have to admit I am starting to get a little nervous. It was a hard decision to make surgery or radiation, I guess only time will tell. Oh well no looking back now it happens in 4 days. Now, I just hope it helps the way they think it will. If you are not familiar with the trial or haven't read my previous posts is to prove that removing or radiating the primary leison will slow down the spread of the metastasis. Ron",

The Feb. 8th date is just when I have to decide if I want to proceed or not. FYI the trips to TX are no problems for me. The reason I chose MDA in the first place instead of something closer is my daughter lives there and is an rn there, so I have place to stay get 24 hour care and the best part I get to play with my 2 grandkids for a week or two. Sorry I didn't explain everything better in my post.",

      "Content": "I got a call from MDA they want me to come back Feb. 8th and take part in a trial. It is called M1 trial, to see if local treatment of pc that has metastasized will extend the life expectancy of pc patients. They will either radiate or remove the prostate whichever we decide would work best. It is a randomized study so I would have a 50 / 50 chance of treatment at this time. However if the tumers start to grow at anytime they will move you into the treatment side of the study. Any thoughts from any of you longtime pc brothers will be appreciated.",
