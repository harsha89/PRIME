Take some time and do the research on various treatments (different types of radiation and surgery). Based on your stats, treatment is in order. Did the report say that they found cancer on both sides of the prostate? This and the previous question help determine the stage. Feel free to ask away with any specific questions and someone will certainly respond. Good Luck and keep us updated! Report stated all quadrants were positive for cancer. Im not knowledgeable enough to know if there was cancer on both sides. Did have ct scan which was negative, cystscopy to check bladder which was clean and urine cytology that came back atypical. Urologist wanted to do biopsy because dre was fine",
