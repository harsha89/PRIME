      "Content": "I've read that getting chemo once you're castration-resistant doesn't buy you much more time--a couple of months additional life expectancy on average. I don't mean he only has 2 months to live! I mean that the studies they've done show that getting chemo vs. not getting chemo at this point in the disease progression only adds a couple of months to his life expectancy. Having just gone through chemo myself, I don't know that I'd choose that path myself. If you haven't read Atul Gawande's book, Being Mortal, I would recommend it as a way to help you in conversations with doctors. What hormone therapy has he had? If he's just done Lupron and Casodex, there are some other hormone therapy approaches that can sometimes help bring the PSA back down. Xtandi is one. There is also Provenge, which is an immunotherapy approach, though I haven't heard that it adds all that much to life expectancy. Does he have a urologist as well as an oncologist? A urologist might have some ideas to try in addition to or instead of chemo. Wishing you and your dad the best.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. Yes, I've always gotten a DRE along with a PSA since I turned 50 (am 58 years old). Last spring doc said the prostate felt normal. My father got prostate cancer at age 70 and lasted 10 years before dying from it. This has been a very stressful year due to a physical move and change of jobs. In the past few months I suddenly had ED and in the last couple of weeks I've had soreness in my lower back and achy legs in the evening but have felt fine in the morning. Who knows what's going on. I will ask for another PSA when I see the Uro Monday, but I do think my regular doc was surprised enough at the result that he ran the PSA twice. I am also scheduled for an MRI on Monday. I guess I was just trying to figure out whether the huge jump was a \"this never happens\" kind of thing or a \"this may be an aggressive cancer\" kind of thing.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. Yes, I've always gotten a DRE along with a PSA since I turned 50 (am 58 years old). Last spring doc said the prostate felt normal. My father got prostate cancer at age 70 and lasted 10 years before dying from it. This has been a very stressful year due to a physical move and change of jobs. In the past few months I suddenly had ED and in the last couple of weeks I've had soreness in my lower back and achy legs in the evening but have felt fine in the morning. Who knows what's going on. I will ask for another PSA when I see the Uro Monday, but I do think my regular doc was surprised enough at the result that he ran the PSA twice. I am also scheduled for an MRI on Monday. I guess I was just trying to figure out whether the huge jump was a \"this never happens\" kind of thing or a \"this may be an aggressive cancer\" kind of thing.",

This week it was \"over 150\" (lab couldn't yield accurate result above 150). Appointment set up with urologist for next week. My question: Does such a large jump in what to me seems a short time signify fast growing cancer? Spread of cancer? Is it possible to have a big jump like this and NOT have cancer? The information on the internet seems so unhelpful. Thanks.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the replies. Yes, I've always gotten a DRE along with a PSA since I turned 50 (am 58 years old). Last spring doc said the prostate felt normal. My father got prostate cancer at age 70 and lasted 10 years before dying from it. This has been a very stressful year due to a physical move and change of jobs. In the past few months I suddenly had ED and in the last couple of weeks I've had soreness in my lower back and achy legs in the evening but have felt fine in the morning. Who knows what's going on. I will ask for another PSA when I see the Uro Monday, but I do think my regular doc was surprised enough at the result that he ran the PSA twice. I am also scheduled for an MRI on Monday. I guess I was just trying to figure out whether the huge jump was a \"this never happens\" kind of thing or a \"this may be an aggressive cancer\" kind of thing.",

I know everyone is different but would anyone mind sharing their experience? If your father has any difficulties with Taxotere, his doctor should be able to make a case to the insurer (if insured) to use Jevtana instead. It supposedly works better and is much more easily tolerated. It also costs over 100x as much. I had Jevtana from April-July for all six of my treatments and didn't lose hair, have digestive issues, or all the other nasty side effects. Hope it goes well and please keep us up to date.

When I was diagnosed with stage 4 a year ago, one reason I went to the doctor was because of lower back pain as well as some pain in my hip and right leg. An MRI showed a probable tumor in my lumbar spine that was possibly pressing on the nerves. The pain went away with the start of HT, but now it is back. I've been able to sleep and work by taking Advil, but I want to know what's causing the pain and what can be done about it. I see the Onco tomorrow...will post an update after that.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ontheroad I am so sorry to read this as i head for my last of 6 Docetaxel treatments on Monday 10/31. I have dropped my PSA from high of over 650 in march to less than 3 as of 10/10, and hopefully now it will go down again and get me under 1.0.....but the fear is what you are saying, that the damn thing will go up as soon as the chemo is done and then I will be headed back to chemo again with almost no break. Stage 4 sucks - as we think things are getting better but behind the curtain is the nasty Pca which seems to find it's way to grow and keep us in treatment unending.....let me know what your Onc says - and i am sorry you are headed back up - i know how much the chemo treatments just freaking mess with your life and peace. Keep your chin up brother and let us know what the Onc wants to do. Thanks, OTR. THe Onc says he's not worried and no change to treatment. I don't know if he expects it to fluctuate or what. I will have it checked next month, so we'll see. I don't think I meet the diagnostic criteria yet for castration-resistant. Hang in there. From what I've heard, Docetaxel is no fun. I had an easier time, with Jevtana for my chemo.",

When I was diagnosed with stage 4 a year ago, one reason I went to the doctor was because of lower back pain as well as some pain in my hip and right leg. An MRI showed a probable tumor in my lumbar spine that was possibly pressing on the nerves. The pain went away with the start of HT, but now it is back. I've been able to sleep and work by taking Advil, but I want to know what's causing the pain and what can be done about it. I see the Onco tomorrow...will post an update after that.

Keep your chin up brother and let us know what the Onc wants to do. Thanks, OTR. THe Onc says he's not worried and no change to treatment. I don't know if he expects it to fluctuate or what.

      "Content": "I was slated to have Taxotere, but my onco got the insurance company to approve the more expensive drug, Jevtana. He has seen it be more effective, and it is much easier to tolerate. I've had 5 of 6 treatments, and I haven't had hair loss, nausea, mouth sores, or extremity nerve pain. If there is any way he can have Jevtana instead of Taxotere, it might be much easier on him. I am puzzled by why he would only take bicalutamide for 21 days. I'd expect him to have to take it until it stops working. My case has some similarities to your fathers: PSA 200, widespread bone mets, Gleason 10, low back pain due to lumbar nerve impingement (which has gone away now).",
