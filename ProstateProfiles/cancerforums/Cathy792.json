I wanted to get some first had advice from others. I think it would be good to for him to hear about other peoples experiences.

I thank your all for yoir insight it has given me a great sense of relief. i can tell you he is 54. And he had blood tests that detected something which prompted the doctor to do further investigations. Maybe thats the psa your talking about. You have to excuse my ignorance while im not up on the terminology of things just yet im sure i will learn. He then had a digital rectal exam where a lump was felt. He was unable to go for a mri as he has metal fragments in his body. Hence then came the biopsy. Then this result. I will update the profile when the info comes to hand. There will be a slim chance of getting my partner on here as he doesnt use computers and forums like this are completely foriegn to him but i will encoursge him.
