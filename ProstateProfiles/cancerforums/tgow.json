      "Content": "Chrisjc, I'm a diabetic too, so perhaps I can help you gain better control of your blood sugar. Newporter gave some good advice. From your post it sounds like you've got little wiggle room, my friend. Specifically, in my unprofessional opinion you should immediately begin a low carb diet, avoiding starchy/ high carb. foods like potatoes, milk, breads, and grains of all kinds. Cut back or eliminate fruits, especially tropical fruits that contain higher levels of sugar. Eat 6 small meals instead of three big ones. Check your BS before each meal, and again 1.5 hours afterwards. Eliminate, or drastically reduce, those foods that spike the BS. Try eating veggies, meat, eggs, cheese, nuts and seeds. Drink water, tea, and coffee. Avoid sugar drinks. Exercise every day. A simple 30 minute walk after one of your meals will go a long way in burning off sugar. Try lifting weights. Fill a couple of bottles with water to use as weights. You will lose weight and lower the BS. Best of luck, and I wish good health to you.",

      "Content": "http://www.dietdoctor.com/lchf Interesting study, thanks for posting. After a dx of Type 2 Diabetes in Feburary I adopted a Low carb/High fat diet. To be honest I was skeptical at first as it just went against the normal message we often hear about eating healthy. I mean when was the last time you heard about fat as being anything but bad. The link posted here is basically my new approach and after losing 40 lbs. and improving other indicators like trigs. and BP, I'm sold on it. Walk down any aisle of all the grocery stores and read the label on just about all the products. You'll see wheat, flour, and some form of sugar in it most likely. Just way too many carbs. I'am taking Metformin to help control my blood sugar and it does help in the weight loss, but even without it I believe most anybody can slim down and improve their health. Currently my A1c is 5.5 and I'm on the cusp of eliminating the Met. and controlling my BS with this diet and exercise alone. I'am not hungry and it's the fat in this diet that helps with that. And, my exercise routine is minimal. I walk about 30 minutes a day. That's it, full disclosure. Losing weight, and eating real food plays a much bigger role in fighting Pca, or any disease, its recurrance or complications than we realize, IMO.",

      "Content": "Got it, thanks. The only animal fat I'm incorporating into my diet is what occurs naturally in the meat. I know from Dr. Walsh's book that red meat is not that great. Tuna if I remember is better. I'm just trying to lose weight to improve the general health and lower my blood sugar. The fat satisfies my hunger. My options on food are limited compared to a non-diabetic. It's a dilemma, and I think shedding the extra pounds will be beneficial even though consuming some animal fat is not the best for Pca.",

      "Content": "Hi Dave, and thanks. I eat very little fruit. Peel a couple of tart green apples, like Granny Smith's, cut them up and make apple sauce. Might eat two small spoonfuls twice a week. Also, I'll drop a few berries in a salad sometimes. Fruit causes my BS to spike, so I go easy with it. Not really counting carbs per day as much as per meal. Try to keep it under 20 per meal, and that is really not difficult. My portions are smaller, so I'll do 5-6 small meals as opposed to 3 big ones if my schedules allows. Again, with the smaller portions my BS is less likely to spike. At first I was really strict on myself and didn't eat any fat. Just couldn't grasp the concept of high fat. Ketosis induced itself at that time. I use a lot of olive oil and like the natural fats in the foods. Probably eat 20 eggs per week, beef, pork, salmon and tuna, veggies. Not as strict now with bread as I've discovered low carb tortillas, but still limit those. Can enjoy a ham and cheese sandwich using lettuce leaves as bread slices. I guess to answer your question I'm like the woman on the TV ad with Terry Bradshaw; counting, measuring, weighing -- no, no, and no.....lol.",
