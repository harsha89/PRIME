      "Content": "Thanks for the encouraging words Chuck - sometimes I'm OK with what lies ahead and sometimes I read something negative and I have doubt. Good advice on checking the number of surgeries - which I will do at my appointment next week. I'm not at all afraid of surgery (have had before for something unrelated) - it's more a concern about the quality of life outcome,,the better the surgeon the better the result, right?! Cheers (and glad I found this forum - very necessary for those of us new to this scary game), Brian Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Sadly happy to welcome you as a member of \"the club.\" But the good news is that your PC, as the doctor said, most likely IS still confined to the prostate. This is not the end of your world -- it is merely the beginning of the rest of a very, very long life. Your FULL lifespan. Too bad he doesn't do da Vinci robotic surgery also. I've had robotic surgery, but am not as familiar with laparoscopic except that it is minimally invasive like robotic, but without the robotic features. I'm sure the cure rate is pretty much the same though. These techniques have about the same cure rate as traditional \"open\" surgery. Has your doctor done several hundred of the laparoscopic ones? Ask him this and also about his positive margin rate. If he doesn't have hundreds of surgeries behind him, you might want to seek a 300+ uro/surgeon who does da Vinci OR open. But, if this doctor is highly qualified, and you are comfortable with him, you should be okay. The skill of the doctor is the most critical thing in avoiding positive margins (when possible) and also in reconstructing the urethra and sparing the erection controlling nerves (when possible). Yup, younger patients do tend to recover faster and more completely (in terms of continence, sexual function, etc), so it sounds like you're on your way to being cured. Remember the key though -- be sure that the surgeon is highly experienced and highly competent. That's number one. Good luck! Chuck",

      "Content": "I'm 49, otherwise healthy male. At 42 my first psa test was 0.2. At 47 on a routine physical my psa was 4.5. DRE was negative. 6 months later my PSA was 5.9, DRE negative. Referred to urologist - recommended biopsy. I had concious sedation - no pain, just some quick initial discomfort. Anticipation was much worse than actual procedure. Cancer found in two cores, 4+3 and 3+4. Surgery scheduled for 8 weeks after biopsy (you don't want surgery too soon after biopsy and it doesn't make any difference in long-term survival rate - READ Dr. Patrick Walsh's - How to survive prostate cancer - I just downloaded on google play for 10 bucks, well worth it!). Doctor says excellent chance that I can be completely cured and as I have a long life ahead of me, surgery is by far the best option. My biopsy SAVED my life - get it done!",
