      "Content": "Thank you all for your replies and advice. Something I'm learning quickly is to not blindly trust what doctors say, to research and ask questions. Honestly, neither of us recall being told he had positive margins after surgery in 2009, but after the radiology consult, we requested all medical, surgical and path notes from the surgeon, urologist (not the same as the surgeon because we moved across the country) and the radiologist. We found mis-information on the radiologist notes too. It's a stressful time, we want to find a doctor that we can trust, one that actually remembers we are humans (worried ones) and not numbers or dollar signs. Jim215, I'd like to ink it was a miscommunication, but that urologist has 2 previous PSA results in the .2x range and waited until it jumped to .56 to send us to a radiologist, and he distinctly told my husband he wasn't concerned yet. It's very confusing to me as well. Again, I sure appreciate everyone's replies!",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this forum and hoping to find some information regarding salvage options for my husband. He had a Da Vinci radical prostatectomy in 2009 (age 47), and his PSA began creeping up in 2012. Of concern to us, the urologist we have indicated he wasn't concerned until he hit 2, but at the last test of .56 (doubled from .28 over 10 months), he recommended we do a consult with a radiologist to discuss a treatment plan when it became necessary down the road. My husband works overseas so it took us 2 months to set that consult up (we didn't have any sense of urgency at the time). At consult, we were shocked to hear this Dr felt we should have already started treatment, and wanted to start right away. The catch being my husband was leaving back overseas in less than 48 hours, and we needed more than 48 hours to come to grips with this. My husband was concerned by the possible long term / permenant side effects (primarily incontinence and bowel damage) that were mentioned from IMRT. That night we saw a commercial proton therapy, stating it had better accuracy and less side effects, and wondered if that may be a salvage option (we're unclear as there is no direct tumor or organ to target). He is now back overseas and making notifications to his employer that he'll need time stateside for treatment soon while I'm trying to get information on treatment options. This is proving to be very frustrating trying to coordinate my husband (facing a 16 hour time difference) giving authorization to these centers to talk to me, especially as he isnt yet a patient yet. Does anyone have any advice or information to share? I greatly appreciate any feed back!!",
