      "Content": "A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring. There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain And drinking largely sobers us again. - Alexander Pope, 1709 I\u0092m a 67-yo retired technical writer who\u0092s never had a serious illness. My high PSA score and subsequent biopsy and diagnosis came at me straight out of the blue. And yet, February of this year seems like a century ago. I\u0092ve been reading books on the subject. (Recommended: \u0093You Can Beat Prostate Cancer\u0094 by Robert J. Marckini.) Watching documentaries. Scanning this forum (which is great). Corresponding with survivors. And yet after two months of saturation in the subject matter I feel like I\u0092m at the very beginning. So many aspects of prostate cancer are amorphous, even arbitrary. (Example: determining stage number or Gleason score. Sometimes I wonder if the pathologists are flipping coins.) Categorical consensus about diagnosis, treatment, and even whether one is cured is impossible to find. There seems to be no source of reliable information we can all draw from. (Maybe NCI?) But there are numerous marketing sites attempting to disguise themselves as such. It seems that everyone involved with this disease, from patients to care providers to treatment developers, has a stake in the process. And yes, some patients too have a stake in the sense that once committed to an avenue of treatment they take ownership of it and tend to proselytize about how superior their treatment is, even to the point of downplaying side effects and other negative aspects. But perhaps the least able to determine next steps in the journey around this disease is the one who must make the call: the new patient, me. I\u0092m here in this forum (and only this forum) to ask my fellow sufferers for their take on the decisions I\u0092ve made so far and those I\u0092m in the process of making. Treatment has not yet begun so I can change my mind if I want to. I consider myself supremely fortunate at my age (67) to come in at Stage 2, and thus I have plenty of options. My priorities are (1) eradication of the cancer; (2) freedom from a return of the cancer; (3) freedom from urinary incontinence; and (4) reduction or elimination of other side effects. My reading so far has prejudiced me against surgery. You know the reasons why so I won\u0092t go into them. The best chance of a successful outcome with minimal side effects seems to be radiation, and that\u0092s the way I\u0092m headed. According to my radiation oncologist, a course of his clinic's state-of-the-art IMRT should give me an 85 percent chance of a complete cure. My radiation oncologist's specialty is brachytherapy and he recommended that procedure first, followed by IMRT. My response was, since brachytherapy carries its own risks and side effects, and IMRT on its own has an such an overwhelming success rate, I\u0092d rather skip the brachytherapy and still be confident of a good outcome. And here is my first question to the forum . . . QUESTION: Should I start with a course of brachytherapy, or bet all my marbles on IMRT? And then there's proton beam. Many sources I\u0092ve read are almost stridently enthusiastic about proton beam therapy. But my healthcare provider doesn\u0092t have it. They have a recent IMRT system and say it is just as good. I\u0092ve found a couple of limited but legitimate comparisons of the two technologies, and one of them cites substantially higher risk of urinary incontinence from proton beam. Both studies say the jury is still out on proton beam\u0092s superiority or even equivalence to IMRT with regard to prostate cancer. (The only consensus is no consensus.) So I\u0092m not sold on proton beam. And if I were I\u0092d be in for a fight with my insurer to pay out-of-network treatment costs. I\u0092d have to stay in a different city (Seattle or San Diego \u0096 Loma Linda has aged out, apparently) for two months at my expense. And before any of that, I\u0092d have to wait my turn in the line-up for limited proton beam resources. All this would take months, and I\u0092m afraid of my prostate malignancy spreading outside the gland during that interval. What would you do? QUESTION: Should I go expend a lot of time and dollars to get proton beam, or will IMRT suffice for my needs? And then there\u0092s the question of hormones. I\u0092ve got a rare autoimmune condition called hypophysitis that has shut down my pituitary gland and thus nearly all my hormone production, including testosterone and growth hormone. I\u0092ve been taking supplements of those hormones for nearly five years now. My doctors recommend I discontinue them during my IMRT treatment. I will do so, though grudgingly, because only guys who\u0092ve been without these hormones will be able to fully relate to how empty life can be in their absence, how difficult it is to engage with work and other pursuits, what little pleasure is left in what were once the most life-fulfilling experiences. What the hell, I can do without them for eight or nine weeks. But what about afterward? QUESTION: Has anyone in this forum been counseled to avoid testosterone even after they\u0092ve been cured of their prostate cancer? My current path, as said above, is IMRT only, beginning in the next 10 days or so. (I have found some great information in this forum\u0092s \u0093What I need to know about external beam radiation treatments\u0094 thread. Thanks!) I\u0092m wondering if the radiation will eradicate my prostate, or if it will have any functionality afterward. Is my quality of life going to take a major downturn? What are the odds of being struck again by prostate cancer, only this time by a more aggressive version? And most haunting of all, what if IMRT fails to kill all the cancer cells. Can I reboot and opt for a course of brachytherapy, or are all options but chemo no longer valid? So much to learn, so little time to decide. Even if it\u0092s just a few words about the way you\u0092d go, I\u0092d love to hear them. And so in advance I thank all in the forum who have read this and especially those who can provide me the wisdom of their experience.",

Many sources I\u0092ve read are almost stridently enthusiastic about proton beam therapy. But my healthcare provider doesn\u0092t have it. They have a recent IMRT system and say it is just as good. I\u0092ve found a couple of limited but legitimate comparisons of the two technologies, and one of them cites substantially higher risk of urinary incontinence from proton beam. Both studies say the jury is still out on proton beam\u0092s superiority or even equivalence to IMRT with regard to prostate cancer. (The only consensus is no consensus.) So I\u0092m not sold on proton beam. And if I were I\u0092d be in for a fight with my insurer to pay out-of-network treatment costs. I\u0092d have to stay in a different city (Seattle or San Diego \u0096 Loma Linda has aged out, apparently) for two months at my expense. And before any of that, I\u0092d have to wait my turn in the line-up for limited proton beam resources. All this would take months, and I\u0092m afraid of my prostate malignancy spreading outside the gland during that interval. What would you do? QUESTION: Should I go expend a lot of time and dollars to get proton beam, or will IMRT suffice for my needs? And then there\u0092s the question of hormones. I\u0092ve got a rare autoimmune condition called hypophysitis that has shut down my pituitary gland and thus nearly all my hormone production, including testosterone and growth hormone. I\u0092ve been taking supplements of those hormones for nearly five years now. My doctors recommend I discontinue them during my IMRT treatment. I will do so, though grudgingly, because only guys who\u0092ve been without these hormones will be able to fully relate to how empty life can be in their absence, how difficult it is to engage with work and other pursuits, what little pleasure is left in what were once the most life-fulfilling experiences. What the hell, I can do without them for eight or nine weeks. But what about afterward? QUESTION: Has anyone in this forum been counseled to avoid testosterone even after they\u0092ve been cured of their prostate cancer? My current path, as said above, is IMRT only, beginning in the next 10 days or so. (I have found some great information in this forum\u0092s \u0093What I need to know about external beam radiation treatments\u0094 thread. Thanks!) I\u0092m wondering if the radiation will eradicate my prostate, or if it will have any functionality afterward. Is my quality of life going to take a major downturn? What are the odds of being struck again by prostate cancer, only this time by a more aggressive version? And most haunting of all, what if IMRT fails to kill all the cancer cells. Can I reboot and opt for a course of brachytherapy, or are all options but chemo no longer valid? So much to learn, so little time to decide. Even if it\u0092s just a few words about the way you\u0092d go, I\u0092d love to hear them. And so in advance I thank all in the forum who have read this and especially those who can provide me the wisdom of their experience.",

I\u0092ve been taking supplements of those hormones for nearly five years now. My doctors recommend I discontinue them during my IMRT treatment. I will do so, though grudgingly, because only guys who\u0092ve been without these hormones will be able to fully relate to how empty life can be in their absence, how difficult it is to engage with work and other pursuits, what little pleasure is left in what were once the most life-fulfilling experiences. What the hell, I can do without them for eight or nine weeks. But what about afterward? QUESTION: Has anyone in this forum been counseled to avoid testosterone even after they\u0092ve been cured of their prostate cancer? My current path, as said above, is IMRT only, beginning in the next 10 days or so. (I have found some great information in this forum\u0092s \u0093What I need to know about external beam radiation treatments\u0094 thread. Thanks!) I\u0092m wondering if the radiation will eradicate my prostate, or if it will have any functionality afterward. Is my quality of life going to take a major downturn? What are the odds of being struck again by prostate cancer, only this time by a more aggressive version? And most haunting of all, what if IMRT fails to kill all the cancer cells. Can I reboot and opt for a course of brachytherapy, or are all options but chemo no longer valid? So much to learn, so little time to decide. Even if it\u0092s just a few words about the way you\u0092d go, I\u0092d love to hear them.

      "Content": "A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring. There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain And drinking largely sobers us again. - Alexander Pope, 1709 I\u0092m a 67-yo retired technical writer who\u0092s never had a serious illness. My high PSA score and subsequent biopsy and diagnosis came at me straight out of the blue. And yet, February of this year seems like a century ago. I\u0092ve been reading books on the subject. (Recommended: \u0093You Can Beat Prostate Cancer\u0094 by Robert J. Marckini.) Watching documentaries. Scanning this forum (which is great). Corresponding with survivors. And yet after two months of saturation in the subject matter I feel like I\u0092m at the very beginning. So many aspects of prostate cancer are amorphous, even arbitrary. (Example: determining stage number or Gleason score. Sometimes I wonder if the pathologists are flipping coins.) Categorical consensus about diagnosis, treatment, and even whether one is cured is impossible to find. There seems to be no source of reliable information we can all draw from. (Maybe NCI?) But there are numerous marketing sites attempting to disguise themselves as such. It seems that everyone involved with this disease, from patients to care providers to treatment developers, has a stake in the process. And yes, some patients too have a stake in the sense that once committed to an avenue of treatment they take ownership of it and tend to proselytize about how superior their treatment is, even to the point of downplaying side effects and other negative aspects. But perhaps the least able to determine next steps in the journey around this disease is the one who must make the call: the new patient, me. I\u0092m here in this forum (and only this forum) to ask my fellow sufferers for their take on the decisions I\u0092ve made so far and those I\u0092m in the process of making. Treatment has not yet begun so I can change my mind if I want to. I consider myself supremely fortunate at my age (67) to come in at Stage 2, and thus I have plenty of options. My priorities are (1) eradication of the cancer; (2) freedom from a return of the cancer; (3) freedom from urinary incontinence; and (4) reduction or elimination of other side effects. My reading so far has prejudiced me against surgery. You know the reasons why so I won\u0092t go into them. The best chance of a successful outcome with minimal side effects seems to be radiation, and that\u0092s the way I\u0092m headed. According to my radiation oncologist, a course of his clinic's state-of-the-art IMRT should give me an 85 percent chance of a complete cure. My radiation oncologist's specialty is brachytherapy and he recommended that procedure first, followed by IMRT. My response was, since brachytherapy carries its own risks and side effects, and IMRT on its own has an such an overwhelming success rate, I\u0092d rather skip the brachytherapy and still be confident of a good outcome. And here is my first question to the forum . . . QUESTION: Should I start with a course of brachytherapy, or bet all my marbles on IMRT? And then there's proton beam. Many sources I\u0092ve read are almost stridently enthusiastic about proton beam therapy. But my healthcare provider doesn\u0092t have it. They have a recent IMRT system and say it is just as good. I\u0092ve found a couple of limited but legitimate comparisons of the two technologies, and one of them cites substantially higher risk of urinary incontinence from proton beam. Both studies say the jury is still out on proton beam\u0092s superiority or even equivalence to IMRT with regard to prostate cancer. (The only consensus is no consensus.) So I\u0092m not sold on proton beam. And if I were I\u0092d be in for a fight with my insurer to pay out-of-network treatment costs. I\u0092d have to stay in a different city (Seattle or San Diego \u0096 Loma Linda has aged out, apparently) for two months at my expense. And before any of that, I\u0092d have to wait my turn in the line-up for limited proton beam resources. All this would take months, and I\u0092m afraid of my prostate malignancy spreading outside the gland during that interval. What would you do? QUESTION: Should I go expend a lot of time and dollars to get proton beam, or will IMRT suffice for my needs? And then there\u0092s the question of hormones.

      "Content": "A little learning is a dangerous thing; Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring. There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain And drinking largely sobers us again. - Alexander Pope, 1709 I\u0092m a 67-yo retired technical writer who\u0092s never had a serious illness. My high PSA score and subsequent biopsy and diagnosis came at me straight out of the blue. And yet, February of this year seems like a century ago. I\u0092ve been reading books on the subject. (Recommended: \u0093You Can Beat Prostate Cancer\u0094 by Robert J. Marckini.) Watching documentaries. Scanning this forum (which is great). Corresponding with survivors. And yet after two months of saturation in the subject matter I feel like I\u0092m at the very beginning. So many aspects of prostate cancer are amorphous, even arbitrary. (Example: determining stage number or Gleason score. Sometimes I wonder if the pathologists are flipping coins.) Categorical consensus about diagnosis, treatment, and even whether one is cured is impossible to find. There seems to be no source of reliable information we can all draw from. (Maybe NCI?) But there are numerous marketing sites attempting to disguise themselves as such. It seems that everyone involved with this disease, from patients to care providers to treatment developers, has a stake in the process. And yes, some patients too have a stake in the sense that once committed to an avenue of treatment they take ownership of it and tend to proselytize about how superior their treatment is, even to the point of downplaying side effects and other negative aspects. But perhaps the least able to determine next steps in the journey around this disease is the one who must make the call: the new patient, me. I\u0092m here in this forum (and only this forum) to ask my fellow sufferers for their take on the decisions I\u0092ve made so far and those I\u0092m in the process of making. Treatment has not yet begun so I can change my mind if I want to. I consider myself supremely fortunate at my age (67) to come in at Stage 2, and thus I have plenty of options. My priorities are (1) eradication of the cancer; (2) freedom from a return of the cancer; (3) freedom from urinary incontinence; and (4) reduction or elimination of other side effects. My reading so far has prejudiced me against surgery. You know the reasons why so I won\u0092t go into them. The best chance of a successful outcome with minimal side effects seems to be radiation, and that\u0092s the way I\u0092m headed. According to my radiation oncologist, a course of his clinic's state-of-the-art IMRT should give me an 85 percent chance of a complete cure. My radiation oncologist's specialty is brachytherapy and he recommended that procedure first, followed by IMRT. My response was, since brachytherapy carries its own risks and side effects, and IMRT on its own has an such an overwhelming success rate, I\u0092d rather skip the brachytherapy and still be confident of a good outcome. And here is my first question to the forum . . . QUESTION: Should I start with a course of brachytherapy, or bet all my marbles on IMRT? And then there's proton beam. Many sources I\u0092ve read are almost stridently enthusiastic about proton beam therapy. But my healthcare provider doesn\u0092t have it. They have a recent IMRT system and say it is just as good. I\u0092ve found a couple of limited but legitimate comparisons of the two technologies, and one of them cites substantially higher risk of urinary incontinence from proton beam. Both studies say the jury is still out on proton beam\u0092s superiority or even equivalence to IMRT with regard to prostate cancer. (The only consensus is no consensus.) So I\u0092m not sold on proton beam. And if I were I\u0092d be in for a fight with my insurer to pay out-of-network treatment costs. I\u0092d have to stay in a different city (Seattle or San Diego \u0096 Loma Linda has aged out, apparently) for two months at my expense. And before any of that, I\u0092d have to wait my turn in the line-up for limited proton beam resources. All this would take months, and I\u0092m afraid of my prostate malignancy spreading outside the gland during that interval. What would you do? QUESTION: Should I go expend a lot of time and dollars to get proton beam, or will IMRT suffice for my needs? And then there\u0092s the question of hormones. I\u0092ve got a rare autoimmune condition called hypophysitis that has shut down my pituitary gland and thus nearly all my hormone production, including testosterone and growth hormone. I\u0092ve been taking supplements of those hormones for nearly five years now. My doctors recommend I discontinue them during my IMRT treatment. I will do so, though grudgingly, because only guys who\u0092ve been without these hormones will be able to fully relate to how empty life can be in their absence, how difficult it is to engage with work and other pursuits, what little pleasure is left in what were once the most life-fulfilling experiences. What the hell, I can do without them for eight or nine weeks. But what about afterward? QUESTION: Has anyone in this forum been counseled to avoid testosterone even after they\u0092ve been cured of their prostate cancer? My current path, as said above, is IMRT only, beginning in the next 10 days or so. (I have found some great information in this forum\u0092s \u0093What I need to know about external beam radiation treatments\u0094 thread. Thanks!) I\u0092m wondering if the radiation will eradicate my prostate, or if it will have any functionality afterward. Is my quality of life going to take a major downturn? What are the odds of being struck again by prostate cancer, only this time by a more aggressive version? And most haunting of all, what if IMRT fails to kill all the cancer cells. Can I reboot and opt for a course of brachytherapy, or are all options but chemo no longer valid? So much to learn, so little time to decide. Even if it\u0092s just a few words about the way you\u0092d go, I\u0092d love to hear them. And so in advance I thank all in the forum who have read this and especially those who can provide me the wisdom of their experience.",
