      "Content": "Was wondering if any of you have ever set off the alarm when you've gone through TSA's airport full-body security scanners while traveling by air. I just returned from a trip and set off the alarms in every airport full-body scanner I went through (i.e., Denver, Chicago, Dayton, Portland, Or.), which required that I be subjected to full body pat downs by TSA's agents each time. What's amazing is that over 60% of my body lit up and I have no idea why, nor does TSA. It's unlikely that it was caused by my radiation levels since I finished my rad treatments nearly 4 years. I'm Stage 4 (lots of bone mets) and the only drugs I'm on are Lupron (3-month injections) and Xgeva (monthly) Any ideas?",

      "Content": "Nope; haven't had any type scan in nearly a year. That's why I'm thinking the cause might be some chem compound that's in either the Xgeva or Lupron. I've got an appointment with my doc this Tue, and I'll ask him if he has any ideas, but I doubt he will. I've Googled for answers to the problem but didn't find any possible causes. If I learn anything I'll do a follow up post to let you all know what I found out. Anyhow, thanks for your feedback.",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed as a Gleason 9 PC guy about 3.5 years ago. Was treated with radiation and was on Lupron for 9 months until I stopped taking the shots because of the energy-draining side effects I was experiencing.
