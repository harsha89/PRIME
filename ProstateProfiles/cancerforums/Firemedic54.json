He recommended a biopsy, I pushed for the MRI, he didn't think insurance would cover it but it did. (and worth a try to check, have your urologist send the insurance paperwork). My MRI was clear but I still wanted to know if something was going on. I pushed to have the biopsy done and cancer was found in 5/12 samples. It was very early and I chose surgery last October. I had no problems with the biopsy, or surgery. I get the results of my second post op PSA tomorrow.

      "Content": "First post here, I have been lurking for a week. I have lots of questions. First, I turned 42, 3 weeks ago. October 2015 during a routine physical my PSA came in at 4.4, DRE was normal. He put me on antibiotics for a month. Dec. 15, PSA was 3.7, he had me come back in 90 days, first of May PSA was 4.1, at this point I told him I was going to see a urologist. So, I go see last Friday, DRE normal and he wants to do a biopsy. I agree leave his office and spend 2 days reading, searching, and studying every thing I can find that will show up in a Google search. My doctor does not offer the guided/targeted MRI. Am I understanding correctly that this procedure produces more accurate results over the random core sampling? Or do they only do the MRI targeting after a positive finding? I have read and talked to a few guys who have 2-3 biopsys before they hit the right spot. I would rather have it done once and get the best and quickest results the first time instead of waiting. Should I, or could I ask to find someone who does the MRI biopsy or process with my doctor and let him do what he has planned.",

      "Content": "First post here, I have been lurking for a week. I have lots of questions. First, I turned 42, 3 weeks ago. October 2015 during a routine physical my PSA came in at 4.4, DRE was normal. He put me on antibiotics for a month. Dec. 15, PSA was 3.7, he had me come back in 90 days, first of May PSA was 4.1, at this point I told him I was going to see a urologist. So, I go see last Friday, DRE normal and he wants to do a biopsy. I agree leave his office and spend 2 days reading, searching, and studying every thing I can find that will show up in a Google search. My doctor does not offer the guided/targeted MRI. Am I understanding correctly that this procedure produces more accurate results over the random core sampling? Or do they only do the MRI targeting after a positive finding? I have read and talked to a few guys who have 2-3 biopsys before they hit the right spot. I would rather have it done once and get the best and quickest results the first time instead of waiting. Should I, or could I ask to find someone who does the MRI biopsy or process with my doctor and let him do what he has planned.",

I asked twice about a bone scan or PET scan and was told I don't need one. Do you see anything that says, I should push for a scan? I am scared of waking up from surgery and hearing bad news. I can't wait for the surgery to get here, so I can start healing and looking at this chapter in the rear view.",

      "Content": "So I posted on here a few months back about my elevated PSA. I have since had a rectal probe MRI, (completely normal and clear). I almost decided against the biopsy, but I figured I had been this far so why not. I got my results today. I turned 42 in April and have no family history, my PSA was found during a routine physical. My doctor checks every male over 40. 10/15 PSA 4.2 12/15 PSA 3.7 4/16 PSA 4.1 MRI 7/16 Biopsy 8/16 Diagnosis today 8/19 12 core sample, found cancer in 6 samples all scored Gleason 6 (3+3) samples range from less than 5% to 35%. My Urologist has suggested Davinci surgery as really the only option. I understand the Gleason of 6 is a favorable dx. I also believe a 3+3 is in my favor. How do they come up with the 3+3 as opposed to a 4+2? I am married and have a 9 y/o son. I have tons to live for and I believe my only option is surgery. I have scheduled my surgery for Sept. 27. Am I jumping the gun by doing it so fast? I am scared to death and want this done and over with, per my Dr. he has done 1000's of surgeries and he says not to worry, he is confident that I will be fine. Any advice is appreciated.",

Dr. Craig Hall with UNC health systems. I know it sounds fast, but 6/12 slides and 5-35% involvement in each sample, is AS even an option? At my age he did not think radiation was the answer. He said my prostate is relatively small, does this help with nerve sparing? With this much involvement and samples is it remotely possible that the lab screwed this up?",

      "Content": "So I posted on here a few months back about my elevated PSA. I have since had a rectal probe MRI, (completely normal and clear). I almost decided against the biopsy, but I figured I had been this far so why not. I got my results today. I turned 42 in April and have no family history, my PSA was found during a routine physical. My doctor checks every male over 40. 10/15 PSA 4.2 12/15 PSA 3.7 4/16 PSA 4.1 MRI 7/16 Biopsy 8/16 Diagnosis today 8/19 12 core sample, found cancer in 6 samples all scored Gleason 6 (3+3) samples range from less than 5% to 35%. My Urologist has suggested Davinci surgery as really the only option. I understand the Gleason of 6 is a favorable dx. I also believe a 3+3 is in my favor. How do they come up with the 3+3 as opposed to a 4+2? I am married and have a 9 y/o son. I have tons to live for and I believe my only option is surgery. I have scheduled my surgery for Sept. 27. Am I jumping the gun by doing it so fast? I am scared to death and want this done and over with, per my Dr. he has done 1000's of surgeries and he says not to worry, he is confident that I will be fine. Any advice is appreciated.",

      "Content": "My doctor was referred to me by a friend who had his surgery in May. I do like this guy, I saw another dr. initially but after talking with my buddy I changed practices. Dr. Craig Hall with UNC health systems. I know it sounds fast, but 6/12 slides and 5-35% involvement in each sample, is AS even an option? At my age he did not think radiation was the answer. He said my prostate is relatively small, does this help with nerve sparing? With this much involvement and samples is it remotely possible that the lab screwed this up?",
