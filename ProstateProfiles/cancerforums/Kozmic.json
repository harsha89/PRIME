      "Content": "I went to Patel too. At our follow up meeting I was overwhelmed with information. And when I asked if they were able to spare the nerves they said \"because you prostate was so large, 67g, it was wrapped around some of the nerves, we had to take some from both sides\" I was never told how much \"some\" was, he immediately went into discussion about how it didn't mean I would never be able to have an erection but it did mean it was going to take \"some time\". Since then I keep wondering how much is \"some\", I don't see it in any reports they gave me. At the time I felt selfish because I knew I should be thrilled that they got the cancer and that it had not spread, but I was was white a a ghost when I heard \"some of the nerves are gone\" I wasn't expecting that since my grade was so low I just assumed that nerve sparing was going to be a slam dunk. So, I for one, am interested in your story it is very similar to mine with a 6 month lead in time. Same age, same score, same Dr. same outlook. I'd put it back up. Or forward it to some one that can help with the writing if it makes you more comfortable. I work with people from all walks of life, languages and cultures. My written skills aren't great either but I did not have any trouble with understanding what you wrote.",

And when I asked if they were able to spare the nerves they said \"because you prostate was so large, 67g, it was wrapped around some of the nerves, we had to take some from both sides\" I was never told how much \"some\" was, he immediately went into discussion about how it didn't mean I would never be able to have an erection but it did mean it was going to take \"some time\". Since then I keep wondering how much is \"some\", I don't see it in any reports they gave me. At the time I felt selfish because I knew I should be thrilled that they got the cancer and that it had not spread, but I was was white a a ghost when I heard \"some of the nerves are gone\" I wasn't expecting that since my grade was so low I just assumed that nerve sparing was going to be a slam dunk. So, I for one, am interested in your story it is very similar to mine with a 6 month lead in time. Same age, same score, same Dr. same outlook. I'd put it back up. Or forward it to some one that can help with the writing if it makes you more comfortable. I work with people from all walks of life, languages and cultures. My written skills aren't great either but I did not have any trouble with understanding what you wrote.",

The result was that he had treatment without any knowledge of why. Now that I'm in the same boat I started asking him questions, \"what were your PSA numbers?, \"what were the results from your biopsy?\" \"why did you choose \"\"seeds\"\"? He had no answers, he didn't know. I wish he had let me help him with it. He is \"cancer free\", so he feels everything is good, but the side effects are something he still deals with in silence.",

Maybe some folks on here can help with some other suggestions. Regards, MM My Dr is Dr. Vipul Patel. He has done more RALP surgeries than anyone else in the world, or so I'm told. I'm 100% sure he will be doing my surgery. He didn't tell me I had to wait 6 months, he said it \"could wait that long\" but no longer. It will have to be done sooner. He said that is OK too. I don't have a surgery date yet because they won't schedule me until I get my pre op clearances from my Primary care Dr, and a cardio dr. I don't have a cardio Dr. so it has been a chalange getting into one without waiting a couple of months. I have a Cardio apt on the 7th of July. So I should get a surgery date after that.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MichiganMan16 Koz: 6 months seems like a long time till a doctor can schedule surgery. Where do u live, what hospital, etc. ? Maybe some folks on here can help with some other suggestions. Regards, MM My Dr is Dr. Vipul Patel. He has done more RALP surgeries than anyone else in the world, or so I'm told. I'm 100% sure he will be doing my surgery. He didn't tell me I had to wait 6 months, he said it \"could wait that long\" but no longer. It will have to be done sooner. He said that is OK too. I don't have a surgery date yet because they won't schedule me until I get my pre op clearances from my Primary care Dr, and a cardio dr. I don't have a cardio Dr. so it has been a chalange getting into one without waiting a couple of months. I have a Cardio apt on the 7th of July. So I should get a surgery date after that.",

      "Content": "Surgery was Monday. Everything went well. Dr Patel said he did feel a nodule in the left side of what he removed, pathology is in tomorrow. Day 1, day of surgery, I was all set to be heroic and man up to this, but my body had different plans. They wanted me up at 4 hours post to walk but I couldn't stand without getting light headed aka passing out, so It took me 6 hours to get up and moving. I didn't get much sleep that night, maybe 2 hours. Day 2, discharge day, I was all fired up and got walking in the morning, I thought I was doing great! Until I had to sit in for after care class, after sitting there for about 10 minutes my ears started ringing and I went cold, about to tip over again. My wife, the squeamish trouper, sat through class for us, I had to go lay down. After about 45 minutes I was discharged and WALKED out of the hospital! Good to go! Well kinda. Gas pains in my chest and right shoulder were bad, Sleeping was rough, Neither of us got much sleep. The Dogs were driving us nuts because they wanted in to the bed room or they were going to bark all night long, and they did. We have a 70# Doberman puppy with puppy manners, I didn't want her tangled in the cath tube. Day 3, Major gas pain, intestinal gas, BAD, it wanted to race around inside me but not come out! I laid down for a nap around noon and did pass some relief, By late afternoon I decided that maybe if I sat on the stool I could pass this, That did work, it was loud and very relieving. But, it came with a price. I developed a leak around the cath tube and blood was dripping. I called the doc and they said not to worry, it wasn't a problem it was blood washing out from around the tube and it wasn't \"really\" bleeding. I went to bed and slept good all night. Day 4, While I was sleeping my hot nurse (can't say enough good about my wife helping me!) was getting up and checking my bag, it wasn't filling very fast, not like it had been. I had been passing small clots and the fluid never really cleared up, but now it wasn't flowing. I managed to wiggle and massage the tube to get some clots to pass and called the dr again. They said if I couldn't keep it clear to come in and have it flushed. I worked on it for a bit and got a massive amount of clots to pass, and everything looked better but I was leaking again. So I decided that going in now, mid morning, would be far better than hitting an ER tonight, since I am an hour from the hospital, and went in to have it flushed anyway. They flushed it, refilled the Foley bulb to try to stop the leak and said it looked like everything had passed and I was good to go. Still set for untethering in the morning!! Big issue today is a burning sensation while sitting, I can't get comfortable for long and I get a burning sensation below the belt line on the right side. Only when sitting, goes away when I stand, no problem if I'm laying down. I asked at the Dr office and they shrugged it off as \"normal\". If anyone has advice on this I'd like to hear it. Day 5, Tomorrow get this tube OUT OF ME! Sorry for all the gory details, but that's just how it went.",

They flushed it, refilled the Foley bulb to try to stop the leak and said it looked like everything had passed and I was good to go. Still set for untethering in the morning!! Big issue today is a burning sensation while sitting, I can't get comfortable for long and I get a burning sensation below the belt line on the right side. Only when sitting, goes away when I stand, no problem if I'm laying down. I asked at the Dr office and they shrugged it off as \"normal\". If anyone has advice on this I'd like to hear it. Day 5, Tomorrow get this tube OUT OF ME! Sorry for all the gory details, but that's just how it went.",

      "Content": "Surgery was Monday. Everything went well. Dr Patel said he did feel a nodule in the left side of what he removed, pathology is in tomorrow. Day 1, day of surgery, I was all set to be heroic and man up to this, but my body had different plans. They wanted me up at 4 hours post to walk but I couldn't stand without getting light headed aka passing out, so It took me 6 hours to get up and moving. I didn't get much sleep that night, maybe 2 hours. Day 2, discharge day, I was all fired up and got walking in the morning, I thought I was doing great! Until I had to sit in for after care class, after sitting there for about 10 minutes my ears started ringing and I went cold, about to tip over again. My wife, the squeamish trouper, sat through class for us, I had to go lay down. After about 45 minutes I was discharged and WALKED out of the hospital! Good to go! Well kinda. Gas pains in my chest and right shoulder were bad, Sleeping was rough, Neither of us got much sleep. The Dogs were driving us nuts because they wanted in to the bed room or they were going to bark all night long, and they did. We have a 70# Doberman puppy with puppy manners, I didn't want her tangled in the cath tube. Day 3, Major gas pain, intestinal gas, BAD, it wanted to race around inside me but not come out! I laid down for a nap around noon and did pass some relief, By late afternoon I decided that maybe if I sat on the stool I could pass this, That did work, it was loud and very relieving. But, it came with a price. I developed a leak around the cath tube and blood was dripping. I called the doc and they said not to worry, it wasn't a problem it was blood washing out from around the tube and it wasn't \"really\" bleeding. I went to bed and slept good all night. Day 4, While I was sleeping my hot nurse (can't say enough good about my wife helping me!) was getting up and checking my bag, it wasn't filling very fast, not like it had been. I had been passing small clots and the fluid never really cleared up, but now it wasn't flowing. I managed to wiggle and massage the tube to get some clots to pass and called the dr again. They said if I couldn't keep it clear to come in and have it flushed. I worked on it for a bit and got a massive amount of clots to pass, and everything looked better but I was leaking again. So I decided that going in now, mid morning, would be far better than hitting an ER tonight, since I am an hour from the hospital, and went in to have it flushed anyway. They flushed it, refilled the Foley bulb to try to stop the leak and said it looked like everything had passed and I was good to go. Still set for untethering in the morning!!

      "Content": "I am at day 9 since surgery. I've had ups and downs, most of the time I believe it is self inflicted, over tired, over worked. My first follow up with Patel is at 6 weeks and they made it clear they expected me to be continent by then. I have a whole stack of supplies, Diapers, guards, shields. I use a diaper at night just for insurance but I've never filled one, just a few \"drainage squirts\" on the way to the bathroom. But I do wake up a lot to go to the bathroom, about 5-6 times every night. Each hour for the first 2-3 times, then 2-3 hours after that. I need to work on holding more volume. When I get out of bed I \"prepare\" myself to try to hold it, but sometimes I have a short drain squirt. Once I'm up it's OK and I'm on guards for the day, and short of the occasional unexplained whoops I'm good most all day. Today I bought shields because they will surely hold any of my mystery whoops moments, and its too flippin hot to be wearing anything heavier. Sometimes I wonder if the wetness I was feeling was sweat or leakage. Thinking about going back to work soon, I'm going to try another day on the shields first. Kegels... did you know there is an app for that? I was told to do kegels every hour, 10 reps for 4 seconds, 100-150 reps per day. I'm trying to do everything they tell me to do to the letter so there is no complaining that I didn't follow the program. What is \"AZ\" Amazon?",

      "Content": "So, I've been diligent for a few months doing my Kegels as required by my surgeon. I'm getting worried that it isn't going well. I can hold a 10, 5 second kegel sets and do them several time each day. But I can't do much more than 5-8 seconds. SO, I have to ask... when you start a urine stream can you clamp it off mid stream? I can't, well not until I'm close to empty. I can almost stop it but not completely and not for long. My sister told me to stop reading so much because I'm getting all worked up about the upcoming surgery and life after surgery. I though I had asked about kegels already but couldn't find where I did.",

      "Content": "Working on it! I'm down 20 pounds and still working at it! But I have to say, I find nothing about the torture of eating weeds and walking and riding to \"nowhere\" enjoyable. I doubt that I will ever find joy in this torture. I used to come home after work and work out in my shop doing something productive till bed time. Now I come home from work, eat weeds, and do work that accomplishes nothing, all while the work I want to do, and need to do, sits waiting. I do understand the need to lose weight, but when I said \"i don't have time for it\" I was right. Now I know why city people live in those zero lot line homes shoulder to shoulder, it's so they have time to do nothing. Originally Posted by Michael F Kozmic: Listen to your sister! Continue to practice your Kegels daily but do NOT overdo them! Stop worrying as you are still more than a month away from having surgery. Be sure to exercise vigorously and slim down as much as possible going into surgery. Both you & your MD will be thankful! Good luck with your upcoming surgery & best wishes for a soft landing! MF",
