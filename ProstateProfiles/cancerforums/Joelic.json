    "Content": "Hi All, First, I would like to say that I have been reading this forum the past couple days, and you guys are great. These forums are great. I don't mean to trivialize this forum with my post because I know you guys are going through way way way more than me. I don't have prostate cancel that I am aware of, but I am seeing an urologist soon, and I don't really know what to ask for. Last month I was (questionably) diagnosed with Prostatitis. A DRE was never performed. I just showed the doctor where I was feeling the mild discomfort and urinating a lot, and he prescribed me Cipro. The discomfort went a way in a couple days, and I now realize that I didn't have any real urinary problems either. I was just drinking more. The Cipro made me constipated and after a rough bowel movement, the discomfort was back. I now think I have/had a hemroid or fissure instead of Prostatitis. I went back to the doctors the day after finishing the Cipro complaining of still have discomfort and urinating a lot. Since I was born with just on kidney, he check my urnine (was OK), a ultra sound of bladder and kidney area (was OK), and blood work for kidney function (OK), and yes a PSA. The doctor recommend that I see a specialist. Not because of my prostate (didn't know PSA yet), but more kidney and bladder. My PSA came back 2.14, but I am a cyclist, and I am sure I had sex within 24 to 48 hours. My wife an ex-oncology nurse who worked with prostate cancer patients says that is high for my age (45) which made me concern. So, what should I ask the urologist to do? I am sure I want a DRE, but should another PSA be performed? I am have a full physical Mid-Jan. Nobody mention a PSA when I set up the appointment, so should I hold off on the sex and riding until after my appointment? I thank all of you guys for reading this, and I am sorry if this post is not appropriate for this forum. Bless all you guys!",
