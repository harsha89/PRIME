      "Content": "Hello all, Things have happened pretty fast for me. I was biopsied on November 5 and diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer (Gleason 4+4) on November 8th though I never had a PSA above normal. Tumor was discovered on rectal exam when I had symptoms of frequent urination. I didn't have much trouble deciding on the DaVinci prostatectomy, since it would get the tumor out as efficiently as possible. I met with Dr. Jonathan Hwang at Washington Hospital Center and decided to have him do it on the recommendation of a friend and my positive impressions, and scheduled the surgery for December 10. I was discharged the next day and spent only one uncomfortable night at home because of recurring hiccoughs that tormented the incision sites. Dr. Hwang reports noting and biopsing some suspicious tissue near the bladder, so he has prepared me for the fact that when the path lab reports come in, he may be recommending radiation for locally advanced cancer. I am blessed with a loving wife and family and lots of dear friends who will be there for me. A couple of them have been through this before with good outcomes. I have not yet read much about radiation, the side effects and timing of it. So I would appreciate any stories any of you have to share. I have been singing with a small accapella group that has concerts scheduled at the end of January and will have to decide whether recovery from the surgery or the radiation will interfere with that. Thanks for being there. Brock",

Left side was clear. Lymph nodes were clear. Surgeon took samples of bladder tissue near the tumor to determine if his suspicion of local spread can be verified. Thanks for your response and support.

      "Content": "I share my story to provide others information regarding a serious radiation side effect and an important treatment that is not well known. Two years after my course of external beam radiation treatment following prostatectomy, I had symptoms that I described as like sitting on a tennis ball. I bought one of those back support cushions with the cut out for your cocyx to sit on when it became uncomfortable to sit. After a couple of failed attempts to treat this with medication, my urologist and radiation doc hypothesized \"Radiation Cystitis.\" I looked it up, and this is important. There are acute radiation side effects that show up immediately after treatment, and there are late onset side effects that can show up a year to ten years (or more) after radiation treatment. In the late onset variety, the radiation causes a breakdown in blood vessels that can develop over time, causing wounds that do not heal well. This can lead to hemorrhagic radiation cystitis, a serious condition that should not be ignored. I had a cystoscopy (not as unpleasant as it sounds) and the doctor was able to show me on the monitor a raw red patch of tissue on the inside of my bladder. This kind of wound does not heal easily and tends to progress and get worse until you have basically a bleeding ulcer in your bladder. It can be dangerous, not only because of the pain and blood loss (severe cases need transfusions) but also because it makes you more vulnerable to nasty bladder infections. A friend of mine was hospitalized when his bladder infection went into the blood because of the open wound in his bladder. I, myself had a bladder infection that aggravated the radiation cystitis and I had to be persistent in asking for urinalysis to confirm my suspicions. Two courses of antibiotics were necessary to knock out the e. coli infection. Here is the good news. A relatively new application of an old technique can be an effective non invasive (though time consuming) treatment for radiation cystitis. It is Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. I went to a wound healing center at Georgetown University Hospital and sat in an oxygen chamber for two hours a day for two months. Although I haven't had a second cystoscopy yet to confirm the healing (it is scheduled in a couple of weeks), I can feel the difference. If it is not entirely healed, I will go back for another month of HBOT. This treatment is not well known by a lot of doctors. Among my fellow HBOT patients were some who had had surgery for bladder conditions. The surgery was compromised because of damaged tissue that did not heal well because of the impaired circulation. The research that has been done on HBOT indicates a high percentage of patients do benefit significantly from it. The earlier you get it, I suspect, the better the results.",

This treatment is not well known by a lot of doctors and I encourage you to research it and be aggressive with doctors about getting information about it. Call the Georgetown University Hospital Wound Healing Center and talk to one of the doctors who specialize in this. I think they will be happy to talk to you. Of course, I think the first step is a cystoscopy to confirm the problem, but this is a serious condition. I encourage you not to put off the cystoscopy. If it is radiation cystitis, it will only get worse. Good luck and let us know what happens.",

      "Content": "I am two and a half weeks post da Vinci prostatectomy and doing well, but did not have clean margins, so radiation is recommended. Since the radiation oncologist wants me to be fully recoverded from surgery, he recommends at least three months before a course of radiation. Hormone therapy to deprive the cancer cells of testosterone is recommended in the meanwhile, which I fully understand. But continued hormone therapy during radiation is also being debated. Since it seems like this would slow the growth of the cancer and make it less vulnerable to radiation therapy (radiation disrupts the cell division process and therefore is more toxic to cancer cells that are dividing more rapidly than normal cells), I am curious if anyone else has been through a similar protocol. There are no studies that indicate effectiveness of simultaneous hormone and radiation. I am currently on 50 mg of Bicalutamide and tolerating it very well. Thanks in advance for your information and support.",

I was taking a medication to reduce bladder irritation and it colored the urine orange. Any spillage resulted in clothes or rugs being indelibly stained. I had been led to believe removal of the Foley would be painful, but it was not a bit of a problem. Good luck. Hopefully, with your Gleason scores, you won't need any further treatment.",
