I'm being referred to a Urologist and will have a phone consultation in no less than 3 days. What should I expect of Kaiser Permanente? I Assume a digital rectal exam...probably more testing? Should I demand/expect a biopsy now? Doc says good news is its lower...but still high. Could it drop to normal in 2 weeks I asked. She says not likely. Is that true? Hiw much can score swing in short periods of time? I'm keeping it cool around wife and daughter (10 years) but frankly I'm scared as can be. Any feedback would be appreciated....Good or Bad.

      "Content": "Thanks for the feedback. Much appreciated! I'm 46 years old. To clarify, I was on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) for the last 3.5 years, but I was feeling so crappy with headaches, fatigue, emotional mood issues, depression and more, that I quit taking vertually all my prescription meds 6 weeks ago...including testosterone. I got sick with a bad cold 3 weeks after stopping all my meds and went to the Doctor. She thought I had a urinary tract infection. And, I did after labs confirmed it. She put me on cipro for ten days and said lets test you after that to make sure the infection had cleared. She also tested me for PSA and a few other things as a matter of routine. When the results came in yesterday my PSA was 18.7. I am back from the doctor now and she wants to retest me in two weaks. She did not do a rectal exam. Should she have? She said if my scores in 2 weeks remain high she would refer me to a urologist for more tests. I've never had a rectal exam. I think its low on most Doctor's list of things to do...understandably. She thinks the high PSA score is a result of the UTI and in two weeks we should see a drop in the score. Is this sound Doctor advice? Should she have done more or someting else?",

      "Content": "I was 2.1 a year ago. Can a PSA score go up to 18.7 in one year... and not be cancer? Hoping for false pos. And, is the drop in two weeks from 18.7 to 14.9 a good sign? Doc says I may have just an inflamed prostate hanging on from the urinary tract infection and that it may take months to cone back to normal. That doesn't make sense to me. Feel like smoke is beingblown up my prostate? Last I struggle with bad constipation due to narcotics ihave to take making stools large, very hard and lumpy. This could affect the prostate like a DRE...cause false positive? Yes/No? Please give feedback....PLEASE..... Never had a DRE Never seen a urologist...yet. Will soon. Freaking out...reading and not seening anyone with scores as high as mine. Am I a dead man?",

      "Content": "Yes, I was told yesterday my PSA was 18.7. (Sorry, title saying 17.8 is wrong...transposed). My last test was 12 months ago and it was normal 2.1. I'm 46. But, I've been on testosterone replacement therapy for 3.5 years. But, I just got over urinary tract infection prior to the 18.7 test being done. The infection was gone by the testing day, but the test was just after it cleared. 18.7 My concern is the testosterone replacement therapy triggerred growth of something. Last 6-8 months I've been very tired and sleeping heavily. It was so bad that I stopped taking testosterone entirely 6 weeks ago. I have felt better since stopping. I've been off testosterone for 6 weeks and know not to take it again. I see my GP doctor today. She wants me to retest PSA in two weeks and only then will she refer me to a urologist. Given everthing, what should I expect frim my GP at todays visit. Staying calm...know false positives are common, but also can not stop thinking about it....",

      "Content": "Yes, I was told yesterday my PSA was 18.7. (Sorry, title saying 17.8 is wrong...transposed). My last test was 12 months ago and it was normal 2.1. I'm 46. But, I've been on testosterone replacement therapy for 3.5 years. But, I just got over urinary tract infection prior to the 18.7 test being done. The infection was gone by the testing day, but the test was just after it cleared. 18.7 My concern is the testosterone replacement therapy triggerred growth of something. Last 6-8 months I've been very tired and sleeping heavily. It was so bad that I stopped taking testosterone entirely 6 weeks ago. I have felt better since stopping. I've been off testosterone for 6 weeks and know not to take it again. I see my GP doctor today. She wants me to retest PSA in two weeks and only then will she refer me to a urologist. Given everthing, what should I expect frim my GP at todays visit. Staying calm...know false positives are common, but also can not stop thinking about it....",

To clarify, I was on TRT (testosterone replacement therapy) for the last 3.5 years, but I was feeling so crappy with headaches, fatigue, emotional mood issues, depression and more, that I quit taking vertually all my prescription meds 6 weeks ago...including testosterone. I got sick with a bad cold 3 weeks after stopping all my meds and went to the Doctor. She thought I had a urinary tract infection. And, I did after labs confirmed it. She put me on cipro for ten days and said lets test you after that to make sure the infection had cleared. She also tested me for PSA and a few other things as a matter of routine. When the results came in yesterday my PSA was 18.7. I am back from the doctor now and she wants to retest me in two weaks. She did not do a rectal exam. Should she have? She said if my scores in 2 weeks remain high she would refer me to a urologist for more tests. I've never had a rectal exam. I think its low on most Doctor's list of things to do...understandably. She thinks the high PSA score is a result of the UTI and in two weeks we should see a drop in the score. Is this sound Doctor advice? Should she have done more or someting else?",

Feel like smoke is beingblown up my prostate? Last I struggle with bad constipation due to narcotics ihave to take making stools large, very hard and lumpy. This could affect the prostate like a DRE...cause false positive? Yes/No? Please give feedback....PLEASE..... Never had a DRE Never seen a urologist...yet. Will soon.
