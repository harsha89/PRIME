      "Content": "9 days post op, and cancer free. I've up dated signature with biopsy results, and i am ecstatic. A couple of thoughts: i went in dehydrated due to not drinking water with the bowel prep, and it added about a day for my liver to start functioning properly. Also, pay close attention to eating really small, very bland meals for a good while following surgery. When i ate too much too soon and with the addition of hospital drugs, it gave me all kinds of digestive gas problems that felt much like a heart attack. I do not relax very well and remained tense uncontrollably. Everything seems to be working pretty well now. i have a fair amount of continence, and began Kegels on 4th day. Complete continence will take some time. I tend not to be a fast healer. Drs. cleared me for Viagra and vacuum device, however my BP remains low following surgery and i will continue taking heart meds. So for a time i will monitor before adding the 3 times a week viagra. So, we were going for the triple play, Cancer free: done, Continence: statistical probability high, and sexual function, same. Drs. don't want me in my pool for 5 weeks, and they don't want me to repair my torn meniscus of the left knee for the same period, so walks are going to be a challenge to balance mileage vs: swelling.",
