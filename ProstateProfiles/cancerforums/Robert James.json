      "Content": "Thanks so much for replying to my thread. I have had a very difficult time finding guys who are getting seed implants. Most seem to be having surgery. I am having the procedure done this Tuesday. I hope the lack of side effects are similar to you. I'm more worried about that than anything else. I also feel very comfortable in selecting this treatment. I hope I can stay in touch with you for awhile during the post treatment period. I will check out Dr. Chen's study. I don't know if you are allowed to email directly from this site, but my email is ******* Take care. Robert Mod edit. I have removed your email address for safety reasons. We have hundreds of people who view these boards and not all have the best intentions. Please PM Robert if you wish to have his address.",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your reply. As I mentioned to another member on this site, I am registered on 4 cancer forum sites and have had only a handful of guys respond who have had Brachytherapy. I am very reassured by your experience that my outcome will be the same. I choose it for the same reasons as you. With a G6, psa 2.4, 2 cores positive, no dre, I was told any treatment I chose had a 95% chance to be curative. So I figured, then why go with something so fraught with potential long term side effects as surgery. Plus the precise implantations of the radiation also made sense to me in regards to sparing healthy tissue, reducing short/long term side effects, and lowering the risk of secondary cancers as compared to EBRT. My only worry is controlling the urinary frequency and/or complications after the initial treatment. It would have a great impact on the QOL with my job and social life. I am hoping for the best. I am having the treatment this Tuesday. I hope we can stay in touch. I need the support of the few of you I have found. If it is appropriate, we can communicate via my email address:Email address deleted for safety. Thanks again for getting in touch with me. It has been very comforting. Robert",
