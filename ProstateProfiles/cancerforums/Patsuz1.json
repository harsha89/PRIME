      "Content": "Hi we are a young couple 46/40. Husband had surgery for Prostate Cancer 2010, with Radiation in 2011 b/c it was still detectable. He had Erectile Disfunction after the surgery and it never came back. Today we met with a eurologist and the doctor who performed the surgery. The suggestion was to try Viagra first, then Cialias. If those dont work then they suggested Prostaglandon E1. We dont want him to end up in the hospital with an erection that wont go away. What are your thoughts on all of this? Thank you in advance.",
