      "Content": "Hello, I had my surgery on the 7th of Sept it was six weeks ago since surgery I've had UTI and another catheter placed I had my miner set backs. But now its hurting bad when I urinate I can feel the pain go from my bladder to my penis and when the urine is leaving the pain is terrible I need to hold something it hurts so bad. I have been tested for uti's and other bacteria and all is normal. I was peeing fine I had good pressure a solid stream now its weak sometimes it dibbles out of me. Doc said he may want to send a camera up me to check for blockages if its not better by Monday I need to call him. I'm so pissed I was suppose to get my release back to work on the 27th and find out my PSA level from surgery and set up appointments to start (RT) treatments. I second guessing my treatment option I took more and more everyday. Well anyway has anyone had this problem not having a good strong stream not caused by infections after surgery? Thanks Sudds",

But I have family members who are older than me who also had (PC) and both had Radiation and both had there cancer return and are now on hormonal treatment's. I called them both and we talked for a while and after taking with them and talking with the surgeons I decided with the surgery. I'm not to happy with the side affects with Radiation where I could have problems with my bladder and rectum and that it could happen over time well after my treatment's and if my cancer did return I would still have the option to have surgery ,but the prostrate will have so much scare tissue from the radiation they may not be able to have surgery. I know that no treatment is 100% affective and both have there own set of side affects but I just feel the surgery is the best option for me. I wish I didn't have to thinking of any of this but it is what it is. I will get through this I hope to kick this cancers butt and move on with my life and never see it again.

Also both of the URO's where up on the all the therapy's and explained it all to me and my wife the side affects of them all which made it easier to decide along with taking to family and my wife about it. But no one had said about the kegel exercise or the walking. I know walking is good for you and I do walk; but what does it have to do with this? How does it help you recover? and what is a kegel exercise? Sorry took so long to get back to you been busy with work. Thanks for all your help. Sudds",

We went to see 3 doctors my general and 2 urologist and all 3 recommended surgery. So after talking it over with my wife I decided to go with the surgery.

      "Content": "Hello All, Thank you for talking to me and telling me your thoughts. I did not talk to a Radiation Oncologist or Medical Oncologist. But I have family members who are older than me who also had (PC) and both had Radiation and both had there cancer return and are now on hormonal treatment's. I called them both and we talked for a while and after taking with them and talking with the surgeons I decided with the surgery. I'm not to happy with the side affects with Radiation where I could have problems with my bladder and rectum and that it could happen over time well after my treatment's and if my cancer did return I would still have the option to have surgery ,but the prostrate will have so much scare tissue from the radiation they may not be able to have surgery. I know that no treatment is 100% affective and both have there own set of side affects but I just feel the surgery is the best option for me. I wish I didn't have to thinking of any of this but it is what it is. I will get through this I hope to kick this cancers butt and move on with my life and never see it again. I added my Signature with my history Sudds",

      "Content": "Hi I was on vacation when I got the call from the doctor and he told me I got (PC) with a Gleason score of 7 3+4/3+3 I had 10 cores taken. I was just listening to him, but the words are going in one ear and out the other. Thank god my wife was with me when I got the call. Well We finished our vacation and got back home then had a bone scan and cat scan done, and thank god the tests came back clean no sign of the cancer other than the prostrate. We went to see 3 doctors my general and 2 urologist and all 3 recommended surgery. So after talking it over with my wife I decided to go with the surgery. I'm nervous about it but I know getting it out is the best decision although I worry about all the side affects of the surgery. learning how to hold my urine and having (ed) doesn't help matters. I thought I join this site to talk about it. My surgery is in two weeks and I will be out of work at least 6 weeks no desk job for me. Well thanks for listening.",

The doctor told me that I need 8 to 10 weeks of radiation now because it a more aggressive cancer then thought and I have to get my first post psa test at the end of the mth and that is will determine the amount of weeks I go. He also said its a good thing I got this done now then if I was to wait. I'm worried. I also got so sick after my catheter was removed I got a bad uti with high fever and had catheter put back in for another 8 days because I couldn't pee. Has not been a good week. Also the same week my hot water heater blew and our dog died of cancer, then I got my path report.... Well that's enough thanks for listening. Sudds",

      "Content": "Hello, Final Report, Prostrate Radical Prostatectomy: Prostatic Adenocarcinoma , poorly differentiated Gleason Score of 4+5=9 (grade 5) Dominant Nodule with a Greatest dimension of 2.4 cm confined within prostate Estimated at 29% of tissue volume (7.14ml) involving surgical resection margins( anterior, at apex); benign seminal vesicles positive for perineral invasions: negative for invasion angiolymphatic invasion no lymph node identified. (NGPIN) High-grade Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Well here it is from my biopsy I was told of Gleason score of 4+3=7 and the final is a 9. The doctor told me that I need 8 to 10 weeks of radiation now because it a more aggressive cancer then thought and I have to get my first post psa test at the end of the mth and that is will determine the amount of weeks I go. He also said its a good thing I got this done now then if I was to wait. I'm worried. I also got so sick after my catheter was removed I got a bad uti with high fever and had catheter put back in for another 8 days because I couldn't pee. Has not been a good week. Also the same week my hot water heater blew and our dog died of cancer, then I got my path report.... Well that's enough thanks for listening. Sudds",

I was at the Docs on Thursday he wasn't there only saw the nurse she checked for uti and other bacteria and it was all normal. She said he may want to send a camera up to check for a blockage. I had to cut back on what I drink because it hurts so bad the pressure of it to come out and can't. I had my surgery 6 weeks ago. I know it doesn't help as what to do but you are not alone on this and I hope I find out soon ... I do know I can't go on like this they got to find out what's wrong and soon. good luck Sudds",

I still have to do (RT) but I have to ask you guys does this mean I'm caner free or do I need to wait to be saying something like that? And on the voiding thing the doctor put rods up my urethra to expand it. That was not easy to go through, but I did void and it seamed to work I didn't feel the restriction so lets hope that's all it was.... Sudds",
