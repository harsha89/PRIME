    "Content": "Last year in February I found out I had prostate cancer with a Gleason scale of 5 in one of twelve samples. We researched and decicded to remove the prostate but decided to do a wait and see until Christmas of 2012. We had a follow up biop 6 months in with no change. In the meantime I decided to do what my wife had been asking me to do for the last 11 years. I changed the way I ate not a diet but just eating right. I started at 219 and at the time of surgery I was at 193. One week from surgery I was told by my insurance that my yearly benifits would not cover the surgery and I would have to wait. So we rescheduled for February 6 and now we are 3 weeks out of surgery and every day I feel better. The surgery was done via the DiVinci at Vanderbilt Hospital in Nashville on a Wednesday and I went home on Thursday at noon. I was given a script for pain but opted for ibproffin as I was never really in pain just uncomfortable. The biggest thing for me was the cath tube. I felt every inch of it every time I moved but still no pain that could'nt be handle with ibproffin.I followed doctors orders and got up and walked every hour even if it was just 5 or 6 laps around the living room. The rest of the time I rested and drank water and juice. Day 14 I got the cath out, what a relief. I opted for pads. If you wear your underwear loose get some smaller ones. You will be more comfortable. I went back to work on the 26th. The doc wanted me to be out 4 to 6 weeks. I manage a warehouse and walk up to 5 miles a day. Walking is good for healing, the first 2 days wore me down but by the end of the week I could tell a big difference in stamana. Back to getting the cath out, the first day I went through 7 or 8 pads. Today 9 days later I'm at 2 per day and last night I slept all nightwith no problems. Warning results will vary but I really feel my walking so much at work helped. I've read a lot of forums over the last year and the 2 things I notice are its all about me and what about me after surgery. It's very important to include family thats why I say we alot because I include my wife. Second don't worry about erections and a little leakage because more than likely thats all it will be and if not they have a fix for both. To me life with my wife is worth more than any erection and when I talk to most men thats what they seem to be the most concerned about. Life maybe a little different but your alive. I will post more progress as time goes on and if my posting helps nobody other than me then my journy to this point has been worth it. The worst thing you can do is nothing.",
