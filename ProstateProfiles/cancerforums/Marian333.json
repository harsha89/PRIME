      "Content": "Long story short, we were in a real financial crunch when my husband was diagnosed with Lymphoma. We had a very high bill at the Mayo because of my knee and hip issues and surgeries. I could not get my husband in the Mayo so we had to go to another hospital which turned out to be a blessing in disguise. I called Financial Assistance and they had me come in with seven documents. To my delight, we qualified. The Charity covered everything our insurance didn't for a year. When I applied the next year, we again qualified. This time we were not accepted but the Financial Advisor told me it might help to write a hardship letter. It was hard to do but I did it. We were again accepted. It was a God send,truly. I did not apply the year because we are doing a little better. I had to go to the Mayo financial assistance. They were NOT nice to me but agreed to wipe out the bill. Another God send. We were so grateful to God. So, you might want to talk to Financial Assistance at your hospital.",
