His nurse told me that she'd check every day and bump me into his schedule as soon as it comes back. I'm following several forum suggestions and ordered Walsh's book. I looked over the John Hopkins site for 2nd opinions, got real familiar w/ my insurance benefits and coverage, and made additional copies of my medical records. Then, I got mad at myself for getting all worked up over something I can't control, and went fishing for the day. I think fishing cures just about everything! LOL",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by newporter Where is the pain? If it is near the incision sites it should go away soon? If not near the incision sites and you also have other symptoms like a fever you need to consult your surgeon. One thing few surgeons talk about post op is the possibility of lymphedema and lymphocele. Do you have leg swelling post surgery and is the pain near the lower abdomen? Lymphocele is a collection of lymphatic fluid in the lower abdominal cavity. Usually it is asymptomatic and goes away after a short period but if it gets infected it can cause pain in that area. You had a successful surgery and lets hope it is just a case of simple recovery. Good luck. Since I first posted, it's become much better. All 6 sites have healed. There has been no fever and only minor swelling of the testicles. The \"pain\" is best described as....my insides are trying to re-position themselves after sitting upright for any length of time....if that makes any sense! Still working on the kegels and incontinence but overall, life is good! I feel very blessed with the outcome.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Hi Gary, The Gleason 3+3 is a low risk type of prostate cancer and there is an old saying that \"No man ever dies from Gleason 3+3.\" YOu also have Gleason 7, which is happily a 3+4 instead of a 4+3. This is a moderatly aggressive type of PC, but the 3+4 often acts very much like 3+3. So whether you choose one of the two primary treatment types (radiation or surgery), you should have an excellent chance for a complete cure. Your low PSA of 1.9 further suggests this. As long as it is confined to the prostate -- and it probably is -- the tumor volume is not as important. Of course, with radiation you would want it to be as small as possible to have less tumor to treat. With surgery, the baby goes out with the bathwater -- prostate, tumors and all -- no matter their size -- all come out. You might want to read a gold standard PC book by Dr Pat Walsh called the \"Guide to Surviving Prostate Cancer.\" Make sure it's the 3rd edition. And stand by as others jump in to give you more information & comments. All in all, I'm sure you are going to be just fine. Chuck I just spotted the part about \"3'rd edition\". Still waiting on delivery of my \"2'nd edition\". What's the major change?",

I finally made the choice to have robotic surgery at UWM (Madison, Wi) with Dr Sean Hedican due to some other stricture issues. I learned today that he was trained by Dr Patrick Walsh at Johns Hopkins. He still does a few open procedures but now favors the robot for almost everything. I came in armed w/ two pages of questions. He spent over 40 minutes answering every one in great detail. Then, before I left, he asked if there was anything else he could answer. Even though I have to travel to Wisconsin, I feel very comfortable with the facility and the doctor. I've already had very favorable interactions w/ his staff this afternoon. I can't thank this forum enough for all the valuable information that helped me make my choice. I almost feel relief knowing I'm another step closer to getting this cured.",

I'm getting my biopsy results back sometime next week and plan to have the results (positive or negative) examined there for a second opinion. I've been using that facility for several years to treat my wife's problems and have been quite impressed with the team approach from this teaching hospital.",

      "Content": "I've been leaning toward robotic surgery for the last month but still wanted to keep an open mind on brachytherapy. I finally made the choice to have robotic surgery at UWM (Madison, Wi) with Dr Sean Hedican due to some other stricture issues. I learned today that he was trained by Dr Patrick Walsh at Johns Hopkins. He still does a few open procedures but now favors the robot for almost everything. I came in armed w/ two pages of questions. He spent over 40 minutes answering every one in great detail. Then, before I left, he asked if there was anything else he could answer. Even though I have to travel to Wisconsin, I feel very comfortable with the facility and the doctor. I've already had very favorable interactions w/ his staff this afternoon. I can't thank this forum enough for all the valuable information that helped me make my choice. I almost feel relief knowing I'm another step closer to getting this cured.",

      "Content": "I'm 9 days post op from RALP. 5 of the 6 openings are healing nicely. They used a lot of glue and strips. However, the top incision (think it's the one used for the CO2) keeps opening and leaking fluid. That was the one opening that didn't show any residual glue or tape. There is still quite a bit of swelling behind that point. I mentioned it at my post op visit and was told everything was healing nicely. It almost looks like a hernia has developed at that point. I say this because I had a hernia repaired w/ mesh about 15 years ago and that's very close to the bottom edge of the mesh. Just wondering if anyone else has experience this kind of leakage and what outcome did you have.",

Ray Yup...that's pretty much what it is. Just when I think it's done leaking, it leaks again for a short time and then quits. It's related to how much I've been sitting around or just being active.
