Not sure how to interpret that Before surgery my PSA was 40, and Gleason was 8-9, so \"the glass is half full\" perspective is that this is quite an improvement. However, it is nowhere near undetectable - nor may it ever be? All along the URO has been telling me that I would have surgery, radiation and HT. I have been on Casodex fro a month and expect to get a shot today. Recovering very well - almost continent - walking a lot - feeling great really. So it shouldn't be too long before I can get the radiation started. Appreciate everyone's support! Mike",

He thinks radiation will be available to me sometime in July if I continue recovery as I have up until now. Understand wanting to know whether cancer has spread outside of the area. I think their answer will be they don't know. I think they are doing the ADT more as an adjuvant to Radiation therapy versus suspected mets. Prior to surgery, they ran the bone scan, CT and MRI with negative results - although I know they are not 100% accurate in ruling it out. I did have one lymph node of 16 with slight trace of cancer, Doctor today surprisingly seemed very upbeat and optimistic with my 1.1 - called it VERY good news. Like most of you have advised - have to take it a day at a time. Today I feel very good.",

      "Content": "Had an acumin scan done last Wednesday, with follow up today with RO. Scan showed locations of traces of possible cancer - to assist with salvage radiation that should begin next week. All indications are that it is confined - no lymph nodes or bones. Scan did pick up something on my pancreas that RO was not all that concerned about - doubts very much that it is cancerous. However, I am making an appointment to consult with a gastro to rule out anything dangerous. Scans I had prior to surgery did not pick up anything. Thgat's all I need! Final PSA before radiation was done last week. Result was PSA <.1. Have been on Casodex and Telstar for a couple of months and it seems to be doing its job as intended. Altogether, I feel pretty good (and optimistic) about where I am, considering where I started. PSA >40 and Gleason 8-10. We'll see where it goes. Thank you all for your support and wisdom. Mike",

      "Content": "Friends, Hard to believe it has been a couple months since surgery. Feeling great - walking 15-20 miles a week - playing golf - pretty continent - limited side effects with HT - still non-smoking - blood pressure medicine cut in half - lost about 5 pounds. Got results of 60 day blood test. PSA is now down to .3. Considering my stats below, I've come a long way I think. Getting close to joining the zero club if things continue as they have! However, I am realistic to understand I will most likely be fighting this well into the future (hopefully :smile). Have consult tomorrow with URO who plans to link me up with a RO. Hope to get that scheduled as soon as I can - my summer work hours are as flexible as I want. Most of you have reported few side effects with the radiation and that encourages me. Any advice? Do you have a choice of the time you want to schedule your daily session? One day I will have the experience and expertise to help others as you have helped me.",

      "Content": "MM and Fairwind, Thank you for advice. I see my current URO in late July to see what he thinks the next step in the plan should be. He was the one who did the surgery and is well regarded throughout NJ. He also lists as a credential \"minimally invasive uro-oncology.\" Not sure what that means except it is probably the reason he has not yet passed me off to a full-time medical oncologist. With this BCR, that may change. I plan to retire next year and move to Dallas/FW area to be closer to our kids. As you both suggest, I will be looking to transfer my care to a major medical/cancer center out that way. I am thinking MD Anderson at either Houston or one of their clinics. Should I wait until I get out there to transfer my care? Alternative is to look into MSK which has just opened a satellite center in Middletown NJ. Or maybe current URO / minimally invasive uro-oncologist (also surgeon) has some standard plan in mind that will tide me over until next summer. Ironically, I feel healthier and in better shape that I have been in over 10 years. Advice? Mike",

      "Content": "Fairwind, MM and Gary, Thank you for the not so gentle shove to seek the treatment I will need in the long term - At least I hope it will be long term Called Memorial Sloan Kettering this morning for appointment, requested current URO office provide documents MSK will need for first visit, and they have already assigned me a patient portal. I finally have the feeling that someone with the best credentials is in charge. Current URO's office has my request for records release - just needs to be signed off by current URO, although I haven't told him he is fired yet. When we move to Dallas/Fort Worth next summer, I will definitely transfer to MD Anderson. I think I have a few years left in me and want the best care I can get. Thank you again for pushing me in the right direction when I was unsure and in doubt. I now have peace of mind and confidence I can move forward the next steps on this journey. Mike Mike",

      "Content": "MM and Fairwind, Thank you for advice. I see my current URO in late July to see what he thinks the next step in the plan should be. He was the one who did the surgery and is well regarded throughout NJ. He also lists as a credential \"minimally invasive uro-oncology.\" Not sure what that means except it is probably the reason he has not yet passed me off to a full-time medical oncologist. With this BCR, that may change. I plan to retire next year and move to Dallas/FW area to be closer to our kids. As you both suggest, I will be looking to transfer my care to a major medical/cancer center out that way. I am thinking MD Anderson at either Houston or one of their clinics. Should I wait until I get out there to transfer my care? Alternative is to look into MSK which has just opened a satellite center in Middletown NJ. Or maybe current URO / minimally invasive uro-oncologist (also surgeon) has some standard plan in mind that will tide me over until next summer. Ironically, I feel healthier and in better shape that I have been in over 10 years. Advice? Mike",

      "Content": "Fairwind, MM and Gary, Thank you for the not so gentle shove to seek the treatment I will need in the long term - At least I hope it will be long term Called Memorial Sloan Kettering this morning for appointment, requested current URO office provide documents MSK will need for first visit, and they have already assigned me a patient portal. I finally have the feeling that someone with the best credentials is in charge. Current URO's office has my request for records release - just needs to be signed off by current URO, although I haven't told him he is fired yet. When we move to Dallas/Fort Worth next summer, I will definitely transfer to MD Anderson. I think I have a few years left in me and want the best care I can get. Thank you again for pushing me in the right direction when I was unsure and in doubt. I now have peace of mind and confidence I can move forward the next steps on this journey. Mike Mike",

      "Content": "Had Da Vinci on 17 April - almost 4 weeks ago. For month prior to surgery, I quit smoking (after 50 years) and walked 4-5 miles a day, building up to about 3.6 MPH. Got myself in pretty decent shape and I think it has paid off. Since surgery, I have begun walking again. Gradually building up to about 3-4 miles per day in the last week, but keeping pace at around 3.3 MPH. I feel I am getting some decent exercise, but not pushing it to point of any pain or tiredness. A day or so ago, at the end, I felt a little pull developing on right side of groin, so took yesterday off. Woke up today without the pull and did my normal 3 and a half mile walk. All this to ask how much is too much? Is 3-4 miles of walking a day too much after 4 weeks? Is the pace I'm walking too fast? Being a competitive person all my life, I have a tendency to push myself, but certainly don't want to do anything that may jeopardize recover. Will appreciate any advice. Mike",

      "Content": "Well, has been almost a year post RP, Radiation, and ADT (Casodex and Trelstar). PSA has been below .1 since a month after starting it (April 2017). Continence not all there yet, but manageable with a pad during the day. Generally satisfied with process except for the usual SEs of ADT: Fat gain, hand joint pain, occasional sweats, urination frequency. But now I think I have a complication - maybe caused by the ADT (?). Came off a 10 day cruise. Did a lot of workout and sweating on board ship - hour a day of fast walking and limited weights. Day 7, after a hard workout - I started drinking water a lot - almost continuously for the next 24 hours. Chalked this up to possible dehyrdration - thirst symptom gradually went away over the next 3 days. Urinated about every hour through the night for the first day. Otherwise felt fine. Got home and weighed myself. I had actually lost 3-4 pounds on the cruise - from 225 to 222. ? Since three weeks ago, I have lost a total of 5 pounds. Unexplained. I suspected onset of diabetes. Got one of those devices from Walgreen's to test blood sugar and came up with readings in the 300-level! Did some research (google) and found a couple of articles that linked ADT with increased blood sugar level and diabetes. Will call my uro this morning to report this. I am supposed to be on ADT for 2-3 years - I wonder if treatment of high blood sugar will trump continuing on ADT? Has anyone experienced rising high blood sugar while on ADT? Advice?? Mike",

They say it is sensitive to very low PSAs (less than .1). It really facilitated mapping for the Radiation regimen - ability to target and focus radiation. I have been on HT for about 3 months. Main reason, the URO told me, was to weaken PC cells to make radiation more effective. However, he insists I will be on HT for 2 years. I have experienced minimal side effects thus far, although early in the process.",

Now it's my turn: Just diagnosed with prostate last week. Gleason 8, PSA 40 (up from normal 2 years prior). Doctor followed up with bone scan, CT, and bone scan which I just did. Will meet with urologist in about a week. Very anxious of course - hoping for the best, bracing for the worst. Question: Will the urologist recommend treatments other than surgery or radiation? At what point will an oncologist become involved? Will he pick the oncologist, or can I go out on my own? Question: I was referred to my current urologist who did the biopsy and ordered the follow up tests. However, I just found out that Memorial Sloan Kettering just opened up a facility in NJ about 30 minutes away. If surgery is offered by current urologist, can I have it done by him and then use MSK for follow-on treatment? I am 67, and up until about 2 months ago whenI had my PSA spike, had no symptoms. Now I just have to urinate more frequently (every couple of hours) than I have in the past. Mike A",

      "Content": "First wife passed away from Colon Cancer 15 years ago. I found the support provided by a forum invaluable as we went down the road. Now it's my turn: Just diagnosed with prostate last week. Gleason 8, PSA 40 (up from normal 2 years prior). Doctor followed up with bone scan, CT, and bone scan which I just did. Will meet with urologist in about a week. Very anxious of course - hoping for the best, bracing for the worst. Question: Will the urologist recommend treatments other than surgery or radiation? At what point will an oncologist become involved? Will he pick the oncologist, or can I go out on my own? Question: I was referred to my current urologist who did the biopsy and ordered the follow up tests. However, I just found out that Memorial Sloan Kettering just opened up a facility in NJ about 30 minutes away. If surgery is offered by current urologist, can I have it done by him and then use MSK for follow-on treatment? I am 67, and up until about 2 months ago whenI had my PSA spike, had no symptoms. Now I just have to urinate more frequently (every couple of hours) than I have in the past. Mike A",

He has thrown everything at my situation (Surgery, Radiation, ADT) with hope for cure or long term remission. Side effects for me: Hot flashes 2-3 times a day or night, weight gain, joint pain (especially hand), some tiredness at end of work day, some return of continence issues (not a major distractor). No sex interest or capability at this time. All these side effects are manageable, but will be glad to get off ADT. Want peace of mind in future to say I did everything I could.

      "Content": "I agree with MM - Your husband is ideal candidate for Radiation and HT. I did have a PET scan (Axumin) prior to beginning RT. They say it is sensitive to very low PSAs (less than .1). It really facilitated mapping for the Radiation regimen - ability to target and focus radiation. I have been on HT for about 3 months. Main reason, the URO told me, was to weaken PC cells to make radiation more effective. However, he insists I will be on HT for 2 years. I have experienced minimal side effects thus far, although early in the process.",

      "Content": "First wife passed away from Colon Cancer 15 years ago. I found the support provided by a forum invaluable as we went down the road. Now it's my turn: Just diagnosed with prostate last week. Gleason 8, PSA 40 (up from normal 2 years prior). Doctor followed up with bone scan, CT, and bone scan which I just did. Will meet with urologist in about a week. Very anxious of course - hoping for the best, bracing for the worst. Question: Will the urologist recommend treatments other than surgery or radiation? At what point will an oncologist become involved? Will he pick the oncologist, or can I go out on my own? Question: I was referred to my current urologist who did the biopsy and ordered the follow up tests. However, I just found out that Memorial Sloan Kettering just opened up a facility in NJ about 30 minutes away. If surgery is offered by current urologist, can I have it done by him and then use MSK for follow-on treatment? I am 67, and up until about 2 months ago whenI had my PSA spike, had no symptoms. Now I just have to urinate more frequently (every couple of hours) than I have in the past. Mike A",
