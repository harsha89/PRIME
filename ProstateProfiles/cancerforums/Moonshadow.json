      "Content": "Hello all. Just an update and also seeking advice.. my dad is now on month 3 of Lupron and now on Zytiga for 2 weeks. Psa has dropped from the 160s at diagnosis to 1.7. His back pain has continued, however. Finally, he had a follow up MRI which shows he has a spinal cord compression fracture. They found my dads cancer at an advanced stage and he has mets in spine, hips, femur. He has had radiation with some adverse side effects and would prefer not to go down that road again. Have any of you experienced fractures and what has been the treatment? I'm concerned about any surgical intervention as I understand it is risky. Any advice would most certainly be appreciated . Thank you!",

He has a very similar bio as your step dad's but he is a bit older. We were very excited about the abireterone versus doxetacel route as well and so I'm curious to know about your findings.

I had been almost non functioning until finding this site and stories of hope for men, even with advanced disease like my dad. I will try to recap what I know and would appreciate any references to said stories that I can share with him. He is very focused on the 3-5 years, scared and depressed. I didn't even know what a PSA was until a blood panel revealed that my dad's was 160. The blood panel was run after he was complaining of fatigue and back pain. The bone scan revealed the disease had spread to his spine and hips. It is not impinging on anything currently. They began him on Casodex and Lupron immediately. He seems to be feeling better only two weeks after the shot; even though this once very active man, has to now nap once or twice a day. They are doing external beam radiation as \"palliative\" (I hate that word) care to relieve his pain. He will begin chemo in 3 months as his doctor (one of the best in the country from what we have read) has said it will help extend his life. He may also have the chance to be in a clinical trial that they have not yet given details of. Eventually, I hope to get him to join the forum. It seems to offer relief and comradery when it is needed most. Right now, he is feeling completely overwhelmed. Anything positive you can share would be most appreciated. Thank you in advance",

      "Content": "Hello all. My father has begun his treatment for stage 4 prostate cancer (bone mets). Although the initial shot of Lupron had done wonders for his bone pain, the radiologist whom he was referred to at the same time he saw his oncologist, suggested palliative radiation. My dad has multiple mets throughout his spine but had extreme pain in his sacral area. This is where the radiation was administered. While we'd heard side effects were minimal, my father has ulcerative colitis (which had been under control) and the treatment has greatly exacerbated this . He has been very sick for the past week and otc meds and steroids aren't seeming to help. I just wondered if any of you had a similar experience and have any advice. I'm so hopeful this is temporary. I just want him to have some reprieve from the emotional and physical pain this has all caused him. I'm trying to remain hopeful that his response to the Lupron had him feeling so much better before this colitis nightmare. Thx in advance",

He had his first shot of Lupron and casodex approximately 45-60 days ago and felt some brief relief but his bone pain has continued. He feels the pain level has decreased but is still present and he needs OxyContin. His ro seemed to think there could be reasons for this that were not as alarming as what the mo said. The mo feels the Lupron should have eliminated symptoms and that there is a chance his psa is not lowering or is going up and has concerns it may not be working.

      "Content": "Hello all. Here we are about 5 weeks after a devastating diagnosis. My 72 y/o dad has metastatic prostate cancer. I've found this forum and one other and both have provided so much information and moreover, hope. I read every article imaginable on advanced prostate cancer, clinical trials and treatment regimens. However, I still feel like I am missing the basics. My parents did not ask for a pathology report and both were so shaken that they seem to be unaware of what I'm guessing are important details. My mom said she thinks my dad's Gleason was a 9 and most cores were positive. We didn't find out about his cancer until it had already spread.. He has since started casodex and Lupron and has had palliative radiation for bone pain. Here are my questions and thank you in advance for helping a newbie. Does Gleason score and detailed pathology matter once the cancer is in the bones? Will we only know how responsive the cancer is to the hormone therapy by doing blood tests every so many months? Will the level at which his psa drops to have some bearing to his overall survival? The oncologist mentioned zytiga w Lupron (stampede) or chemo in the next couple of months. Is it better to do the chemo early? He is seeig a top oncologist at the Cleveland clinic whom we haven't seen since being first diagnosed. I'd ask these questions of him if I could. Thx so much",

My brother plans to travel home so that we can all ask the questions we've compiled in the last month and a half. I hope the doctor has as much patience as you lovely people do. My dad has been having some tough side effects from the radiation. It flared his colitis and now he is having issues with fatigue and burning when he tries to urinate. He had a very rapid and positive response to the Lupron - pain went from a 8 on the 10 scale to a 1 as he describes. I'm just hopeful that he can \"get a break\" from pain and side effects so he can gear up for chemo. His doc alluded to him taking it up front when we first met. He also alluded to the stampede trial which he wasn't able to site at the time but was apparently involved in. I guess what I'm learning is that there is no road map and every person experiences the journey in their own way.",
