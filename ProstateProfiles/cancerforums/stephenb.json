Carotid endarterectomy 1.5 years ago following retinal stroke. Give my age, the condition of my liver, my cardiovascular issues, I think it improbable that I will survive the assault of hormone therapy and radiation recommended by my radiation oncologist, where I mean by 'survive' to regain anything like the quality of life I have now. It is almost certain that the oncologist will consider his treatment a success because I am very likely to die of the side-effects of the treatment rather than of the cancer. Through exercise and diet I have begun to regain some of the health I damaged through my drinking. I am loathe to erase those gains through the horrors of HT and the assault of radiation. I have talked my radiologist into delaying treatment for a couple of months and am thinking very seriously of just NOT doing it at all, of facing the cancer music with all my wits about me etc. If anyone has an opinion on my situation, on my choice, I will be glad to hear it.",
