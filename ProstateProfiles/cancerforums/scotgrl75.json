      "Content": "Hi all, My father was diagnosed with prostate cancer at the end of November. Initially he was set up to do radiation because his urologist suggested this be the best course of action. After consulting with our family oncologist ( my mother has had lung and colon cancer ) he suggested that my dad may be a candidate for surgery and to go see Dr Patel located in Celebration, Florida since he is supposedly the leading surgeon for the davinci method. He has an appointment on Wednesday and basically I want to make sure we are prepared with the questions that we need answered. Any suggestions on what we should /need to ask would be helpful. Some history on my dad: Just turned 61. Has a blood coagulation issue that was discovered 1 year ago and on medication for his blood. This was discovered after having 2 strokes ( no lasting damage except some short term memory issues ). Other than that no medical issues. Initial abnormal DRE over the summer. PSA level increased from 2.8 ( I believe a year ago ) to 6.2 in September. Biopsy done 11/21/14. 12 samples taken 5/12 positive 3 samples 7 gleason ( 3+4) and 2 samples 6 gleason. % 5-50% in each sample Any feedback would be helpful. Thanks in advance!",
