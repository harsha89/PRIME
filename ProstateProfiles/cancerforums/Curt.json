      "Content": "I had my RP over one year ago and I would like to revisit with you, my path to the use of Trimix for those of you that might benefit from it. My RP went well, my Uro was also my Surgeon and I am very pleased with my outcome. The only part that I would change would be my education to dealing with the typical ED issues that most have after RP. I wish I knew early on what I know now about ED rehab and this is my attempt to try and help my fellow PC brothers to maybe make earlier decisions. It seems that most Uro's and surgeons are not very open about ED rehab and don't really talk about it. They don't seem to understand how important it is in keeping our male sexuality intact. My Uro did not even bring ED rehab up until I started asking questions because of the information I was starting to get from these very important sites I have gotten involved with. After telling him about my concerns, he finally gave me some ED Drug samples and said to take one every week to help with rehab. I also asked him about a VED and he said that might help also. I ended up purchasing a VED and used it for a while but found it to be quit a process to use and not much fun. In my readings I was hearing, \"use it or lose it\" !!!! I was over six months out from my RP and had an appointment with my Uro when I brought up the idea of injections, nothing else was working. I told him how I felt and that I wanted to try that approach and he said ok. He wanted me to make another appointment and then come in for a trial injection to see how it worked. The next week, I went in and he explained the procedure, he injected a small amount of trimix to see how I reacted and WoW, it worked !!!! I was elated at the idea of actually being back in control of my ability to have sex again and the rehab qualities that this might bring me. I purchased 5 syringes from my Uro with 1 cc of trimix in each one. While reading on the boards, I could see that 1 cc of trimix could send you off to the ER, I have no idea why he would prescribe such a large starting dose !! I think the boards really saved me from this. The small dose my Uro gave me in his office was around .2 cc and I did have a nice reaction that lasted about an hour. I decided to start myself at .25 cc and work my way up from there till I had about a 2 hour reaction which is really good for sex and rehab. The syringes he gave me were 5 cc and had big needles. Also because of what I had been reading, I decided to get .5 cc syringes with 30 gauge needles. The smaller size syringes gave me really accurate control of my dose and the small needles totally eliminated any pinch feeling I was getting from the larger needles. No pain and accurate control of your dose is really a good thing. I slowly worked my way up to .5 cc keeping track of my dose, date and site of the injection. I was injecting 3 times per week and unfortunatley did not have a partner to try this out on so I just chocked it up to rehab. i have now been using trimix since December, had great sex with a gal 4 times, have proven to myself that having a 2 hr woody can be very productive having sex and for its physical rehab qualities. If I was to do this all over again, I would get started on trimix as soon as possible after RP, would start out with the proper syringe needle combination for accurate control of dose and eliminating any pain from injection and would inject 3 times per week with or without a sex partner. You might need to challenge your Doctor about all this and take control !!! This is not at all a mystery to me anymore and it was in the beginning. From my personal experience and from everything I am reading, there is nothing wrong with this approach, in fact, it should be the standard, not the exception. You should not have to pull this info out of your Doctor nor feel funny asking about it. Be forward, be strong and take control !! For us guy's, this is a very big mental and physical challenge that we all need to take control of and it can be done. Hope this helps some of you make the decision to get with it, you have nothing to loose other than your own sexual well being which was really important to me. Cheers, and here's to harder days ahead for you that jump on to the Trimix wagon.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Race I'm glad to hear some discussion about Trimix. My urologist/surgeon offered the injections when I asked about ED about 4 months after surgery. The pills were not doing much for me. I have been using it for the last 4 months. My urologist did not recommend using more than twice a week. The dosage that works for me is about 0.10 cc. I have been slowly improving in the ED department. The pills (viagra or cialis) will work for me about half the time lately. I've had one successful intercourse with no help at all. Having the Trimix to go to is a real good thing. (But never double up with the pills). Hi Race- Yes, your are correct, Trimix is really good for rehab and should be used as soon as possible after RP if pills are not working. The problem I see is that some Uro's are not taking care of the ED and ED rehab quickly enough. An RP patient should be on an agressive ED rehab program as soon as physically possible, usually no longer than 30 days would be my guess, everyone will be a little different. Get Serious, The sooner the better for ED rehab, don't wait !!!!! Curt",

      "Content": "Hi Davidhp- I was also 60 when I found out I had PC. I also had a raise in my PSA over a years period and that triggered my biopsy which I had done right away. Out of 12 core samples, they found 1 little trace of cancer. I had my robotic RP done just a little over a year ago. The key is catching this thing early and it looks like you are on the right track for that. My surgery went well and I am hoping for a long life ahead of me. Keep plugging away and let us know how you are doing. These forums are great. Any questions, just ask away and there are people that will jump in and help. Good luck with your biopsy, it seems worse than it really sounds and is over very quickly. Cheers, Curt",
