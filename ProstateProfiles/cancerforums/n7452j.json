      "Content": "Hello,I am 52, feel healthy, physically fit, active and in good condition.(no family history of pc) I had my first psa test at age 41 it was 1.19 my next was at 49 = 3.20. On 1/17/14 on my birthday at age 52 my psa test was 5.53 urologist ordered another test and on 2/5/14 it was 5.76, so he did a DRE and said it seemed ok but thought I should have a biopsy just in case,(I thought this was jumping the gun a bit) I ask if we could do anything else instead and he said we could try to rule out infection first which I thought sounded much better than the biopsy so he put me on minocycline 100MG twice a day for 50 days then I had another psa test on 4/29/14 it went down to 5.06 but now he wants to go forward with the biopsy. I was having to urinate more than normal and needed to get up once or twice a night, not always, it seems like it comes on for a few days then all is normal for a spell. This has been the case for a year or two. Is a biopsy the next best option to find out why my psa is still high ?",

      "Content": "Thanks, Highlander, He did not say anything about BPH. As for the urinating, it is more the night time and sudden urges that seems to come and go. I had about a three day spell last fall where, in the morning mostly, I would have to go every 15 minutes or so and when I had to go I had to go NOW, might have been partially coffee induced. It hasn't been near that bad since then. Most days I can go a couple hours between pit stops. One other symptom I have is a burning sensation between the scrotum and anus, which comes and goes also. I do have the biopsy scheduled for the end of the month. The uro has 40+ years in so I am good with that I guess. He just hasn't asked me much about any symptoms or really explained anything to me, so I am curious, nervous, anxious and a bit afeared. I don\u2019t personally know anyone that has experienced any of this, so I am very thankful for this forum. I will keep in touch.",
