      "Content": "Hi everyone, have been lurking around reading for a few months learning my dad (63 yrsold) had PC after positive biopsy. Waiting another 2 weeks to do the post op PSA test to determine if he will require further radiation treatment (my guess is most likely will require adjuvant or salvage later on). Biopsy back in December 2015 showed 3/12 positive cores, GS score 7 (3+4), T1a (later upgraded to T2C after MRI showing tumor on both side of prostate). MRI clear other than the tumor in prostate. Bone scan clear. PSA was 11.11ng/ml at the time of the diagnose with free psa at 10%. RALP was performed February 15, 2016 without complications and dad recovered rather quickly. Both nerve bundles spared, 14 lymph nodes removed. Post op pathology report: Prostate, robotic assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3+4 = 7 (pT3b) with margin involvement. Prostate, margin, anterior, biopsy, negative for malignancy. Prostate, margin, posterior, biopsy, negative for malignancy. Seminal vesicle, right, robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, adenocarcinoma, involved. Seminal vesicle, left , robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, adenocarcinoma, negative for malignancy. Vas deferens, right, robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, negative for malignancy. Vas deferens, left, robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, negative for malignancy. Lymph nodes, pelevic, right, dissection, negative for malignancy (0/9). Lymph nodes, pelevic, left, dissection, negative for malignancy (0/5). 1. Prostate size: 27g, size: 5 x 4 x 2.5cm 2. Gleason pattern: Primary pattern: Grade 3, secondary pattern: Grade 4. Total Gleason score: 3+4=7 (25% pattern 4). 3. Tumor quantitation: Proportion (percentage) of prostate involved by tumor: 7%. Tumor 1 (right): 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.2 cm. Tumor 2 (left): 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm. 4. Extraprostatic Extension: Present; extensive. 5. Seminal Vesicle Invasion (invasion of muscular wall required): Present, right side. 6. Primary Tumor: pT3b: Seminal vesicle invasion 7. Margins(s) involved by invasive carcinoma: location: Right posterior apex margin and posterior margin. 8. Lymph-Vascular Invasion: not identified 9. Perineural Invasion: not identified 10. Lymph nodes: number examined: 14; number involved: 0 11. Additional findings: *high-grade PIN. *Nodular prostatic hyperplasia Comments: (1). The tumor cells are immunoreactive for AMACR and show loss of basal cells around the tumor cells by immunohistochemical study of CK34 B E12 in the prostate and right seminal vesicle. The right posterior apex margin is involved by cauterized and inked tumor cells which are highlighted by cytokeratin immunostain. So it looks like it is pT3bN0M0 at this time. The bad news is that Dr said unfortunately the cancer grew at the right posterior near the capsule and most likely grew into the seminal vesicle muscular wall hence the SV+ on the right side. It looks like there are some positive margin but I am not sure the extent in measurement (I will ask the doctor to ask the pathologist at the next appointment to provide more info is possible). The good news is that all the lymph nodes are clear and apex margin looks to have been cauterized (cross fingers cautherization kills the reminding tumor cells lingering at the margin or further in. So... leaving the posterior closer to the SV with positive margin... hopefully with SV taken out at the same time as prostate the extraprostate extension & some positive margins are taken care of as well. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! Peter",
