    "Content": "I do not understand any of this can someone please help me, Biopsy was done more than a year ago and was told by a nurse that it has been to long for any of that to show up.... TECHNIQUE: Multi-parametric multi-planar 3 Tesla MRI of the pelvis. T1-weighted, T2-weighted and diffusion weighted images were obtained, as well as post-contrast T1-weighted subtraction images following the administration of 20 cc of Multihance intravenous gadolinium contrast. FINDINGS: No focal suspect regions of rapid enhancement and washout. Diffuse T2 hypointensity throughout the peripheral zone with sparing of the midline gland from base to apex. A focus of proteinaceous/hemorrhagic material is seen in the posterior gland, possibly related to prior biopsy. The capsule is intact. No evidence of seminal vesicle involvement. The bladder is normal in size, shape, and signal intensity in both T1 and T2 weighted sequences. The visualized bowel demonstrate no gross abnormality. No free fluid seen within the pelvis. No enhancing masses, or contrast enhancement abnormalities were noted after the administration of contrast. No regional lymphadenopathy or abnormal marrow signal. Right inguinal soft tissue heterogeneity, likely postprocedural. Impression: 1. Diffuse peripheral zone T2 hypointensity without focal suspect prostatic mass. The capsule and seminal vesicles are intact. No abnormal lymphadenopathy. As clinically indicated, correlate with biopsy.",
