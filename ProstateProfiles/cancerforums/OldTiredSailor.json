      "Content": "Try to remain a little bit optimistic. My surgeon flat out said \"looks like you will have radiation in your winter schedule\" when he saw me 6-days post RALP due to my SM+ EPE+ and relatively high PSA density prior to surgery. But, he wanted to wait till my first µPSA test at six-weeks post RALP. That 6-week test came back 0.021 for me so he again said \"your surgical pathology was not great but we can hope your PSA stays down\" and told me to wait another 3-months for a 2nd µPSA, which came back 0.018. At this point I am seeing my medical oncologist who reviewed the surgeons notes and my post-RALP PSA and told me that \"even with SM+ and EPE+ there is no reason to rush into SRT decision making. From now on you will be on a 3-month PSA schedule and we won't decide anything until you've got two tests above 0.10 ng/ml. Once you get one 0.1 we will start looking at genomics and genetic testing... but for now smile and wait.\" My pT3a and G7 SM+ EPE+ was not quite as sever as your results but it does appear that there is no need to rush if the PSA scores stay down.",

      "Content": "You've received a lot of important information and advice here. I just want to add one more caution - as you proceed along the Prostate Cancer path you will find there are few black/white or clear cut decisions. You will learn that very intelligent, well informed, and experienced professionals and patients can come to differing or even conflicting opinions. That, IMHO, is the norm for we PCa patients and you will have to adapt to that ambiguity. My medical oncologist/urologist (25+years experience with over 1,000 open RP surgeries) who did the initial diagnosis, MRI, and biopsy insisted, after the 12-core TRUS biopsy, I begin primary treatment ASAP and in no case should I take longer than 4-weeks to start treatment. My MO referred me to a highly experienced RALP surgeon (1,600 RALPs and over 12-years experience doing them) whom the MO worked with on a daily basis. The RALP surgeon reviewed all my tests and told me there was No Hurry to make a decision and suggested I also talk with a Radiation Oncologist to learn more about RT as a primary treatment. The RALP surgeon said he would be comfortable waiting up to 4-months to do the surgery. The RO reviewed all my tests and talked with me several times. His attitude about the timing was - No rush, let's take our time and do the right thing. SO - it came down to a personal decision on my part as to when to have the primary RALP treatment. I chose sooner rather than later because I was way to emotional and confused to spend months trying to decide. The surgeon had a sudden opening in his schedule and I had the RALP done just 20-days after the biopsy. A minor detail to highlight the ambiguity in many of our decisions. A lot of folks on this forum have doctors tell them to wait 6-weeks or more after the biopsy to do the surgery because of the prostate trauma during Bx. My highly experienced MO said there was NO data to support that claim. My RALP surgeon said he knew of no data to support the claim but he \"typically\" did wait at least a month post Bx but had no real concerns about doing my RALP surgery just 20-days post-Bx.",

      "Content": "PSA on the rise during last 14-years but I have easily ignored the issue until May 23 when my GP/Internist told me last PSA analysis was 9.2 Now my urologist tells me to wait another couple weeks for another PSA test and then another week before I can see him again. And then most likely a 3T MP MRI and still more waiting. Then I read about all the men with elevated or ever increasing PSA scores and negative biopsies who just have to \"wait and see\" I am not a \"waiter\", I am a numbers guy and a veteran of many invasive and high tech medical procedures, which clearly and quickly gave a well defined diagnosis and prognosis: - Knee x-rays and MRI confirm there is no cushion and it is 100% certain I need two new knees (after seven prior knee surgeries) - Radionuclide X-Ray study of heart after stress EKG provided 100% assurance I have great blood flow in heart after several A-fib events - Ultrasound with contrast proves 100% my heart is pumping efficiently after several tachycardia events - 21-day Holder EKG study demonstrated excellent heart rhythms after many potential AFib and tachycardia events with 100% assurance from cardiologist that my heart will not fail me - CT with contrast absolutely found no mass in upper GI tract after extreme rectal bleeding - Colonoscopy showed 100% I had suffered ischemic colitis and there was 0% chance of malignant growth in lower intestine - Endoscopy showed 100% that I had no mass or malignant growth in esophagus after strange swallowing events ... I could go on and on with more tests/images/exams but I've learned during the last 30-years that modern medicine can provide a pretty clear and certain diagnosis about a LOT of medical issues I've been conditioned to expect medical certainty but now, starting down the bumpy, winding, and uncertain elevated PSA path, I find I can only hope for 50% sensitivity and 80% specificity and lots of conflicting advice and information. And, my graduate and professional education and experience taught me that \"more numbers / better analysis\" would lead to clear statements, explanations, and plans. How do I now teach myself to not wake up in the middle of the night wondering and pondering \"what if?\" and to not wander off during the day into a mental fog of \"what if?\" How do I live with what appears to be a future of uncertainty and ambiguity regarding prostate health and prognosis?",

      "Content": "Try to remain a little bit optimistic. My surgeon flat out said \"looks like you will have radiation in your winter schedule\" when he saw me 6-days post RALP due to my SM+ EPE+ and relatively high PSA density prior to surgery. But, he wanted to wait till my first µPSA test at six-weeks post RALP. That 6-week test came back 0.021 for me so he again said \"your surgical pathology was not great but we can hope your PSA stays down\" and told me to wait another 3-months for a 2nd µPSA, which came back 0.018. At this point I am seeing my medical oncologist who reviewed the surgeons notes and my post-RALP PSA and told me that \"even with SM+ and EPE+ there is no reason to rush into SRT decision making. From now on you will be on a 3-month PSA schedule and we won't decide anything until you've got two tests above 0.10 ng/ml. Once you get one 0.1 we will start looking at genomics and genetic testing... but for now smile and wait.\" My pT3a and G7 SM+ EPE+ was not quite as sever as your results but it does appear that there is no need to rush if the PSA scores stay down.",

      "Content": "I sure don't want to forecast doom and gloom or to be overly pessimistic BUT... You can see in my signature that my PSA progression from age 63 to age 71 (5.8 to 10.2) was similar to yours. And, my June 28, 2018 3T mpMRI was more optimistic than yours. Based on the MRI findings I really wanted to postpone the TRUS biopsy but my medical urologist/oncologist convinced to have the biopsy done August 3, 2018. That biopsy convinced me to have a RALP procedure done on August 23. I received the pathology report yesterday. Staging upgraded from cT1c to pT3a but Gleason stayed the same 7 (3+4) The MRI report understated: - size of the lesion by FOUR orders of magnitude (0.32 cc in MRI -vs- 7g in the pathology lab) - size of prostate by a factor of 2 (18cc -vs- 35cc in the pathology lab) The MRI report missed: - ALL the cancerous cells in the right lobe - the EPE I ended up with 2mm positive surgical margins at the left posterior apex, which in my limited understanding, is due to the EPE in that location, which the MRI missed. I was very fortunate that my medical urologist was quite skeptical about the MRI reported tumor size. My PSA density of .57 was way TOO high given the MRI and TRUS prostate size (18 cc) and the MRI reported lesion size (0.32cc) so he convinced me to trust him and the surgeon. The pathology report confirmed his suspicions. The more I read and communicate with doctors who are not surgeons or radiologists the more I find that the 3T mpMRI can be good indicator but can also miss a lot of bad stuff. I don't know what you can do with my pessimistic experience but, that experience has really changed my believe that technology and imaging reveals the truth or even the partial truth.",

The Mixed or PIN type has a much more favorable prognosis. \"Moreover, serum PSA level is not associated with tumor staging, recurrence and metastasis, and might not be an ideal prognostic indicator for risk assessment and prediction of recurrence in PDA (1. In summary, PDA is a rare, but the second common histological variants of prostatic carcinoma. It has unique origin, histological features, and biological behavior. Due to its aggressive clinical course and high risk of disease progression, it is important for us to differentiate PDA from other mimickers.\" An even more current study in Oct 2017 Radiation Oncology (Ductal Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate Gland Treated With Radical Prostatectomy or Radiation Therapy: A Single Institutional Retrospective Review With Long-Term Follow-Up) https://www.redjournal.org/article/S...327-1/fulltext.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I generally jog for ONE HOUR every day, which amounts to somewhere around 7-8 miles. I generally consider this to burn about 1200 calories. If you are able to jog -- and do it at a pace of around one mile in 8 minutes -- you can actually surpass those 900 calories. I would love to be able to run again! I was a life long runner and have run a lot of trail and road miles all over the world because I traveled for work 200-days a year 1984 - 1999. I've had seven knee surgeries with no cushion of any kind left in the knees, two crushed feet, a broken ankle, tib-fib fracture, and two crush injuries on the thigh which damaged the muscle. I ran for six years after the last pair of arthroscopic knee \"port and polish\" procedures but there is just nothing left. This fall was supposed to bring me two new knees - we'll see if the prostate interferes. I now have trouble walking more than a couple miles. My wife was also a superb runner for 30+ years who could do hours of 6:30s on hilly trails without breaking a sweat. She would run with me at my 7:30 pace for 40 or so minutes, then get bored and then take off for another hour on her own while I found my way home (in the car because we usually ran on trails in the country). She had to give up running last summer after an intetrochanteric femur/hip fracture (bike riding), which required two titanium rods to fix the bones for healing. She was also a very strong mountain and road bike rider but her orthopedic guy says her bones are so fragile now that even the slightest fall will shatter a bone. She has a Ti rod and four Ti screws ($2,500 apiece) in her humerus after a mountain biking accident in the San Diego foothills (2014). Getting old is not so much fun for us old jocks who defined their lives by athletics and other outdoor stuff. I love to read and work on the computer but really get antsy if I don't get my heart rate above 130 for an hour a day. Tough to be off the bike. A good alternative is swimming and/or the stairmaster at a local gym. I do swim everyday in our private pool but it is seven strokes, kick turn, seven strokes, and not that much fun. I am a strong swimmer and would like to swim in the canal we live on but the water is pretty dirty, has an alligator or three, and recently two really big dolphins. You have inspired me to check with the local gym to see if I can get a short term membership. Or - now that you have rattled my thinking- I can check with the YMCA down the street and see if my Florida Blue Shield Silver Sneakers card works there. Thanks for the inspiration!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ljames What was your 4K score. Any update from your Urologist? The doc is on vacation so I will not know my 4KScore until July 18 when I seem him again. As I said in my original post the doctor \"repeatedly stressed that nothing he said and no test results we receive in the interim would diminish the need for a TRUS/12-core biopsy. \" Now that the radiologist has isolated a suspicious 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm lesion on the 3T mpMRI imaging - the urologist will know exactly where to take a sample or two. The good news is that the potential lesion is a \"subtle area\" with \"equivocal\" radiological characteristics and the rest of the prostate is \"unremarkable\" as stated in the radiologists findings. I am trying to focus on that potentially positive news in that report and betting that the biopsy findings will define the lesion with no bad news.",

      "Content": "First meeting with my 52-year old urologist to discuss diagnostic process for ever increasing PSA values. Discussed lifestyle and history. He had all medical data from my GP/Internist for last 18-months. And he had details about my PSA values, testing methods, and equipment for all values back to 2004. He then performed an extensive DRE, which found unusually small and soft prostate with no abnormalities, hard spots, or lumps. However, the prostate is small enough the the PSA density, (PSA value 9.24), is troubling. He wants me to abstain from sex and bike riding for two weeks and then have another PSA analysis, including Free PSA. His experience is that a week of abstinence, (bicycle riding and sex), is usually sufficient but with my particular anatomy, style of bike riding, and history he wants two full weeks to allow the prostate to calm after the exam and the three very hard bicycle rides I have done in the last four days. His alternative was to do the 3T MP MRI tomorrow but he is pretty sure that it will find nothing and I will still have to go two weeks for the next PSA blood draw. IF he thinks a biopsy is needed, after the next PSA result is known, he will order a 3T MP MRI prior to the biopsy. We discussed fusion / in bore biopsy but he is no fan. He has done a lot of them and was initially excited about them but know feels they provide little better sensitivity compared to a TRUS-biopsy done after careful examination of the prior 3T MP MRI. I asked about going direct to a Prostate Template biopsy (36 or 54 core) to avoid the low sensitivity of a TRUS-Biopsy. With my \"quite small\" prostate he thinks it would be hard to miss a lesion when doing a standard TRUS-biopsy while carefully consulting the prior MRI image. His extensive experience tells him that any small malignant mass in my particular case will be detected by a TRUS-Biopsy. He does a lot of 4KScoring after the biopsy and uses the other bio-marker analysis as well as genetic examination of the biopsy tumor specimens if found. His primary message was to avoid over diagnosis and certainly over treatment. His bottom line to me was \"I've only lost one patient to an aggressive cancer that we could have caught earlier with a more aggressive diagnosis and treatment. We are learning to be much more cautious and calculating in our diagnosis and treatment plans and I see no need to rush anything in your case.\" I asked him about windows of treatment opportunity how long they stay open. He again stressed that few cancers that are undetectable with DRE and a PSA<10 would suddenly become aggressive. If - IF! - the MRI finds anything suspicious and then a biopsy yields cells to type, grade, and get genetic details from, he will then be able to determine if a sudden acceleration of tumor growth MIGHT be possible. But, for now we will wait and test again later in June. I guess we older men, or men with elevated PSA, and no biopsy details just have to learn to live with a fair amount of unpleasant uncertainty. No bicycle riding for two weeks is a real problem because that is over 200 miles and at least 14 hours riding, which burns 900 calories/hour. I can easily go two weeks with no sex but I cannot stop drinking beer for two weeks, which is what I would have to do if I don't burn that extra 900+ calories a day.",

      "Content": "Recovery from a RALP is tricky for old endurance jocks like us. Our history and experience leads us to think we \"can just do it\" but there is more to the recovery than one first realizes. I have had a lifetime of demanding physical endeavors - 10-years as a concrete laborer in the hot Virginia sun, long distance running, bicycling, hiking, back country ski expeditions, monumental alpine climbs... etc. I have always been used to and able to \"push on through\" to take one more step, to climb one more hill, over and over until the destination is achieved, no matter the cost. The RALP surgery leaves little external physical indication of the enormous stress your body has suffered and is continuing to endure. It is easy to look at your abdomen and compare it to old injuries that barely slowed you down. A couple days after the surgery I was apparently well on the way to recovery, from an external visual perspective, and felt like \"no big deal\" was the answer. But, internally your body is recovering from a lot of trauma and is spending vast amounts of energy repairing that damage. There were times when I just could not summon the energy to stand up and move or even to take those few steps to get a drink of juice - I was too tired! Not sore, not in pain - just exhausted. I felt like a failure when I compared my current state with how I felt after previous monumental physical efforts that seemed to require more of me. I guess the combination of many years abuse to the body and all the internal trauma makes the recovery much slower and more exhausting than external symptoms would lead us to believe.",

Small practical details that would have been a burden and hard effort for me were simple and easy for her. I am sure I would have been very unhappy, and mentally exhausted, if I had to deal with even one of those a day. For example, my catheter bag leaked badly the first time I tried to empty it and made a mess in the master bathroom. She had to get down on her hands and knees to mop up behind the toilet. That would have been near impossible for me! Or - the garbage can need to be taken out to the street the 4th day after surgery. I could probably have done the job and probably would have hurt myself. It was easy for her. Physically - I needed no help and was able to care for myself. Mentally and Emotionally - I would not want to have spent the two weeks post surgery all alone. You do need someone to stand by, watch out, and provide an emotional crutch.",

      "Content": "I had my 2nd appointment with a urologist today and was dreading it because my PSA had gone from 9.2 on May 18 to 10.2 on June 20. And, my Free PSA percentage was 8.4% on June 20. I used a prostate risk calculator (age, family history, PSA, Free PSA %), which said 35% chance high grade cancer and 46% chance low grade cancer, which I interpreted to mean 81% chance of having PCa. That seems like a BIG number to me! Summary result: \u201cyou need a biopsy but there is no rush and we\u2019ve got a few other things to do first\u201d His demeanor and attitude was calm and reeked of experience and certitude. He made it clear by word, expression, and tone that he had seen all this many times and knows exactly what to do and when to do it. His ONLY concern was that I commit to having the biopsy on the schedule he selected and, in the manner, he chooses. He was willing to discuss many topics and answer a lot of questions but he repeatedly stressed that nothing he said and no test results we receive in the interim would diminish the need for a TRUS/12-core biopsy. Forty minutes after entering his office, my wife and I left with a more positive and less stressed outlook. At the start of the appointment he gave me the June 20 PSA value (10.2). I asked about the Free PSA percentage and he plainly said \u201cFree PSA is of no diagnostic value with a PSA score above 10. You ABSOLUTELY need a biopsy with a PSA 10 ng/ml and the Free PSA value will not change that fact.\u201d He would venture no opinion about Free PSA % as an indicator/predictor of Lo-grade or Hi-grade PCa. He just stressed that with a PSA above 10 and having doubled in five years - a biopsy is mandatory and the grade, type, and amount of PCa would become more clear after the biopsy. I again stressed that \u201cI don\u2019t fear or worry about any procedures but do worry very much, even obsess, about consistently high PSA values with negative biopsies.\u201d His response was \u201cYou learn to deal with it while understanding that I have many patients with a PSA consistently above 20 or 30 with no sign of PCa after more than six biopsies, some guided by a 3T MP MRI. Some men just have \u2018PSA leakage\u2019 which results in abnormally high PSA but we never find a cancer.\u201d The Next Steps in my Journey: Today \u2013 4KScore blood draw He believes the patient should have all possible information as early in the process as is possible. He finds the 4KScore is helpful in making the patient understand the nature of their problem. Tomorrow \u2013 3T MP MRI with NO rectal antenna July 18 \u2013 another appointment to discuss 4K and MRI results. He will also obtain a rectal swap to determine which antibiotic(s) to take before, during, and after the biopsy Later in July \u2013 TRUS/12 Core biopsy using image (but not fused) prepared by his radiologist as a guide for sample locations. I use a rectal enema the morning of the biopsy. Antibiotic(s) may be given prior to the procedure, during the procedure (if necessary), and after the procedure based on the rectal swap results. He does the biopsy using Propofol sedation unless the patient asks not to be sedated. I am all for Propofol sedation. I\u2019ve had two endoscopies, an AFib electro conversion (shock to the heart), and three colonoscopies under Propofol and really appreciate the peace of mind and lack of stress it provides. I\u2019ve got a 13-year history of heart arrythmias and he wants a cardiologist to clear me for the Propofol prior to the biopsy. I had two Propofol sedated colonoscopies in fall 2016 ( I had 2-week serious colon cancer scare with severe rectal bleeding and mysterious lump in upper colon on a contrast CT scan ) so have no concern about the general anesthetic. My GP/Internist did a 12-lead EKG study last month and found no abnormalities so that may satisfy the anesthesiologist. The biopsy takes 10-minutes so I will be sedated for only 15-minutes and should be out of recovery in less than an hour. He has done over 3,000 biopsies using the same two pathologists during the last fifteen years and is very confident about their findings. But, he said they have automatic procedures to send all images and biopsy material to John Hopkins for a 2nd opinion if the patient requests or if he or the pathologist wants a 2nd opinion. The biopsy results will be available three business days after the procedure and he will see me five days after the biopsy to discuss results and potential tactics and/or treatments.",

      "Content": "Recovery from a RALP is tricky for old endurance jocks like us. Our history and experience leads us to think we \"can just do it\" but there is more to the recovery than one first realizes. I have had a lifetime of demanding physical endeavors - 10-years as a concrete laborer in the hot Virginia sun, long distance running, bicycling, hiking, back country ski expeditions, monumental alpine climbs... etc. I have always been used to and able to \"push on through\" to take one more step, to climb one more hill, over and over until the destination is achieved, no matter the cost. The RALP surgery leaves little external physical indication of the enormous stress your body has suffered and is continuing to endure. It is easy to look at your abdomen and compare it to old injuries that barely slowed you down. A couple days after the surgery I was apparently well on the way to recovery, from an external visual perspective, and felt like \"no big deal\" was the answer. But, internally your body is recovering from a lot of trauma and is spending vast amounts of energy repairing that damage. There were times when I just could not summon the energy to stand up and move or even to take those few steps to get a drink of juice - I was too tired! Not sore, not in pain - just exhausted. I felt like a failure when I compared my current state with how I felt after previous monumental physical efforts that seemed to require more of me. I guess the combination of many years abuse to the body and all the internal trauma makes the recovery much slower and more exhausting than external symptoms would lead us to believe.",

He then decides we should \"speed up\" the process and wants me to have a Radical Prostatectomy ASAP with a maximum delay of less than 4-weeks. August 14 I meet with the RALP surgeon who reviews ALL the tests and images and states there is \"no rush and no reason to hurry my decision about surgery or radiation.\" He goes on to say that I can safely take \"a couple months\" to make my decision. The surgeon reminds me he has treated over 1,600 men with PCa by removing their prostate and he knows for sure that my case does not demand a rush to treatment or even decision making August 23 I have the surgery which shows the PCa had escaped the prostate capsule. Neither doctor will tell me if I needed to rush the surgery.

I had no idea there was so much happening in the drug, hormone, and immunotherapy world that will help us prostate cancer survivors. Your story is truly an inspiration. And, it is very encouraging to a post-RALP patient with adverse pathology to know that so much research is moving forward and into commercial exploitation. I really enjoyed the story because it is so local for my wife and I. She grew up in Longview in a family business which supported the timber and logging industry. Her family owned a large Christmas Tree farm on the Toutle and she learned to ski and do crazy stuff on snow mobiles at Mt. St. Helens. I was a hard core Gorge board sailor '82 thru '99. One of my best friends lived and died in Chehalis. My first wife was from Vancouver, Wa. I lived in Tacoma for 38 years between 1965 and 2013.",

      "Content": "All I want to do this week is schedule my da.. biopsy But am having no luck accomplishing that seemingly simple task. SO am posting here just to give myself somewhere to vent. Is it always so hard to keep the PCa process moving along at what, to the patient, seems like a reasonable pace, but to the medical specialists is just the normal, \"no hurry here\" pace? Or, does this patient have unreasonable expectations as to the pace of progress, diagnosis, and decision making? May 24 My Internist tells me my PSA has gone from 5.8 to 9.2 in a little less than 5-years and I need to see a urologist May 24 - May 28 Receive invaluable advice here, which convinces me to get biopsy ASAP May 29 Schedule first urologist appointment ASAP June 6 First urologist exam results in another PSA test scheduled for June 20 June 27 2nd Urologist visit where I learn PSA has increased to 10.2 with 8.4% Free PSA. Urologist Schedules MRI ASAP and draws blood for 4KScore and tells me he is on vacation until July 17 June 28 3T mpMRI July 6 receive copy of radiologist report 0.3cc lesion in 18cc prostate results in PIRADS 3 due to indeterminate tumor Up to this point I feel like I am making adequate and reasonable progress toward a diagnosis. But, I have to wait another 12-days because my urologist is on vacation. July 18 3rd Urologist visit (mid-morning) where I learn 4KScore shows 34% probability of Gleason 7 or greater. He wants to schedule TRUS 12-core biopsy ASAP but needs medical and cardio clearance from my Internist. Urologist thinks my May 24 EKG and lab results should be current enough for the clearance he needs. But, I must wait for his scheduler to call me and they will contact my Internist for clearance. July 19 Still no call from biopsy scheduler so I call that number and leave message but get no call back July 20 I leave two more messages for biopsy scheduler but get no call back. Finally at 3 PM I get a call, which tells me they cannot schedule the biopsy unitl they receive medical clearance from my Internist, which is new news to me and something I wished I had known because my Internist's back office is careless. Biopsy scheduler says they sent two faxes to my Internist but \"don't think either one went thru because our machine was out of paper the first time and wasn't working the 2nd time.\" I offer to call my internist but get the answer \"It is late on Friday and we won't do anything more until Monday morning.\" July 23 I Call my Internist but am not allowed to talk to the office staff so ask them to call me back about the missing Fax. I get no call back, despite sending another e-mail requesting help. I call biopsy scheduler who sends another FAX to my Internist. I call my internist at 11 AM and am told they have not received any of three faxes but tell me to come in for the EKG and medical exam at 3 PM. Internist will not sign off on medical release using EKG, blood tests, and physical exams that are more than 10-days old and does not care how the urologist feels about my May exams, labs, and EKG. July 23 3 PM My Internist and her office can find no copy of Fax sent to them from my Urologist. EKG is clear so I call my urologist who insists they sent three Faxes. My internist sends her RN out to search \"everywhere\" for the missing faxes while Internist attends rest of medical exam. My Internist then finds an infected wound on my ankle. I knew about it and told her it was two-weeks old and healing slowly but that is what happens with wounds down there. She agreed and said she would not mention it or consider the wound in the medical clearance decsion. RN returns with the missing faxes, which had a heading of \"Pre-Procedure Insurance Clearance\" but, since I had no scheduled procedure, the office staff discarded them. Whoops! Urologist clearance form plainly asks about open wounds and infections so my Internist cannot sign the form. She gives me Rx for 7-day antibiotic and treats the wound with topical antibiotic. She schedules another appointment for July 27 to see if wound has healed enough for her to give me clearance for the biopsy. I have suffered many serious lower leg injuries in the last ten years due to mountain bike crashes. All those wounds do heal but they take about 4-weeks to completely heal up. July 25 - I cannot get the biopsy scheduled until next week so I decide to go ahead with my semi-annual bi-lateral cortisone injections in my creaky old knees (7-surgeries over the last 55-years). My long time knee doc's PA sees the wound on my ankle and tells me that cortisone is out of the question because of it's negative effect on wound healing due to it diminishing lucocyte effectivetivness. She examines the wound in detail and tells me that it will be at least three-weeks until the wound and infection heals enough to have an invasive procedure such as a 12-core biopsy. I've sent a note to the urologist asking him if can do the biopsy after my 7-day antibiotic regimine, which ends noon Monday July 30 but have heard no answer. Given what I know now - my biopsy cannot be scheduled until at least August 17 which means I will not receive a diagnosis and Gleason score until at least August 25. Is this about the normal course of events (91 days from PSA results to biopsy results) in the early diagonstic stages of the PCa journey? Am I being impatient? I know PCa moves at a slower pace and is seldom an acute problem... BUT, is it humane to have over 3-months elapse from the time a patient is told PSA=9 with 1 in 3 probabilty of clinically significant PCa to the pathology report on that PCa? I guess the answer is - \"It is what it is and I just need to accept it and continue to live with positive thoughts\"... but that is hard to do! Rant over ... now I feel a little better.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the Medscape link. That was one of the many things I had read. What I find most interesting is the Kaiser Permanete Clinical Review ( https://provider.ghc.org/all-sites/c...df/4kscore.pdf ) prepared for their physicians in late 2017. There is insufficient evidence in the published medical literature to show that this service/therapy is as safe as standard services/therapies and/or provides better long-term outcomes than current standard services/therapies. And then provides many technical details that to my somewhat well trained statistical eye appear to actually confirm the test does provide very useful information to someone like me who is trying to decide about biopsy / no biopsy. The authors compared the predictive accuracy of the 4Kscore vs. a modified Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator (PCPTRC) 2.0. The results showed that the 4Kscore had a significantly higher discrimination in detecting Gleason ≥7 cancer compared to modified PCPTRC 2.0 (AUC 0.82 versus 0.74, p<0.0001) Kaiser Permanente/Group Health is the largest HMO in the United States and employs more than 21,000 physicians. A new twist in my decision process is that the practice suggesting the 3T MP MRI as a first step assured me that the 4KScore test is covered by Medicare but they recommend the MRI as a first step and then the 4KScore can be used if the MRI reveals suspicious lumps and bumps in my prostate. I was sent a e-mail by the practice billing department to confirm Medicare does pay for the 4KScore test. A May 18, 2018 draft policy by Medicare administrative services provider Novitas Solutions recommends denying coverage for OPKO's 4Kscore test. That draft policy seemed to state that CMS (Medicare) will not pay for a 4KScore test. That draft policy is open for comments thru July 5, 2018 so who knows when the official CMS decision will occur.",

      "Content": "Michael F said \"Like a sailing regatta, navigate it one leg at a time. But be sure an expert URO MD is your navigator! \" Having been a navigator in a factory sponsored race sailboat I do appreciate the value of such a person. However, I graduated to being a Tactician and realized that the best Navigator cannot overcome bad tactics. The Navigator gets us to where we want to go but I am concerned with knowing where to go. Will the next windshift be sufficient to counter the backeddy of the tidal shore current on the rhumb line or should we stay offshore and avoid the backeddy? If not - navigating to the point were the wind shift first occurs is of no value. At this point it seems to me that starting with the 3T MP MRI would give the best possible information about potential lesions and lumps hidden in the Prostate and can then be used for fused guidance if a biopsy is indicated subsequent to seeing the MRI picture. As you say - a biopsy is most likely in the next couple years so Why Not start with imaging that also serves as a guide for that most likely biopsy. Looking at your signature - Why did you have a biopsy with a PSA < 3.0? Was it the positive DRE? My family doc was a board certified internist and quite confident that they knew how to do a thorough DRE. With a PSA fluctuating up AND down between 4.0 and 5.8 for 3.5 years (age 63 - 65) but always a \"normal\" DRE they felt I was at a low risk of PCa and PSA/DRE testing every other year was sufficient. If a Urology practice tells me that Medicare/Florida Blue Plan F will pay 100% of the cost of a procedure/diagnostic test is it safe to believe them? I can find no way to verify that such an event is actually covered by Medicare.",

      "Content": "I have an appointment next Wednesday with a local urologist who is the senior partner in a large SW Florida practice. He wants to talk with my wife and I and review my PSA and family history as well as our attitudes and concerns. He will then recommend next steps. The practice website and patient testimonials indicate the use of pretty new technology and techniques. One of their more interesting diagnostic tools, from my perceptive, is the 4KScore blood analysis. I did a lot of professional work developing similar predictive scoring, based on historical measures, in a far different field. I have spent a lot of time studying the various validation studies for OPKO and 4KScore and think I have a good understanding of the advantages and potential problems. I have verified that Medicare will not pay the $400 cost of a 4KScore blood analysis. My other local option is to have a 3T Multiparametric MR Imaging & 3D Prostate Mapping procedure done by a different practice, which tells me is 100% covered by Medicare and my Florida Blue supplemental insurance. I am having trouble understanding the advantage of having the 4KScore , which only yields the probability of an aggressive cancer when the 3TMP MRI will actually show lesions and lumps and can subsequently be used for biopsy guidance in a fused situation. I like the idea of starting with another simple blood test but wonder what information I actually gain from that blood test. Does anyone have any 4KScore experience that can explain the 4KScore advantage over starting with a sophisticated MRI?",

      "Content": "Lost my father to a similar and rather unexpected problem. The last month of his life tore our family of four siblings apart and that rupture has not been repaired in 10-years. My father was a retired veterinarian who had led a wonderful and productive life. He was 91-years old and in good health when the grim prognosis was given. He had won a total remission from a quite rare lymphoma ten-years earlier. That was a cancer which had about a 1% 2-year survival rate so he was used to knowing bad news and planning for it. Dad made his wishes crystal clear: - no extraordinary measures - he wanted to die with dignity at home - he wanted to die in a state of peace and had the means to effect that - he wanted to die while he still had his mental facilities and was able to tell his family good-bye He told each and every one of his children and his four siblings the same thing \"I want to die my way at my time\" The family clearly understood and agreed. He was the eldest son and the most successful of his five brothers and sisters and was always the leader of the family. When his end time approached my sister panicked and got a court order to hospitalize him and to declare him mentally incompetent and made my sister his guardian. In the hospital (medical not hospice); he underwent many gruesome procedures which extended his end time by weeks. He was in pain, some physical but most mental, as he lay there in agony waiting to die. He called me, I lived 3,000 miles away, and begged for help because none of us brothers knew he had been institutionalized. We brothers retained an attorney to fight the court order but my sister's attorney was far more skilled at manipulating the Florida Baker act. End result - he died exactly the way he feared. But, he was able to kill himself while in the hospital. A truly terrible end to a near perfect life. The family has never recovered from the trauma of that last month of his life. We now know my father could have had even more explicit end of life instructions that would have prevented my sister from getting the court order. Please make sure you ALL know and agree about your fathers end time and how HE wants it to proceed. Sorry to be so dark and gloomy but it is hard to describe the misery we experienced during that last month of court battles and terrible hospital visits.",

      "Content": "During my January 9 post-RALP discussion with my MO we spent a bit of time on Ultrasensitive PSA tests (see my prior posting about that). My MO took the time and made the effort to explain that there is a PSA analogue, which is/can be detected by the µPSA test. I did not write down the specifics but in general the PSA analogue is produced by cells in the urinary tract (he gave me the technical name but ????), which have an embryological origin from the same source as normal prostate cells, which produce PSA. There is no way, at the .001 - .003 ng/ml measurement level to differentiate between PSA produced by stray prostate cells that were left behind after the surgery, PCa cells that escaped the capsule and were not removed during surgery, or those cells which produce the analogue PSA and are a normal part of the urinary tract. The amount of analogue PSA produced is highly individual. This was another reason he felt that Ultrasensitive PSA testing was not necessary in my case, and if I understood him correctly in this highly technical discussion, µPSA testing produces a third digit of noise. I have been unable to find any additional information about this topic.",

      "Content": "Reading the guidelines has been a real eye opener for me. It confirms that many of our decisions are made with little statistical evidence to support them. I do understand the complexity of PCa treatment and do appreciate that clinical judgement and experience are critical to the decision making process. BUT - looking closely at just one guideline I have found some interesting information. I have SM+ and EPE+ with G7 (3+4) post RALP and will eventually have to make a decision as indicated in Guideline 2 below. My surgeon, with more than 1,600 RALP surgeries experience, is leaning strongly on Guideline 2. So, I am analyzing it in great detail, particularly in light of more current research, knowing the Guidelines were published six-years ago based on diagnostics, chemistry, and treatments, which are now at least seven-years old. I am mostly quoting from the Guidelines and have placed those quotes in italics AUOA Guideline 2. \"Patients with adverse pathologic findings including seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margins, and extraprostatic extension should be informed that adjuvant radiotherapy, compared to radical prostatectomy only, reduces the risk of biochemical (PSA) recurrence, local recurrence, and clinical progression of cancer. They should also be informed that the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy on subsequent metastases and overall survival is less clear; one of two randomized controlled trials that addressed these outcomes indicated a benefit but the other trial did not demonstrate a benefit. However, the other trial was not powered to test the benefit regarding metastases and overall survival. (Clinical Principle)\" Definition of Clinical Principal: \"For some clinical issues, there was little or no evidence from which to construct evidence-based statements. Where gaps in the evidence existed, the Panel provides guidance in the form of Clinical Principles... with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique if differences of opinion emerged. A Clinical Principle is a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature.\" Discussion of Guideline 2: \"All three trials documented significant improvements in biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS) with use of ART compared to RP only (pooled hazard ratio of 0.48\" \"SWOG 8794 and EORTC 22911 also both demonstrated improved clinical progression-free survival (defined as clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence or death but not including biochemical progression) at more than 10 years of follow up in ART patients compared to RP only patients. This difference was statistically significant in SWOG 8794 and borderline significant (p = 0.054) in EORTC 22911. The Panel also judged improved clinical progression-free survival as an important endpoint because it reflects lower rates of local and distant failure as well as lower death rates associated with the use of ART.\" My graduate school statistics professor, who was a student of Snedecor who developed the Fischer F-test (statistical significance) used to say \"claiming a result is borderline significant (p = 0.054) is like betting on a horse to win a race and then trying to claim part of the prize because it only lost by a nose!\" It is significant or it is not significant and anyone who claims borderline is not a real scientist. Therefore, IMHO, the statement \"demonstrated improved clinical progression-free survival (defined as clinical or imaging evidence of recurrence or death\" was not replicated by any study. \"Therefore, in the context of offering ART to patients, it should be emphasized that there is less certainty regarding potential benefits in terms of preventing metastatic recurrence and improving overall survival.\" \"Only SWOG 8794 demonstrated significantly improved overall survival (74% in ART patients compared to 66% for RP only patients) and significantly improved metastatic recurrence-free survival (defined as evidence of metastases or death from any cause; 71% for ART patients compared to 61% for RP only patients) with the use of ART compared to RP only at more than 12 years of follow-up. These findings did not replicate in EORTC 22911 at median 10.6 years of follow-up.\" AND... \"Overall, the interpretation that ART leads to superior outcomes is difficult to make with certainty\" AND... \"Given these issues, the Panel concluded that it is not possible from the available evidence to address the question of the superiority of ART vs. SRT. A recent propensity score-matched, multi-institutional analysis has attempted to address this issue, reporting no difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival rates at 60 months between pT3N0 patients administered RT adjuvantly compared to those observed and treated with early SRT (with PSA ≤ 0.5 ng/ml).\" Sounds to me like they are saying - We are statistically certain ART reduces the incidence of BCR but cannot find REPLICABLE studies that demonstrate better overall survival rates or even lower rates of metastic disease for ART patients. ART, with its wide range of long term side effects, does significantly reduce the occurrence of BCR but there seems to be little statistical evidence that long term survival, PCa Specific survival, or even clinical progression is reduced by the use of ART.",

I've posted a lot of stuff about PIRADS 3 (my specifications) but in summary - about 70% of men with a PIRADS 3 are found not to have clinically significant PCa upon biopsy or surgery. The free PSA number is also getting high enough it too indicates a low probability of no clinically significant PCa (free PSA 20% to 25% about a 1 in 6 chance (16%) of having significant PCa), which is quite similar to the PIRAD s assessment. In May 2018, before I started this PCa adventure, I was very negative about prostate biopsy and had lots of \"good\" reason to resist getting one. My opinion now is the 12-core TRUS biopsy is very low risk and if done under Propofil is not a bit unpleasant or uncomfortable. The biopsy cannot tell you there is NO PCa (it misses about half?) but it can confirm there is PCa and help you decide about the appropriate next steps. If you really want to get confirmation then a biopsy might be a good idea but I would be looking at another PSA test in 6-months to see which trend your PSA is taking. IF - the dates on those PSA scores are not displayed correctly - then some of my ramblings here are of little value.",

      "Content": "Propofol! In last 15-years I've had two endoscopies, three colonoscopies, a cardiac conversion, and prostate biopsy under the divine sedation of Propofol (Diprivan). Out like a light for five to 30-minutes and then suddenly awake and it's all over with no memory, pain, or agitation. I can think of no reason to have those somewhat unpleasant procedures done while fully conscious. As far as taking action now - I too am a action person who makes extensive decision trees prior to major life events, or even some minor ones. What to do, after the DRE, MRI, 4KScore, Free PSA tests was driving me crazy, literally CRAZY! I couldn't sleep, I could not concentrate, and found myself obsessing over diagnosis probabilities and treatment modalities. My MO hit me over the head several times and smacked me in the face once with \"I've done this thousands of times, I've helped men down this road many times a month for over 25-years and really do know what I am doing. SO - please let me guide you as we get more information.\" He stressed that NO Decisions of any kind were necessary, in fact would not be appropriate, prior to getting the biopsy information back. He then stressed \"I've never lost a patient, EVER, due to being cautious and taking our time to make an informed decision.\" He worked hard to make sure that I could talk with him as much as I wished after the biopsy as we then formulated a plan to deal with the biopsy results. He also told me that I would probably want to talk with other medical professionals about the biopsy results, e.g radiation guys, maybe HIFU proponents, and even, hopefully, active surveillance advocates. His main takeaway was that PCa treatment is complex and can take many unexpected twists and turns. All we, the patient, can do is take one more step with the one more bit of information we gain. Step -by- Step without looking too far into the future. It is a hard lesson - to take this journey step by step, but, at least in my case with my mental attitude, looking too far into the future is counter productive. And, I did learn that my MO really did anticipate ALL my questions and concerns and provided almost all the information I wanted and needed without me asking for it.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MIKEinCNY Thank you its a lot to take in. But how do I know its only in the prostate? They said stage T2b but that was just from the core samples I haven't had any other tests yet. That was the hardest part for me during the diagnosis phase of my PCa adventure. The uncertainty, the multiple options and decision points. You just have to live with uncertainty and making decisions with limited information. You can read all the studies, use the nomograms, calculate the odds but eventually you have to make a choice and it is you and only you who can make that choice. Do to the uncertainty of my diagnosis (there was way too much PSA given the identified size of the prostate and the suspected tumor so something was amisss) I chose the certainty of a RALP and the clear identification of the pathology post surgery. I have previously described (in other threads here) my mind set and confusion prior to the surgery and the clarity and reduction of my mental stress post surgery. All that uncertainly weighted heavily on my mind and spirits until the pathologist gave me a specific diagnosis of measured and weighed tissue. All you can do at this point is read, ask questions, and try to remember that 99% of men with G7 PCa are still alive and well after 10-years. The disease is treatable and manageable but knowing that only makes it a little easier to deal with the day to day anxiety as you wait for treatment options and decisions.",

      "Content": "Does anyone have any experience with starting a statin regimen in the middle of a series of ultrasensitive PSA tests? I am confused about the interaction of statins and PSA, testosterone, androgen receptors, etc! I've reviewed several studies that seem to contradict each other and can find no recent threads on this forum about statins. The following article published by the Prostate Cancer Foundation seems to link statins with all kinds of prostate cancer and PSA effects: https://www.pcf.org/news/statins-pro...-magic-bullet/ A recent cardic stress test with radionuclide study found several \"minor\" blockages in my ventricular muscle blood flow. I am almost always asymptomatic for heart problems. Now my new cardiologist wants to put me on a statin regimen to reduce my cholesterol and thus reduce the plaque in those small heart blood vessels. I am reluctant to start down the statin path because my Total Cholesterol last spring was 176, HDL was 56, LDL was 74 and has been in that same range for at least 15-years. All my previous internists and cardiologists told me those were almost \"optimum\" cholesterol values for a semi-geriatric subject. This new (to me) cardiologist just told me that any LDL value over 70 in a patient with imaging results showing even minor blockages needs to have their LDL reduced to minimize the arterial plaque and significantly reduce the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. My four month post RALP µPSA blood draw will be just after the first of the year. Should I wait until after that blood draw to start the statins? I don't know which statin I will be taking because my CK values have been three to five times normal for the last 10-years (600 to 1100). The cardiologist needs to determine why and what those values mean before starting the statins because CK is used to monitor statin toxicity. A little background detail: I am asymptomatic about 99.9% of the time. I ride my bicycle six or more hours a week with an average heart rate over 135 and can easily keep my heart over 155 for 30-minutes at a time. I've been riding that way since I was a teenager. BUT - I have a long history of rapid heart rates (HR > 160 at rest and >210 while exercising), sudden short lived hypertension (BP > 180/95), and irregular heart rythms (AFib or SVT depending on who is interpreting the data). Those events are annoying but until recently were of little concern. In October 2018 I experienced tachycardia, hypertension, and irregular rhythms almost continually for four days. I did go for a longish bike ride during the event and the sypmtoms vanished during my ride but returned a few hours after I cooled off. I partially \"grayed out\" making lunch the 4th-day so made my way to the ER where they diagnosed SVT wave form and injected lopressor, which immediately returned my heart to normal condition. Subsequent studies have identified \"minor\" blockages in some of the smaller ventricle blood vessels and a \"2nd pathway\" for the ventricle nerve signal that causes contraction. None of this is a surprise because the same things were identified in 2004 at which time my cardiologist, a fellow runner and bicycle rider, told me not to worry about it and to just live with the occasional cardiac events. He did say if those events lasted more than 48-hours to seek medical help - so I did, which resulted in the afore mentioned stress test.",

      "Content": "The most important thing you can do - ASK Questions - here and at the doctors office. I had a constantly increasing PSA score from 2004 until my prostatectomy in August 2018. My internist in May 2018 convinced me to pay attention and learn more about the disease and what I needed to do. Back then, late May when I first logged into this forum, I was the typical over educated \"know it all\" who really knew almost nothing and what I did know was mis-leading. The brothers here were patient and then aggressive about answering my questions, prodding me to take action, and forcing me to confront my disease. I am quite certain that without this forums guidance and prompting I would have not moved as quickly to rid my body of the cancer. Ask for help - debate - question - read - learn and let us help you move forward. No question or concern you might have is off limits, too simple, or too obvious. If you don't have the answers or information you want - ask for it!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MIKEinCNY Thank you its a lot to take in. But how do I know its only in the prostate? They said stage T2b but that was just from the core samples I haven't had any other tests yet. That was the hardest part for me during the diagnosis phase of my PCa adventure. The uncertainty, the multiple options and decision points. You just have to live with uncertainty and making decisions with limited information. You can read all the studies, use the nomograms, calculate the odds but eventually you have to make a choice and it is you and only you who can make that choice. Do to the uncertainty of my diagnosis (there was way too much PSA given the identified size of the prostate and the suspected tumor so something was amisss) I chose the certainty of a RALP and the clear identification of the pathology post surgery. I have previously described (in other threads here) my mind set and confusion prior to the surgery and the clarity and reduction of my mental stress post surgery. All that uncertainly weighted heavily on my mind and spirits until the pathologist gave me a specific diagnosis of measured and weighed tissue. All you can do at this point is read, ask questions, and try to remember that 99% of men with G7 PCa are still alive and well after 10-years. The disease is treatable and manageable but knowing that only makes it a little easier to deal with the day to day anxiety as you wait for treatment options and decisions.",

      "Content": "\"Are you worried about a statin \"artificially\" lowering your PSA? \" I guess that is my concern? The surgeon who performed the RALP was pessimistic about my long term BCR prognosis due to SM+ and EPE+. At the time we talked about the 0.021 in mid-October he was concerned it would show some increase by January 2019. I am going to see my medical oncologist Jan 9 to review the ultrasensitive PSA for which I will have a blood draw in early January. The oncologist told me, prior to the RALP but after he did the biopsy, he thought there would be less than a 25% chance I would need adjuvant or salvage radiation post surgery. I don't want to get in the situation that the January 2019 µPSA is ~0.02? (not decreased since the early October test) and either doc worries the statin is holding the PSA level down and the January value is really an increase. As you suggest - it seems like waiting another 3-weeks to start the statin regimen is a reasonable idea. I have always heard bad words and feelings about statins (mother hated hers!) and wonder if they really have the side effects, about which I have heard and read so much.",

      "Content": "Does anyone have any experience with starting a statin regimen in the middle of a series of ultrasensitive PSA tests? I am confused about the interaction of statins and PSA, testosterone, androgen receptors, etc! I've reviewed several studies that seem to contradict each other and can find no recent threads on this forum about statins. The following article published by the Prostate Cancer Foundation seems to link statins with all kinds of prostate cancer and PSA effects: https://www.pcf.org/news/statins-pro...-magic-bullet/ A recent cardic stress test with radionuclide study found several \"minor\" blockages in my ventricular muscle blood flow. I am almost always asymptomatic for heart problems. Now my new cardiologist wants to put me on a statin regimen to reduce my cholesterol and thus reduce the plaque in those small heart blood vessels. I am reluctant to start down the statin path because my Total Cholesterol last spring was 176, HDL was 56, LDL was 74 and has been in that same range for at least 15-years. All my previous internists and cardiologists told me those were almost \"optimum\" cholesterol values for a semi-geriatric subject. This new (to me) cardiologist just told me that any LDL value over 70 in a patient with imaging results showing even minor blockages needs to have their LDL reduced to minimize the arterial plaque and significantly reduce the risk of stroke or myocardial infarction. My four month post RALP µPSA blood draw will be just after the first of the year. Should I wait until after that blood draw to start the statins? I don't know which statin I will be taking because my CK values have been three to five times normal for the last 10-years (600 to 1100). The cardiologist needs to determine why and what those values mean before starting the statins because CK is used to monitor statin toxicity. A little background detail: I am asymptomatic about 99.9% of the time. I ride my bicycle six or more hours a week with an average heart rate over 135 and can easily keep my heart over 155 for 30-minutes at a time. I've been riding that way since I was a teenager. BUT - I have a long history of rapid heart rates (HR > 160 at rest and >210 while exercising), sudden short lived hypertension (BP > 180/95), and irregular heart rythms (AFib or SVT depending on who is interpreting the data). Those events are annoying but until recently were of little concern. In October 2018 I experienced tachycardia, hypertension, and irregular rhythms almost continually for four days. I did go for a longish bike ride during the event and the sypmtoms vanished during my ride but returned a few hours after I cooled off. I partially \"grayed out\" making lunch the 4th-day so made my way to the ER where they diagnosed SVT wave form and injected lopressor, which immediately returned my heart to normal condition. Subsequent studies have identified \"minor\" blockages in some of the smaller ventricle blood vessels and a \"2nd pathway\" for the ventricle nerve signal that causes contraction. None of this is a surprise because the same things were identified in 2004 at which time my cardiologist, a fellow runner and bicycle rider, told me not to worry about it and to just live with the occasional cardiac events. He did say if those events lasted more than 48-hours to seek medical help - so I did, which resulted in the afore mentioned stress test.",

      "Content": "A couple observations. Everything I read says PSA can vary 20% test to test (assuming it is always the same lab and same test) so going from 4.1 to 4.4 is not so worrisome if it is not the beginning of a trend. (0.3 increase is only a 7% increase). A six-month increase of 0.3 would give a doubling time of 6.8 years (off the 4.1 base) which is also not so worrisome. My PSA went from 4.0 to 5.8 back to 4.5 and back to 5.6 over a period of three years. FIVE years later my PSA was 9.2 and I was diagnosed with G7 (3+4) and EPE. Do you have more PSA history to show that increase of 0.3 is part of a trend? My urologist cautioned me that a 3T mpMRI is very good at finding major PCa tumors but not so good at finding smaller or less aggressive ones. I would not think a \"clear\" MRI would offer much peace of mind. You can see from my signature that my 3T mpMRI: - understated the tumor size by a factor of 20 - missed the extra-prostatetic extension - understated the prostate size by a factor of 2 thus leading to a PSA density measure over twice what it actually was - missed ALL the G7 tissue in the right lobe My summary for you is: - you need at least one more PSA test to get a trend line - you've had a negative biopsy - wait another three-months for another PSA Even with my G7 biopsy results - the RALP surgeon (1,600 procedures) said I could easily wait three or four months to have the prostate removed.

      "Content": "A couple observations. Everything I read says PSA can vary 20% test to test (assuming it is always the same lab and same test) so going from 4.1 to 4.4 is not so worrisome if it is not the beginning of a trend. (0.3 increase is only a 7% increase). A six-month increase of 0.3 would give a doubling time of 6.8 years (off the 4.1 base) which is also not so worrisome. My PSA went from 4.0 to 5.8 back to 4.5 and back to 5.6 over a period of three years. FIVE years later my PSA was 9.2 and I was diagnosed with G7 (3+4) and EPE. Do you have more PSA history to show that increase of 0.3 is part of a trend? My urologist cautioned me that a 3T mpMRI is very good at finding major PCa tumors but not so good at finding smaller or less aggressive ones. I would not think a \"clear\" MRI would offer much peace of mind. You can see from my signature that my 3T mpMRI: - understated the tumor size by a factor of 20 - missed the extra-prostatetic extension - understated the prostate size by a factor of 2 thus leading to a PSA density measure over twice what it actually was - missed ALL the G7 tissue in the right lobe My summary for you is: - you need at least one more PSA test to get a trend line - you've had a negative biopsy - wait another three-months for another PSA Even with my G7 biopsy results - the RALP surgeon (1,600 procedures) said I could easily wait three or four months to have the prostate removed. Take your time and gather more data.",

      "Content": "\"Are you worried about a statin \"artificially\" lowering your PSA? \" I guess that is my concern? The surgeon who performed the RALP was pessimistic about my long term BCR prognosis due to SM+ and EPE+. At the time we talked about the 0.021 in mid-October he was concerned it would show some increase by January 2019. I am going to see my medical oncologist Jan 9 to review the ultrasensitive PSA for which I will have a blood draw in early January. The oncologist told me, prior to the RALP but after he did the biopsy, he thought there would be less than a 25% chance I would need adjuvant or salvage radiation post surgery. I don't want to get in the situation that the January 2019 µPSA is ~0.02? (not decreased since the early October test) and either doc worries the statin is holding the PSA level down and the January value is really an increase. As you suggest - it seems like waiting another 3-weeks to start the statin regimen is a reasonable idea. I have always heard bad words and feelings about statins (mother hated hers!) and wonder if they really have the side effects, about which I have heard and read so much.",

      "Content": "Have not had a biopsy yet (next week I hope) but significant probability there will be a PCa treatment in my future. My wife tried to press the urologist about possible treatments (see note at end for the backstory on her real concern!). Urologist said that his most likely recommendation would be radiation rather than surgery. - I will be 71 next week with a life expectancy of 17 - 20 years - His opinion is that radiation has fewer significant side effects for us guys over 70 - Survival rates for radiation -vs- surgery at 15-years is identical - 20-year survival rate is marginally better for surgery - Surgery does not have enough potential positive lifespan benefits to outweigh near term negative impacts of surgery - He does not believe that a 71-year old in good health and physically fit/active is at any higher risk for surgical or anesthetic complication than a 55-year old I then asked about seeds -vs- external beam - My very small 18cc prostate is at the low end of the size where the seed radiation may damage tissue (bladder) external to the prostate - New robotic and focused external beams have even fewer side effects Dr. Blitz continually reminded me during this conversation: - 2 out of 3 men with my symptoms and test results only need active survellence - Treatment mode will depend on biopsy results - Treatment mode will be decided by joint consultation with: - Me - Wife - Medical Oncologist - Radiation Oncologist - Surgeon (Him) At this time, with what we know, there is no rush to judgement. I need to quit thinking so far ahead and concentrate on just the next step - THE BIOPSY! Wife Back Story: I am trying to buy a Melges MC Scow, which is a 16-foot serious racing sailboat. It is designed for one or two people and requires the operator to put their feet under straps on the centerline and lean back, way back, outside the boat to keep the boat on a 17 degree heel when sailing hard upwind in more than 10-knots. It is a strenuous exercise, which I have been doing for 35+ years, but she was very worried that I would buy the boat, have my gut cut open, and then not be able to sail the boat for six months to a year... she now needs a new reason to stop the purchase!",

      "Content": "I spent an hour with my selected surgeon today talking about RALP. He is friendly, open, explains things clearly and obviously wants me to understand and make the correct decision. He convinced me that RALP was the correct choice. He has done 1,600 RALP procedures as well as thousands of other urogenital robotic laparoscopic procedures. He says his 24-month incontinence rate, (defined as more than 2 dribble drops per event, more than twice a day) is less than 4%. He was also straight up about the left nerve will be sacrificed due to the 100% left lobe involvement. He thinks there is greater than a 50% chance of serious ED. My wife so so impressed that she signed me up for RALP next Thursday, Aug 23. And, I was greatly relieved to have made that decision. ... I think wife may have been pleased with the 50% ED number? BUT... I then spent 90+ minutes on the phone with a radiation oncologist who also had my mpMRi and biopsy results as well as all my lab/blood results. He was even more friendly and willing to share information in a form, (very technical and numeric), that I could easily grasp. We discussed much of the recent research comparing EBRT, Brachy, RP results. He pointed out that my numbers (T1c, Stage II, 100% positive left lobe cores 3 of which were 3+3 and 3 were 3+4 with one 100% 3+4 and one 60% 3+4) indicate at least a 35% probability of extra capsular extension (ECE). That number agrees with what Memorial Sloan Kettering website shows. My medical urologist (retired knife guy) discussed my path report with me last Friday and said he felt there was a 50% probability of ECE. Radiation guy says that means there is at least a 30% chance I will need some radiation therapy after the RP because that ECE will guarantee my PSA will not stay at 0.01 as everyone wants. Radiation guy also pointed out (strongly and vividly), that RP means the trans-prostate urethra is removed, the bladder pulleed down into the area voided by the prostate removal and then reconnected to the lower urethra. That is all normal delicate but easily done surgery. However! that means the lower part of the bladder is now over the prostate bed and will be heavily radiated with salvage radiation if the RP did not get all the cancer. The radiation guy is recommending 3-month oral ADT, EBRT (proton), and LDR brachytherapy to guarantee no biochemical recurrence. He did say the ADT benefit is marginal but, in his experience, oral ADT for just 3-months has minimal adverse side effects so he recommends it. I can stop the oral ADT if it becomes too upsetting to my wife or I. If I have a 30% chance of needing radiation AFTER the RP- then why not just start with the radiation and skip the surgery? Radiation guy claims less than 2% BCR (within prostate) at 10-years with a combination of EBRT & LDR brachy. Radiation guy makes a lot of sense to me but the RALP seems to be the safe and secure way to go with only a 1:3 chance of needing the additional radiation therapy. My wife is leaning towards the RP. ??",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate OTS, If you go with RT, the triple play of ADT, EBRT and BBT (brachy boost) appears to have some really good results. Actually, with BBT involved, the ADT may not make a difference. And (damn - more complications ) the boost can come from LDR-BT, HDR-BT, or SBRT. SBRT (Cyberknife or TrueBeam) was designed to supply the same Gy's as HDR-BT, without being invasive. All three of these boost treatments are available, and perhaps you should ask why this RO is preferring one type over the other two. We did discuss HDR-BT and SBRT in the context of doing that in addition to ADT and EBRT. I caught a little of what he said but the man took me at my word \"give me the details, all the details, and the numbers to support those details\" and he did ... for 90-minutes. Seldom am I overwhelmed when discussing very technical material but at that point, 70-minutes in, he had earned my trust and I let my mind relax a bit as he discussed HDR-BT and SBRT. He did a bit of them at other institutions and his facility can offer them but he prefers LDR . He gave me his personal cell number and his e-mail address and said to call or e-mail anytime. Already this evening, just 3-hours after I got off the phone, he has sent me three very technical and recent papers about combined RT, QOL, and long term toxicity. He seems genuinely interested in educating me and helping me make the right decision. Looks to be early '50s and has a strong academic and research background as well as clinical experience and leadership roles at some big cancer facilities.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MIKEinCNY Thank you its a lot to take in. But how do I know its only in the prostate? They said stage T2b but that was just from the core samples I haven't had any other tests yet. That was the hardest part for me during the diagnosis phase of my PCa adventure. The uncertainty, the multiple options and decision points. You just have to live with uncertainty and making decisions with limited information. You can read all the studies, use the nomograms, calculate the odds but eventually you have to make a choice and it is you and only you who can make that choice. Do to the uncertainty of my diagnosis (there was way too much PSA given the identified size of the prostate and the suspected tumor so something was amisss) I chose the certainty of a RALP and the clear identification of the pathology post surgery. I have previously described (in other threads here) my mind set and confusion prior to the surgery and the clarity and reduction of my mental stress post surgery. All that uncertainly weighted heavily on my mind and spirits until the pathologist gave me a specific diagnosis of measured and weighed tissue. All you can do at this point is read, ask questions, and try to remember that 99% of men with G7 PCa are still alive and well after 10-years. The disease is treatable and manageable but knowing that only makes it a little easier to deal with the day to day anxiety as you wait for treatment options and decisions.",

      "Content": "I've described my coping process in other threads here but will try to briefly cover MY way of dealing with the fundamental life changes you describe. I do understand a bit of your anguish about the many changes occurring in short order. For me, and my wife of 44-years: - sudden onset of seemingly serious heart problems after years of being told those problems would never be important - now need to take medicine to control heart rhythms, which adversely affects ALL my athletic endeavors - wife suffered two life threatening and debilitating bicycle accidents which now prevent her from riding with me, which has been a very important part of our life for over 35-years - wife went thru five serious orthopedic surgeries in three years in attempt to repair shoulder, arm, hip, leg with not so good results - move from San Diego to SW Florida and all the changes (good and bad) that entails - owning a home for the first time in 18-years (had been living on our sailboat since mid-2000) - termination of relationship with sister after death of our parents and her theft of several hundred K dollars from the estate (she was executrix) - wife retired from a job she loved and had worked at for 35-years and found she really missed the work and friends (now 2,800 miles distant) My wife and I have been a strong team since 1974. We've gone thru a lot of counseling as a couple and as individuals. I did graduate work in counseling and she had some undergraduate classes in the same while studying to be a speech therapist and special ed teacher. Our prior experiences were not sufficient to get us through the trauma, physical and mental of all the changes, gravely exacerbated by my PCa diagnosis and treatment, since 2014. I was fortunate to find a Ph.D counselor with vast experience dealing with geriatric patients (I am 71 and wife is 63) experiencing fundamental changes due to physical and mental situations. She is in her mid-50s and is personally aware of many of the situations we here deal with. And, her 78-year old father has been battling PCa for 10-years (RP, ADT, radiation, metastatic disease) so she really understands the PCa aspects of our problems. She is the primary care giver for her father and has also counselled hundreds of other PCa men. While I was in the pre-RP, post-RP, and 'wait for the first post-RP µPSA' phase of my PCa journey I talked with her twice a week for a hour each time. I did not have to explain things - I could just vent with no concern about her feelings or judgement. That in itself was of great value but she was able to ask questions and turn around my statements and thoughts to allow me to understand what I was really worried about and what I really wanted to do. Additionally, due to her personal experience with her father, and with many dozen other PCa men, she had a lot of practical advice and was quite outspoken in offering it. And, she arranged for my wife and I to meet with a couples therapist who specializes in medical counselling and practical strategies for dealing with traumatic medical issues. I did not appreciate the degree of PTSD my wife was suffering after the two horrible bike accidents (2014 - she had to walk two miles out of a mountain canyon with a broken arm, dislocated shoulder, and severe concussion & 2016 she was unconscious for 6-days). That accident built on the PTSD she suffered 30-years ago when she had to walk 3-miles out of the Mt. Rainier woods with a broken illiac crest, broken forearm, and concussion. I was shocked at how little I understood where my wife was coming from and why she was being so cold about my whole PCa journey. The couples therapist was able to let wife and I understand and appreciate the others perspective on my PCa. I just did not know how freaked out the wife was about my disease. She was unable to talk about it until after the RP and was unable to say the word \"cancer\" until months after we began sessions with the counselor. My therapist also convinced me to try some anti-depressants and some anti-anxiety medication which, after a short while, allowed me to develop and practice new thought processes. I now understand that: - PCa is a 'rest of my lifetime' disease and will always be lurking in the background. - I am doing everything possible to manage my PCa - I will take the required next steps, whatever they are, if I suffer BCR - I can't do anything more than I am now doing - I cannot change my place in life - I must actively find things to do that give my life purpose and meaning - I discuss all my fears and worries with the wife who can now accept that I do have cancer",

It would seem that one should not delay action and while I think a PC3 test and imaging might be useful, would it not be safest to have an ASAP removal of my prostate and lymph nodes? I really don't care if I have ED, but I fear I have waited to long. Will the doctor insist on a full battery of tests before such a procedure? Also, Id appreciate any feed back on MRI vs. color Doppler and whether or not both would compliment each other? My August 2103 PSa was 5.8 and had been fluctuating up and down between 4.0 and 5.8 for about 3.5 years. My family doc/board certified Internist felt that it was nothing to be concerned about so I neglected all testing until my new internist in May 2018 insisted on a PSA test. It came back 9.2 which was a shock so I immediately consulted with a urologist who did not seem very concerned. He made me wait another month to get a 2nd PSA test which came back 10.2 I was really shocked but my urologist (26-years in practice and is using state of the art everything) said to stay calm and not be disturbed. My DRE was normal but my Free PSA was quite low. Again, he said he has hundreds of patients with higher PSA values who have had those high scores for years. They've had many biopsies with no PCa detected. He says \"lots of men are leakers - they secrete unusual amounts of PSA into their blood but we never find a cancer. \" He concluded \"I've never lost a patient to a fast moving aggressive PCa by being cautious and conservative.\" My 3T mpMRI identified a 0.3cc PIRADS-3 lesion and my 4KScore gives me a 34% chance of a Gleason 7 or greater tumor when the biopsy samples are examined. However, it has been 30-days since those findings and I am still waiting for that biopsy to be scheduled. Two days ago my urologist told me that there is no concern about rushing the biopsy, and even with my rather dire blood tests, he is comfortable waiting another 30-days to do the biopsy so a nasty little wound on my ankle can heal. Again, he concluded by telling me that very little in the PCa diagnosis or treatment world moves quickly and there is seldom any need to rush anything. Summary - it appears it will be more than 90-days from the time I got a PSA 9.2 score to when my highly experienced urologist does the biopsy - NO NEED TO RUSH!",

He says \"lots of men are leakers - they secrete unusual amounts of PSA into their blood but we never find a cancer. \" He concluded \"I've never lost a patient to a fast moving aggressive PCa by being cautious and conservative.\" My 3T mpMRI identified a 0.3cc PIRADS-3 lesion and my 4KScore gives me a 34% chance of a Gleason 7 or greater tumor when the biopsy samples are examined. However, it has been 30-days since those findings and I am still waiting for that biopsy to be scheduled. Two days ago my urologist told me that there is no concern about rushing the biopsy, and even with my rather dire blood tests, he is comfortable waiting another 30-days to do the biopsy so a nasty little wound on my ankle can heal. Again, he concluded by telling me that very little in the PCa diagnosis or treatment world moves quickly and there is seldom any need to rush anything. Summary - it appears it will be more than 90-days from the time I got a PSA 9.2 score to when my highly experienced urologist does the biopsy - NO NEED TO RUSH!",

It would seem that one should not delay action and while I think a PC3 test and imaging might be useful, would it not be safest to have an ASAP removal of my prostate and lymph nodes?

      "Content": "I've described my coping process in other threads here but will try to briefly cover MY way of dealing with the fundamental life changes you describe. I do understand a bit of your anguish about the many changes occurring in short order. For me, and my wife of 44-years: - sudden onset of seemingly serious heart problems after years of being told those problems would never be important - now need to take medicine to control heart rhythms, which adversely affects ALL my athletic endeavors - wife suffered two life threatening and debilitating bicycle accidents which now prevent her from riding with me, which has been a very important part of our life for over 35-years - wife went thru five serious orthopedic surgeries in three years in attempt to repair shoulder, arm, hip, leg with not so good results - move from San Diego to SW Florida and all the changes (good and bad) that entails - owning a home for the first time in 18-years (had been living on our sailboat since mid-2000) - termination of relationship with sister after death of our parents and her theft of several hundred K dollars from the estate (she was executrix) - wife retired from a job she loved and had worked at for 35-years and found she really missed the work and friends (now 2,800 miles distant) My wife and I have been a strong team since 1974. We've gone thru a lot of counseling as a couple and as individuals. I did graduate work in counseling and she had some undergraduate classes in the same while studying to be a speech therapist and special ed teacher. Our prior experiences were not sufficient to get us through the trauma, physical and mental of all the changes, gravely exacerbated by my PCa diagnosis and treatment, since 2014. I was fortunate to find a Ph.D counselor with vast experience dealing with geriatric patients (I am 71 and wife is 63) experiencing fundamental changes due to physical and mental situations. She is in her mid-50s and is personally aware of many of the situations we here deal with. And, her 78-year old father has been battling PCa for 10-years (RP, ADT, radiation, metastatic disease) so she really understands the PCa aspects of our problems. She is the primary care giver for her father and has also counselled hundreds of other PCa men. While I was in the pre-RP, post-RP, and 'wait for the first post-RP µPSA' phase of my PCa journey I talked with her twice a week for a hour each time. I did not have to explain things - I could just vent with no concern about her feelings or judgement. That in itself was of great value but she was able to ask questions and turn around my statements and thoughts to allow me to understand what I was really worried about and what I really wanted to do. Additionally, due to her personal experience with her father, and with many dozen other PCa men, she had a lot of practical advice and was quite outspoken in offering it. And, she arranged for my wife and I to meet with a couples therapist who specializes in medical counselling and practical strategies for dealing with traumatic medical issues. I did not appreciate the degree of PTSD my wife was suffering after the two horrible bike accidents (2014 - she had to walk two miles out of a mountain canyon with a broken arm, dislocated shoulder, and severe concussion & 2016 she was unconscious for 6-days). That accident built on the PTSD she suffered 30-years ago when she had to walk 3-miles out of the Mt. Rainier woods with a broken illiac crest, broken forearm, and concussion. I was shocked at how little I understood where my wife was coming from and why she was being so cold about my whole PCa journey. The couples therapist was able to let wife and I understand and appreciate the others perspective on my PCa. I just did not know how freaked out the wife was about my disease. She was unable to talk about it until after the RP and was unable to say the word \"cancer\" until months after we began sessions with the counselor. My therapist also convinced me to try some anti-depressants and some anti-anxiety medication which, after a short while, allowed me to develop and practice new thought processes. I now understand that: - PCa is a 'rest of my lifetime' disease and will always be lurking in the background. - I am doing everything possible to manage my PCa - I will take the required next steps, whatever they are, if I suffer BCR - I can't do anything more than I am now doing - I cannot change my place in life - I must actively find things to do that give my life purpose and meaning - I discuss all my fears and worries with the wife who can now accept that I do have cancer",

      "Content": "I spent an hour with my selected surgeon today talking about RALP. He is friendly, open, explains things clearly and obviously wants me to understand and make the correct decision. He convinced me that RALP was the correct choice. He has done 1,600 RALP procedures as well as thousands of other urogenital robotic laparoscopic procedures. He says his 24-month incontinence rate, (defined as more than 2 dribble drops per event, more than twice a day) is less than 4%. He was also straight up about the left nerve will be sacrificed due to the 100% left lobe involvement. He thinks there is greater than a 50% chance of serious ED. My wife so so impressed that she signed me up for RALP next Thursday, Aug 23. And, I was greatly relieved to have made that decision. ... I think wife may have been pleased with the 50% ED number? BUT... I then spent 90+ minutes on the phone with a radiation oncologist who also had my mpMRi and biopsy results as well as all my lab/blood results. He was even more friendly and willing to share information in a form, (very technical and numeric), that I could easily grasp. We discussed much of the recent research comparing EBRT, Brachy, RP results. He pointed out that my numbers (T1c, Stage II, 100% positive left lobe cores 3 of which were 3+3 and 3 were 3+4 with one 100% 3+4 and one 60% 3+4) indicate at least a 35% probability of extra capsular extension (ECE). That number agrees with what Memorial Sloan Kettering website shows. My medical urologist (retired knife guy) discussed my path report with me last Friday and said he felt there was a 50% probability of ECE. Radiation guy says that means there is at least a 30% chance I will need some radiation therapy after the RP because that ECE will guarantee my PSA will not stay at 0.01 as everyone wants. Radiation guy also pointed out (strongly and vividly), that RP means the trans-prostate urethra is removed, the bladder pulleed down into the area voided by the prostate removal and then reconnected to the lower urethra. That is all normal delicate but easily done surgery. However! that means the lower part of the bladder is now over the prostate bed and will be heavily radiated with salvage radiation if the RP did not get all the cancer. The radiation guy is recommending 3-month oral ADT, EBRT (proton), and LDR brachytherapy to guarantee no biochemical recurrence. He did say the ADT benefit is marginal but, in his experience, oral ADT for just 3-months has minimal adverse side effects so he recommends it. I can stop the oral ADT if it becomes too upsetting to my wife or I. If I have a 30% chance of needing radiation AFTER the RP- then why not just start with the radiation and skip the surgery? Radiation guy claims less than 2% BCR (within prostate) at 10-years with a combination of EBRT & LDR brachy. Radiation guy makes a lot of sense to me but the RALP seems to be the safe and secure way to go with only a 1:3 chance of needing the additional radiation therapy. My wife is leaning towards the RP. ??",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate OTS, If you go with RT, the triple play of ADT, EBRT and BBT (brachy boost) appears to have some really good results. Actually, with BBT involved, the ADT may not make a difference. And (damn - more complications ) the boost can come from LDR-BT, HDR-BT, or SBRT. SBRT (Cyberknife or TrueBeam) was designed to supply the same Gy's as HDR-BT, without being invasive. All three of these boost treatments are available, and perhaps you should ask why this RO is preferring one type over the other two. We did discuss HDR-BT and SBRT in the context of doing that in addition to ADT and EBRT. I caught a little of what he said but the man took me at my word \"give me the details, all the details, and the numbers to support those details\" and he did ... for 90-minutes. Seldom am I overwhelmed when discussing very technical material but at that point, 70-minutes in, he had earned my trust and I let my mind relax a bit as he discussed HDR-BT and SBRT. He did a bit of them at other institutions and his facility can offer them but he prefers LDR . He gave me his personal cell number and his e-mail address and said to call or e-mail anytime. Already this evening, just 3-hours after I got off the phone, he has sent me three very technical and recent papers about combined RT, QOL, and long term toxicity. He seems genuinely interested in educating me and helping me make the right decision. Looks to be early '50s and has a strong academic and research background as well as clinical experience and leadership roles at some big cancer facilities.",

The document I was given says the FA guides the non-cutting tools and manipulates all the robot settings and controls. The FA credentials ar RNFA, BSN, CNOR. Who Knew? - Clear liquid diet from 7 AM the day before the surgery, but this includes Crystal Lite (I drink a gallon a day), black coffee (another 1/2 gallon), and (I think) Beer - so that covers my three food groups! - I was surprised to see the pathology report will not be available for 5 to 7 business days after the surgery. He will call me with the results -I have a followup appointment scheduled 6-days after the surgery. His nurse said that almost all his patients my age and in good physical condition will have the catheter removed at that time and almost all have \"pretty good\" urninary control upon removal. I sure hope so! But, I must bring urinary pads or pull up diapers to that appointment. - Avoidance of coffee/caffeine and alcohol are two of the easiest ways to regain good urinary control early in the healing process. As I said I live on coffee during the day and the sun will not set if I don't have a beer to help it go down. - A big reason for scheduling the surgery ASAP was to get it done, and all the followup visits done before Thanksgiving when all the SnowBirds return to Naples, Ft Myers, Cape Coral here in SW Florida. The hospital is 61-miles from home and the surgeons primary office is 55-miles from home. We can make those trips in about 75 (or less) minutes June thru mid-November. By late December the time would exceed 90-minutes and by mid-January it might take over two hours to get from Punta Gorda to Naples. So, now the last followup at three months will be done by early December. July thru October I can get from our house to I-75 (8-miles) in about 10-minutes because most of the drive is on 55 or 60 mph Hwy 41 (The Tamiami Trail). December thru April the five miles on Hwy 41 takes half an hour due to the two-cycle backups at each of the four controlled intersections.",

Bone Scan (Tc-99m labeled MDP) \"no definitive evidence of malignancy\" Met, today August 17, with my medical urologist to review scan and discuss probability of radiation therapy post RALP, which he now puts at less than 10%. RALP surgeon had told me that only 15% of his patients (1,600 RALP total) with my characteristics ever require any radiotherapy. Those two numbers gave me the confidence to fully commit to a RALP procedure Thursday August 23. I can now relax and have a life other than searching for medical and research literature that would help me decide surgery or radiation. It is done and on we go to surgery and the definitive cure! I asked my medical urologist, who retired from doing open prostatectomies (retropubic), about having the surgery just 20-days after the biopsy. He said he used to wait six-weeks BUT he said my surgeon has so much experience (1,600 RALP in the last 15-years) that the surgeons judgement is far superior to his or mine. Now the really scary part of waiting for the surgery is Nothing to eat after 7 AM Wednesday but the surgery is scheduled (time is tenative and will not be confirmed until Tuesday evening) for late Thursday morning. How in the world can a fat guy go that long without eating?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Frenchy Good question, Pratoman. I've been wondering myself why they all of a sudden are testing me with the ultra test. The last score was 0.010. Before they were testing me with the regular PSA and I was less than 0.1 . So I still don't have a valid explanation of why the ultra sensitive test now. Your post maybe clarifies this for me in that they are looking for the next threshold, if it ever happens. I am not sure I would act on a score of something close to 0.05. I remember reading somewhere there is fluctuation from day in these scores. One does not see this if the test is simply resulting in less than 0.1 . But if an ultra test, it does tend to add to the stress level it the result begins to inch up a bit, or fluctuate a bit. Here is a copy of a post I made in another thread - it might explain why the interest in Ultrasensitive PSA tests. The 3-month Ultrasensitive number appears to provide a lot of prognostic information about Biochemical Recurrence: Walsh book (4th edition) page 326 \"ULTRASENSITIVE PSA TESTS\" references a study done by a Walsh colleague at Hopkins, Dr. Lori Sokoll (professor of pathology and assistant director of clinical chemistry): 750 men 3-months post RP with PSA <0.1 were given ULTRASENSITIVE PSA tests and then monitored for 10-years. 14% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA < 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years 78% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA > 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years There was no report about the clinical symptoms or actual PSA level at 10-years I found a source document for Dr. Sokoll (Journal of Urology Feb 2016), which discusses the same topic but has a little different conclusion than found in the Walsh book. I am not sure if this is the research Walsh was describing but pub date and number of subjects is very similar to what is in the book. Biochemical recurrence-free rates 11 years after surgery were 86.1% (95% CI 83.2\u201389.0) for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% (95% CI 37.5\u201360.3) for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater (p <0.0001). That says to me: An Ultrasensitive PSA < 0.01 had an 86% chance of no biochemical recurrence compared to only about 50% chance of no recurrence if the Ultrasensitive PSA =>.01. My 6-week test is October 9 and 3-months is just after Thanksgiving so I am particularly interested in this topic!",

      "Content": "Thank you ALL for the words of encouragement and the sometimes necessary harsher words that forced me to first understand, and then accept my disease and diagnosis. I am quite certain that I would not have moved as quickly and with as much knowledge and understanding if ALL of you had not been here to guide me, encourage me, and when necessary push me along this inevitable path. I do hope my journey from denial in mid-May, to understanding in mid-July, to acceptance this week can help others who follow along. Going from the shock of \"OMG - I have cancer\" to \"OMG I am going to be an impotent leaker\" to \"Oh - there is hope and a real possibility of several excellent long term outcomes\" is painful and could only be accomplished with your help. So, now I hope my story, and all the others I read here, will help the next brother move along. A couple details about the surgery: - A Fleet Enema bowel prep is required at 8 PM the evening before the surgery - I was quite surprised that the RALP, as done by Dr. Ornstein & DaVinci, is a four-handed operation. He uses what his literature calls a \"First Assistant\" who handles two of the four Da Vinci arms and tools. The document I was given says the FA guides the non-cutting tools and manipulates all the robot settings and controls. The FA credentials ar RNFA, BSN, CNOR. Who Knew? - Clear liquid diet from 7 AM the day before the surgery, but this includes Crystal Lite (I drink a gallon a day), black coffee (another 1/2 gallon), and (I think) Beer - so that covers my three food groups! - I was surprised to see the pathology report will not be available for 5 to 7 business days after the surgery. He will call me with the results -I have a followup appointment scheduled 6-days after the surgery. His nurse said that almost all his patients my age and in good physical condition will have the catheter removed at that time and almost all have \"pretty good\" urninary control upon removal. I sure hope so! But, I must bring urinary pads or pull up diapers to that appointment. - Avoidance of coffee/caffeine and alcohol are two of the easiest ways to regain good urinary control early in the healing process. As I said I live on coffee during the day and the sun will not set if I don't have a beer to help it go down. - A big reason for scheduling the surgery ASAP was to get it done, and all the followup visits done before Thanksgiving when all the SnowBirds return to Naples, Ft Myers, Cape Coral here in SW Florida. The hospital is 61-miles from home and the surgeons primary office is 55-miles from home. We can make those trips in about 75 (or less) minutes June thru mid-November. By late December the time would exceed 90-minutes and by mid-January it might take over two hours to get from Punta Gorda to Naples. So, now the last followup at three months will be done by early December. July thru October I can get from our house to I-75 (8-miles) in about 10-minutes because most of the drive is on 55 or 60 mph Hwy 41 (The Tamiami Trail). December thru April the five miles on Hwy 41 takes half an hour due to the two-cycle backups at each of the four controlled intersections.",

      "Content": "My closest friend of \"only\" 51-years and I have a relationship similar to what you describe. He and I have skied, climbed, run, bicycled, windsurfed together all over North America for over half a century. We both have needed bi-lateral knee replacements, due to injuries incurred while engaged in all those fun activities, for more than 20-years. Five years ago he finally had a knee replaced while I chose to wait and see the results of his surgery and replacement. He suffered horrible complications, required an additional surgery, and eventually a 2nd total knee replacement because the first one failed in just three years. He now has far less mobility, but also much less pain, than he did before the initial surgery. He was in such constant, debilitating pain that his loss of mobility and three surgeries were worth the problems he has suffered because he can now walk and sleep without living under the adverse influence of narcotic pain medication. As a result - I have continued to defer my bi-lateral knee replacement. He and I discuss the issue on a regular basis and he continues to push me to have my knee replacements done. I am fully cognizant of my choices, biases, and other reasons for deferring my knee replacements. His experience is just one of many data points in my decision matrix. Just as is the very positive result my father experienced when he had both knees replaced at age 76 and as is the somewhat negative results a third mutual 50-year friend had with his Canadian knee replacement. I am an adult and can take full responsibility for my choices and decisions. I respect his choices and felt he could make none other than get rid of the knee that was ruining his life. I greatly appreciate all the conversations he and I have had about our knees but in the end - it is my decision and only I can make that decision! I actively seek his advice and counsel but I know I am the only person that can make the right choice for my life.",

      "Content": "My closest friend of \"only\" 51-years and I have a relationship similar to what you describe. He and I have skied, climbed, run, bicycled, windsurfed together all over North America for over half a century. We both have needed bi-lateral knee replacements, due to injuries incurred while engaged in all those fun activities, for more than 20-years. Five years ago he finally had a knee replaced while I chose to wait and see the results of his surgery and replacement. He suffered horrible complications, required an additional surgery, and eventually a 2nd total knee replacement because the first one failed in just three years. He now has far less mobility, but also much less pain, than he did before the initial surgery. He was in such constant, debilitating pain that his loss of mobility and three surgeries were worth the problems he has suffered because he can now walk and sleep without living under the adverse influence of narcotic pain medication. As a result - I have continued to defer my bi-lateral knee replacement. He and I discuss the issue on a regular basis and he continues to push me to have my knee replacements done. I am fully cognizant of my choices, biases, and other reasons for deferring my knee replacements. His experience is just one of many data points in my decision matrix. Just as is the very positive result my father experienced when he had both knees replaced at age 76 and as is the somewhat negative results a third mutual 50-year friend had with his Canadian knee replacement. I am an adult and can take full responsibility for my choices and decisions. I respect his choices and felt he could make none other than get rid of the knee that was ruining his life. I greatly appreciate all the conversations he and I have had about our knees but in the end - it is my decision and only I can make that decision! I actively seek his advice and counsel but I know I am the only person that can make the right choice for my life.",

      "Content": "This is an enhanced copy of a post I made on June 29 in another thread about \"do I or don't I biopsy\" The changes in my PSA levels increased slowly over a period of time where my age was similar to where you are now. Age 57 PSA 2.0 Age 63 PSA 4.0 Age 65 PSA 4.5 Age 66 PSA 5.6 ... and I kept putting off the biopsy.... SLOW rate of increase, Levels \"almost\" normal for my age, my internist was not concerned, \"normal\" DRE, worry about potential side effects, head in the sand... SO - Here I am currently 70, soon to be 71, and waiting to see when my urologist will schedule my FIRST biopsy. I have been going thru the same \"should I - shouldn't I\" thought process for the last 14-years and have always chosen to wait. At this time my PSA is 10.2, having doubled in a bit over six-years (or maybe 8-years if you take the first occurence of a PSA 5+ in November 2010). My Free PSA percentage is now 8.4%, which combined with my PSA score indicates a high probability of some form of PCa being present. When my PSA went from 9.2 in mid-May this year to 10.2 in mid-June I knew my waiting time was over. However, my very experienced urologist (claims more than 3,000 biopsies in the last 20-years) does not seem to have any sense of urgency, other than to insist I get the biopsy done when he tells me to, but certainly not before early August or at least two months after he first saw me with a PSA score of 9.2 at age 70. NOW - facing a significant probability of having a significant PCa I am not unhappy I chose the course I did. BUT; way back in 2010 when my PSA increased to from 2.0 to 5.8 over a 6+ year period, I wish I had learned as much as I know now! I also now understand that a negative biopsy just means the PCa was not found by that particular biopsy and, depending on future PSA values and MRI images, I may be experiencing additional biopsies as the years go by. I now, understand deep in my heart, that is life with high PSA values and I can now accept the need for ongoing testing. IF I had understood biopsies, statistics, treatments, and side effects, then I would probably have elected to have the first biopsy in 2011 or 2012 when my PSA stabilized at 5.6 to 5.8. My current urologist has given me confidence that a TRUS/12-core biopsy is a very low risk/low side effect procedure and with MRI guidance can yield important information to help plan the rest of my life. I had a 3T mpMRI (with contrast) on June 28 which my urologist recommended for two reasons: 1) It helps clarify the timing for the biopsy by defining number, size, and location of possible lesions/tumors 2) He can use the MRI images to more accurately select the 12-core TRUS biopsy sample locations, once he decides when to do the biopsy My urologist also drew blood this week for a 4KScore test which will also help him decide when to do the biopsy. I'll get the MRI results/analysis and 4KScore on July 5 and may have an entirely different opinion of my decision to wait 14-years!",

      "Content": "PSA - May 2014 - 2.1, Oct. 2015 - 3.4, April 2016 - 4.0, Oct. 2016 - 2.5, April 2017 - 2.9, Oct. 2017 - 3.4, May 2018 - 3.5, Oct. 2018 - 4.0 Looking at your worst case PSA velocity (Oct 2016 to Oct 2018 with a 1.5 increase in 24-months) and calculating the absolute change in PSA over time - the doubling time is 3.3-years, which is relatively short or indicative of a growing PSA source. But ... if we do a PSA Velocity from Oct 2015 to Oct 2016 (3.4 to 4.0) we get a doubling time of 17-years, which is suggestive of a slow growing PSA source. And... a third analysis says the PSA has not changed in the 30-months between April 2016 and October 2018, which confirms the PSA doubling time of 17-years and the G6 in 5% of the tissue. Most research says that PSA can vary 20% from test to test with no change to the underlying source. When I calculate the slope of the trend line (PSA score on Y-axis and elapsed months on X-axis) using each PSA test value and the prior TWO values I see an annual change in absolute PSA score ranging from negative 1.1 to plus 1.1. FOUR consecutive values show an annual PSA increase ranging from -0.6 to +0.7 FIVE consecutive values show an annual PSA increase ranging from -0.2 to +0.7 With the sharp decrease in PSA between April 2016 and October 2016, with the PSA score not again reaching it's April 2016 value until October 18 (30-months), it is impossible to develop a reasonable trend line that extends back more than two-years. The 5-test trendline which incorporates the data from October 2016 to October 2018 shows a doubling time of 3.6 years and an annual increase of 0.7. Both of those numbers are on the higher, \"less good\", side of the equation and would indicate to me that I do not want to wait another six-months for a biopsy. The 4-test trendline which incorporates the data from October 2016 to May 2018 shows a doubling time of 3.8 years and an annual increase of 0.7, which (from a statistical POV) confirms the 5-test slope ( Oct 2016 thru Oct 2018 ) is a logical continuation of the 4-test slope. Is it not possible to get a biopsy done on a fairly short notice in your home town? Can you postpone your Florida travel a couple weeks?",

      "Content": "PSA - May 2014 - 2.1, Oct. 2015 - 3.4, April 2016 - 4.0, Oct. 2016 - 2.5, April 2017 - 2.9, Oct. 2017 - 3.4, May 2018 - 3.5, Oct. 2018 - 4.0 Looking at your worst case PSA velocity (Oct 2016 to Oct 2018 with a 1.5 increase in 24-months) and calculating the absolute change in PSA over time - the doubling time is 3.3-years, which is relatively short or indicative of a growing PSA source. But ... if we do a PSA Velocity from Oct 2015 to Oct 2016 (3.4 to 4.0) we get a doubling time of 17-years, which is suggestive of a slow growing PSA source. And... a third analysis says the PSA has not changed in the 30-months between April 2016 and October 2018, which confirms the PSA doubling time of 17-years and the G6 in 5% of the tissue. Most research says that PSA can vary 20% from test to test with no change to the underlying source. When I calculate the slope of the trend line (PSA score on Y-axis and elapsed months on X-axis) using each PSA test value and the prior TWO values I see an annual change in absolute PSA score ranging from negative 1.1 to plus 1.1. FOUR consecutive values show an annual PSA increase ranging from -0.6 to +0.7 FIVE consecutive values show an annual PSA increase ranging from -0.2 to +0.7 With the sharp decrease in PSA between April 2016 and October 2016, with the PSA score not again reaching it's April 2016 value until October 18 (30-months), it is impossible to develop a reasonable trend line that extends back more than two-years. The 5-test trendline which incorporates the data from October 2016 to October 2018 shows a doubling time of 3.6 years and an annual increase of 0.7. Both of those numbers are on the higher, \"less good\", side of the equation and would indicate to me that I do not want to wait another six-months for a biopsy. The 4-test trendline which incorporates the data from October 2016 to May 2018 shows a doubling time of 3.8 years and an annual increase of 0.7, which (from a statistical POV) confirms the 5-test slope ( Oct 2016 thru Oct 2018 ) is a logical continuation of the 4-test slope. Is it not possible to get a biopsy done on a fairly short notice in your home town? Can you postpone your Florida travel a couple weeks?",

      "Content": "This is an enhanced copy of a post I made on June 29 in another thread about \"do I or don't I biopsy\" The changes in my PSA levels increased slowly over a period of time where my age was similar to where you are now. Age 57 PSA 2.0 Age 63 PSA 4.0 Age 65 PSA 4.5 Age 66 PSA 5.6 ... and I kept putting off the biopsy.... SLOW rate of increase, Levels \"almost\" normal for my age, my internist was not concerned, \"normal\" DRE, worry about potential side effects, head in the sand... SO - Here I am currently 70, soon to be 71, and waiting to see when my urologist will schedule my FIRST biopsy. I have been going thru the same \"should I - shouldn't I\" thought process for the last 14-years and have always chosen to wait. At this time my PSA is 10.2, having doubled in a bit over six-years (or maybe 8-years if you take the first occurence of a PSA 5+ in November 2010). My Free PSA percentage is now 8.4%, which combined with my PSA score indicates a high probability of some form of PCa being present. When my PSA went from 9.2 in mid-May this year to 10.2 in mid-June I knew my waiting time was over. However, my very experienced urologist (claims more than 3,000 biopsies in the last 20-years) does not seem to have any sense of urgency, other than to insist I get the biopsy done when he tells me to, but certainly not before early August or at least two months after he first saw me with a PSA score of 9.2 at age 70. NOW - facing a significant probability of having a significant PCa I am not unhappy I chose the course I did. BUT; way back in 2010 when my PSA increased to from 2.0 to 5.8 over a 6+ year period, I wish I had learned as much as I know now! I also now understand that a negative biopsy just means the PCa was not found by that particular biopsy and, depending on future PSA values and MRI images, I may be experiencing additional biopsies as the years go by. I now, understand deep in my heart, that is life with high PSA values and I can now accept the need for ongoing testing. IF I had understood biopsies, statistics, treatments, and side effects, then I would probably have elected to have the first biopsy in 2011 or 2012 when my PSA stabilized at 5.6 to 5.8. My current urologist has given me confidence that a TRUS/12-core biopsy is a very low risk/low side effect procedure and with MRI guidance can yield important information to help plan the rest of my life. I had a 3T mpMRI (with contrast) on June 28 which my urologist recommended for two reasons: 1) It helps clarify the timing for the biopsy by defining number, size, and location of possible lesions/tumors 2) He can use the MRI images to more accurately select the 12-core TRUS biopsy sample locations, once he decides when to do the biopsy My urologist also drew blood this week for a 4KScore test which will also help him decide when to do the biopsy. I'll get the MRI results/analysis and 4KScore on July 5 and may have an entirely different opinion of my decision to wait 14-years!",

      "Content": "\"When the MRI came I was called in and explained that the prostate looks inflamed and there are \"some modifications in some cells\" and he doesn't know what to say.\" Are you certain that is what you were told: \"some modifications in some cells? In my limited knowledge, an MRI does not work at the cellular level. My understanding is the MRI senses changes in the spin of protons as they relax from the intense magnetic field. The timing of the spin change varies depending on tissue type. The contrast media allows the differential uptake (diffusion) of the fluid depending on the tissue type. The computer and the radiologist can then interpret the timing and pattern of spin changes to \"estimate\" tissue type. What kind of MRI? - 3TmpMRI - with or without contrast? - with or without endorectal coil? Was the MRI specific to the prostate or generalized to the entire area around the prostate? There should be a formal report about the MRI interpretation including a PIRADS number - did you get one? - prostate size? - were modified cells (tissue?) in one region or multiple regions? Can you share the report details? Here are two excellent references if you want to learn more about MRI function, limitations, and utility for prostate problem diagnosis: https://www.livescience.com/39074-what-is-an-mri.html https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/rg.2016150234",

      "Content": "\"Why post SRT? I thought we were discussing adjuvant vs. salvage RT after RP with adverse findings, such as EPE.\" His surgery was July 2018 - more than 6-months ago so is the current RT - Adjuvant or SRT? There is little, if any, evidence of biochemical recurrence or disease progression (PSA 0.06; 0.07; 0.1; 0.08 ) so what would the adjuvant therapy be treating? \"The stats you posted are far from good. Best practice is to offer ART to men who are high risk post RT.\" I guess I am missing something - what makes him a high risk? MSK stats (not mine) show that IF he receives NO ADT but does receive SRT (which would be a higher Gy load ?) there is almost no difference in the probability of disease progression for a man with or without EPE. Why would results be any different for adjuvant with or without ADT? We can find research studies on many sides of this issue: Early Salvage vs Adjuvant Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Rahul Tendulkar, MD: At least three randomized trials have examined the role of immediate postprostatectomy radiotherapy in patients with high-risk pathologic features, yet the optimal management remains controversial.[4-6] Two of these trials (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 8794 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 22911) included patients with a detectable postoperative PSA level, and thus the immediate radiotherapy arms comprised a mix of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy.[4,5] Likewise, the observation arms included some patients with untreated residual disease, which likely resulted in worse outcomes than would have been seen if these patients had been excluded from randomization. Only the German trial (ARO 96-02) tested adjuvant radiation vs observation in a cohort of patients with undetectable PSA levels (< 0.1 ng/mL), and unfortunately this trial had the smallest sample size.[6] Interestingly, among the patients randomized to observation across all three trials, about half (46% to 54%) remained free of biochemical recurrence at 5 years, suggesting that adjuvant radiotherapy would have been unnecessary in a large proportion of patients despite their high-risk pathologic features. In summary, serial PSA testing with initiation of early salvage radiotherapy is an attractive treatment paradigm and should be considered for most men after radical prostatectomy. Because of the ability of serum PSA to detect low-volume prostate cancer recurrences, clinicians can better select those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment. Likewise, up to half of men with high-risk features may be spared from potentially unnecessary adjuvant therapy and its associated costs and side effects. Until genomic profiling is proven to provide more personalized outcomes assessments, patients should be counseled about both approaches, with joint decision making based on a careful assessment of the risks and benefits of each treatment option. A more recent metastudy (Contemporary role of postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer Alan Dal Pra,corresponding author Matthew C. Abramowitz, Radka Stoyanova, and Alan Pollack June 2018 states: Adverse pathological factors after RP, such as positive surgical margins (+SM), extracapsular extension (ECE), or seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) increase the likelihood of disease recurrence. Three randomized clinical trials (RCT) have addressed the potential benefits of adjuvant (ART) versus delayed RT after RP for these patents... Taken together, these RCTs provide level I evidence for improved biochemical control without clear proof of benefit in long-term freedom from metastasis or survival for adjuvant therapy.\" As more research is done and genomics because more precise to each individual - the ART -vs- SRT decision will become easier and the added decision about ADT will also become more clear.",

      "Content": "\"When the MRI came I was called in and explained that the prostate looks inflamed and there are \"some modifications in some cells\" and he doesn't know what to say.\" Are you certain that is what you were told: \"some modifications in some cells? In my limited knowledge, an MRI does not work at the cellular level. My understanding is the MRI senses changes in the spin of protons as they relax from the intense magnetic field. The timing of the spin change varies depending on tissue type. The contrast media allows the differential uptake (diffusion) of the fluid depending on the tissue type. The computer and the radiologist can then interpret the timing and pattern of spin changes to \"estimate\" tissue type. What kind of MRI? - 3TmpMRI - with or without contrast? - with or without endorectal coil? Was the MRI specific to the prostate or generalized to the entire area around the prostate? There should be a formal report about the MRI interpretation including a PIRADS number - did you get one? - prostate size? - were modified cells (tissue?) in one region or multiple regions? Can you share the report details?

      "Content": "Shocking or perhaps Disturbing Results for my particular numbers! I sure hope I am mis-understanding or mis-interpreting the results. MY 10-year Overall Survival with: Radical Prostatectomy 74% Conservative Treatment (Active Surveillance) 71% NO PCa diagnosis 77% The data above says that I only gain a 3% increase in overall survival probability at age 81 by submitting to an RP. OR - 32 out of 33 cases similar to mine will receive NO benefit in 10-years by proceeding to treatment compared to AS. Does that mean that in 11 out of 12 cases ( [71-77]/77 = ~8%) similar to mine that COMPLETE IGNORANCE of my PSA, and thus no treatment, would lead to NO PCa death by age 81? I guess that is why PSA testing after age 72 is not recommended? MY 15-year Overall Survival with: Radical Prostatectomy 48% Conservative Treatment (Active Surveillance) 43% NO PCa diagnosis 54% Does that mean IF I knew I had PCa (3+4) and did NO treatment (AS) I would be only ~20% more likely ( [43-54]/54 )to die in 15-years than if I had NO PCa at all? Does that mean that in 9 out of 10 cases ( [43-48]/43 ) similar to mine that AS would lead to NO PCa death by age 86 IF I knew I had (3+4) PCa? I guess a more optimistic way to interpret the data is that RP benefits are only realized in the long term, which in my case exceeds 15-years. To me, this shows why it is so important to consider one's overall health and medical status when deciding on PCa treatment modalities and strategies. Life expectancy is so critical when making these long term decisions. I still expect to fumble around on this earth for another 20-years so RP still makes sense to me.",

      "Content": "My wife and I walk 1.5 - 2.0 miles every evening along the Charlotte Harbor waterfront. The path takes us thru a Childrens playground, pickleball courts, tennis courts, fishing pier, past two waterfront restaurants, and then thru downtown Punta Gorda, which on a January evening with a beautiful sunset and 73° air temp is full of al fresco diners and drinkers. This evening I decided to take my walk wearing a pair of snug briefs lined with a light men's absorbent pad. Big MISTAKE! During the day while puttering about the house I wear a men's Depends pullup brief. For the last three days the pad in the Depends has barely been damp after 12 to 14-hours wearing. The one I took off just before going on the walk was only 1.2 oz heavier than a new dry pad and I had been wearing it for 15-hours. My personal problem with the Depends is that my butt and hips get very sweaty and wet when briskly walking for a half hour or more. I sweat easily and profusely and the non-breathable material in the Depends really makes my skin damp. SO - for tonight's walk I decided to wear my normal breathable cotton/nylon briefs with a men's light pad to absorb any minor leakage, something I have tried a couple times with good success. I wear the light pad inside my spandex bicycle shorts when I go on a two hour hard ride and the pad is hardly damp when I am done. So, I started our walk with no thought of a leakage problem. About 3/4-mile from the car in the midst of many walkers, strollers, skaters, and people admiring the sunset my wife exclaims - \"your butt is wet.\" I look at my crotch and a damp stain is starting to appear at the base of the zipper in my light brown walking shorts. Normally I wear black shorts which do not easily show dampness but I was too confident this evening to worry about that. We walked about 100-yards to a secluded location where I could open my waist band and look down into my briefs. I was shocked by a steady stream of urine and nothing I could do stopped it! That has not happened for more than six-weeks and I have little idea why tonight. I adjusted the light pad to catch as much leakage as possible but within 5-minutes my shorts were darkly stained front and back. I tried my hardest to stop the leakage but as soon as I relaxed by kegel action the stream started again. I could feel a small stream running down my leg. Within 10-minutes the short's zipper was surrounded by dark stains. SO - the big question: Do we boldly walk back along the waterfront path, past the resturants and sunset observers and hope they are concentrating on the western sky? Or, slink back thru downtown on the side streets and hope we miss all the folks walking to the local pubs and resturants, after all this is the height of tourist season and it was a wonderful warm evening. We chose the side streets, which we walk three or four nights a week and were surprised to a dozen groups of evening walkers. At least none of them pointed and laughted! It was a long slow and embarassing 15-minute walk back to the car. Fortunately, we had an old towel in the trunk that I could place on our almost brand new leather drivers seat. Our car is a 1993 Saab 900S which I have spent a fortune on restoring, including new leather upholstery. By the time we arrived at home and I took a shower the leakage had stopped and I again had complete positive bladder control. I wonder what happened during that 35 to 40-minute walk that I lost all bladder control? The only unusual thing I did this afternoon was to drink 16-oz of strong coffee about 90-minutes before we walked. I drink twice that every morning and never have a leakage problem. But, something this evening was different!",

      "Content": "\"Why post SRT? I thought we were discussing adjuvant vs. salvage RT after RP with adverse findings, such as EPE.\" His surgery was July 2018 - more than 6-months ago so is the current RT - Adjuvant or SRT? There is little, if any, evidence of biochemical recurrence or disease progression (PSA 0.06; 0.07; 0.1; 0.08 ) so what would the adjuvant therapy be treating? \"The stats you posted are far from good. Best practice is to offer ART to men who are high risk post RT.\" I guess I am missing something - what makes him a high risk? MSK stats (not mine) show that IF he receives NO ADT but does receive SRT (which would be a higher Gy load ?) there is almost no difference in the probability of disease progression for a man with or without EPE. Why would results be any different for adjuvant with or without ADT? We can find research studies on many sides of this issue: Early Salvage vs Adjuvant Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Rahul Tendulkar, MD: At least three randomized trials have examined the role of immediate postprostatectomy radiotherapy in patients with high-risk pathologic features, yet the optimal management remains controversial.[4-6] Two of these trials (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 8794 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 22911) included patients with a detectable postoperative PSA level, and thus the immediate radiotherapy arms comprised a mix of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy.[4,5] Likewise, the observation arms included some patients with untreated residual disease, which likely resulted in worse outcomes than would have been seen if these patients had been excluded from randomization. Only the German trial (ARO 96-02) tested adjuvant radiation vs observation in a cohort of patients with undetectable PSA levels (< 0.1 ng/mL), and unfortunately this trial had the smallest sample size.[6] Interestingly, among the patients randomized to observation across all three trials, about half (46% to 54%) remained free of biochemical recurrence at 5 years, suggesting that adjuvant radiotherapy would have been unnecessary in a large proportion of patients despite their high-risk pathologic features. In summary, serial PSA testing with initiation of early salvage radiotherapy is an attractive treatment paradigm and should be considered for most men after radical prostatectomy. Because of the ability of serum PSA to detect low-volume prostate cancer recurrences, clinicians can better select those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment. Likewise, up to half of men with high-risk features may be spared from potentially unnecessary adjuvant therapy and its associated costs and side effects. Until genomic profiling is proven to provide more personalized outcomes assessments, patients should be counseled about both approaches, with joint decision making based on a careful assessment of the risks and benefits of each treatment option. A more recent metastudy (Contemporary role of postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer Alan Dal Pra,corresponding author Matthew C. Abramowitz, Radka Stoyanova, and Alan Pollack June 2018 states: Adverse pathological factors after RP, such as positive surgical margins (+SM), extracapsular extension (ECE), or seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) increase the likelihood of disease recurrence. Three randomized clinical trials (RCT) have addressed the potential benefits of adjuvant (ART) versus delayed RT after RP for these patents... Taken together, these RCTs provide level I evidence for improved biochemical control without clear proof of benefit in long-term freedom from metastasis or survival for adjuvant therapy.\" As more research is done and genomics because more precise to each individual - the ART -vs- SRT decision will become easier and the added decision about ADT will also become more clear.",

In my limited knowledge, an MRI does not work at the cellular level. My understanding is the MRI senses changes in the spin of protons as they relax from the intense magnetic field. The timing of the spin change varies depending on tissue type. The contrast media allows the differential uptake (diffusion) of the fluid depending on the tissue type. The computer and the radiologist can then interpret the timing and pattern of spin changes to \"estimate\" tissue type. What kind of MRI? - 3TmpMRI - with or without contrast? - with or without endorectal coil? Was the MRI specific to the prostate or generalized to the entire area around the prostate? There should be a formal report about the MRI interpretation including a PIRADS number - did you get one? - prostate size? - were modified cells (tissue?) in one region or multiple regions? Can you share the report details?

      "Content": "\"Why post SRT? I thought we were discussing adjuvant vs. salvage RT after RP with adverse findings, such as EPE.\" His surgery was July 2018 - more than 6-months ago so is the current RT - Adjuvant or SRT? There is little, if any, evidence of biochemical recurrence or disease progression (PSA 0.06; 0.07; 0.1; 0.08 ) so what would the adjuvant therapy be treating? \"The stats you posted are far from good. Best practice is to offer ART to men who are high risk post RT.\" I guess I am missing something - what makes him a high risk? MSK stats (not mine) show that IF he receives NO ADT but does receive SRT (which would be a higher Gy load ?) there is almost no difference in the probability of disease progression for a man with or without EPE. Why would results be any different for adjuvant with or without ADT? We can find research studies on many sides of this issue: Early Salvage vs Adjuvant Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Rahul Tendulkar, MD: At least three randomized trials have examined the role of immediate postprostatectomy radiotherapy in patients with high-risk pathologic features, yet the optimal management remains controversial.[4-6] Two of these trials (Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] 8794 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer 22911) included patients with a detectable postoperative PSA level, and thus the immediate radiotherapy arms comprised a mix of adjuvant and salvage radiotherapy.[4,5] Likewise, the observation arms included some patients with untreated residual disease, which likely resulted in worse outcomes than would have been seen if these patients had been excluded from randomization. Only the German trial (ARO 96-02) tested adjuvant radiation vs observation in a cohort of patients with undetectable PSA levels (< 0.1 ng/mL), and unfortunately this trial had the smallest sample size.[6] Interestingly, among the patients randomized to observation across all three trials, about half (46% to 54%) remained free of biochemical recurrence at 5 years, suggesting that adjuvant radiotherapy would have been unnecessary in a large proportion of patients despite their high-risk pathologic features. In summary, serial PSA testing with initiation of early salvage radiotherapy is an attractive treatment paradigm and should be considered for most men after radical prostatectomy. Because of the ability of serum PSA to detect low-volume prostate cancer recurrences, clinicians can better select those patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment. Likewise, up to half of men with high-risk features may be spared from potentially unnecessary adjuvant therapy and its associated costs and side effects. Until genomic profiling is proven to provide more personalized outcomes assessments, patients should be counseled about both approaches, with joint decision making based on a careful assessment of the risks and benefits of each treatment option. A more recent metastudy (Contemporary role of postoperative radiotherapy for prostate cancer Alan Dal Pra,corresponding author Matthew C. Abramowitz, Radka Stoyanova, and Alan Pollack June 2018 states: Adverse pathological factors after RP, such as positive surgical margins (+SM), extracapsular extension (ECE), or seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) increase the likelihood of disease recurrence.

You will find that your prostate related information, analysis, and interpretation develops slowly and frequently in less than straightforward fashion. I began the journey in mid-May 2018 and had no clear answer until August 9, 2018. Here is one study, published in 2013 that might give you some temporary mental relief until the urologist can do a more complete workup. You did not tell us your age, which is very important in the decision making processes, so the following study may not help. 268 men, aged 40-49, were randomly selected in 1990 and carefully followed for 16 or more years. Only 0.6% (ONE) of the 195 men with a PSA < 1.0 (in their initial 1990 exam) developed prostate cancer with a Gleason score of 6 by the time they all reached 55-years of age. None of those 195 men with PSA < 1.0 developed intermediate or higher risk prostate cancer. The article's summary says \"If it is below 1.0 ng/mL, there is very little risk for developing a lethal CaP, and as many as 75% of men might be able to avoid additional PSA screening until 55 years.\"",

      "Content": "Shocking or perhaps Disturbing Results for my particular numbers! I sure hope I am mis-understanding or mis-interpreting the results. MY 10-year Overall Survival with: Radical Prostatectomy 74% Conservative Treatment (Active Surveillance) 71% NO PCa diagnosis 77% The data above says that I only gain a 3% increase in overall survival probability at age 81 by submitting to an RP. OR - 32 out of 33 cases similar to mine will receive NO benefit in 10-years by proceeding to treatment compared to AS. Does that mean that in 11 out of 12 cases ( [71-77]/77 = ~8%) similar to mine that COMPLETE IGNORANCE of my PSA, and thus no treatment, would lead to NO PCa death by age 81? I guess that is why PSA testing after age 72 is not recommended? MY 15-year Overall Survival with: Radical Prostatectomy 48% Conservative Treatment (Active Surveillance) 43% NO PCa diagnosis 54% Does that mean IF I knew I had PCa (3+4) and did NO treatment (AS) I would be only ~20% more likely ( [43-54]/54 )to die in 15-years than if I had NO PCa at all? Does that mean that in 9 out of 10 cases ( [43-48]/43 ) similar to mine that AS would lead to NO PCa death by age 86 IF I knew I had (3+4) PCa? I guess a more optimistic way to interpret the data is that RP benefits are only realized in the long term, which in my case exceeds 15-years. To me, this shows why it is so important to consider one's overall health and medical status when deciding on PCa treatment modalities and strategies. Life expectancy is so critical when making these long term decisions. I still expect to fumble around on this earth for another 20-years so RP still makes sense to me.",

      "Content": "Journol of Urology Jan 2015 Extent of extraprostatic extension independently influences biochemical recurrence-free survival: evidence for further pT3 subclassification OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the extent of extraprostatic extension (EPE) on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) after radical prostatectomy (RP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried our RP database from 2004 to 2013. Extent of EPE on RP was divided into 3 groups: no EPE, focal EPE (F-EPE; a few extraprostatic cancer glands on 1-2 slides), and nonfocal EPE (NF-EPE). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models determined the influence of EPE on BCRFS. RESULTS: A total of 10,750 men underwent RP during the study period. Of these, 7,843 men (73.0%) had no EPE, 1,258 (11.7%) men had F-EPE, and 1,649 men had (15.3%) NF-EPE. Overall BCRFS was worse in men with NF-EPE than those with F-EPE or no EPE. In a multivariate model, F-EPE and NF-EPE were both independently associated with worse BCRFS compared with no EPE (F-EPE: hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.84-3.10; P <.0001; NF-EPE: hazard ratio, 3.57; 95% confidence interval, 2.89-4.40; P <.0001). When stratified by Gleason score in men without seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastases, there was no difference in BCRFS for Gleason score <6, 3 + 4 = 7, 4 + 3 = 7, and 8 for F-EPE vs no EPE; however, patients with Gleason score of 9-10 with F-EPE had worse BCRFS. Patients with NF-EPE had significantly worse BCRFS for Gleason score <6, 7, and 8 and a trend for worse BCRFS for Gleason score 9-10 compared with no EPE. I guess I will go to bed now - I found something to tell me that my Focal EPE has no more probability of BioChemical Failure, (requiring adjuvant or salvage radiation?), than if there were NO EPE. Now - If only I could find something as positive regarding positive margins. Like - mine are small (2mm<) and restricted to one slide only so they don't count. I suspect the only thing that matters is that first PSA test on October 9 but I can try to learn more as I wait.",

      "Content": "Six Weeks since my RALP. I can easily control the urine stream much of the time. I get a full bladder signal and then piss out a normal healthy stream that I can stop and start at will. This full bladder & good control will last for eight or more hours. During that time I do leak or dribble a bit but do not have to change my maxi-Depends for six or eight hours. At other times I dribble continuously and can only stop the urine leakage with maximum effort, which if relaxed even a bit allows a burst of urine to escape. When my system is in that mode I fill a maxi-Depends in two or three hours and never retain any fluid in my bladder. The two phases are not related to caffeine or alcohol, as far as I can tell. This morning I had two strong cups of coffee and almost no leakage during the four hours after the coffee. Now, as I write this four hours after the last sip of coffee, the urine is flowing non-stop and I have almost zero control. Some nights I go eight hours with an almost dry pad and good full bladder emptying several times during the night with near perfect control. Other nights, e.g. last night, I soak through a pad in two hours or less and never get a full bladder. But, after changing the pad at 4 AM, I woke up at 9:30 AM with a full bladder, easy control, and an almost dry pad. I had one beer, at 7 PM, just before dinner. I am becoming quite frustrated because I feel like I have regained most of the bladder control, and then suddenly it disappears for half a day, only to reappear for no apparent reason. This good control / no control has not changed much in the last three weeks. The morning after the catheter was removed (six-days post RALP) I woke with a full bladder and good control, being able to stop and start the stream three times while emptying the bladder. But, it feels like I have made little progress since then. Additionally, stress incontinence has not improved a bit. Bending over to tie my shoes, getting up from a chair, or twisting in bed to reach a book on the night stand, all result in major leakage, no matter how much I try to tightened the external sphincter. That sphincter control is usually quite good while standing over the toilet but seems inadequate to deal with normal stress. Getting into and out of the car always leads to some, and often, major leakage. That is a real problem for every day living because I fill a maxi-Depends with two round trips into and out of the drivers seat. That makes it hard to go anywhere and do anything and is becoming a real QoL issue. Is this a normal course of events? The RALP surgeon told my wife, I can't remember the conversation but it was just four hours after the surgery, that he spared entirely one nerve, and felt he did very little damage to the other. He told my wife I should expect almost perfect bladder control after a few months. My first post-catheter removal appointment with the surgeon is next Tuesday so I will express my concerns then but I would appreciate any opinions from the \"been there - done that\" guys here. I am very careful to do 20x Kegels three times a day, every day without fail. Thanks!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by kumquat we just spoke with is interested in doing the entire prostate and not just the side where we have discovered the tumors and cancer cells. Kumquat Did not know that was possible My understanding is that HIFU can only work on tumors in glands that are smaller than about 40cc or 60cc depending on who you talk with, or which articles you read. I thought that the sound waves could only penetrate a certain depth of tissue and would not work effectively beyond that depth, thus those high energy waves cannot reach all the way thru the gland. A prostate larger than 40cc must be reduced in size prior to HIFU. Is that cost covered by Medicare? My understanding of a TURP prostate size reduction is that most men find it quite unpleasant. Here is a quote from the Indian Jounal of Urology \"A prostate volume >40 ml should be excluded from treatment, or two HIFU session should be considered. This is the major difficulty of HIFU, to reach the anterior parts of the prostate.\" The article was written in 2010 so maybe the newer technology has addressed that limitation. Please let us know what other interesting new information you gather in your future discussion. I am very interested in HIFU and will greatly appreciate any new data.",

      "Content": "Is cost any concern to you? I have been considering HIFU for my treatment and have spent a lot of time talking to Scionti Prostate Center in Sarasota, FLorida. They do make HIFU sound like an attractive option! I have Medicare and Florida Blue Shield NO Deductible Plan F supplemental insurance to pay what Medicare does not. I do not pay a penny to any medical provider, which accepts Medicare/CMS contracts or assignments. However, Scionti Billing was quite clear that MY out of pocket expense would be AT LEAST $7,000 and more likely $9,000. Their website said the OOP for a Medicare patient is in the $10,000- $12,000 range but the person I talked to, three times, said their experience is that the lesser range I quoted is the typical out of pocket expense. I did get the sense that many expenses that will not be covered by Medicare are unknowable at the time treatment begins and can be substantially greater than the $10,000 or $12,000 upper limit I quote above. There are now CMS Code C numbers to be used for billing CMS/Medicare or seeking reimbursement of my expenses but CMS/Medicare is clear that not all costs associated with HIFU will be covered. I tried but did not receive any answer to the question of \"Do I pay all the expenses myself and seek reimbursement from Medicare or will you bill Medicare and then bill me the difference?\" The answer I received indicated there were a lot of IFs associated with things unknown at the start of treatment but I should be prepared and able to pay up front $20,000 out of my own pocket with much, maybe half, of it being reimbursed to me by Medicare. But, other patients find that they pay only the $10,000 out of pocket because Medicare is billed directly. The financial ambiguity did not make me very comfortable! And... I have already had a 3T mpMRI to locate and classify my prostate tumor. The Scitonti RN told me that many MRIs they receive for review are not usable because they were not properly done and must be repeated at Scionti in order to develop the map Dr. Scionti uses to aim the UltraSound device. Usually, CMS/Medicare will not pay for a 2nd MRI. I have read a lot of technical/medical literature about HIFU and it does seem to hold great promise. But, there is limited long term data to confirm the 15 and 20-year survival rates and quality of life issues that are well analyzed with radiation and surgical procedures. My biopsy has been delayed due to an infected wound on my lower leg so I will continue to research this issue while I wait several more weeks to find out if I am a HIFU candidate. Financial issues may seem to be the least of concerns however: - My wife is not old enough for Medicare and pays $9,252 per year for Blue Shield of Florida Bronze high deductible insurance - She needs additional surgery to revisit a femur/hip repair that did not yield good results and this will cost us $7,000 this year - My Medicare and Florida Blue Plan F supplemental costs $4,750 per year - Our Dental insurance costs $1,000 per year - My wife needs $2,500 of dental work, over the annual max her insurance covers, to repair very old fillings and crowns that failed IF you are keeping track - that is more than $24,000 in medical insurance and expenses we have committed to for 2018. Another $10,000 for HIFU would be a sharp blow to our retirement budget! That amount of additional expense will make me think long and hard about the potential benefits of HIFU compared to other treatments that are 100%, (or so I understand at this point), paid for by Medicare and Blue Shield of Florida.",

      "Content": "Walsh book (4th edition) page 326 \"ULTRASENSITIVE PSA TESTS\" references a study done by a Walsh colleague at Hopkins, Dr. Lori Sokoll (professor of pathology and assistant director of clinical chemistry): 750 men 3-months post RP with PSA <0.1 were given ULTRASENSITIVE PSA tests and then monitored for 10-years. 14% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA < 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years 78% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA > 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years There was no report about the clinical symptoms or actual PSA level at 10-years I found a source document for Dr. Sokoll (Journal of Urology Feb 2016), which discusses the same topic but has a little different conclusion than found in the Walsh book. I am not sure if this is the research Walsh was describing but pub date and number of subjects is very similar to what is in the book. Biochemical recurrence-free rates 11 years after surgery were 86.1% (95% CI 83.2\u009689.0) for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% (95% CI 37.5\u009660.3) for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater (p <0.0001). That says to me: An Ultrasensitive PSA < 0.01 had an 86% chance of no biochemical recurrence compared to only about 50% chance of no recurrence if the Ultrasensitive PSA =>.01. Thanksgiving this year I will be at 3-months post RP and am hoping I see that PSA <0.1 report so I can then ask for an Ultrasensitive test to get even more peace of mind.",

      "Content": "Have you studied the \"Review of the Prognostic Value of BCR\" thread? https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...c-Value-of-BCR It points at a very detailed analysis of 77 research papers about BioChemical Recurrence and the interpretation of rising PSA values. It also ends with some recommendations for how to think about future treatment decisions when faced with a rising PSA. In summary the article states: \u201cBased on these analyses, in patients who underwent RP as primary treatment, the main prognostic factor for DM, PCSM, and OM was short PSA-DT.\" That is doubling time, or how long it takes the PSA score to double once it reaches a BCR level, which in RP surgery patients is typically 0.2ng/ml for two consecutive measures. The article discusses the determination of DT because it is such an important value. OM = Overall Mortality (death from any cause) PCSM = PCa Specific Mortality DM = Distant Metastasis (clinical evidence of distant metastasis or metastatic prostate disease) \"3.4.2.6. Interval to biochemical failure. For patients undergoing RP as primary treatment, IBF was associated with DM in two out of six, PCSM in eight out of 11, and OM in one out of four studies, respectively.\" Research is pretty clear that and Interval Before Failure (time from surgery to BCR which is usually defined as 0.2 ng/ml) is the critical measure. If that interval is greater than 18-months the likelihood of a CLINICAL recurrence is small. \"3.4.2.7. PSA-DT after radical treatment. There was a clear association between PSA-DT after primary therapy and oncological outcomes, being most pronounced in patients who underwent RP as primary treatment. All reported studies showed a significant correlation between shorter PSA-DT and DM, PCSM, and OM. The shorter the PSA-DT, the higher the risk of developing worse oncological outcomes.\" The study suggests there be a category of patients titled \"EAU Low Risk of BCR\" Interval to Biochemical Failuer > 18-months Gleason Score after surgery < 8 - OR- PSA-Doubling Time > 12-months Gleason Score after surgery <8 You do not provide enough detail to calculate DT exactly but it seems to be far greater than 12-months (.02 in late 2016) to 0.05 now. BCR has not been reached (0.05 << 0.2) so the IBF will be much greater than 34-months. That Gleason score is appearing much more important for prognosis. The study cites research done by Trock et. al.: \"In contrast, in patients with PSA-DT >6 mo, sRT +/- ADT had no prognostic value with HRs for PCSM of 0.66 to 0.85.\" The HR refers to Hazard Ratio, which means in this case the number of men who died from PCa after they had a rising PSA and met the BCR level and received salvage radiation (with or without ADT) was 35% to 15% less than if they did not receive SRT +/- ADT. The meta-study authors felt there was no statistical difference in the probability of dying from PCa with or without SRT. Those patients need to consider the toxic side effects of salvage radiation therapy when considering future treatment. The \"Implications for Clinical practise\" section of the article says \"As an example, if a PSA rise of >0.2 ng/ml is confirmed in a patient after primary RP, the pGS is 7, and if PSA kinetics are favorable (PSA-DT >12 mo, IBF >18 mo), patients should be informed that they have low-risk BCR and the potential toxicities of additional treatments should be discussed to allow the patient to make a well-informed decision.\" Your husband is young and it sounds like he has a long life ahead of him so consideration of his Quality of Life might be important IF his Gleason score was 7 or less.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by kumquat we just spoke with is interested in doing the entire prostate and not just the side where we have discovered the tumors and cancer cells. Kumquat Did not know that was possible My understanding is that HIFU can only work on tumors in glands that are smaller than about 40cc or 60cc depending on who you talk with, or which articles you read. I thought that the sound waves could only penetrate a certain depth of tissue and would not work effectively beyond that depth, thus those high energy waves cannot reach all the way thru the gland. A prostate larger than 40cc must be reduced in size prior to HIFU. Is that cost covered by Medicare? My understanding of a TURP prostate size reduction is that most men find it quite unpleasant. Here is a quote from the Indian Jounal of Urology \"A prostate volume >40 ml should be excluded from treatment, or two HIFU session should be considered. This is the major difficulty of HIFU, to reach the anterior parts of the prostate.\" The article was written in 2010 so maybe the newer technology has addressed that limitation. Please let us know what other interesting new information you gather in your future discussion. I am very interested in HIFU and will greatly appreciate any new data.",

      "Content": "Is cost any concern to you? I have been considering HIFU for my treatment and have spent a lot of time talking to Scionti Prostate Center in Sarasota, FLorida. They do make HIFU sound like an attractive option! I have Medicare and Florida Blue Shield NO Deductible Plan F supplemental insurance to pay what Medicare does not. I do not pay a penny to any medical provider, which accepts Medicare/CMS contracts or assignments. However, Scionti Billing was quite clear that MY out of pocket expense would be AT LEAST $7,000 and more likely $9,000. Their website said the OOP for a Medicare patient is in the $10,000- $12,000 range but the person I talked to, three times, said their experience is that the lesser range I quoted is the typical out of pocket expense. I did get the sense that many expenses that will not be covered by Medicare are unknowable at the time treatment begins and can be substantially greater than the $10,000 or $12,000 upper limit I quote above. There are now CMS Code C numbers to be used for billing CMS/Medicare or seeking reimbursement of my expenses but CMS/Medicare is clear that not all costs associated with HIFU will be covered. I tried but did not receive any answer to the question of \"Do I pay all the expenses myself and seek reimbursement from Medicare or will you bill Medicare and then bill me the difference?\" The answer I received indicated there were a lot of IFs associated with things unknown at the start of treatment but I should be prepared and able to pay up front $20,000 out of my own pocket with much, maybe half, of it being reimbursed to me by Medicare. But, other patients find that they pay only the $10,000 out of pocket because Medicare is billed directly. The financial ambiguity did not make me very comfortable! And... I have already had a 3T mpMRI to locate and classify my prostate tumor. The Scitonti RN told me that many MRIs they receive for review are not usable because they were not properly done and must be repeated at Scionti in order to develop the map Dr. Scionti uses to aim the UltraSound device. Usually, CMS/Medicare will not pay for a 2nd MRI. I have read a lot of technical/medical literature about HIFU and it does seem to hold great promise. But, there is limited long term data to confirm the 15 and 20-year survival rates and quality of life issues that are well analyzed with radiation and surgical procedures. My biopsy has been delayed due to an infected wound on my lower leg so I will continue to research this issue while I wait several more weeks to find out if I am a HIFU candidate. Financial issues may seem to be the least of concerns however: - My wife is not old enough for Medicare and pays $9,252 per year for Blue Shield of Florida Bronze high deductible insurance - She needs additional surgery to revisit a femur/hip repair that did not yield good results and this will cost us $7,000 this year - My Medicare and Florida Blue Plan F supplemental costs $4,750 per year - Our Dental insurance costs $1,000 per year - My wife needs $2,500 of dental work, over the annual max her insurance covers, to repair very old fillings and crowns that failed IF you are keeping track - that is more than $24,000 in medical insurance and expenses we have committed to for 2018. Another $10,000 for HIFU would be a sharp blow to our retirement budget! That amount of additional expense will make me think long and hard about the potential benefits of HIFU compared to other treatments that are 100%, (or so I understand at this point), paid for by Medicare and Blue Shield of Florida.",

      "Content": "Is cost any concern to you? I have been considering HIFU for my treatment and have spent a lot of time talking to Scionti Prostate Center in Sarasota, FLorida. They do make HIFU sound like an attractive option! I have Medicare and Florida Blue Shield NO Deductible Plan F supplemental insurance to pay what Medicare does not. I do not pay a penny to any medical provider, which accepts Medicare/CMS contracts or assignments. However, Scionti Billing was quite clear that MY out of pocket expense would be AT LEAST $7,000 and more likely $9,000. Their website said the OOP for a Medicare patient is in the $10,000- $12,000 range but the person I talked to, three times, said their experience is that the lesser range I quoted is the typical out of pocket expense. I did get the sense that many expenses that will not be covered by Medicare are unknowable at the time treatment begins and can be substantially greater than the $10,000 or $12,000 upper limit I quote above. There are now CMS Code C numbers to be used for billing CMS/Medicare or seeking reimbursement of my expenses but CMS/Medicare is clear that not all costs associated with HIFU will be covered. I tried but did not receive any answer to the question of \"Do I pay all the expenses myself and seek reimbursement from Medicare or will you bill Medicare and then bill me the difference?\" The answer I received indicated there were a lot of IFs associated with things unknown at the start of treatment but I should be prepared and able to pay up front $20,000 out of my own pocket with much, maybe half, of it being reimbursed to me by Medicare. But, other patients find that they pay only the $10,000 out of pocket because Medicare is billed directly. The financial ambiguity did not make me very comfortable! And... I have already had a 3T mpMRI to locate and classify my prostate tumor. The Scitonti RN told me that many MRIs they receive for review are not usable because they were not properly done and must be repeated at Scionti in order to develop the map Dr. Scionti uses to aim the UltraSound device. Usually, CMS/Medicare will not pay for a 2nd MRI. I have read a lot of technical/medical literature about HIFU and it does seem to hold great promise. But, there is limited long term data to confirm the 15 and 20-year survival rates and quality of life issues that are well analyzed with radiation and surgical procedures. My biopsy has been delayed due to an infected wound on my lower leg so I will continue to research this issue while I wait several more weeks to find out if I am a HIFU candidate. Financial issues may seem to be the least of concerns however: - My wife is not old enough for Medicare and pays $9,252 per year for Blue Shield of Florida Bronze high deductible insurance - She needs additional surgery to revisit a femur/hip repair that did not yield good results and this will cost us $7,000 this year - My Medicare and Florida Blue Plan F supplemental costs $4,750 per year - Our Dental insurance costs $1,000 per year - My wife needs $2,500 of dental work, over the annual max her insurance covers, to repair very old fillings and crowns that failed IF you are keeping track - that is more than $24,000 in medical insurance and expenses we have committed to for 2018. Another $10,000 for HIFU would be a sharp blow to our retirement budget! That amount of additional expense will make me think long and hard about the potential benefits of HIFU compared to other treatments that are 100%, (or so I understand at this point), paid for by Medicare and Blue Shield of Florida.",

      "Content": "Have you studied the \"Review of the Prognostic Value of BCR\" thread? https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...c-Value-of-BCR It points at a very detailed analysis of 77 research papers about BioChemical Recurrence and the interpretation of rising PSA values. It also ends with some recommendations for how to think about future treatment decisions when faced with a rising PSA. In summary the article states: \u201cBased on these analyses, in patients who underwent RP as primary treatment, the main prognostic factor for DM, PCSM, and OM was short PSA-DT.\" That is doubling time, or how long it takes the PSA score to double once it reaches a BCR level, which in RP surgery patients is typically 0.2ng/ml for two consecutive measures. The article discusses the determination of DT because it is such an important value. OM = Overall Mortality (death from any cause) PCSM = PCa Specific Mortality DM = Distant Metastasis (clinical evidence of distant metastasis or metastatic prostate disease) \"3.4.2.6. Interval to biochemical failure. For patients undergoing RP as primary treatment, IBF was associated with DM in two out of six, PCSM in eight out of 11, and OM in one out of four studies, respectively.\" Research is pretty clear that and Interval Before Failure (time from surgery to BCR which is usually defined as 0.2 ng/ml) is the critical measure. If that interval is greater than 18-months the likelihood of a CLINICAL recurrence is small. \"3.4.2.7. PSA-DT after radical treatment. There was a clear association between PSA-DT after primary therapy and oncological outcomes, being most pronounced in patients who underwent RP as primary treatment. All reported studies showed a significant correlation between shorter PSA-DT and DM, PCSM, and OM. The shorter the PSA-DT, the higher the risk of developing worse oncological outcomes.\" The study suggests there be a category of patients titled \"EAU Low Risk of BCR\" Interval to Biochemical Failuer > 18-months Gleason Score after surgery < 8 - OR- PSA-Doubling Time > 12-months Gleason Score after surgery <8 You do not provide enough detail to calculate DT exactly but it seems to be far greater than 12-months (.02 in late 2016) to 0.05 now. BCR has not been reached (0.05 << 0.2) so the IBF will be much greater than 34-months. That Gleason score is appearing much more important for prognosis. The study cites research done by Trock et. al.: \"In contrast, in patients with PSA-DT >6 mo, sRT +/- ADT had no prognostic value with HRs for PCSM of 0.66 to 0.85.\" The HR refers to Hazard Ratio, which means in this case the number of men who died from PCa after they had a rising PSA and met the BCR level and received salvage radiation (with or without ADT) was 35% to 15% less than if they did not receive SRT +/- ADT. The meta-study authors felt there was no statistical difference in the probability of dying from PCa with or without SRT. Those patients need to consider the toxic side effects of salvage radiation therapy when considering future treatment. The \"Implications for Clinical practise\" section of the article says \"As an example, if a PSA rise of >0.2 ng/ml is confirmed in a patient after primary RP, the pGS is 7, and if PSA kinetics are favorable (PSA-DT >12 mo, IBF >18 mo), patients should be informed that they have low-risk BCR and the potential toxicities of additional treatments should be discussed to allow the patient to make a well-informed decision.\" Your husband is young and it sounds like he has a long life ahead of him so consideration of his Quality of Life might be important IF his Gleason score was 7 or less.",

      "Content": "Walsh book (4th edition) page 326 \"ULTRASENSITIVE PSA TESTS\" references a study done by a Walsh colleague at Hopkins, Dr. Lori Sokoll (professor of pathology and assistant director of clinical chemistry): 750 men 3-months post RP with PSA <0.1 were given ULTRASENSITIVE PSA tests and then monitored for 10-years. 14% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA < 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years 78% of men with ULTRASENSITIVE PSA > 0.03 had an elevated PSA at the end of 10-years There was no report about the clinical symptoms or actual PSA level at 10-years I found a source document for Dr. Sokoll (Journal of Urology Feb 2016), which discusses the same topic but has a little different conclusion than found in the Walsh book. I am not sure if this is the research Walsh was describing but pub date and number of subjects is very similar to what is in the book. Biochemical recurrence-free rates 11 years after surgery were 86.1% (95% CI 83.2\u009689.0) for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% (95% CI 37.5\u009660.3) for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater (p <0.0001). That says to me: An Ultrasensitive PSA < 0.01 had an 86% chance of no biochemical recurrence compared to only about 50% chance of no recurrence if the Ultrasensitive PSA =>.01. Thanksgiving this year I will be at 3-months post RP and am hoping I see that PSA <0.1 report so I can then ask for an Ultrasensitive test to get even more peace of mind.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by kumquat we just spoke with is interested in doing the entire prostate and not just the side where we have discovered the tumors and cancer cells. Kumquat Did not know that was possible My understanding is that HIFU can only work on tumors in glands that are smaller than about 40cc or 60cc depending on who you talk with, or which articles you read. I thought that the sound waves could only penetrate a certain depth of tissue and would not work effectively beyond that depth, thus those high energy waves cannot reach all the way thru the gland. A prostate larger than 40cc must be reduced in size prior to HIFU. Is that cost covered by Medicare? My understanding of a TURP prostate size reduction is that most men find it quite unpleasant. Here is a quote from the Indian Jounal of Urology \"A prostate volume >40 ml should be excluded from treatment, or two HIFU session should be considered. This is the major difficulty of HIFU, to reach the anterior parts of the prostate.\" The article was written in 2010 so maybe the newer technology has addressed that limitation. Please let us know what other interesting new information you gather in your future discussion. I am very interested in HIFU and will greatly appreciate any new data.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I think your doc is wisely prudent. OTS, stay optimistic that all is prostate-contained and either treatment path will permanently rid you of you unwanted intruder! I am actually quite relieved that the doc was so committed to treatment and so unequivocal in his analysis. I can now stop wondering and thinking this or that and can concentrate on treatment. I am a man of action and when committed to a path I seldom \"what if\" my choice. My doc was a board certified surgeon for five years prior to becoming a board certified urologist. But - he does not do any prostatectomy work at this point in his busy practice. He wants to concentrate on the non-oncology side of surgery and the diagnostic side of prostate cancer. He recommended a robotic surgeon whose practice involves many robotic prostatectomies each week. His total robotic prostatatecomy count is in the several thousand range. At this point I am strongly leaning to RALP because few surgeons in SW Florida are doing open prostatectomies. And, the latest quality of life, post prostatectomy, shows fewer adverse side effects in the areas that concern me, i.e bowel and bladder involvement. I can deal with ED and minor urinary incontinence but bowel or bladder problems would drive me crazy. The ability to get a 100% cure with a RP is appealing as is the ongoing PSA monitoring to verify I too get to be a member of the PSA Zero club - look out - here I come! (at least once more before the RP?) I have an appointment with the Robot operator on Monday afternoon to get a feel for him, his practice, and his prognosis.",

      "Content": "T1c/Grade II / medical urologist says \"unfavorable intermediate but doesn't matter because of high PSA density\" surgeon urologist says \"favorable intermediate\" radiation oncologist says \"intermediate intermediate but it doesn't matter because it is intermediate with high PSA density\" The RP -or- EBRT+LDR Brachy -or- LDR Brachy monotherapy all seem to depend on the probability of Exta Capsular Extension (ECE) My radiation oncologist recommends 3 to 6 months ADT, 37 to 44 EBRT treatments, and LDR-Brachytherapy He also wants a 2nd opinion read on the biopsy and recommended Hopkins. I was pushing for ONLY LDR-BT. My .55ng/ml/ml PSA density and a 100% 1.4cm 3+4 and 60% 2.0cm 3+4 specimen are worrisome, as they were to my medical urologist, who gave me a 50% proabability of ECE, and my RALP surgeon who things the chance of ECE is less than 35%. Thus, the need for EBRT. Radiation doc, thinks the ADT could also be helpful due to the 35% probability of extra-capsular extension . Is there anything a 2nd opinion can due to resolve the ECE probability? My 3T mpMRI report clearly states the \"capsule is intact\" and \"No extracapsular disease.\" Specificity of the MRI reading for ECE exceeds 75% in most studies, which says to me there is less than a 1 in 4 chance of ECE. That probability seems to be critical in the decision making path. All the recent literature indicates that ADT is indicated when there is a significant risk of ECE. A 2016 talk by Dr Juanita Crook clearly states the decision about LDR-BT as a monotherapy in a G7 (3+4) patient rests on ECE probabilities. AND... if I have more than a 1 in 3 chance of ECE THEN - a RALP surgery would almost certainly be followed by EBRT or at least ADT so why bother with the RALP? How does one resolve this Extracapsular Extension/Disease question?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OTS, with regard to ECE prediction: (If any Abstracts look promising, you may want to look into getting the Full Text.) Thanks so much for the fantastic assistance! I'd seen a couple of those articles but not most of them. I guess the big question is what is my Tumor Contact Length? I will try to get the radiologist to reexamine my mpMRI to give me some more information. The \"map\" provided with the biopsy report shows the 100% (3+4) specimen to be 14mm and located next to the capsule and the 20mm specimen in the Lateral Apex to be 60% (3+4) and next to the capsule. I wonder if radiologist can use that info to estimate TCL? An issue raised by the radiation oncologist about those specimens is the distinct possibility the needle penetrated the capsule a bit and includes some periprostatic tissue. That seems unlikely to me and also seemed to be a bit of \"salesman\" talk also known as FUD when I was doing support for MegaMillion dollar software sales (Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt make the potential client scared enough they believe you are their savior) SO MUCH to think about! But, at least it is fun and interesting to deal with all this technical stuff and once again bury myself in analyzing research and statistical validity. Your assistance is so appreciated. I am shortly off to get the CT scan (pelvis & abdomen) with contrast and whole body bone scan. Hopefully they will not change my status and will allow me to continue this fantastic decision making process.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I'll let others comment on the stats. If you do opt for a RP, remember that you are not looking and interviewing for Dr. Average Stats. There are excellent, highly experienced surgeons with excellent urinary outcomes as well as some Just-Starting-Out-Haven't-Quite-Got-the-Hang-of-It ones. Yes that is an important observation and surgeon experience was not a controlled or analyzed variable in the JAMA QOL study. Here are two biggish names Patel (2011) reports on 1,111 RALP patients with an average 12-month continence rate of 96%. Shikanov (2010) reports on 1,436 RALP patients with an average 12-month continence rate of 69%. How does one verify the data / success rates / side effect percentages provided by my particular surgeon? My urologist, board certified surgeon and urologist, no longer does prostatectomies. He referred me to D. Ornstein in Bonita Springs, FL. Ornsteins website says he began doing RALP procedures in 2003 and has done thousands since then. So, I can assume the proper experience. How do I verify the results? My urologist says fewer than 4% of Ornstein RALP patients experience urinary incontinence at 24-months. They both work for the 21st Century Oncology which has many practices in many states. Trust but Verify - HOW?",

      "Content": "One hour discussion with my urologist regarding my blood tests and pathology report (August 3 TRUS 12-core biopsy with guidance from prior 3T mpMRI image). Bottom Line - Staging / Grading / MRI imaging mean very little when deciding the next steps to take in my PCa journey. Doctor confirmed: 18 cc prostate size calculated by TRUS PSA (blood taken during biopsy) has risen from 9.2 (May 19) to 10.2 (June 20) to 10.4 August 3 Every sample in left lobe was Gleason 6 or 7 A 1.4 cm sample was 100% (3+4) A 2.0 cm sample was 60% (3+4) His beginning summary was \"You have a a very high level of PSA for such a small gland and small tumor identified on the MRI. Your PSA density is way to high and you have several cores that were a very high percentage Gleason 7.\" He confirmed the staging was T1c (I double checked that and he explained there was no tumor felt by DRE and it was equivocal\\ in the MRI thus the T1c) He confirmed I was Grade II He confirmed I was unfavorable intermediate risk BUT - he felt none of that mattered because of the PSA density (~.56 ng/ml) and the 100% involvement in the left lobe. I asked him about a 2nd opinion and he said he had an easy process to transmit everything to Epstein at JH but was 100% certain there would be no change. Then the SHOCKER for me - \"Even if the path is down graded to Gleason 6 (3+3) for every positive sample - you will still have a very high PSA density and total involvement of the left lobe - thus immediate treatment is required.\" He is a bit concerned about cancerous cells having already leaked (invaded) from the left lobe into the pelvic area (~5% probability) and/or into the systemic blood stream (~3% probability) Whole body CAT Scan with contrast and Whole Body Bone Scan on Wednesday August 15. If nothing detected on either scan I get to choose from surgery (prostatectomy) or radiation to begin prior to September 14. The date was selected because new data says to complete the surgery or start the radiation within 6-weeks of the biopsy. PCa with my characteristics is probably becoming more aggressive and the data shows a 1 point Gleason upgrade within several months of a biopsy with results similar to mine. He left treatment choice up to me and my wife. Similar survival rates at 15-years but significant advantage at 20-years for surgical patients.",

      "Content": "I need help understanding the urinary incontinence statistics I find in many places. They are quite inconsistent and in some cases hugely different. My baseline is a 2017 JAMA study looking at Quality of Life (QOL) for 1,141 men who underwent AS, RP, Internal, and External radiation during 2011 to 2013. This is an important study because it uses a nationally recognized and standarized method to determine QOL. All patients were extensively interviewed at pre-treatment/post Dx, 3-months, 12-months, and 24-months post treatment or post Dx for AS. Each patient had a Baseline (pre-treatment/post Dx) QOL analysis. I will focus on just urinary incontinence because that is the side effects that most concerns me at this point as I plan for RALP but still consider radiation. QOL responses are broken into three categories Normal (full urinary control with no dysfunction), intermediate (one distressful symptom, e.g. occasional leakage but minor impact on QOL), and poor ( at least one very distressful symptom with major QOL impact). I will focus on the NORMAL baseline group because that is where I currently live. No leakage, no holding problems, no emptying problems, almost no night time symptoms. The 314 AS participants grouped themselves as follows when asked about their CURRENT urinary incontinence at 24-months post Dx: 73% Normal 20% Intermediate 7% Poor (at least one major dysfunction adversely affecting The 469 RP participants grouped themselves as follows when asked about their CURRENT urinary incontinence at 24-months post RP: 34% Normal 50% Intermediate 16% Poor (at least one major dysfunction adversely affecting QOL) Please note - the participants shown above self reported NORMAL QOL (no symptoms) at their pre-treatment baseline. Those numbers seem to say that 27% of AS men and 66% of RP men have at least some urinary incontinence and 16% of RP patients report major urinary dysfunction at 24-months post treatment. I CANNOT reconcile those numbers with the following types of numbers I find reported at many prostate cancer education and treatment sites: Less than 10% of RP patients require pads 3-years post surgery (PCF) More than 90% of men who undergo surgery at MSK return to normal urinary function, usually within a few months. (MSK) Only 7% of men had urinary incontinence 18-months after RP (article in Urology) No Control or frequent leakage at 24-months post RP 9.6% (NEJM 2013) Personally bothered by leakage or dripping 24-months post RP 10.6% (NEJM 2013) Most of the literature reports 5% to 10% urinary incontinence post RP for ALL patients which is ~40% below the number for the QOL RP patients who had NO urinary sypmtoms prior to RP. How do the popular literature and other medical studies report post-RP urninary incontinence percentages that are LOWER than the pre-RP incontinence numbers? What am I misunderstanding here? The major QOL study found that 2 of 3 RP patients who had normal urinary function prior to surgery had at least one distressful symptom post RP yet everyone else reports only 1 out of 10 men have an incontinence problem. An AUA paper published in 2016 concludes: Surgeon overestimate continence Patients report higher incontinence and are bothered by the rate of incontinence",

      "Content": "I need help understanding the urinary incontinence statistics I find in many places. They are quite inconsistent and in some cases hugely different. My baseline is a 2017 JAMA study looking at Quality of Life (QOL) for 1,141 men who underwent AS, RP, Internal, and External radiation during 2011 to 2013. This is an important study because it uses a nationally recognized and standarized method to determine QOL. All patients were extensively interviewed at pre-treatment/post Dx, 3-months, 12-months, and 24-months post treatment or post Dx for AS. Each patient had a Baseline (pre-treatment/post Dx) QOL analysis. I will focus on just urinary incontinence because that is the side effects that most concerns me at this point as I plan for RALP but still consider radiation. QOL responses are broken into three categories Normal (full urinary control with no dysfunction), intermediate (one distressful symptom, e.g. occasional leakage but minor impact on QOL), and poor ( at least one very distressful symptom with major QOL impact). I will focus on the NORMAL baseline group because that is where I currently live. No leakage, no holding problems, no emptying problems, almost no night time symptoms. The 314 AS participants grouped themselves as follows when asked about their CURRENT urinary incontinence at 24-months post Dx: 73% Normal 20% Intermediate 7% Poor (at least one major dysfunction adversely affecting The 469 RP participants grouped themselves as follows when asked about their CURRENT urinary incontinence at 24-months post RP: 34% Normal 50% Intermediate 16% Poor (at least one major dysfunction adversely affecting QOL) Please note - the participants shown above self reported NORMAL QOL (no symptoms) at their pre-treatment baseline. Those numbers seem to say that 27% of AS men and 66% of RP men have at least some urinary incontinence and 16% of RP patients report major urinary dysfunction at 24-months post treatment. I CANNOT reconcile those numbers with the following types of numbers I find reported at many prostate cancer education and treatment sites: Less than 10% of RP patients require pads 3-years post surgery (PCF) More than 90% of men who undergo surgery at MSK return to normal urinary function, usually within a few months. (MSK) Only 7% of men had urinary incontinence 18-months after RP (article in Urology) No Control or frequent leakage at 24-months post RP 9.6% (NEJM 2013) Personally bothered by leakage or dripping 24-months post RP 10.6% (NEJM 2013) Most of the literature reports 5% to 10% urinary incontinence post RP for ALL patients which is ~40% below the number for the QOL RP patients who had NO urinary sypmtoms prior to RP. How do the popular literature and other medical studies report post-RP urninary incontinence percentages that are LOWER than the pre-RP incontinence numbers? What am I misunderstanding here? The major QOL study found that 2 of 3 RP patients who had normal urinary function prior to surgery had at least one distressful symptom post RP yet everyone else reports only 1 out of 10 men have an incontinence problem. An AUA paper published in 2016 concludes: Surgeon overestimate continence Patients report higher incontinence and are bothered by the rate of incontinence",

      "Content": "D&B At 4-weeks post surgery I too was impatient and tried sitting on my mountain bike. I was uncomfortably aware of the saddle and felt a bit of pressure in my lower abdomen. That one bike sitting convinced me to wait a couple more weeks. At six weeks I could feel a somewhat uncomfortable sensation when I sat down too firmly on a hard surface. But, at seven weeks I was surprised to find I could sit on the WTB Silverado saddle with no discomfort. I had dug out an older, wider, softer saddle my wife used a long time ago Just in Case but did not need to use it. I was most worried about urine leakage and bladder control as the weeks went by and my control did not improve as quickly as my physical well being. I am most pleased that the \"not minor\" leakage is not going to be a problem during the months it takes me to regain full bladder control. My surgeon stressed that 98% of his patients who have had similar amount of tissue removal and nerve damage as did I will eventually regain almost full control. He did say that stress leakage might be a long term problem but I will learn to exert more positive and thoughtful/willful muscle control. He reminded me that the old autonomic sphincter control is not enough for men like me. Good luck with the recovery and please do not rush things for a short term gain and potentially long term adverse consequences.",

      "Content": "I am a life time cyclist and measure most days by the quality and duration of my bicycle adventure. Being off the bike for 7-weeks after my surgery has been a trial. I am happy to report that just 49-days after my surgery I was back on the bicycle and riding as if the surgery never happened. I hope other serious bicyclist will find the thread in the future and take comfort in my experiences, all of which have been positive. My comments get a little \"bike geeky\" and cover some of the details bicyclist who do a hundred miles a week worry about. 48-Days after the surgery I was given permission to return to \"all normal activities.\" I specifically asked the surgeon about strenuous street bicycle riding with a hard narrow saddle and dropped handlebars. He cautioned me \"not to be stupid - but if it does not hurt then it is OK to do it. Just ease into it and give your body a couple weeks to get used to the effort again.\" I have ridden five times since then and feel no pain, discomfort, or any other sensation that indicates the surgery or missing parts have any adverse impact on my ability to ride or the comfort of riding. Three rides were on a 26\" wheel front suspension and very stiff Specialized aluminum mountain bike and two were on a stiff 700c Specialized carbon fiber road burner. I use the same saddle on all my bicycles and it is on the \"hard narrow\" side of things. My cardio-vascular conditioning fell way off during the 7-weeks of only walking and light exercise after the surgery. I have eased back into the riding but have done two rides with an average heart rate over 130 and max at 165. I have tried spinning at max, which for me is about 108 RPM. I have pushed a big gear for several minutes at 160 bpm heart rate. AND... have felt no indication of any soreness, loss of strength, or pain, stiffness, or soreness in my abdomen and groin. As I said - except for the poor cardio condition - I feel like the surgery never happened and my shorts feel just as normal as before I discovered Prostate Cancer. Most of the time I can control my bladder until it almost fills and then semi-gracefully find my way to the toilet and release the flow with a modicum of control. However, I do \"leak\" a lot due to stress such as laughing, coughing, standing up, bending over, sneezing... and many other little things. I dribble out less than an ounce per hour to a little more than two ounces per hour but many nights go almost all night with no leakage. I was very concerned about the leakage and how it would impact my longer and more intense bike riding. Turns out to be a non-issue and the leakage is hardly noticeable while riding. I am a traditionalist on the bike and wear Lycra bike shorts (tights) or baggy mountain bike shorts. I tried using Depends Men's shields in the baggy shorts but they were not comfortable and did not stay in place. I completed all the rides with men's Depends max absorption briefs under either the tights or the baggy shorts. Once I put them on and start riding - everything automatically adjusts and I hardly think about the briefs being there. I am riding in Florida where it is 90-degrees or so each day and the humidity is over 55% so I SWEAT - A Lot! I weight my Depends briefs after each ride and find they gain about 4-ounces an hour while riding. I know I sweat out about 12 or so ounces per hour and the entire brief is soaking wet, as are my shorts so I suspect that my urine leakage is more like 2 or 3-ounces per hour. I am only aware of the Depends briefs when I try hard to think about them. I find no indication of chafe or other adverse skin effects after even two hours non-stop on the bike. This is a key point because I was very worried that wearing bulky briefs under Lycra shorts with a synthetic chamois would surely cause chafing and irritation as I spin at 85 - 95 RPM continually. As far as I can tell the briefs are not a problem! I can feel a little \"warm dribble\" occurring during certain riding conditions: - standing up to sprint causes a little dribble as I spring off the saddle and make the first surge - riding over speed bumps knocks loose a dribble or two (even if out of the saddle) - sudden change in pedal load such as moving to the big chain ring - bouncing on the saddle when spinning at high RPM and getting out of synch with the pedals After about 7-hours of riding I am now confident that the RALP surgery will turn out to be a total non-issue for my future bicycle riding. EVEN IF my bladder control never improves! I expect to regain full bladder control in the next six-months but I am relieved to know even if my leakage problem continues by bicycle riding will hardly be impacted. Being able to issue this report has really freed my mind of many concerns because bicycle riding has always been a huge part of my wife and I's life and I now know it can continue to be.",

      "Content": "T1c/Grade II / medical urologist says \"unfavorable intermediate but doesn't matter because of high PSA density\" surgeon urologist says \"favorable intermediate\" radiation oncologist says \"intermediate intermediate but it doesn't matter because it is intermediate with high PSA density\" The RP -or- EBRT+LDR Brachy -or- LDR Brachy monotherapy all seem to depend on the probability of Exta Capsular Extension (ECE) My radiation oncologist recommends 3 to 6 months ADT, 37 to 44 EBRT treatments, and LDR-Brachytherapy He also wants a 2nd opinion read on the biopsy and recommended Hopkins. I was pushing for ONLY LDR-BT. My .55ng/ml/ml PSA density and a 100% 1.4cm 3+4 and 60% 2.0cm 3+4 specimen are worrisome, as they were to my medical urologist, who gave me a 50% proabability of ECE, and my RALP surgeon who things the chance of ECE is less than 35%. Thus, the need for EBRT. Radiation doc, thinks the ADT could also be helpful due to the 35% probability of extra-capsular extension . Is there anything a 2nd opinion can due to resolve the ECE probability? My 3T mpMRI report clearly states the \"capsule is intact\" and \"No extracapsular disease.\" Specificity of the MRI reading for ECE exceeds 75% in most studies, which says to me there is less than a 1 in 4 chance of ECE. That probability seems to be critical in the decision making path. All the recent literature indicates that ADT is indicated when there is a significant risk of ECE. A 2016 talk by Dr Juanita Crook clearly states the decision about LDR-BT as a monotherapy in a G7 (3+4) patient rests on ECE probabilities. AND... if I have more than a 1 in 3 chance of ECE THEN - a RALP surgery would almost certainly be followed by EBRT or at least ADT so why bother with the RALP? How does one resolve this Extracapsular Extension/Disease question?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic I'll let others comment on the stats. If you do opt for a RP, remember that you are not looking and interviewing for Dr. Average Stats. There are excellent, highly experienced surgeons with excellent urinary outcomes as well as some Just-Starting-Out-Haven't-Quite-Got-the-Hang-of-It ones. Yes that is an important observation and surgeon experience was not a controlled or analyzed variable in the JAMA QOL study. Here are two biggish names Patel (2011) reports on 1,111 RALP patients with an average 12-month continence rate of 96%. Shikanov (2010) reports on 1,436 RALP patients with an average 12-month continence rate of 69%. How does one verify the data / success rates / side effect percentages provided by my particular surgeon? My urologist, board certified surgeon and urologist, no longer does prostatectomies. He referred me to D. Ornstein in Bonita Springs, FL. Ornsteins website says he began doing RALP procedures in 2003 and has done thousands since then. So, I can assume the proper experience. How do I verify the results? My urologist says fewer than 4% of Ornstein RALP patients experience urinary incontinence at 24-months. They both work for the 21st Century Oncology which has many practices in many states. Trust but Verify - HOW?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic OTS, with regard to ECE prediction: (If any Abstracts look promising, you may want to look into getting the Full Text.) Thanks so much for the fantastic assistance! I'd seen a couple of those articles but not most of them. I guess the big question is what is my Tumor Contact Length? I will try to get the radiologist to reexamine my mpMRI to give me some more information. The \"map\" provided with the biopsy report shows the 100% (3+4) specimen to be 14mm and located next to the capsule and the 20mm specimen in the Lateral Apex to be 60% (3+4) and next to the capsule. I wonder if radiologist can use that info to estimate TCL? An issue raised by the radiation oncologist about those specimens is the distinct possibility the needle penetrated the capsule a bit and includes some periprostatic tissue. That seems unlikely to me and also seemed to be a bit of \"salesman\" talk also known as FUD when I was doing support for MegaMillion dollar software sales (Fear-Uncertainty-Doubt make the potential client scared enough they believe you are their savior) SO MUCH to think about! But, at least it is fun and interesting to deal with all this technical stuff and once again bury myself in analyzing research and statistical validity. Your assistance is so appreciated. I am shortly off to get the CT scan (pelvis & abdomen) with contrast and whole body bone scan. Hopefully they will not change my status and will allow me to continue this fantastic decision making process.",

      "Content": "The pains you describe sound very similar to what I experienced post-RALP. First it was dull pain in upper left quadrant, which was scary due to cardiac concerns. It then moved closer to my left shoulder and became more intense and felt very much like my dislocated shoulder/broken clavicle pains. A day or so later it moved to my right quadrant in the mid-rib area and felt like my previous broken rib episode. I saw my surgeon on day 6 post-RALP and discussed the pains with him. Apparently there are multiple theories about the pain: - referred pain due to gas pressure on nerves in the diaphragm area - actual pain in the area it is felt due to gas pressure in the shoulder or rib area - actual pain in the abdomen area that the brain mis-interprets as being from upper chest or ribs due to all the trauma in the lower abodomen His recommendation (he has done over 1,600 RALPs and another 1,000 other robotic urogenital procedures) was WALK - WALK - WALK! He was correct - I started walking 1/4 mile day five, 1/2 mile day seven, 1/2 mile twice on day 10.... and the pain moved around more, diminished, returned and by day 15 was just a distant memory. BUT - then my biggest incision for the \"gas port\" in my lower right abdomen started really aching as I stretched and walked. Again - surgeon says \"I moved a lot of stuff, I cut a lot of stuff, I traumatized a lot of stuff in your abodomen, especially where we cut access holes - it will take a couple months before all the aches and pains are gone.\" And it was! At 3-months post RALP I was back to hard bicycle riding, long walks, and sailing my big boat. Patience and a reasonable expectation of various pains, aches, discomfort will get you thru the recovery.",

      "Content": "I am currently 9-days post RALP done by surgeon with 1,600 prior cases experience. He said he thinks he did no damage to any nerves. I am not quite understanding my incontinence behavior and would like someone with experience to explain what I am experiencing. - Dry all night - Can start/stop/hold urine stream on demand with little effort - Dry sitting or walking if I am not stressing abdomen or pelvis and I make conscious effort to stop urine stream - ANY little stress, (laughing, coughing, farting, bending over too far) causes serious dribbling that I can stop with some effort - Standing up from chair causes major leakage that I might or might not be able to stop depending on bladder fullness Standing in shower, relaxed and upright, my penis dribbles at a steady rate. I can easily stop the dribble by flexing the appropriate muscles and I can keep the stream shut off with a continued conscious effort. But, as soon as I relax my mind/sphincter (?) the dribble returns. My understanding of all the above is that I have a good nerve path from brain to sphincter but the brain is not sending a steady \"pinch that thing off\" signal to the external sphincter unless my mind wills it to do so. Will that autonomic/no conscious effort signal return eventually? Is progress dependent on my muscles, nerves, brain learning a new skill similar to learning to throw a curve? I have been conscientious doing my Mayo and UCLA kegels and feel I have excellent control of the urine stream with an overt effort. What do I need to do to regain that same control with no conscious thought? I am not impatient and am fine with not getting full control back for months. I do want to confirm there is not something else I can be doing to make faster progress. thanks for any advice",

      "Content": "I have many questions about the interpretation of post-RP PSA values and what prognostic information those PSA tests provide. In the following I summarize some of the information and literature I have found useful. Anything in italics is a direct quote from the article I am summarizing or paraphrasing. Here is a Literature Review titled: Biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: what does it mean? January-February 2018 International Brazilian Journal of Urology This is a concise but complete summarization of all the literature and research about BioChemicalRecurrence (BCR) conducted from the mid-1990 thru summer 2017. Much of what I summarize below is taken from this article. I highly recommend the IBJU article to all post-primary treatment PCa patients. The article discusses many of the issues involved with interpreting PSA scores after primary treatment. For example, something very important for me: \"Positive surgical margins (PSM) PSM alone is not associated with higher risk of PCa mortality, although it increases men\u2019s risk of BCR in 2 to 4-fold and need for secondary therapy\" ************** Single Best Study: Natural history of progression after PSA elevation following radical prostatectomy. JAMA. 1999 \"An excellent report of natural history of BCR was given by Johns Hopkins\u2019s researchers. They performed a retrospective review of almost two thousand men that underwent RP for localized PCa who had not received adjuvant hormonal treatment before documentation of metastasis. Patients with good response to radiotherapy after BCR were also excluded. After a mean follow-up of 5.3 years, BCR (PSA =0.2ng/mL) was observed in 15% of patients at a median time of 2.3 years and 34% of them developed metastatic disease. The median actuarial time to clinically evident metastasis after PSA elevation was 8 years and it was dependent on GS 8-10, PSA-DT <10 months and time to BCR after RP. The likelyhood of metastatic disease was 37% in 5 years among those men who had presented BCR. Forty four percent of patients with metastatic disease died due to PCa. Actuarial median time to death after development of metastasis was 5 years. Death time was only influenced by time to metastatic disease after RP\" ************ SHOULD WE ADDRESS BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE OF PROSTATE CANCER AS SOON AS POSSIBLE? IN FAVOUR European Oncology & Haematology, 2018; \"Approximately 15\u201340% of men will develop recurrent disease following an attempt at curative therapy for prostate cancer. Some of them will develop metastases after a median time of 8\u201310 years. The predictors of metastasis are Gleason score of 8\u201310, pathological stage T3b-4, nodal invasion and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time. One can anticipate that about 10% of patients with recurrent PSA will develop systemic progression and that 5% will die from prostate cancer more than 10 years after radical prostatectomy and more than 6 years after the biochemical recurrence.\" ************ Biochemical (prostate specific antigen) recurrence probability following radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer. J Urol. 2003 Han and colleagues evaluated 2.091 men submited to RP without adjuvant radiotherapy for a median follow-up of 5.9 years. Recurrence (PSA =0.2ng/mL) was noted in 17% of patients. Overall actuarial 5, 10 and 15 year BCR rates were 16%, 28% and 39%, respectively. Same years rates for metastatic disease were 4%, 11% and 19% and for PCa specific mortality 1%, 4% and 11%, respectively The last sentence above seems to say that if left untreated, BCR leads to metastatic disease symptoms in about 1/5 of the occurrences of BCR within 15-years, and about half (1/10 of RP patients) of those with symptoms die from PCA/metastatic disease within 15-years. ************ Long-term risk of clinical progression after biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy: the impact of time from surgery to recurrence. Eur Urol. 2011 Ten-year rate of PCa systemic progression ranges from 10% to 19% for patients who experienced BCR >6 years or <1.2 year after RP, respectively. ************ Comparative effectiveness of radical prostatectomy and curative radiotherapy in localized prostate cancer: long-term follow-up J of Radiation Research 14 Nov 2016. 248 RP and 182 EBRT patients were followed for at least 10-years. The number with NO Biochemical Recurrence (PSA > 0.2 twice) was as follows. 48-months 78% RP & 88% EBRT 96-months 72% RP & 80% EBRT (percentages did not change much after 8-years) ************ 10-Year Outcomes After Monitoring, Surgery or Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer N Engl J Med 2016; 375:1415\u201324 1,095 PCa G6 or G7 patients treated with either RP or RT monitored for 10-years 92 suffered \"disease progression\", which was undefined. I interpret that to mean almost 92% of the men receiving a single primary treatment did not have clinical disease symptoms after 10-years. ************ Do Ultrasensitive Prostate Specific Antigen Measurements Have a Role in Predicting Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Men after Radical Prostatectomy? J of Urology Feb 2016 754 men wiht PSA < 0.1 ng/ml post-RP. Eleven years after RP 86% of men with PSA nadir < 0.01 had no BCR but 49% of men with PSA nadir >0.01 experienced BCR. 93% of the men who had NO BCR had a PSA nadir <0.01. Amling and colleagues analyzed the use of various PSA cut point definitions for determining biochemical progression after RP in 2001. They evaluated the percentage of patients with a continued PSA increase after each cut point to define the most appropriate PSA level to determine disease progression. Progression of PSA rates were 49%, 62% and 72% after reaching PSA levels of 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4ng/mL, respectively. I guess that means that half the men with a post-surgery PSA <0.2 do not continue to experience an increase in their PSA score.",

At this time I am wishing, now that I understand a biopsy is no big deal!, I had had a biopsy at age 66 or earlier. This forum has been a wealth of information and has guided me to a world of important PCa diagnosis and treatment information on the web. If I had known that information at age 63 I would have had the first biopsy at that time. I now believe, contrary to back then, that a biopsy has few objective risks and many potential benefits.",

      "Content": "I am 71 and had a robotic assisted radical prostatectomy done in late August this year. The recovery was 100% non-eventful. I was up walking in 8-hours, home from the hospital in 36-hours, and walking miles around the neighborhood in 3-days. Seven weeks after the surgery the robot man told me I could resume all normal activities including sailing my 40' boat and riding my very stiff carbon fiber bicycle with a small hard saddle. It is now 10+ weeks since the surgery and I feel as if it never happened. I spent the last three days digging up the irrigation/sprinkler system in our yard and other than being a little tired and sore in the evening, I don't feel any effects from the surgery. At least for me - surgery in my early '70s was not problem. The wild fluctuations in the PSA score are quite unusual. Is EVERY PSA test done at the same lab using the same equipment? If not - then comparing those numbers is less than useful. My PSA fluctuated quite a bit (+ and - 25% of so) over a period of 4-years but never like your husband's. When I had PSA scores in the 4 to 5 range at ages 63 to 66 I dismissed them as not important and thus delayed my treatment by a couple years. That delay will probably lead to the eventual need to have radiation therapy at some point in the next five-years.",

      "Content": "You can read my PSA history in my signature I am having a hard time getting the 1st biopsy scheduled - I posted two rants about that problem here... but the important thing is that==> My urologist just sent me an e-mailing saying that even with my dire PSA, free PSA, 4KScore, MRI results it will be no problem if my biopsy is postponed for another month while my open ankle wound heals. He called while I was writing this and reassured me that even with those scary (to me) numbers there is no rush to biopsy let alone treatment. \"things move slowly in the PCa world\" was his parting words based on 22-years of practice after a 4-year resident program.",

      "Content": "The authors state: \u201cOwing to the heterogeneity of the studied populations and measurement of prognostic factors, we did not report on a pooled HR for the different prognostic factors. Rather, the meta-analysis is an exploratory analysis to attempt more complete insight into the most strongly associated prognostic factors.\u201d I summarized the various individual findings about prognostic indicators just for my personal knowledge but figured that many other men here probably are in the same situation as me: SM+, EPE+, non-Zero PSA, waiting for that all important 3-month Post RP PSA score. In the following summaries you will find capitalized initials: DM = Distant Metastasis PCSM = Prostate Cancer Specific Mortality (patient died from PCa) OM = Overall Mortality (patient died regardless of cause) HR = Hazard Ratio (factor showing number of BCR patients experiencing effect (DM or PCSM) due to a factor or treatment compared to patients with NO factor or treatment) For example, A HR of 1.0 for the DM effect for Positive Surgical Margins means the percentage of patients with a particular factor (e.g. SM+) experiencing an effect( e.g. DM) is not different than a patient without that factor (e.g. SM-). An HR of 2.0 for DM in SM+ patients would mean that twice the percentage of SM+ patients experience DM as do SM- patients. HR is the key indicator in this study. RP = Radical Prostatectomy (used as primary treatment) RT = Radiotherapy (Radiation of any kind used as primary treatment) IBF = Interval to BCR following initial treatment ((definition of BCR varies study to study) PSA-DT = PSA Doubling Time pGS = Pathological Gleason Score MY SUMMARY OF THE SUMMARY is stated by the authors (IMHO): \u201cBased on these analyses, in patients who underwent RP as primary treatment, the main prognostic factor for DM, PCSM, and OM was short PSA-DT. For patients who underwent primary RT, clearly the strongest prognostic factor for DM, PCSM, and OM was a short IBF.\u201d The following are ALL quotes from the article UNLESS I label it My Comment. What I consider Good News is in a different font Here are what I consider the important summary quotes from the section titled: \u201c3.4.2 Prognostic factors for oncological outcomes in patients who develop BCR.\u201d 3.4.2.1 AGE For PCa-specific outcomes (DM and PCSM) and irrespective of the primary PCa treatment (RP or RT), age is not an unfavorable factor with HRs ranging from 0.98 to 1.02 for the development of DM and 0.96 to 1.05 for PCSM, with only two studies showing a small, but statistically significant unfavorable effect of increasing age 3.4.2.2. Initial PSA. Initial serum PSA (iPSA) levels prior to primary treatment were not uniformly found as a prognostic factor for any of the investigated outcomes. 3.4.2.3. Gleason score. For patients undergoing primary RP, a higher GS identified on prostatectomy histology report (pGS) is a strong prognostic factor for oncological outcomes in most studies. My Comments about G Score: RP men were 1.2 to 14.4 more likely to have DM and 1.4 to 10.8 times more likely to die from PCa depending on the G Score. RT men\u2019s factors were 1.7 to 3.7 for DM, 2.1 to 14.8 for PCSM. And very disturbingly, to me at least, RT men were 1.8 to 17.9 times more likely to die from any cause, depending on the Gleason Score. The increasingly large HR correlates well with ever higher Gleason Scores. For example, RP men with BCR & G7 (3+4 and 4+3) are between ~5 and ~11 times more likely to have DM than men with BCR & G6 pathology. 3.4.2.4. T category. Increasing T category at prostatectomy histology report (pT category) is not clearly associated with any of the oncological outcomes for patients undergoing RP. For RT, four out of six, three out of seven, and two out of six studies showing a significant correlation between cT category and DM, PCSM, and OM, respectively. 3.4.2.5. Positive surgical margin. For patients who underwent RP, two out of eight studies showed an inverse relationship with DM (ie, \u201ca protective effect\u201d) and none of the eight studies investigating PCSM as an outcome showed a significant correlation 3.4.2.6. Interval to biochemical failure. For patients undergoing RP as primary treatment, IBF was associated with DM in two out of six, PCSM in eight out of 11, and OM in one out of four studies, respectively. For patients undergoing RT as primary treatment, IBF had a clear association with oncological outcomes, with five out of five studies, five out of seven studies, and five out of six studies showing a strong association with DM, PCSM, and OM, respectively. Although studies repeatedly reported this association, the effect size was less interpretable due to the use of different thresholds. However, it is clear that the shorter the IBF, the higher the risk of developing DM, PCSM, and OM after both RP and RT. 3.4.2.7. PSA-DT after radical treatment. There was a clear association between PSA-DT after primary therapy and oncological outcomes, being most pronounced in patients who underwent RP as primary treatment. All reported studies showed a significant correlation between shorter PSA-DT and DM, PCSM, and OM. The shorter the PSA-DT, the higher the risk of developing worse oncological outcomes. Similarly, for patients who underwent RT, the limited number of studies consistently showed that PSA-DT was a risk factor for DM. 3.4.2.8. Salvage RT. Four studies included salvage RT (sRT) as a covariable in their MVAs, of which three studies showed a significant impact on survival outcome. These data suggest that a PSA cutoff of 0.4 mg/l that keeps increasing is probably indeed a good definition for BCR and that initiating sRT based on this definition is probably desirable. Eleven studies investigated only patients who received sRT. For these patients, pGS remained a strong predictor for DM and to a lesser extent for PCSM. In two out of four and four out of five studies investigating IBF in their MVA for DM and PCSM as outcomes, respectively, this was significant. PSA-DT was only investigated by one study and showed a significant effect [33]. Closely related were the PSA levels before initiation of sRT, which showed to be a significant predictor for DM and PCSM, More about SRT from the Clinical Implications Section: In this study, in patients with PSA-DT <6 mo, sRT with or without ADT resulted in a reduction of PCSM with HRs of 0.14 to 0.24. In contrast, in patients with PSA-DT>6 mo, sRT with or without ADT had no prognostic value with HRs of 0.66 to 0.85. My Comment: Section 3.4.2.8 is not easily summarized but for me the conclusion is that early SRT (within 2-years of BCR) significantly diminished the possibility of DM and PCSM when PSA-DT < 6-months. When the PSA-DT > 6-months the benefit of SRT is less easily distinguished or quantified. The addition of ADT does not seem to change the outcome. The authors discuss 15-studies involving SRT but it is hard to generalize any result other than early SRT is good if the PSA-DT is less than 6-months. 3.4.2.9. Salvage ADT. A limited number of studies report on the prognostic effect of salvage ADT (sADT) after RP or RT. No conclusions can be drawn from the RT patients outcomes after ADT because of the contradictory results and the lack of Hazard Ratios being reported. My Comment: The PCSM (patient died from PCa) HR\u2019s for RP followed by ADT vary from .83 (patients who received ADT did a little bit better) to 1.09 (patients who did not receive ADT did marginally better). ALL studies found that RP patients who received ADT did far worse when looking at OM (overall mortality), with the HR being 0.55, which says an ADT patient is almost twice as likely to die as one who does not get ADT.",

      "Content": "I am 71 and had a robotic assisted radical prostatectomy done in late August this year. The recovery was 100% non-eventful. I was up walking in 8-hours, home from the hospital in 36-hours, and walking miles around the neighborhood in 3-days. Seven weeks after the surgery the robot man told me I could resume all normal activities including sailing my 40' boat and riding my very stiff carbon fiber bicycle with a small hard saddle. It is now 10+ weeks since the surgery and I feel as if it never happened. I spent the last three days digging up the irrigation/sprinkler system in our yard and other than being a little tired and sore in the evening, I don't feel any effects from the surgery. At least for me - surgery in my early '70s was not problem. The wild fluctuations in the PSA score are quite unusual. Is EVERY PSA test done at the same lab using the same equipment? If not - then comparing those numbers is less than useful. My PSA fluctuated quite a bit (+ and - 25% of so) over a period of 4-years but never like your husband's. When I had PSA scores in the 4 to 5 range at ages 63 to 66 I dismissed them as not important and thus delayed my treatment by a couple years. That delay will probably lead to the eventual need to have radiation therapy at some point in the next five-years.",

      "Content": "But the authors do say: Although we acknowledge that a prognostic study design is not the appropriate study design to investigate the therapeutic effect of a certain treatment, it shows that not all patients with BCR are equal in outcome and therefore should not receive the same treatment. As an example, if a PSA rise of >0.2 ng/ml is confirmed in a patient after primary RP, the pGS is <=7, and if PSA kinetics are favorable (PSA-DT >12 mo, IBF >18 mo), patients should be informed that they have low-risk BCR and the potential toxicities of additional treatments should be discussed to allow the patient to make a well-informed decision. Which, to me at least, implies the patient should be carefully notified of the tradeoff between Low Risk of future clinical symptoms of PCa and the known toxicities of SRT. If the authors did not want the patient to consider delay or non-treatment, then why would they want the patient and treatment team to discuss the topic?",

The pre-surgery Gleason score, PSA, biopsy findings, MRI findings tell me the likelihood there is malignant tissue outside the prostate tissue and I excise tissue based on that information. Frozen sections don't really provide any more useful information.\" In my case I ended up with a 2mm G6 focal positive margin at the apex. The surgeon did not want to dig any deeper there in the hope of saving some function. Post surgery he told me the tissue did not appear dangerous and he felt my quality of life outweighed the very small likelihood that positive margin would lead to future PCa extensions. However, (isn't there always?), during his post surgery pathology review appointment with me he also said \"Due to the positive surgical margin I suspect there will be radiotherapy in your future.\" Only time will tell which of his assessments was correct.",

What a wealth of information! London & Melbourne Study - 196 biopsies on men with PI-RADS 3 - 70% found to have some cancer on biopsy - 27% Gleason (3 + 4) - 2% Gleason (4 + 3) - 2% Gleason 8 Doesn't seem encouraging...BUT... (my favorite word in Statistics) ~ 9% of Men with NO lesion on MRI had Gleason (3 + 4) on biopsy (so how did they get a PIRADS 3 score?) ~37% of Men with 1 lesion on MRI had Gleason (3 + 4) on biopsy ~56% of Men with 2 or lesions on MRI had Gleason (3 + 4) on biopsy So - it appears a biopsy is in my future!",

      "Content": "My urologist is on vacation for July so would appreciate any observations you can make. 3T mpMRI with Dotarem IV contrast (to provide Dynamic Contrast Enhancement - DCE) on June 28. Following are quotes from the printed report I received today. Findings: 18cc prostate Subtle area of T2 signal hypointensity and mild restricted diffusion at apical posterolateral PZ measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm Remainder of gland is unremarkable Capsule intact Impression: 18cc volume with an Equivocal 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm left posterolateral PZ and apical lesion. No exttracapsular disease PI-RADS 3 INDETERMINATE I've spent a lot of time the last week learning about MRI physics, techniques, and interpretation and think I understand it fairly well, for a novice layperson. I've gone thru the American College of Radiology (ACR) PI-RADs presentation ( https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/File.../PIRADS-V2.pdf ) and have studied the PI-RADS Version 2: A Pictorial PDF published by the Genitourology Imaging publication. Update1 My Understanding of the report - I have a quite small and unremarkable prostate ( 18cc ) - only one area of possible concern measuring 0.42 cc located in peripheral zone - the area of possible concern produced a low intensity T2 signal that was not so obvious ( \"subtle\" ) - the DCE contrast fluid did not flow into the area of concern as easily or in as much volume as adjacent area, during the same sampling interval, but the diminution ( \"restricted\" ) of diffusion was limited ( \"mild\" ) - the 0.47 cc lesion can not be clearly characterized ( \"equivocal\" ) Due to the presence of a lesion of \"equivocal\" characteristics and limited diffusion (DCE) a P-RADS 3 score is given \" PI-RADS 3 = the presence of clinically significant cancer is equivocal\" is the definition found in the ACR presentation IF there had been extensive DCE diffusion in the lesion the score would have been a PI-RADS 4. I am inclined to see this report as good news. - relatively small lesion ( < 0.5cc) - subtle hypointensity - mild restricted diffusion - no clear indication of malignancy Will my urologist, who seems to be quite conservative (tries not to) about ordering a biopsy, order one for me when I see him late in July? Maybe the 4KScore results will now play a larger part in the biopsy decision. OR - am I just being too optimistic in my interpretation of a PI-RADS 3 score and trying to see only the plus side?",

      "Content": "RALP began 10:15 AM -wife met me recovery at 12:15 PM. Moved to private room 1:O0 PM. Very little discomfort as of 7:30 PM with NO pain meds so far. The only serious pain is a heavy ache in right side when I laugh! How bad can it be when laughter is my big complaint? Right side is where they put a larger hole just above the liver to extract the prostate. About 3PM I experienced some heavy pain that was about a nine out of 10 for 20 to 30 minutes. It turned out to be a blood clot in the catheter that was preventing urine from flowing and the bladder had filled up. I have many bits of plumbing coming and going from arms, hands, belly, and other personal items. The RN used one of those special ports and plumbing loops to flush the blood clot and within 10 minutes all of the pain was gone. The hospital staff wanted me on a liquid diet this evening but my surgeon came in at 4 PM to check on me and said I could have A full dinner. So I was able to eat a wonderful hospital prepared chicken breast, mashed potatoes, green beings, and cooked carrots. The only annoying part of the process so far has been my extreme dry mouth. Since 1 PM I have drunk over a gallon of freshwater and had two IV bags run through me but my mouth still feels like it is full of desert sand. I just ate 4 ounces of very nice cold vanilla ice cream and that seems to have cured much of the dry mouth. I am not allowed ice cream at home per my wife/nutritionist but she had sympathy for me here and let me have a treat! I\u2019m lying here in bed very comfortable and in far less pain than after a normal hard afternoon on the bicycle. The nursing staff is overly busy but says they will take me for my first walk sometime later this evening. I\u2019m looking forward to the walk because I feel so good I want to get up and do something. You guys who are wondering about radical prostatectomy, mine was robot assisted, should not worry about any of the immediate surgery or post immediate post surgery issues if my situation is typical. I sure hope I am not jinxing my short term recovery by talking about my incredible lack of problems and pain but I did want to share this with those of you who are concerned about RALP procedure. The surgeon was very optimistic - he said he completely spared the right-hand nerve bundle and felt he did not do too much damage to the left hand nerve bundle and did no damage at all to the necessary arteries and veins.",

Of the patients in this group with negative biopsy results, 22% were subsequently diagnosed as prostate cancer. The median patient age, PSA level, prostate volume and PSA density were 69 years, 7.5 ng/mL, 28.7 mL, and 0.26 ng/mL/mL, respectively. The biopsy results were benign, clinically insignificant, and clinically significant prostate cancer in 129 (45%), 18 (6%) and 141 (49%) patients, respectively. My PSA is 30% higher than average and PSA Density almost twice their average. Maybe I can grow a bigger prostate in the short term to get that PSAD down?",

      "Content": "My wife had an appointment today with our PCP / Internist, which I attended. After the doc wrote the Rx for my wife she turned to me and said - \"Your PSA could not have been better.\" She then checked her computer and handed me a slip of paper with 0.021 written on it. My 6-week follow up appointment with my surgeon is next Tuesday, Oct 9 but my PCP was copied on the PSA lab results from my blood draw yesterday and she knew I would be anxiously waiting for the results. I asked her to confirm the 0.021 and she looked again at the lab report to confirm them. She did say \"you could not hope for better results at 6-weeks!\" I AM concerned because I had to call my surgeon on Monday morning to ask them to fax the PSA test request to my local lab. At that time I asked the surgeons front desk person if it would be µPSA test and she replied \"Yes - it will be a standard PSA test.\" I am not sure how my local lab could have sent the blood to Lab Corp or Quest mid-day Tuesday (blood draw was 11 AM Tuesday) and the results be back to my PCP by 2 PM Wednesday. UPDATE: Just talked to my surgeon's PA who confirmed it was a 3-digit µPSA test with a 0.021 result.",

      "Content": "RALP Surgery scheduled for tomorrow (August 23) at 10:00 AM if I believe the surgeons nurse or 10:30 AM if I believe the surgery scheduling nurse at the hospital. I need to check-in at 8:45 (hospital statement) or 8:00 AM (surgeon statement). Why trying to determine the schedule the surgeon nurse casually mentioned: \"Oh - we have not received the EKG, Chest X-Ray, blood work clearance from your GP. If we don't receive that information within 2-hours (90-minutes as of this writing) the surgery will be cancelled. I've talked to your GP's nurse three times and each time she says she will send the information immediately. \" I immediately called my GP but am not allowed to talk to doctor or nurse. Left message with front desk who said someone will call me back. My GP's nurse just called and says my RALP surgeon has never talked to them and has never requested a medical clearance. She is not sure she can get the FAX sent this afternoon. She is now calling the RALP office. And, now I find that the RALP \"First Assistant\" (RNFA) will not accept assignment from Medicare. But, I am supposed to get a form from my RALP surgeon guaranteeing the RNFA will only bill me $250, of which Medicare and Blue Shield Supplemental will pay NOTHING! And, being new to SW Florida we did not know that Ft Myers has a morning rush hour and I need to plan an EXTRA hour on the freeway so our normally 75-minute drive may take up to 2.5 hours. I hate to get up in the morning but I guess we need to plan on leaving the house before 6 AM. Pre-surgery jitters are not diminished by this stuff!",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Another Is there a study that defines the overtreatment concern? Do we really know? A partial answer (copied from a post I made elsewhere): A 2013 study, published in Molecular and Clinical Oncology, followed 200 RP patients for a median of 52-months to monitor their µPSA values and post surgery progression toward biochemical recurrence (BCR), which was defined as two consecutive PSA tests with a value > 0.2 ng/ml. 94% of the patients (183) with a PSA nadir of < 0.008 had not experienced BCR at a median followup time of 52-months. Sixtysix (66) of those patients who reached a nadir of <0.008 subsequently progressed to have a PSA > 0.008 4+ year followup. Thirtythree (33) of those 66 patients never exceeded a PSA value of 0.05 in the 52-month followup. That means almost 52% of the patients whose PSA value rose above the 0.008 nadir never exceeded 0.05, which is only 1/4 of the definition of BCR. The author's characterized those 33-patients as having a PSA transition pattern of \"peaking out.\" Their pathology characteristics are not real great. 46% of them were T3 or greater, 30% were G8 or greater, and 21% had positive surgical margins. That says to me that we can start with a very low PSA value post surgery and show some significant increase in the PSA values while not coming close to BCR (PSA > 0.2 twice) in over 4-years. I have read some other studies looking at progression toward BCR but have not yet found them. Your question is always in the forefront of my PCa thoughts!",

The local Uro knows I have been to CC and who I have seen at CC when I arrive today for a some urinary issues and a consultation. He does a very good job explaining things lasting about an hour. I ask hm what he believed the odds of cure with surgery. The value given was 2x what I expected him to say based on my research. To some extent I believe I was getting a sales job. What are your experiances? My Medical Oncologist/Urologist with 25+years experience and over 1,000 prostatectomies under his hands, before he quit doing surgery, refused to cite any \"CURE\" numbers. Every time I or my wife asked he insisted there is no CURE - there are just increasingly less frequent PSA tests after a prostatectomy and an increasing probability I will die from something other than PCa as I get older and time goes by after the surgery. He explained that many of his long time surgery patients do eventually experience biochemical recurrence but it is of little concern as they age. He reminded me that the median time from the 2nd occurrence of a 0.2 PSA test, post surgery, to the onset of metastatic disease symptoms is over eight years and the median time to death is another five years. Have you plugged your numbers into the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) nomogram for pre-radicial prostatecotmy patients? I assumed you were 65-years old and had a T1c clinical stage given your biopsy results. That nomogram gives you a 99% chance of NOT dying from PCa in 10-years and 98% in 15-years. It also calculates a 50% chance of NO biochemical recurrence (MSK BCR is 0.05 ng/ml or greater) in 5-years and only a 34% chance of NO recurrence in 10-years. Please consider that many oncologists will not recommend Salvage Radiation Therapy (SRT) until you have two consecutive PSA >0.2 tests. If your PSA gets to 0.05 MSK considers it BCR, BUT, if your PSA increases at .02 per year you'd have 7 more years until SRT might be necessary. So - what do you consider to be a definition of CURE relative to your situation? How do those numbers compare to what the clinic or your doctor reported? The MKS nomogram also provides the odds of the cancer: - being organ confined - extra capsular extension - lymph node involvement - seminal vesicle invasion",

      "Content": "During my 2nd discussion with my urologist about \"what to do if PSA keeps increasing but we find NO PCa on the biopsy\" he clearly stated: \"I've many patients who are LEAKERS - they have abnormally high PSA values and we never find any lesion, tumor, or non-normal cells in their biopsies. Some men just secrete larger than normal amounts of PSA into their blood stream. We don't know why that happens nor do we know what it means. But, I'm comfortable with just conservatively monitoring their status. I've never had a single one suddenly develop an aggressive PCa and I've never had one who suffered any negative consequences of just tracking the PSA and doing a biopsy every couple years..\" OTH - he did order a 3T mpMRI and 4KScore for me to help determine IF I need a biopsy. He is a strong advocate of using the 3T MRI images, annotated by the radiologist, to guide the sample needles when doing a TRUS 12-core biopsy. He claims to find more than 90% of the PCa lesions with those guided biopsies. He is 52-years old and has been a board certified urologist for 22-year. He claims many thousands of biopsies and \"never a lost soul due to suddenly aggressive PCa he missed by taking a conservative, non-invasive path when appropriate.\" I asked several more questions about leakers with high PSA counts and how to live with the uncertainty. He again stressed \"trust me - I've seen a lot of men with and without PCa and we'll make sure you are well cared for\"",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Duck2 ... Personally see about zero chance of negative margins. Staging for last Urologist was T2B. .... Q. Am I too pesimistic on hopes of negative margins? I too obsessed over surgical margins and have read everything I can find about them. And, have played endlessly with nomograms which incorporate surgical margins as they predict biochemical failure, disease progression, and life expectancy. As with almost every thing else I have learned about PCa since my initial PSA=9.2 in May 2018 - the more I learn the less I know. Current research about the interpretation of surgical margins and their prognostic value after an RP is confusing and inconsistent. For Example (the following use my specific pathology reports and assume 12-months post RP progression from 0.02 ng/ML to 0.2 ngl/ml PSA). the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MKS) nomograms: - Death due to PCa post RP with NO additional therapy gives the SAME probability of death due to PCa at 5 - 10 - 15 years (4% - 13% - 20%) when I tell it there were surgical margins and then tell it there were NO surgical margins. https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/pros...cal_recurrence - Probability of NO additional PCa progression for 6-years following a PSA = 0.2 a year (12-months) following RP is 71% when there are surgical margins present and only 61% when NO surgical margins were present https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/pros...iation_therapy - Probability of NO future Biochemical Recurrence in 2 - 5 - 7 - 10 years is 88% - 69% - 61% - 52% with surgical margins and extraprostatic extension - Probability of NO future Biochemical Recurrence in 2 - 5 - 7 - 10 years is 94% - 85% - 80% - 74% with NO surgical margins and extraprostatic extension and just to show how much those BCR free progression numbers depend on other factors - here they are for SM+ EPE- and SM- EPE- - Probability of NO future Biochemical Recurrence in 2 - 5 - 7 - 10 years is 90% - 79% - 73% - 65% with surgical margins and NO extraprostatic extension - Probability of NO future Biochemical Recurrence in 2 - 5 - 7 - 10 years is 96% - 91% - 87% - 83% with NO surgical margins and NO extraprostatic extension AND Of course - the probability of DEATH from PCa within 15-years varies from 1% to 2% with changes to Surgical Margin and Extraprostatic Extensions. https://www.mskcc.org/nomograms/prostate/post_op A recent research project concerning the prognostic value of biochemical recurrence said the following about surgical margins: \"Positive surgical margin. For patients who underwent RP, two out of eight studies showed an inverse relationship with DM (ie, \u201ca protective effect\u201d) and none of the eight studies investigating PCSM as an outcome showed a significant correlation\" All the details are in the thread: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...c-Value-of-BCR I have now decided that the only thing I can do for the next ten or so years is monitor my PSA and prepare a mental plan for dealing with an increasing PSA value - IF it were to occur. Trying to read tea leaves, or surgical pathology reports does not help me prepare for the 50% probability I will experience biochemical recurrence in the next 15-years so I am trying to learn to live PSA test to PSA test. One last thought- the more I learn post RP and the more I talk with my medical oncologist - the more importance genomics / genetic testing is coming to play in my thinking and decision making process. PSA dynamics describes what is currently happening and genetics gives me the most possible information about where that PSA change may ( will ?? ) take me in the subsequent years.",

      "Content": "I am now a Biopsy Evangelist singing the praise of the life saving diagnostic tool! Here is a practical example showing how much fairly serious cancerous tissue can be missed with a 3T mpMRI. June 28 3TmpMRI with Dotarem contrast. The images were read by a very experienced radiologist who has done thousands of MRI studies for my urologist: \"There is a subtle area of T2 signal hypointensity and mild restricted diffusion at the apical left posterolateral peripheral zone measuring 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.7 cm. REMAINDER OF THE GLAND IS UNREMARKABLE. Capsule is intact.\" Capitalization is mine for emphasis. That meant, IMHO, that only 0.42cc of my 18cc prostate contained cancerous tissue. The August 3 TRUS 12-Core biopsy found that ALL 6-cores (Every one!) from the left lobe contained Gleason 6 or Gleason 7 cells. A 1.4cm core was 100% Gleason 7, a 2.0 cm core ws 60% Gleason 7, and a 1.8 cm core was 20% Gleason 7. The ENTIRE tumor identified by the MRI was only 1cm long and ~0.6cm in the other dimensions. Yet two of the Gleason 7 samples had far more than 1cm of cancerous tissue! The 100% and 60% Gleason 7 cores were from the tumor identified by the MRI but the other 20% Gleason 7 core was from an area the MRI displayed as not abnormal. ALL Gleason 6 cores (3 total) were from areas in the prostate that the radiologist noted as \"unremarkable.\" I am very happy that my urologist did a Free PSA and 4KScore blood test in order to give me more evidence to convince myself that a biopsy was necessary. I had read studies, and the urologist warned me before the MRI, that some big percentage ( more than 50% ?) of low and intermediate grade tumors can be missed in a 3T mpMRI. The significance of that warning was not apparent last month when it seemed I had only a \"tiny\" 0.3cm area of concern. Now, I can more fully appreciate the problem of missed low and intermediate grade tissue. Two months ago I was a biopsy sceptic, my many forum comments from May and June now embarass me, but am now a proud supporter of the Another approach to biopsies: Git 'er done Stupid!",

      "Content": "I hope my providing the following summary is OK - it is exciting for me to read about these wonderful new ideas that will stop the growth of PCa without surgery or radiation. Thanks to Todd1963 and the great article about his treatments that led me to start exploring this new and ongoing research. Summarized in MedicalXpress (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-...te-cancer.html) Quotes are from Professor Fahri Saatcioglu at University of Oslo's Department of Biosciences who heads the research team publishing in Nature Communications. \"We think that what we found is really exciting. We have shown that a new small molecule drug called MKC8866 has very good effect on the growth of prostate cancer cells both in cell culture and in animal experiments, and we are already planning clinical trials with humans. We expect these trials to be carried out in Scandinavia and Western Europe,\" \"Now we have used MKC8866, which was developed for other purposes, and shown that it inhibits the signal pathway and oncoprotein activation. Thus, it also inhibits the growth of prostate cancer tumors both in vitro\u2014cell culture\u2014and in vivo\u2014in mouse prostate cancer models,...\" This progress is a result of basic and translational research that has been going on for about 10 years,\" Translation research is a type of medical research that aims to translate knowledge from basic research into practical application in patient treatment. \"There is a lot of effort by many people internationally over many years that is behind these findings. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the students, employees and partners who have participated in various parts of this and the organizations that have supported us financially. If we succeed in the clinical trials, and I think we have good chances, we can have a new medicine developed in about five or six years,\" A little more background: \"All cells in the body can experience different forms of stress from time to time, and the cancer cells are under extra stress because they have to grow fast while having trouble getting enough oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, the cancer cells \"hijack\" the normal cells' stress response mechanisms and use these for their own benefit to survive. We have found a way to block this 'hijacking' and thus the cancer cells can no longer cope. So they die,\" Detailed in Nature Communications (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-08152-3) ABSTRACT Activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been linked to cancer, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and there is a paucity of reagents to translate this for cancer therapy. Here, we report that an IRE1α RNase-specific inhibitor, MKC8866, strongly inhibits prostate cancer (PCa) tumor growth as monotherapy in multiple preclinical models in mice and shows synergistic antitumor effects with current PCa drugs. Interestingly, global transcriptomic analysis reveal that IRE1α-XBP1s pathway activity is required for c-MYC signaling, one of the most highly activated oncogenic pathways in PCa. XBP1s is necessary for optimal c-MYC mRNA and protein expression, establishing, for the first time, a direct link between UPR and oncogene activation. In addition, an XBP1-specific gene expression signature is strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Our data establish IRE1α-XBP1s signaling as a central pathway in PCa and indicate that its targeting may offer novel treatment strategies. Critically, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of MKC8866-treated or XBP1 knockdown PCa cells revealed that IRE1α-XBP1s is essential for c-MYC signaling, a central oncogenic regulatory pathway in PCa12,13. These results establish IRE1α-XBP1s signaling as a potential target for alternative treatment strategies for PCa.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Fairwind Have you absolutely ruled out surgery as an option ? Is there some reason surgery is not an option for you ? RALP is currently my chosen treatment. I meet with the RALP operator tomorrow afternoon (Monday Aug 13). I got the order to proceed to immediate treatment on Friday afternoon (Aug 10). My wife, my urologist, and I spent an hour discussing my PCa and treatment options. At that time I verbally committed to RALP - get the bad stuff out, get the PSA to 0, and don't look back. I am still holding to that commitment. But, I have been frantically studying the many measures of survival and side effects for external and internal radiation just to make sure I carefully and objectively consider all the options. Some of those options would take me out of town - thus this question. The more I study the more it seems that external radiation (various forms) and RALP are pretty much equal in the various measures of survival out to 15 or so years. The side effects seem to break down as follows: RALP - Side effects begin at treatment, are well known, and will probably not change in the future RT - Few immediate side effects, are less clearly established, and will probably increase over time.",

      "Content": "EXACTLY My experience: \"Once it's out, expect it to take 3 to 6 months to recover \"full\" urinary continence. I say \"full\" because there will always be a bit of stress leakage when you stress your abdomens doing something. Measure progress week by week, not day by day as some days will be better than others. The first thing to come back is staying dry overnight. The next thing is staying dry while doing normal daily activities. The last thing to improve is leakage doing things that compress or stress the abdomen.\" In 3-days (Dec 23) I will be 4-months post-RALP. My Depends now stay almost bone dry 11 PM to 11AM. But, as soon as I start doing any activity requiring bending or pressing on my abdomen - I dribble or leak a bit. Hard work, e.g. yesterday afternoon replacing five landscape light bulbs that required bending and digging, will cause me to leak a ounce or two per hour. Another funny one is dishwashing or teethbrushing. If I lean forward against the counter and let it press into my abdomen - leaky/leaky. Don't let the bad/leaky hours or days disturb you as you progress. Four or five weeks ago - After I started being bone (not yet!) dry all night I thought my pad wearing days were over. I then went thru several afternoons reversion to leaking several ounces per hour followed by 12 or more hours of no dribbles. That was very frustrating but I now understand that the periods of extreme leakage become less and less frequent. For me at this point - it has been five-days since I leaked more than an ounce an hour, and that occurred while working under/over the car while installing new driving lights. I am a numbers guy so six-weeks post RALP I bought a nice digital scale that can accurately measure 0.1 fl oz up to 32-fl oz (by weight). I have weighed every pad and Depends since them and plot the ounces/hour number over time. I also plot the trend line. It is reassuring to a geeky statistician to see the trend line headed downward and the 90-percentile line (90% of previous 20 pads) trending downward at even a steeper rate. And, those 2-ounce per hour peak leaks are becoming less and less evident. I expect to be almost completely continent, except for sever bending, pressing and lifting before the Super Bowl and am pretty sure I will be almost completely dry under all conditions by Easter.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Good luck OTS! Keep in mind that the above guidelines to NOT apply to you today! At time of surgery, your PSA was likely > 4x normal. With a 1/2 Life of approx 3 days, your PSA level might not yet be < 0.03ng/ml. If not today, may your 3 month post RP PSA be < 0.03ng/ml! MF My surgeon said he does not do a µPSA at 6-weeks. He will decide later about the µPSA at 3-months. 10.2 PSA at time of surgery 0.5^9*10.2=~0.02 9 (half lifes) x 3-days (half life of PSA) is about 27 or so days. Today was 40-days so I am really hoping to see <0.1 when I get the results Friday or Monday. My appointment with the surgeon is Oct 9. I read and read about the Zero Club but did not really understand the significance of membership until about 3-weeks after the RALP and I began to appreciate how much my short term future depends on that <0.1. Now I do so hope I qualify for at least a short term membership!",

Prostatomegaly is a term used to generally describe enlargement of the prostate gland from whatever cause. Usually the prostate is considered enlarged on imaging when it measures beyond 30 cc (30 grams) in size. \" Yet the MRI and TRUS biopsy stated I had an 18cc prostate and my urologist (with 26-years experience) initially noted \"a quite small and soft prostate\" after the very intense DRE. HOW can there be two such different measurements of the prostate size? One of the key reasons I was promptly moved to surgery was the PSA density of .58 ng/ml/ml but the CT scan would cut that value almost in half. The CT scan report does not change anything but I am curious about the different estimates of size.",

My subjective impression is the MO wants to prepare me mentally/psychologically for the future need to make some decisions and he is trying to make me think now, while I have time and little pressure, about choices in the future. During our detailed discussion I felt like he was not totally committed to the need for SRT but wanted me to know it might be a hard choice in the future. Additionally, his attitude / experience with SRT seemed to me to be \"minimal side effects and minimal long term consequences\" so WHY NOT do SRT at some point just to be sure of a cure? He did say \"you chose surgery and the side effects. You are young (??) and healthy so why wouldn't you want to take the next step of SRT to ensure a positive and life long good outcome?\" I did not feel any pressure from him to choose now. He did stress that things move slowly at this stage and waiting to begin SRT is a perfectly reasonable choice. SO - just to continue my \"It is a life time journey with many twists and turns\" - it appears to be more twisted now than before. But, I've accepted the uncertainty and can happily wait 3 - 6 - 12 months to see what I next need to do.",

Next test scheduled for January 19, 2019 which will be five months post surgery and will again be a 3-digit µPSA test done by Lab Corp. The info above is per my surgeon who has done more than 1,600 RALPs in the last 15-years. His card says Urologist/Oncologist and his practice is part of 21st Century Oncology corporation. My medical urologist/oncologist wants me to have an µPSA test in early December because he wants that 3-month number, which is becoming the standard for prognostic information. The medical onocologist, (who has done thousands of open prostatectomies since 1996 but quit doing surgery when RALP became so popular) is my original diagnostician and will become my go to guy for any additional PCa diagnosis and treatment. His practice is also part of the 21st Century Oncology corporation. SO - both doc's have the same intent to use a µPSA (3-digit) test but different ideas about intervals. Their primary concern is my positive surgical margin and extra prostatetic extension. They both expect BCR within 4-years.",

      "Content": "Fourth post-RALP appointment with Medical Oncologist 30-weeks after surgery PSA prior to RALP 10.2 up from 9.2 3-months earlier RALP August 23, 2018 Focal EPE and Focal SM+ G7 (3+4) Lab Corp µPSA 0.021 at 6-weeks 0.018 at 18-weeks 0.022 at 30-weeks Surgeon at 10-days post-RALP told me radiation therapy would be \"required within 6-months\" due to EPE and SM+ Surgeon at 6-weeks postponed SRT until PSA shows a consistent rise but to \"expect it within 6-months\" MO at 18-weeks said there was \"no need to consider SRT until PSA shows consistent rise over 3-months\" MO at 30-weeks (April 10, 2019) \"plan on SRT before end of 2019\" Details that led MO to plan for SRT within a year: EPE (even if it is FOCAL and G6) SM+ (even if it is 2mm FOCAL G6) µPSA increase from 0.018 to 0.022 in 3-months There is no reason the PSA should increase IF ALL the PCa cells were removed. But, the confusing factor is \"psuedo-PSA\" or \"PSA-analogue\" produced by cells in the urethra. At the 0.00x PSA level it is possible to detect the analogue version of the PSA. However, there is NO reason the amount of analogue will increase over time. The 0.004 INCREASE in my µPSA is indicative of some remaining PCa tissue. We will wait 3-months and get another µPSA test. I asked about the 6-week 0.021 PSA value and the fact that the 30-week value (0.022) has just returned to the 6-week value. The MO answer was that PSA has a 6-week half-life and the 0.021 could have been remaining from prior to the RALP. The 18-week decrease to 0.018 would indicate that at least some of the 0.021 was \"old\" PSA. The 30-week rise/increase should not occur if all the PCa was removed. I asked about standard error of measurement for µPSA and he told me Lab Corp does not provide that information. And, it doesn't really matter because he cares about the TREND rather than the absolute value. I tried to pin him down to numbers and he refused to play. He ordered another 3-month µPSA test. If the July 2019 test shows any increase above 0.022 it almost certainly means I will experience SRT in the not distant future. But, as to actual initiation of SRT - there is no rush so if the July test shows a small increase (0.005 or less?) he would probably wait another 3-months. But, his experience is that, even at the µPSA levels, three consecutive increases, even in the third digit (0.00X) inevitably leads to BCR and the need for SRT- \"You have no remaining non-cancerous tissue, which can increase the amount of PSA over time so any consistent increase in the PSA level, no matter how small, must be from PCa tissue that was missed during the surgery\" He wants to wait until at least 10-months post-RALP because a 71-year old needs 9-months healing time to recover from the RALP. He does not want to irradiate tissue that is still healing because it leads to strictures and fibrous growth. The longer I wait post surgery - the fewer SRT side effects I will experience. Whatever level of continence (almost 100% dry except when playing pickleball - my opponents \"piss me off\") and sexual function (semi-firm) will be retained if the SRT begins after 10-months post-RALP. He says the Radiation Oncologist will make all the decisions about type of SRT and imaging prior to radiation. But, his experience, (the MO and RO work for the same national practice 21st Century Oncology), is that no high tech imaging will be done if we start SRT at PSA <0.05 because none of it can detect metastasizes at such a low level. The MO did also say that SRT technology is progressing at a very rapid pace and the longer I can wait the better the results and fewer the side effects. Asked him about ADT or any other hormone or chemical treatment prior to or with the SRT and he was quite definite - NO- NONE! My G7 (3+4) and small focal EPE & SM are not indicative of the need for anything in addition to SRT. The radiation therapy will almost certainly be a near cure or provide me enough time to die from anything other than PCa. Bottom Line for me is that SRT is inevitable but I want to delay it as long as possible.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Maldonado57 Has anyone tried the 4K Score blood test as an alternative to having a prostate biopsy? YES and it quickly CONFIRMED the need for a biopsy! You can see my path from not knowing how to spell prostate in mid-May 2018 to a RALP in late August. My medical urologist/oncologist insisted I have the 4KScore test done in mid-June after my PSA went from 9.2 May 18 to 10.2 June 18. He knew the 4KScore results would be the last test I needed to convince me that a biopsy was needed NOW! 4KScore showed a 34% (1 in 3) chance of clinically significant cancer and sure enough the August 3 biopsy found 3 of 12 samples at G6 and 3 at G7 (3+4). PLEASE NOTE: As late as July 20 I was still resisting the idea of a biopsy for all the typical but wrong reasons. The 3T mpMRI gave me hope the biopsy would not be needed but the 4KScore and the PSA Density (.57 ng/ml/ml) was enough to push me into the biopsy room. And...the RALP pathology report confirmed that the surgery was necessary and should have been done several years earlier.",

      "Content": "I can identify with your anguish and understand the overwhelming sense of \"what happened and what do I do now?\" After years of watching my PSA move around and choosing each time to \"wait for more information\" - this spring my PSA jumped to 9.2 and then 10.2 the next month. I've had more tests and a 3T mpMRI to confirm the presence of a quite small \"equivocal\" tumor in my prostate. My biopsy will be on Friday August 3. When I started posting here in late May, in much the same mental state you seem to be, I found the forum to be very informative and helped me gain some degree of relaxation and peace of mind. You will hear from a lot of very knowledgeable men who have a lot of important experience. My urologist, 26-years in practice with a state of the art diagnostic and treatment facility, urged me to remember that nothing moves rapidly in the world of prostate cancer. He cautioned me to take my time and learn as much as I could. He is also adamant, very outspoken, that many, a high percentage, of men with prostate cancer are over treated. He has been treating prostate cancers for several decades and he is convinced that his fellow practitioners are far to eager to cut and irradiate. He is a both a board certified surgeon (one fellowship) and a board certified urologist (different fellowship), but he is apparently opposed to surgery except in dire circumstances. He wants to do my biopsy 'cause my 4KScore, which he recommended, says I have a 34% chance of a significant cancer despite his knowing the tumor is very small. Then, he wants to get genetic tests on the tumor samples, IF (Big IF!), the pathologist sees any undifferentiated cells. Then (IF a Gleason 7 or more), he wants to take OUR time to discuss the treatment options. He stressed we have plenty of time to make an informed decision that is specific to my health, life expectancy, and my wife's wishes. At all three appointments I've had since early June he has reassured me that \"I've never lost a patient to prostate cancer by waiting, being thoughtful, and being conservative while trying to minimize the impact of treatment\" SO - I would not rush off to that surgeon just yet",

      "Content": "There are many statistics about PCa progression after biochemical recurrence (BCR). But, let's just use the simple ones found in the Johns Hopkins research paper about the Natural History of BCR after prostatectomy and with no additional hormonal therapy. At 5.3 years post surgery 15% of men had BCR (PSA > 0.2ng/ml) The median (half the times were less and half were more) time to BCR was 2.3 years Eventually 1/3 of those men developed metastatic disease (About 1 in 20 of the original study group of prostatectomy patients) The Median time to metastatic disease symptoms was 8-years About half (actually 44%) of men with metastatic disease died from the disease (About 1 in 40 of the original study group of prostatectomy patients) The Median time to metastatic disease death was 5-years AFTER development of symptoms (About 13-years after initial PSA > 0.2) As others have mentioned - your life expectancy and Quality of Life is critical in the SRT / ADT / HT Yes or No? decision making process. All the the life expectancy calculators I've used give me at least another 20-years and I expect them to be good years. My father and I went for a 3-mile hike in the Everglades on his 89th birthday and he felt great doing it. SO - for me it seems I should do everything possible to fight the renewed growth of PCa IF I experience BCR. The recent post describing two brother's current SRT and HT therapy with few side effects has been very encouraging for me. They make it sound like SRT & HT can be experienced with a minimal degree of suffering and long term effects. Yet another reason to plan on additional treatment if BCR does occur. Several surviving partners of men who died from Metatstatic Prostatic Cancer disease have posted threads here describing the last two years of their partners journey to death. It sounds like a horrible way to die and is also very hard on the surviving family. I've promised my wife, 8-years younger than me and from a family where all the women live to be older than 95, I will outlive her. Thus I have a strong incentive to submit to whatever additional treatment I need to delay or deny PCa return. I've written several more detailed threads about BCR and prognosis, which summarize much of the research I've found. Here is one link: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...t-RP-prognosis",

      "Content": "Saved by the e-mail! Hospital nurse who schedules surgery called to say she would have to cancel the surgery due to lack of paperwork for medical clearance. I asked for her FAX number and another 10-minutes to call my GP and have the stuff faxed directly to the hospital. She gave me her FAX number and then said \"Oh - wait - here is an e-mail from your surgeon\" That e-mail did contain all the necessary clearances. But, they have now moved the check-in up to 7:45 AM and she said to plan on a 3-hour drive at that time of morning. That makes no sense because if we leave home at 5:30 AM we will be thru all the bottlenecks by 6:30 AM. The first 20-miles of the drive is on wide open I-75 (85 mph) in the wilderness of SE Charlotte County where there is no on/off ramp for 14-miles. A nearby suites hotel will give us a good rate but my wife has decided we should leave at 5:30 AM and make the best of it. The scheduling nurse did say that if I called her at 7:45 AM and said \"I am on I-75 10-miles north of the hospital she would allow me until 8:15 AM.\" I am pre-registered and they have all the insurance, emergency contact, etc so getting there 90-minutes before surgery could work.

      "Content": "One more update to help those considering RALP understand the short term effects / life after RALP. RALP 10:15 AM - 12:15 PM Thursday and it is now noon Saturday. I left the hospital at 4 PM Friday and drove myself 61-miles home. I know that is not recommended but I had had no pain medications and felt like I had a clear head. I had taken three longish walks in the 12-hours prior to leaving. And, we were experiencing a monumental tropical downpour and lightning storm. My wife has only driven our new car one time previously and really hates to drive on the freeway in rush hour traffic, let alone in blinding rain. And, she was totally freaked out because two lightning bolts had hit trees in the parking lot while she was trying to find the car. The main point is that driving a nice new automatic auto with a catheter and bag is no big deal. Fatigue, and overwhelming desire to just lie down and stay still is the main way to describe my current situation. I went to bed last night at midnight and did not move again, literally not a muscle, until I convinced myself to get up at 10 AM. This morning I struggled to the kitchen and made two cups of very strong Starbucks Sumatra. It is only five steps from the coffee pot to the recliner in front of the 72\" TV but, once I settled in the chair with the first cup, it was just way too hard to stand up again and get the 2nd cup. No pain, little discomfort but WAY TOO much effort was required to lift my self out of that nice electric recliner! After 20-minutes contemplation I was able to standup and get that 2nd cup and a couple peanut M&Ms. I was a bit over optimistic about the lack of gas pains and the benefit of the robots new de-gassing device. I have experienced several unpleasant gas episodes where my stomach becomes hugely swollen but walking and making loud rude noises resolves the issue. A couple of times, sitting on the toilet, I wished I had a seat belt fastened because I thought I was going to experience toilet seat liftoff! The surgeon told me he believes the sharp shoulder pains, I've now experienced it several times in both shoulders, is a \"referred pain.\" They are pretty sure the gas in the abdomen pushes up on the diaphragm which irradiates nerves and the brain interprets that nerve signal to be shoulder pain. It is disconcerting at first but quickly diminishes, especially after passing gas. The only consistent discomfort I have experienced is in the big incision in my right side near my ribs. It really pulls and is quite uncomfortable when I try to cough. Learning to deal with the catheter and bag is an experience. The small bag the nurse strapped to my leg at discharge is hard to deal with, especially in a recliner. I hooked up the big \"overnight\" bag last evening before going to bed. It has a 48\" tube and a carrying handle. I find it much easier to just carry that bag as I walk and then lay in on the floor when I sit down. The main problem with the smaller leg bag was the velcro straps the nurse used were ineffective and the bag kept dropping down my leg. That meant the tube in my penis kept getting tugged and caused leakage and a bit of pain. I've now got the long tube strapped to the thigh with that reusable elastic double sided sticky tape you get after they draw blood. Holds everything very secure and is comfortable. I was concerned about living with a catheter and bag but, as others told me, it is no big deal and convenient to not have to get up to pee every so often. Draining either bag is simple and quick. I have absolutely no appetite and have to work hard to eat stuff like yogurt, chopped fruit, and banana. I am sitting at my computer desk, banging away on the keyboard and feel almost normal, except for the fatigue.",

I now see the 2012 NO Screening recommendation as an invitation for men like me, (know it all techno-nerds), to ignore marginally bad PSA results and to convince themselves the biopsy is needless, invasive, and counter productive to a good life. My Internist in 2012 and 2013 did not press the subject and try to convince me that a 5.6 PSA at age 63 needed further investigation. She made me aware of the No Screen advice and I used that NO Screening advice to allow myself to do NO more screening for FIVE years, which resulted in a 9.2 then 10.2 PSA result.",

Like most other solid malignancies, prostate cancer can metastasize to distant organs such as the liver, lungs and brain, but it has an unusually high propensity for metastasizing to the bone. In one autopsy study, approximately 80% of the men who had died from prostate cancer possessed bone metastases. Most current treatments for individuals with bone metastases have only palliative effects, with little effect on long-term survival International Journal of Cancer June 2012",

      "Content": "RALP began 10:15 AM -wife met me recovery at 12:15 PM. Moved to private room 1:O0 PM. Very little discomfort as of 7:30 PM with NO pain meds so far. The only serious pain is a heavy ache in right side when I laugh! How bad can it be when laughter is my big complaint? Right side is where they put a larger hole just above the liver to extract the prostate. About 3PM I experienced some heavy pain that was about a nine out of 10 for 20 to 30 minutes. It turned out to be a blood clot in the catheter that was preventing urine from flowing and the bladder had filled up. I have many bits of plumbing coming and going from arms, hands, belly, and other personal items. The RN used one of those special ports and plumbing loops to flush the blood clot and within 10 minutes all of the pain was gone. The hospital staff wanted me on a liquid diet this evening but my surgeon came in at 4 PM to check on me and said I could have A full dinner. So I was able to eat a wonderful hospital prepared chicken breast, mashed potatoes, green beings, and cooked carrots. The only annoying part of the process so far has been my extreme dry mouth. Since 1 PM I have drunk over a gallon of freshwater and had two IV bags run through me but my mouth still feels like it is full of desert sand. I just ate 4 ounces of very nice cold vanilla ice cream and that seems to have cured much of the dry mouth. I am not allowed ice cream at home per my wife/nutritionist but she had sympathy for me here and let me have a treat! I\u2019m lying here in bed very comfortable and in far less pain than after a normal hard afternoon on the bicycle. The nursing staff is overly busy but says they will take me for my first walk sometime later this evening. I\u2019m looking forward to the walk because I feel so good I want to get up and do something. You guys who are wondering about radical prostatectomy, mine was robot assisted, should not worry about any of the immediate surgery or post immediate post surgery issues if my situation is typical. I sure hope I am not jinxing my short term recovery by talking about my incredible lack of problems and pain but I did want to share this with those of you who are concerned about RALP procedure.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Congrats OTS! That looks to be very good at the 6 week post RP mark! In the cog6 Thread you stated: \"10.2 PSA at time of surgery\" Did you have your PSA tested at time of surgery or are you using the 6/18 PSA: 10.2 & 8.4% Free value in your Signature? If it is the 6/18 value, that had risen from the 5/18 value. Thus your PSA at time of surgery may well have been about 12. If so, the current value looks very good at 6 weeks post. Welcome to \"Club Zero\" = the Fictitious Forum Gathering Hole somewhere out in cyberspace! MF The 10.2 PSA was measured just prior to the biopsy on August 3 and the RALP was August 23 I am now looking for the \"secret instructions\" that ensure permanent membership in Club Zero - no matter where it meets, 'cause I always want to be there.",

      "Content": "My wife and I live in a small village in SW Florida about 3-hours from Miami or Orlando, 2.5 hours from Tampa, and 5-hours from Jacksonville. Those appear to be the nearest facilities where I could receive one of the several newer and more advanced forms of radiation therapy that might be appropriate for my current PCa situation (T1c, Grade II, unfavorable intermediate). My current understanding, briefly mentioned by my urologist, is any of those treatments would involve eight or more weeks of daily (5-days a week) appointments lasting one or two hours (check in, positioning, treatment, check out...etc). The centers offering treatment are too distant to drive to on a daily basis so how does one manage their living arrangements during two or more months of such treatment? Do we rent a small efficiency apartment and move our lives there Monday thru Friday and drive home on the weekends? Do the treatment centers have some type of living facility for patients? It does appear that some of the radiation therapy might be available in either Ft Myers (an hour drive if the snowbirds are still in the North) or Naples (90 minute drive until after Thanksgiving). Is it practical to plan on 3-hours a day driving back and forth and a couple hours a day at the treatment facility? My wife likes to drive and would not mind doing so but five hours a day / 5-days a week for at least two months. Is that doable as side effects of the treatment progress? I would be very interested in any thoughts you survivors can offer. Our financial situation does allow us to take the most comfortable option but I am not sure how you move your life to another city for two months of daily medical procedures. Does that really work? A close boating friend of ours in San Diego lived in Yuma, AZ which is about 2.5 hours from San Diego or Phoenix (90 mph thru the desert!) where she could receive her radiation therapy for an aggressive throat and nasal cancer. They chose to move their lives to their boat in San Diego, just across the dock from us. I remember them spending about half their time for three months attending to appointments for checkups, treatment, other minor procedures, and yet more treatments. So, that is the basis/background for my question. From what I witnessed, and participated in as driver and support person, it would not be practical to do all the necessary things if those facilities are located more than an hour from the living location.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate OTS, Thanks for all the thoughtful research, and the confounding conclusion that \"the more I learn, the less I know\". I, and I'm sure many others have that same dilemma. I want to confirm your statement that: \"- Probability of NO additional PCa progression for 6-years following a PSA = 0.2 a year (12-months) following RP is 71% when there are surgical margins present and only 61% when NO surgical margins were present.\" Is that what you intended to write; or, I am I misinterpreting it? It seems to say that the probability of PCa progression is LESS if there are positive surgical margins at RP, than if there weren't any. Doesn't sound right to me. Indeed! That is confusing and counter-intuitive to me as well. I have tried the MKS nomograms many times and come up with the same result. I think the research I cited: \"Positive surgical margin. For patients who underwent RP, two out of eight studies showed an inverse relationship with DM (ie, \u0093a protective effect\u0094) and none of the eight studies investigating PCSM as an outcome showed a significant correlation\" is addressing the issue you raise. All I can think of at this time is that a slight rise (0.02 to 0.2) in PSA when SM+ is evident could be caused by some small amount of PCa tissue at the margin. But, if the margin is negative (SM-) then there must be some \"unknown\" of \"hidden\" PCa tissue that was not noted in the surgical pathology report and therefore leads to a less optimistic prognosis. As I said - I do a lot of reading in this area and have not found a satisfactory explanation for the result you question. My understanding of nomograms (but not the MKS ones in particular) is based on decades of professional research in the use of big data and multivariate statistics to develop predictive models for large system behavior. I can conceptualize how the MKS charts were developed and my thinking is that men with SM- develop future BCR at a higher rate independent of the other variables used in the regression equation (EPE, LNI, SVI, PSA pre/post RP, PSA-DT...).",

I had explained to the internist that a cardiologist in 2014 did an intense 2-month study of my LVH and declared it benign and not important. But, she did not include that in the medical clearance because I did not give her the report - my internist did note that my EKG was otherwise excellent - the chest X-ray was to confirm/deny the LVH - I can have the biopsy done on Monday IF I do it without the Propofol - Or I can wait for the urologist/nurse anesthesiologist review the chest X-ray and EKG on Monday the 30th and have the biopsy later in the week I (being a wimp with a lot of positive Propofol experience) chose later in the week! We'll see on Monday if I can really get the biopsy scheduled Urologist e-mailed and called to tell me that the biopsy could be delayed a month with no concern because there is no indication that whatever my little tumor is - is aggressive or fast growing.

The surgeon looked at the report for a couple minutes and said: \"well, looks like you might need radiation therapy but let's wait 6-weeks for a PSA test.\" Memorial Sloan Kettering nomogram gives me a 31% chance of BCR within 5-years, 48% chance of BCR within 10-years with NO radiation but a 98% cancer specific survival rate at 15-years with NO radiation. My whole attitude has changed dramatically since the RALP. The worry about side effects and the future no longer concern me. It is like \"I've been through the worst now, so a little radiation is no big deal and a 98% survival rate at age 86 is a big deal.\"",

      "Content": "Standing over the toilet STOPPING & STARTING my urine stream! I almost burst into tears because it was 5:30 AM, my bladder was full, my diapers dry, and I again had control! 6-days Post RP and 18-hours after having the catheter removed. Catheter out at 2 PM day 5 post RP and I leaked and dribbled all afternoon and evening. I soaked thru a pair of Depends Maxi pants in about three hours. I had no control and no feeling, no connection to penis or bladder. I was so distressed and emotionally distraught as I stood in the shower at 11 PM watching that steady drip, drip, drip from my penis. It continued no matter how I worked the muscles. There was just no connection at all between my mind, let alone brain, and the external sphincter. I put on dry Depends at midnight and put a double layer of waterproof cover on the matteress and a doubled beach towel on top of that. I then tried to go to sleep while thinking about the future of dribbling and leaking but ended up reading Walsh on Adjuvanct and Salvage radiation for several hours. Eventually I fell into a restless sleep but not before noting my Depends were still dry, which was enough to make me smile. About first light I woke with a strange sensation - \"Jeez do I have to pee!\" I carefully climbed out of bed and took the 10-steps to the toilet, dropped the Depends to find them almost totally dry,and from there it was as if a miracle had occurred. There was mind-brain-sphichter connection and I could turn the stream on and off at will. I could completely stop the stream for a few seconds then it would slowly start again. I'd let it build to full flow and clamp it off. What FUN! I suddenly remembered what it was like to be a very young boy who ran around the woods and pastures peeing on stuff (the electric fence I tried was not so much fun). Maybe the future was not going to be so grim. I write this 9-hours later knowing that I have very little control yet of the urine flow when coughing, bending, or standing too suddenly. And, I am getting a very faint \"bladder full\" signal. I have to remind myself to empty the bladder every couple hours. But, when doing that I can do three or four clamp off and restart exercises. Each time I visit the toilet I can clamp longer and stronger. I know everyone tells us to be patient with the incontinence issue but I had no idea how upsetting it would be for me, after only a few hours of NO control. I was devasted and assumed the nerves to the external sphincter had been damaged because of the amount of EPE at the left apex. Now that I know there is a clear signal path I can concentrate on strengthening the sphincter and learning to exert more careful control as I move around. My wife tells me the surgeon talked to me about incontinence after taking out the catheter. He clearly stated he had spared almost all the nerves and I should quickly regain continence but it might be a week or a month. I remember none of that conversation! Trust your surgeon - patience - and, I guess, listen to your wife.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Duck2 So I have seen a local Uro and a Cleveland Clinic Uro. The local Uro knows I have been to CC and who I have seen at CC when I arrive today for a some urinary issues and a consultation. He does a very good job explaining things lasting about an hour. I ask hm what he believed the odds of cure with surgery. The value given was 2x what I expected him to say based on my research. To some extent I believe I was getting a sales job. What are your experiances? My Medical Oncologist/Urologist with 25+years experience and over 1,000 prostatectomies under his hands, before he quit doing surgery, refused to cite any \"CURE\" numbers. Every time I or my wife asked he insisted there is no CURE - there are just increasingly less frequent PSA tests after a prostatectomy and an increasing probability I will die from something other than PCa as I get older and time goes by after the surgery. He explained that many of his long time surgery patients do eventually experience biochemical recurrence but it is of little concern as they age. He reminded me that the median time from the 2nd occurrence of a 0.2 PSA test, post surgery, to the onset of metastatic disease symptoms is over eight years and the median time to death is another five years. Have you plugged your numbers into the Memorial Sloan Kettering (MSK) nomogram for pre-radicial prostatecotmy patients? I assumed you were 65-years old and had a T1c clinical stage given your biopsy results. That nomogram gives you a 99% chance of NOT dying from PCa in 10-years and 98% in 15-years. It also calculates a 50% chance of NO biochemical recurrence (MSK BCR is 0.05 ng/ml or greater) in 5-years and only a 34% chance of NO recurrence in 10-years. Please consider that many oncologists will not recommend Salvage Radiation Therapy (SRT) until you have two consecutive PSA >0.2 tests. If your PSA gets to 0.05 MSK considers it BCR, BUT, if your PSA increases at .02 per year you'd have 7 more years until SRT might be necessary. So - what do you consider to be a definition of CURE relative to your situation? How do those numbers compare to what the clinic or your doctor reported? The MKS nomogram also provides the odds of the cancer: - being organ confined - extra capsular extension - lymph node involvement - seminal vesicle invasion",

      "Content": "He said he wanted a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast plus delays. CT scan requires you to lie still inside a large open ring that is approximately 2' deep. I am pretty claustrophobic but a 0.5mg Ativan (Lorazepam) tablet 90-minutes before the scan makes it easy for me. The contrast is injected through a small port they put in your arm prior to you going into the scanner. I was in and out of the imaging place in less than 90-minutes. The scan is to look for tissue outside the prostate that might be acting abnormally. The contrast fluid is taken up/absorbed more readily by abnormal, malignant?, cells so a greater intensity return on the image shows where abnormal tissue \"might\" be located. I will be having this CT scan next week and have alot of questions regarding possible outcomes. What should I expect from the CT scan? My scan was done 4-weeks AFTER the 2nd PSA test confirmed a number > 10 and three weeks AFTER a 3T mpMRI, which found a prostate tumor and was rated PIRADS 3 (not normal but of an indeterminate nature). You can see from my signature the MRI missed a whole lot of stuff. I received the CT scan results 4-days after the scan, (I had go to the imaging facility and make an in-person request for the report) and met with my urologist/oncologist a week after the scan. It was done the same day as a whole body bone scan. Both the CT and bone scan showed no abnormal tissue activity outside the prostate. The \"clear\" findings allowed my doctors and I to take a little more time to decide what to do. It also reassured me that a prostatectomy would have a high probability of removing ALL PCa tissue. If the scans had found abnormal tissue activity outside the prostate - then the surgical intervention might not have resulted in removal of the nasty tissue. Does this high PSA likely statistically mean cancer? There are many excellent websites explaining the possible causes of high PSA. Just start googling \"high psa\" or \"how to interpret PSA\". I chose to ignore my PSA (4.0 at age 63, 5.8 age 65) until it hit 9.2 at age 70. I wish I had learned more about the meaning of a PSA > 5.0 several years ago. ASK all the questions you want - some of us here enjoy writing and it is therapeutic on both the asking and answering side. What questions should I be asking? The \"sticky\" section of this forum, at the top of the page, has many threads about questions to ask.",

My annoyance is more with the paper work problems and the fact that my urologist did not explain to me that the Propofol route would require such a detailed medical clearance. I've had four propofol procedures in the last 4.5 years and not a single one of them required any kind of medical clearance so I made an assumption ( I know - bad idea!) that this one would be the same. I mean... really how different is a colonoscopy, with emphasis on the upper reaches of the lower colon, done under poropofol than a quick and easy TRUS biopsy? Well - now I know! The good news is that the biopsy scheduler told me \"this is not prostate season in SW Florida because all the snow birds have gone north so our facilities and staff have open and flexible schedules.\" Wednesday or Thursday",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Good luck OTS! Keep in mind that the above guidelines to NOT apply to you today! At time of surgery, your PSA was likely > 4x normal. With a 1/2 Life of approx 3 days, your PSA level might not yet be < 0.03ng/ml. If not today, may your 3 month post RP PSA be < 0.03ng/ml! MF My surgeon said he does not do a µPSA at 6-weeks. He will decide later about the µPSA at 3-months. 10.2 PSA at time of surgery 0.5^9*10.2=~0.02 9 (half lifes) x 3-days (half life of PSA) is about 27 or so days. Today was 40-days so I am really hoping to see <0.1 when I get the results Friday or Monday. My appointment with the surgeon is Oct 9. I read and read about the Zero Club but did not really understand the significance of membership until about 3-weeks after the RALP and I began to appreciate how much my short term future depends on that <0.1. Now I do so hope I qualify for at least a short term membership!",

      "Content": "He said he wanted a CT scan of my abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast plus delays. CT scan requires you to lie still inside a large open ring that is approximately 2' deep. I am pretty claustrophobic but a 0.5mg Ativan (Lorazepam) tablet 90-minutes before the scan makes it easy for me. The contrast is injected through a small port they put in your arm prior to you going into the scanner. I was in and out of the imaging place in less than 90-minutes. The scan is to look for tissue outside the prostate that might be acting abnormally. The contrast fluid is taken up/absorbed more readily by abnormal, malignant?, cells so a greater intensity return on the image shows where abnormal tissue \"might\" be located. I will be having this CT scan next week and have alot of questions regarding possible outcomes. What should I expect from the CT scan? My scan was done 4-weeks AFTER the 2nd PSA test confirmed a number > 10 and three weeks AFTER a 3T mpMRI, which found a prostate tumor and was rated PIRADS 3 (not normal but of an indeterminate nature). You can see from my signature the MRI missed a whole lot of stuff. I received the CT scan results 4-days after the scan, (I had go to the imaging facility and make an in-person request for the report) and met with my urologist/oncologist a week after the scan. It was done the same day as a whole body bone scan. Both the CT and bone scan showed no abnormal tissue activity outside the prostate. The \"clear\" findings allowed my doctors and I to take a little more time to decide what to do. It also reassured me that a prostatectomy would have a high probability of removing ALL PCa tissue. If the scans had found abnormal tissue activity outside the prostate - then the surgical intervention might not have resulted in removal of the nasty tissue. Does this high PSA likely statistically mean cancer? There are many excellent websites explaining the possible causes of high PSA. Just start googling \"high psa\" or \"how to interpret PSA\". I chose to ignore my PSA (4.0 at age 63, 5.8 age 65) until it hit 9.2 at age 70. I wish I had learned more about the meaning of a PSA > 5.0 several years ago. ASK all the questions you want - some of us here enjoy writing and it is therapeutic on both the asking and answering side. What questions should I be asking? The \"sticky\" section of this forum, at the top of the page, has many threads about questions to ask.",

      "Content": "EXACTLY My experience: \"Once it's out, expect it to take 3 to 6 months to recover \"full\" urinary continence. I say \"full\" because there will always be a bit of stress leakage when you stress your abdomens doing something. Measure progress week by week, not day by day as some days will be better than others. The first thing to come back is staying dry overnight. The next thing is staying dry while doing normal daily activities. The last thing to improve is leakage doing things that compress or stress the abdomen.\" In 3-days (Dec 23) I will be 4-months post-RALP. My Depends now stay almost bone dry 11 PM to 11AM. But, as soon as I start doing any activity requiring bending or pressing on my abdomen - I dribble or leak a bit. Hard work, e.g. yesterday afternoon replacing five landscape light bulbs that required bending and digging, will cause me to leak a ounce or two per hour. Another funny one is dishwashing or teethbrushing. If I lean forward against the counter and let it press into my abdomen - leaky/leaky. Don't let the bad/leaky hours or days disturb you as you progress. Four or five weeks ago - After I started being bone (not yet!) dry all night I thought my pad wearing days were over. I then went thru several afternoons reversion to leaking several ounces per hour followed by 12 or more hours of no dribbles. That was very frustrating but I now understand that the periods of extreme leakage become less and less frequent. For me at this point - it has been five-days since I leaked more than an ounce an hour, and that occurred while working under/over the car while installing new driving lights. I am a numbers guy so six-weeks post RALP I bought a nice digital scale that can accurately measure 0.1 fl oz up to 32-fl oz (by weight). I have weighed every pad and Depends since them and plot the ounces/hour number over time. I also plot the trend line. It is reassuring to a geeky statistician to see the trend line headed downward and the 90-percentile line (90% of previous 20 pads) trending downward at even a steeper rate. And, those 2-ounce per hour peak leaks are becoming less and less evident. I expect to be almost completely continent, except for sever bending, pressing and lifting before the Super Bowl and am pretty sure I will be almost completely dry under all conditions by Easter.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Hi OTS! The 3 month post RP PSA is pretty much the Universal Standard. It is the PSA value against which all future PSA values will be compared. I am assuming that your 2018 Healthcare Deductibles have been met and you have reached your Out of Pocket limits. If so, getting a uPSA after Thanksgiving will provide the key 3 month data point and will be free. Most importantly, it should be < 0.021 and will be able to confirm that your PSA is on a downward trajectory. Then move your Jan PSA back about 5 weeks to the end of Feb and \"Voila!\" you are on a Every 3 Months Program. Even if you have to pay an out of pocket fee, it should only be about $13. LabCorp can provide an estimate up front. Good luck! MF Several years ago I chose to go with a Blue Shield (at that time California and now Florida) ZERO Deductible Plan F Medicare Supplemental. I pay $212 a month for the Plan F and never have a single out of pocket expense. My knees and my heart required fairly constant attention thus I know I will always exceed my deductibles and other numbers. And that was years before I became a PCa participant. I decided the easiest way to manage all my medical expenses was to commit to the $2,544 annual payment and be assured I never receive a single bill from any medical professional. AND... my medical insurance and expenses pale compared to my wife's. She is 9-years younger than me (I married her when she was 18 but led me to believe she was 20) and still has to pay for a private individual policy. She has broken a proximal humerus, and thigh/hip during the last four years. Those repairs have required five major surgeries, each with extensive hospital stays. And, she has a fatal blood chemistry deficiency that requires a maintenance drug at $135/month. She has been on that for 10-years now and will be on it the rest of her life. All I can say is \"Hope she gets old soon and can sign up for Medicare!\" Her insurance premiums are $9,600 / year with OOP max of $6,900 ($6,400 deductible).",

      "Content": "I started several threads about my biopsy results and discussion today (Friday Aug 10) with my urologist. Due to my very high PSA density and very low gland size he is pushing me to immediate treatment just as your cousin is experiencing. . A key part about my treatment choices was my life expectancy, current health, and how I wanted to live my remaining years. Your cousin seems to have a number of comorbidities that do not suggest a long life expectancy. Nor does it seem his quality of life will be as high as one would want. Is he carefully considering the potential benefits, e.g. additional years of life, compared to the decreased quality of that life? The red text seemed to indicate he was aware of the trade off. I have had several Afib episodes and my father suffered dozens of Afib events requiring cardio-conversion in the last five years of his 90-year life. I do know that the blood thinner regimen puts a real strain on every other medical decision. My father experienced total remission from a very rare and typically fatal lymphoma at about age 80 and had no problem with the nasty 2-years of treatment required to get there. But at age 88 with a worsening Afib situation he chose not to take any additional invasive steps to manage the Afib. He felt the potential negative side effects were not worth whatever gain he might enjoy. Two years later he died of a non-medical condition unrelated to either his lymphoma or his heart. His choice not to treat broke my mother's and sister's heart but I totally understood his reasoning. He and I went for a long hike through a SW Florida swamp just a month before his death and he was very happy with the choices he had made. I am 71 and other than my PCa am quite healthy. Every life expectancy test I use gives me another 17 to 23 years so I am willing to take drastic steps today (RALP ASAP) to ensure PCa will not interfere with that 17+ year life. Is your cousin really in a life space (medically / physically) that drastic PCa treatment with all it's side effects will have a net benefit in what ever years he has left? I know you have thought through this stuff many times - has he or have you really talked him through it?",

      "Content": "Djiin Tonic - MY thoughts exactly. What you so elegantly (?) stated is exactly what I had in mind as I asked the questions. I will review the studies you mentioned. Standard Errors, Standard Deviations, Repeatability, Confounding...etc were my professional life for many years and I do appreciate your concerns. My subjective impression is the MO wants to prepare me mentally/psychologically for the future need to make some decisions and he is trying to make me think now, while I have time and little pressure, about choices in the future. During our detailed discussion I felt like he was not totally committed to the need for SRT but wanted me to know it might be a hard choice in the future. Additionally, his attitude / experience with SRT seemed to me to be \"minimal side effects and minimal long term consequences\" so WHY NOT do SRT at some point just to be sure of a cure? He did say \"you chose surgery and the side effects. You are young (??) and healthy so why wouldn't you want to take the next step of SRT to ensure a positive and life long good outcome?\" I did not feel any pressure from him to choose now. He did stress that things move slowly at this stage and waiting to begin SRT is a perfectly reasonable choice. SO - just to continue my \"It is a life time journey with many twists and turns\" - it appears to be more twisted now than before. But, I've accepted the uncertainty and can happily wait 3 - 6 - 12 months to see what I next need to do.",

      "Content": "Fourth post-RALP appointment with Medical Oncologist 30-weeks after surgery PSA prior to RALP 10.2 up from 9.2 3-months earlier RALP August 23, 2018 Focal EPE and Focal SM+ G7 (3+4) Lab Corp µPSA 0.021 at 6-weeks 0.018 at 18-weeks 0.022 at 30-weeks Surgeon at 10-days post-RALP told me radiation therapy would be \"required within 6-months\" due to EPE and SM+ Surgeon at 6-weeks postponed SRT until PSA shows a consistent rise but to \"expect it within 6-months\" MO at 18-weeks said there was \"no need to consider SRT until PSA shows consistent rise over 3-months\" MO at 30-weeks (April 10, 2019) \"plan on SRT before end of 2019\" Details that led MO to plan for SRT within a year: EPE (even if it is FOCAL and G6) SM+ (even if it is 2mm FOCAL G6) µPSA increase from 0.018 to 0.022 in 3-months There is no reason the PSA should increase IF ALL the PCa cells were removed. But, the confusing factor is \"psuedo-PSA\" or \"PSA-analogue\" produced by cells in the urethra. At the 0.00x PSA level it is possible to detect the analogue version of the PSA. However, there is NO reason the amount of analogue will increase over time. The 0.004 INCREASE in my µPSA is indicative of some remaining PCa tissue. We will wait 3-months and get another µPSA test. I asked about the 6-week 0.021 PSA value and the fact that the 30-week value (0.022) has just returned to the 6-week value. The MO answer was that PSA has a 6-week half-life and the 0.021 could have been remaining from prior to the RALP. The 18-week decrease to 0.018 would indicate that at least some of the 0.021 was \"old\" PSA. The 30-week rise/increase should not occur if all the PCa was removed. I asked about standard error of measurement for µPSA and he told me Lab Corp does not provide that information. And, it doesn't really matter because he cares about the TREND rather than the absolute value. I tried to pin him down to numbers and he refused to play. He ordered another 3-month µPSA test. If the July 2019 test shows any increase above 0.022 it almost certainly means I will experience SRT in the not distant future. But, as to actual initiation of SRT - there is no rush so if the July test shows a small increase (0.005 or less?) he would probably wait another 3-months. But, his experience is that, even at the µPSA levels, three consecutive increases, even in the third digit (0.00X) inevitably leads to BCR and the need for SRT- \"You have no remaining non-cancerous tissue, which can increase the amount of PSA over time so any consistent increase in the PSA level, no matter how small, must be from PCa tissue that was missed during the surgery\" He wants to wait until at least 10-months post-RALP because a 71-year old needs 9-months healing time to recover from the RALP. He does not want to irradiate tissue that is still healing because it leads to strictures and fibrous growth. The longer I wait post surgery - the fewer SRT side effects I will experience. Whatever level of continence (almost 100% dry except when playing pickleball - my opponents \"piss me off\") and sexual function (semi-firm) will be retained if the SRT begins after 10-months post-RALP. He says the Radiation Oncologist will make all the decisions about type of SRT and imaging prior to radiation. But, his experience, (the MO and RO work for the same national practice 21st Century Oncology), is that no high tech imaging will be done if we start SRT at PSA <0.05 because none of it can detect metastasizes at such a low level. The MO did also say that SRT technology is progressing at a very rapid pace and the longer I can wait the better the results and fewer the side effects. Asked him about ADT or any other hormone or chemical treatment prior to or with the SRT and he was quite definite - NO- NONE! My G7 (3+4) and small focal EPE & SM are not indicative of the need for anything in addition to SRT. The radiation therapy will almost certainly be a near cure or provide me enough time to die from anything other than PCa. Bottom Line for me is that SRT is inevitable but I want to delay it as long as possible.",

      "Content": "Walsh book - 4th edition page 326-327 \"What is the advantage of the ultrasensitive test? If your pathology report suggests that not all the cancer has been removed....then this information can be helpful.\" JH Research done by Dr. Lori Sokoll, professor of pathology and associate director of clinical chemistry at JH studied 750 men with PSA<0.1 3-months post surgery. Those with µPSA <0.03 had only 14% chance of an elevated PSA in 10-years. Those with µPSA>0.03 had 78% chance of an elevated PSA within a decade. The research DID NOT quantify the percentage of those 750 men who actually experienced BCR (PSA >0.2 for three consecutive tests) nor did it specify how many men needed additional therapy after their surgery. So men with SM+, SVI+, LNI+ and a µPSA >0.03 at 3-months need to have more frequent µPSA screening than those with a lower µPSA. I interpret the above as saying the µPSA <0.03 provides some reasonable peace of mind for at least a decade. And, if the score is higher it tells me that I will probably have to deal with BCR at some distant point. I find very different information in the Sokoll paper published in J of Urology Feb 2016! The Feb 2016 paper does not seem to say that a µPSA<0.03 is the assurance of a biochemical recurrence free survival that the Walsh book states. 754 men with standard PSA<0.1 17% (131) experienced BCR at a median time of 4-years. 69% of men with BCR had a µPSA <0.01 83% (623) had no BCR at a median time of 11-years. 93% of the BCR free men had a µPSA < 0.01 BCR free rates 11 years after surgery were 86% for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater. Kaplan-Meier estimates for mean BCR-free survival were 15.2 years for µPSA<0.01 ng/ml and 10.0 years for µPSA>0.01 ng/ml or greater. Conclusions (paraphrased from article) µPSA<0.01 ng/ml stratified biochemical recurrence-free survival and was a significant independent predictor of biochemical recurrence, as were pathological features. PSA concentrations in men without pathological evidence of prostate cancer suggest that a higher prostate specific antigen concentration (0.03 ng/ml) in the ultrasensitive range may be needed to define the detection threshold. The Kang et. al paper in J of Urology May 2015 offers a different perspective on µPSA and it's usefulness for determining future treatment. 247 hi risk patients (EPE+ or SM+ after surgery) and studied 1991 -2013. Sensitivity analysis identified uPSA ≥0.03 as the optimal threshold identifying recurrence. First post-op uPSA ≥0.03, Gleason grade, T-stage, iPSA (initial PSA), and margin status predicted BCR (PSA>0.2 for successive tests). First post-op uPSA ≥0.03 conferred the highest risk (Hazard Ratio =8.5 which means BCR is 8.5 times more likely to occur with a PSA>0.03) and discerned cBCR with greater sensitivity than undetectable first conventional PSA (70% vs. 46%). Any post-op PSA ≥0.03 captured all failures missed by first post-op value (100% sensitivity) with accuracy (96% specificity which means 96% of men with PSA<0.03 do not suffer BCR). Defining failure at uPSA ≥0.03 yielded a median lead-time advantage of 18 months (mean 24 months) over the conventional PSA ≥0.2 definition.",

      "Content": "Here is an interesting factoid that might help with decision making: In patients with localized prostate cancer, the 5-year survival approximates 100%; however, in patients in whom distant metastases have occurred, the 5-year survival drops to 31%. Like most other solid malignancies, prostate cancer can metastasize to distant organs such as the liver, lungs and brain, but it has an unusually high propensity for metastasizing to the bone. In one autopsy study, approximately 80% of the men who had died from prostate cancer possessed bone metastases. Most current treatments for individuals with bone metastases have only palliative effects, with little effect on long-term survival International Journal of Cancer June 2012",

      "Content": "There are many statistics about PCa progression after biochemical recurrence (BCR). But, let's just use the simple ones found in the Johns Hopkins research paper about the Natural History of BCR after prostatectomy and with no additional hormonal therapy. At 5.3 years post surgery 15% of men had BCR (PSA > 0.2ng/ml) The median (half the times were less and half were more) time to BCR was 2.3 years Eventually 1/3 of those men developed metastatic disease (About 1 in 20 of the original study group of prostatectomy patients) The Median time to metastatic disease symptoms was 8-years About half (actually 44%) of men with metastatic disease died from the disease (About 1 in 40 of the original study group of prostatectomy patients) The Median time to metastatic disease death was 5-years AFTER development of symptoms (About 13-years after initial PSA > 0.2) As others have mentioned - your life expectancy and Quality of Life is critical in the SRT / ADT / HT Yes or No? decision making process. All the the life expectancy calculators I've used give me at least another 20-years and I expect them to be good years. My father and I went for a 3-mile hike in the Everglades on his 89th birthday and he felt great doing it. SO - for me it seems I should do everything possible to fight the renewed growth of PCa IF I experience BCR. The recent post describing two brother's current SRT and HT therapy with few side effects has been very encouraging for me. They make it sound like SRT & HT can be experienced with a minimal degree of suffering and long term effects. Yet another reason to plan on additional treatment if BCR does occur. Several surviving partners of men who died from Metatstatic Prostatic Cancer disease have posted threads here describing the last two years of their partners journey to death. It sounds like a horrible way to die and is also very hard on the surviving family. I've promised my wife, 8-years younger than me and from a family where all the women live to be older than 95, I will outlive her. Thus I have a strong incentive to submit to whatever additional treatment I need to delay or deny PCa return. I've written several more detailed threads about BCR and prognosis, which summarize much of the research I've found. Here is one link: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...t-RP-prognosis",

      "Content": "Here is an interesting factoid that might help with decision making: In patients with localized prostate cancer, the 5-year survival approximates 100%; however, in patients in whom distant metastases have occurred, the 5-year survival drops to 31%. Like most other solid malignancies, prostate cancer can metastasize to distant organs such as the liver, lungs and brain, but it has an unusually high propensity for metastasizing to the bone. In one autopsy study, approximately 80% of the men who had died from prostate cancer possessed bone metastases. Most current treatments for individuals with bone metastases have only palliative effects, with little effect on long-term survival International Journal of Cancer June 2012",

      "Content": "There are many statistics about PCa progression after biochemical recurrence (BCR). But, let's just use the simple ones found in the Johns Hopkins research paper about the Natural History of BCR after prostatectomy and with no additional hormonal therapy. At 5.3 years post surgery 15% of men had BCR (PSA > 0.2ng/ml) The median (half the times were less and half were more) time to BCR was 2.3 years Eventually 1/3 of those men developed metastatic disease (About 1 in 20 of the original study group of prostatectomy patients) The Median time to metastatic disease symptoms was 8-years About half (actually 44%) of men with metastatic disease died from the disease (About 1 in 40 of the original study group of prostatectomy patients) The Median time to metastatic disease death was 5-years AFTER development of symptoms (About 13-years after initial PSA > 0.2) As others have mentioned - your life expectancy and Quality of Life is critical in the SRT / ADT / HT Yes or No? decision making process. All the the life expectancy calculators I've used give me at least another 20-years and I expect them to be good years. My father and I went for a 3-mile hike in the Everglades on his 89th birthday and he felt great doing it. SO - for me it seems I should do everything possible to fight the renewed growth of PCa IF I experience BCR. The recent post describing two brother's current SRT and HT therapy with few side effects has been very encouraging for me. They make it sound like SRT & HT can be experienced with a minimal degree of suffering and long term effects. Yet another reason to plan on additional treatment if BCR does occur. Several surviving partners of men who died from Metatstatic Prostatic Cancer disease have posted threads here describing the last two years of their partners journey to death. It sounds like a horrible way to die and is also very hard on the surviving family. I've promised my wife, 8-years younger than me and from a family where all the women live to be older than 95, I will outlive her. Thus I have a strong incentive to submit to whatever additional treatment I need to delay or deny PCa return. I've written several more detailed threads about BCR and prognosis, which summarize much of the research I've found. Here is one link: https://www.cancerforums.net/threads...t-RP-prognosis",

      "Content": "Walsh book - 4th edition page 326-327 \"What is the advantage of the ultrasensitive test? If your pathology report suggests that not all the cancer has been removed....then this information can be helpful.\" JH Research done by Dr. Lori Sokoll, professor of pathology and associate director of clinical chemistry at JH studied 750 men with PSA<0.1 3-months post surgery. Those with µPSA <0.03 had only 14% chance of an elevated PSA in 10-years. Those with µPSA>0.03 had 78% chance of an elevated PSA within a decade. The research DID NOT quantify the percentage of those 750 men who actually experienced BCR (PSA >0.2 for three consecutive tests) nor did it specify how many men needed additional therapy after their surgery. So men with SM+, SVI+, LNI+ and a µPSA >0.03 at 3-months need to have more frequent µPSA screening than those with a lower µPSA. I interpret the above as saying the µPSA <0.03 provides some reasonable peace of mind for at least a decade. And, if the score is higher it tells me that I will probably have to deal with BCR at some distant point. I find very different information in the Sokoll paper published in J of Urology Feb 2016! The Feb 2016 paper does not seem to say that a µPSA<0.03 is the assurance of a biochemical recurrence free survival that the Walsh book states. 754 men with standard PSA<0.1 17% (131) experienced BCR at a median time of 4-years. 69% of men with BCR had a µPSA <0.01 83% (623) had no BCR at a median time of 11-years. 93% of the BCR free men had a µPSA < 0.01 BCR free rates 11 years after surgery were 86% for prostate specific antigen less than 0.01 ng/ml and 48.9% for prostate specific antigen 0.01 ng/ml or greater. Kaplan-Meier estimates for mean BCR-free survival were 15.2 years for µPSA<0.01 ng/ml and 10.0 years for µPSA>0.01 ng/ml or greater. Conclusions (paraphrased from article) µPSA<0.01 ng/ml stratified biochemical recurrence-free survival and was a significant independent predictor of biochemical recurrence, as were pathological features. PSA concentrations in men without pathological evidence of prostate cancer suggest that a higher prostate specific antigen concentration (0.03 ng/ml) in the ultrasensitive range may be needed to define the detection threshold. The Kang et. al paper in J of Urology May 2015 offers a different perspective on µPSA and it's usefulness for determining future treatment. 247 hi risk patients (EPE+ or SM+ after surgery) and studied 1991 -2013. Sensitivity analysis identified uPSA ≥0.03 as the optimal threshold identifying recurrence. First post-op uPSA ≥0.03, Gleason grade, T-stage, iPSA (initial PSA), and margin status predicted BCR (PSA>0.2 for successive tests). First post-op uPSA ≥0.03 conferred the highest risk (Hazard Ratio =8.5 which means BCR is 8.5 times more likely to occur with a PSA>0.03) and discerned cBCR with greater sensitivity than undetectable first conventional PSA (70% vs. 46%). Any post-op PSA ≥0.03 captured all failures missed by first post-op value (100% sensitivity) with accuracy (96% specificity which means 96% of men with PSA<0.03 do not suffer BCR). Defining failure at uPSA ≥0.03 yielded a median lead-time advantage of 18 months (mean 24 months) over the conventional PSA ≥0.2 definition.",

      "Content": "I can certainly understand and identify with your concern. I've had many, dozens ?, of MRIs over the years due to bad back, knees, shoulder, neck. During the first ?? (many over the years) I never had a claustrophobia problem. I'd spent years crawling around very tight pipes, tunnels, and engine rooms with no thought of a problem. Then suddenly, about 2003, I became extremely claustrophobic during an MRI for my back. (I was 30-minutes into the MRI, which was an old style narrow tube with a closed end where your head ended up for a back image. I was listening to classical music and was half asleep when the technician says \"Boy am I glad you are not claustrophobic - it is a real nuisance when people freak out in there.\" I quickly lost it! My heart accelerated, my breathing almost stopped and I started sweating like crazy. As I recall I made it thru that one but the next several MRIs were downright frightening.) Since that time MRIs, CT scans, and radionuclide cardiac stress tests (the sensor presses on your chest) have been a real issue for me and cause me a lot of stress leading up to the event. My 3T mpMRI (June this year) for the prostate was in a newer Siemens machine and it was a whole lot LESS problematic (scary!) than the older enclosed machines. The tunnel is wide open at both ends and is at least 50% wider than the older style. They put me in feet first so that my shoulders and head were outside the tube. Additionally, and most important for my mental state, I had to keep my arms above my head while lying there. My claustrophia is worst when I feel like my arms and hands are pinned in such a fashion I cannot help myself ESCAPE. The machine used for my 3T mpMRI did not cause that irrational sensation. AND, my GP has given me an Rx for Adivan 0.5mg (Lorazepam), which is a very mild anti-anxiety medication. I take one 90-minutes before they put me in the tube and I feel almost NO concerns and can even fall asleep if the technician does not talk to me. I also feel no effect from the Adivan, it does not seem to make my thinking slow or cloudy and does not seem to impair my judgement, or at least my wife says she cannot tell when I take it.",

My 3T mpMRI (June this year) for the prostate was in a newer Siemens machine and it was a whole lot LESS problematic (scary!) than the older enclosed machines. The tunnel is wide open at both ends and is at least 50% wider than the older style. They put me in feet first so that my shoulders and head were outside the tube. Additionally, and most important for my mental state, I had to keep my arms above my head while lying there. My claustrophia is worst when I feel like my arms and hands are pinned in such a fashion I cannot help myself ESCAPE. The machine used for my 3T mpMRI did not cause that irrational sensation. AND, my GP has given me an Rx for Adivan 0.5mg (Lorazepam), which is a very mild anti-anxiety medication. I take one 90-minutes before they put me in the tube and I feel almost NO concerns and can even fall asleep if the technician does not talk to me. I also feel no effect from the Adivan, it does not seem to make my thinking slow or cloudy and does not seem to impair my judgement, or at least my wife says she cannot tell when I take it.",

(Reuters Health) - - In men with localized prostate cancer discovered because they had symptoms or noticed during a work-up for another medical problem, radical prostate surgery leads to an average of three extra years of life compared to a \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d approach, researchers say. The benefit of surgery was most pronounced in men who were under age 65 when their tumor was diagnosed, a new, long-term Scandinavian study found.

Ask for whatever help you need to \"come to terms\" with this new experience. It is OK to be uncertain, frustrated, confused, and even angry. I vented my frustration several times and was pleased at how much better I felt and how supportive the forum members were.",

This might spare men who have lower-grade cancer at the margin from post-operative radiation therapy.\u201d I sure hope they are correct!",

      "Content": "The Good News about positive surgical margins is in this November 2017 Discovery (Johns Hopkins) article: https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/brad...to-perspective Quoting Jeffery Epstein from the article: \" \u201cit is not uncommon for the margins to be positive \u2013 to have tumor at the cut edge, which potentially could indicate that some cancer has been left behind.\u201d However, he adds, \u201conly about half of prostate cancers with positive margins recur after surgery.\u201d This also means that half of men who have positive margins never have a recurrence of cancer.\" \"Because Epstein has looked at tens of thousands of prostate specimens in his distinguished career, he knows that the positive surgical margin itself is not as important as some other factors.\" \" In a current study of 4,082 consecutive patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2010 and 2014 at Johns Hopkins, Epstein and colleagues showed that men who had a lower Gleason score at the margin were less likely to have a return of PSA after surgery, and \u201cwe conclude that the Gleason score of the cancer at the positive margin site should routinely be documented. This might spare men who have lower-grade cancer at the margin from post-operative radiation therapy.\u201d I sure hope they are correct!",

      "Content": "PSA 44-days after RALP = 0.021 My RALP surgeon, whose card reads \"Specializing in Urology Oncology and Robotic Surgery\", has done over 1,600 RALPs and has been practicing for over 25-years. Today I met with him to review the 0.021 PSA results. He looks at the lab paper, looks at the RALP pathology report and says: \"Remember we were concerned about the pathology and surgical margins? This .021 is good for six-weeks post surgery but is marginal for denying the need for radiation. Let's wait three months and see what the PSA result is at that time.\" My wife then asked \"how much radiation?\" and he says \"seven weeks - but let's wait three months to decide.\" And... here I thought a 0.021 was a solid indicator of no immediate need for SRT. My wife thinks the surgeon is skeptical that the PSA measure will stay that low. I know that in the first appointment I had with him, 6-days after the surgery, he looked at the pathology report and said \"it looks like you have radiation in your future this winter.\" I guess he really does not think he got all the PCa tissue and expects to see the PSA start to climb during the next couple months. Disappointing but I guess not unexpected. I want to be an optimist and he wants to guarantee my future.",

      "Content": "July 18 review of 3T mpMRI and 4KScore Urologist says MRI provides no useful diagnostic information but provides clear target and guidance of biopsy. 4KScore says that 34% of men who were biopsied with my age, DRE, PSA, Free PSA, inTact PSA, and hK2 values were found to have PCa with a Gleason score of 7 or greater I guess the good news is that 2 out of 3 men like me DID NOT have an aggressive PCa! They will try to schedule the TRUS 12-Core biopsy for next week and the urologist assures me he will get at least two samples from the 0.30 cc tumor/lesion identified on the MRI. Dr. Blitz stressed that even an \"aggressive\" cancer at this point has a relatively slow progression, particularly with such a small lesion, and there is plenty of time to deal with it.",

My urologist has been in practice 26-years and prefers to do the biopsy while the patient is under \"Conscious sedation \", which is accomplished with Propofol. I remember talking to the doctor and nurse/anesthesiologist about college basketball, she squeezed my hand and said, \"you'll relax now\", and then I was in the recovery room with my wife holding my hand. Propofol is not an anesthetic but inhibits the formation of memory so I have no remembrance of the biopsy. My urologist will do the biopsy in his office with lidocaine but his many years of experience tells him Propofol results in a relaxed, compliant patient and he has a better working field.

I wonder how unusal that is, and is no cancer on the other side suspect? I see the volume on the one side as an adverse condition, imo. Curious to hear what the doctor says. 18cc prostate 0.3cc tumor identified by MRI average involvement in all 12-cores is 27% but is 53% in the cores showing positive Staging from American Cancer Society staging page: The tumor can be felt by digital rectal exam or seen with imaging such as transrectal ultrasound and is in one half or less of only one side (left or right) of the prostate [cT2b] The tumor can be felt by digital rectal exam(NO in my case) or seen with imaging (equivocal MRI in my case) such as transrectal ultrasound. It is in more than half of one side of the prostate [cT2b] or it is in both sides of the prostate[cT2c] Mine is 100% of one side and none on the other so I guess my lottery number is cT2b WHOOPS! ^(&()&)( I did not notice that the staging definitions above only apply to Gleason 6. I fit all the criteria for cT2b BUT have a Gleason 7 (3+4) so what is my staging/grade with a PSA of 10.3? AJCC Stage IIB? Grade Group 2? The cancer has not yet spread outside the prostate. It might (or might not) be felt by digital rectal exam or seen with imaging such as transrectal ultrasound [T1 or T2]. How does one express that? IIBT2",

      "Content": "I met with my Medical Oncologist/Urologist January 9, 2019. This is the first time we have talked since he sent me to the RALP surgeon in mid-August 2018. My MO is 25-year board certified urologist. He retired from doing open RPs when RALP procedures became common and efficient. He still does a lot of urological surgery but wants to focus on the medical oncology aspects of his practice. He said my surgical pathology report is hard to interpret from a prognostic perspective. He said the EPE+ and SM+ are negative indicators and probably predict future biochemical recurrence (BCR). Then he continued saying my SM and EPE were small (< 2mm), single focal, and G6 so he would discount their negative value in the prediction of future BCR. There is no current indicator that a future course of radiation is needed or even predicted for me. There is no way to predict, given my pathology, what the course of my PCa will be. It is truly wait and see. I asked him about Hypofractionation IF radiation became necessary. He said than he and his radiological oncologist were using hypofractionation on a more frequent basis and were becoming much more comfortable with it for Salvage Radiation Therapy. No discussion of dosage but he indicated they usually did five treatments. But, at this point radiation is at least six-months in the future due to my low PSA ( 0.018 ). The monitoring plan is every three months for a couple years. The BIG news to me is that he DOES NOT want to use Ultrasensitive PSA tests. He says a two digit test is all he needs and the three digit test just provides noise that confuses the patient. He again reminded me of the slow growth of PCa, even post-RALP. I suggested the trendline provided by µPSA is useful for catching an increasing PSA score earlier than could with a two-digit test and he called BS. He feels the two-digit test is \"exquisitly sensitive\" and provides plenty of advanced information about the post-RALP patient's PSA dynamics. He stressed the dynamics are the key - not the absolute level. He then strongly, adamantly, described the 0.2 ng/ml for two consecutive PSA tests three months apart as his gold standard for a BCR diagnosis. I then asked about genetic testing of the surgical specimens. His answer was \"I usually do that genetic testing when trying to convince the patient they need to take a course of action or to avoid a treatment. In your case, today, the PSA test shows no reason to do anything except wait three-months. In the future, with a rising PSA value we might want the genetic information to determine how aggressive we want to be with radiation and hormone. At this time genetics provides no useful information, BUT if you want I will order it.\" I chose to wait another three months. Then he told me I had been doing my Kegels all wrong. He wants me to do 100 long duration Kegels per day, every day, forever. Every time I stand up, sit down, reach, do anything that stresses my bladder or abdomen I am to do a Kegel and HOLD IT to exhaustion. I said that might be a long time - He laughed and said \"I bet it is less than 10-seconds if you are really squeezing the correct muscles.\" He said short dynamic Kegels are of little value and repetitions of longer Kegels are not much better. He stressed I need to do them every time I put stress on the abdomen and hold till tired.",
