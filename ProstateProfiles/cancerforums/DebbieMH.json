He went in for a bone scan Friday. The urologist said that he has advanced prostate cancer. That he didn't need to do a biopsy because his PSA was so high. The bone scan hasn't come back yet. He has no symptoms ... and is only 61 years old. Is that true ... a PSA that high actually means cancer, period?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Replicant I would say if you have access to MD Anderson in Houston, go there. By all means. They are ranked #1 in the US by US News & World Report for cancer treatment. They're also highly rated for urology--so for a urologic cancer like prostate cancer, that's a great combination. They are one of three original comprehensive cancer centers established with federal assistance in 1971. They are one of 66 National Cancer Institute-recognized Centers of Excellence, and have conducted more clinical trials than any other cancer research organization. Get a referral to a top notch medical oncologist there, and your husband will be in excellent hands. Best wishes. Thank you. MD Anderson is considered to be in our hospitalization network. We are going to the doctor today to discuss his bone scan results and to just sit down and find out what he really is facing. Last Thursday when we were there, we didn't quite hear everything, I'm sure - total shock! I am going to ask the Urologist to refer him to MD Anderson. We live in New Orleans - but can be in Houston in just a couple hours drive, or a fairly cheap plane ride.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by indypaul didn't have one before. might not be infection with bone/hip ache?? I'm not an expert or a doctor, but from what our onocologist and also our urologist said is that when you get \"bone pain\" from advanced prostate cancer, you know it. It is not an ache, it is a constant deep down pain. I really doubt if your bone/hip pain is from advanced prostate cancer.",
