      "Content": "Originally Posted by Michael F Welcome mcloud! The PSA value that currently defines Biochemical Recurrence (BR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) is 0.10 ng/ml. (Although AUA and other guidelines consider 0.20 ng/ml to be defining for BR) Clinically Undetectable: Any PSA level < 0.05 ng/ml. IMO, repeating the latest PSA (0.06) is the best course of action. It is important to keep records of all PSA results. Request a copy of the original lab report each time. In the U.S., often PSAs are shipped to the big commercial labs (e.g. LabCorp, Quest) for analysis. The local lab might change their commercial lab, or the commercial lab might switch to a different PSA assay. Thus results can and will vary between different labs and also between different PSA assays. It is also possible to simply get an incorrect PSA value. This has happened to Forum Brothers on at least 3 occasions. What is your age? If your surgical Path Report was favorable i.e. pT2c or better, it is highly unlikely that you are facing a pending crisis after 7 years post RP! Hoping your next PSA result is: \"<\" 0.05 ng/ml! Keep us updated. Good luck! MF Hello Michael, Thank you for your comments. I am 69 years old. I had my surgery when I was 62. My stage is pT3aF ( focal extraprostatic extension) with negative margins and no involvement of the lymph nodes or seminal vesicles. My PSA post surgery was 5.07 I will have blood taken on October 6 and hope to have a result in about 3 or 4 days. Cheers, mcloud.",

      "Content": "Hello, I am a new member on the forum. I had robotic surgery for prostate cancer in September 2010. Since then all my PSA readings have been under .05 which is the standard they use at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto for undetectable. Unfortunately I have no idea what my PSA readings have been other than under .05 After my biopsy ( 4 of 12 cores positive on the left side only) my Gleason score was a 6 but post surgery was upgraded to a 3 + 4 with negative margins. G The amount of tumour was 5% of the gland surface, secondary pattern accounted for 10 to 15% of total tumour. PI present. After the operation my surgeon talked to me and I remember he said, \" I was able to be very aggressive on the left side.\" My most recent PSA was reported as .06 after 7 years of under .05 Although I realize I should not worry and just wait and see if there is a pattern developing, the sub conscious mind is causing me stress that I am struggling to control. I have read extensively about this but am just going in circles. I have seen several cases where low PSAs are reported under .1 for many years but this does not seem to be normal. Does any one have any thoughts or ideas where this might be heading and if the lengthy time from surgery to PSA of .06 is a factor in any way? Any information would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH Joining Michael in welcoming you to the forum, mcloud. Repeating that last PSA test is indeed a good idea. If there should be a trend taking place, you are right that it is still a good sign that it took 7 years for the PSA to begin rising. This would probably bode well for your long term prognosis. It is probably well in your favor, based on the post-op path report, that you are going to be just fine. Please let us know the results of your upcoming PSA test. Good luck!
