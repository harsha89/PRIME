      "Content": "I think incontinence is different with everybody. I'm 19 days post Da Vinci. The first few days after the catheter was removed I had \"drips and dribbles\". The next few days I was dry and thought I had it made. I am used to exercising and figured I could at least go for a fast walk for a couple miles. Then I climbed up a ladder to drill a couple holes and put some hooks in a post. That's when the fun began. I became fully incontinent and blood was mixed in my urine. Also my testicles were pulling up and down and twisting around by themselves. After 2 hours of this I called my surgeon. He has a cellphone for patients to call and he answered on a Saturday afternoon! He said to drink a lot of water to flush the blood out and to be there Monday morning if the other stuff was still happening. He said \" Didn't someone tell you to take it easy?\". An hour later I was dry, no blood in the urine, and my testicles quit squirming. I've been completely dry since, not even any \"phantom\" drips like I was having before. I don't know if I had twisted a nerve or what, I'll ask him about it when I see him in a couple weeks. So my 2 cents worth is to take it easy, (was told it can take 8 weeks for tissue to heal up in there), and only drink fluids when you're thirsty to give the bladder and urethra time to heal, (unless you're trying to flush blood out of your urine). Good Luck Rooster.",

      "Content": "Thank you for the welcome. The Prolaris Score can go from -3 to 7. Negative numbers are less aggressive. When I met the surgeon to find out my score I asked him first if I had a minus 3. That's when he looked over his glasses and said it's 4.4 and he'd only seen a number that high a couple other times. These genomic tests have only been out for a little over three years. I don't want to sound like an expert on these things. It's hard to find info that's not just on Myriad's website, (the owner of Prolaris). I have found reviews on medical journal websites that say the Prolaris Score is very accurate concerning outcomes. My 10 year mortality rate was 30%. The Prolaris Score is supposed to be an accurate predictor of biochemical recurrence also. I asked my surgeon about this and he said he wants to get it out and that everybody is different when it comes to prostate cancer. As for him saying it was a perfect surgery he told my wife that means no problems or surprises. He told her he thinks it was still contained but will know more from the pathology report. I get the catheter out next Wednesday. I don't know if the pathology report will be in then. I just wanted to put my experience out here since there is not a lot of info on actual results compared to a high Prolaris Score and if catching it early made a difference.",

      "Content": "Had my catheter removed yesterday. That makes everything a little bit easier. Pathology on surgery showed 2 bilateral tumors with a gleason score of 7, (3+4), on each one. The biopsy 3 months earlier showed 1 tumor with 2 positive cores beside each other with a gleason score of 6, (3+3). Negative margins, negative on lymph nodes, both nerve bundles saved. The surgeon said \"You're essentially cured\". I asked him about the high Prolaris score and he said what counted with that was getting the prostate out before the cancer got outside the prostate. I get a PSA test and see him in 4 weeks. With that news I forgot all about getting a copy of the complete pathology report. I'll get that next time. They just put basic information on their patient portal. When I came back out to the receptionist counter I saw my wife through the window in the waiting room and gave her \"thumbs up\" and she started crying. I had mentioned before that I didn't need any pain meds before. That was until I wasn't thinking 3 days post-op and got in bed like normal and pulled on my abdomen. I took one that night and another the next morning.",

      "Content": "I've been reading this forum for the last month and greatly appreciate all the tips and advice. I had my robotic surgery yesterday. I thought I would put something on here because my surgery was done mainly because of a Prolaris Score of 4.4. My surgeon has done over 800 robotic surgeries. He has been using a genomic test to measure the aggressiveness of the biopsy sample. He said he has only seen a score this high a couple other times. Talked to a radiologist also and went with the surgery. Before the Prolaris Score came back my surgeon was thinking active surveillance. When he saw the score he didn't want to waste any time. I'll keep posting about this because I could find very little about people with Prolaris Tests done. Surgery was 3 hours and he said it was a perfect surgery. I haven't had to take any pain meds. Since this is my first post I don't know if my history from my profile automatically shows up. Thanks again to everybody on here for making this a lot easier.",
