The average 12-core \"blind\" biopsy misses tumors about 20% of the time. However, you might consider what is known as a \"saturation biopsy.\" In this single procedure, they take more than the standard 12 cores. At least 20 and as many as 40+ can be taken. Often the patient is put to sleep in this version of the procedure. The thing to remember is that you will never get any official PC diagnosis with the MRI. An MRI simply cannot render such a diagnosis. The only procedure that can literally detect and diagnose prostate cancer is a biopsy. So, if you want the best chance of detecting any prostate cancer that might be present, the saturation way might be best. On the other hand, if you have the 3T MRI, it could then be followed up by a standard 12-core biopsy that tries to focus on areas \"suggested\" by the MRI. No fun no matter what you do, but a biopsy is probably going to have to be performed at some point in the future. agree, one problem might be, saturation biopsy might not be a preferred way for most urologist in Canada, might not be even available, since we have subsidized health care system we are not as progressive and some procedures are still not widely accepted or approved and covered",
