      "Content": "Hi, everyone. I have learned a great deal lurking here and this is my first post. After my PSA in annual physicals went from from 2.3 in 2007 to 3.3 in 2009 and 5.2 in 2010, my GP referred me to a local urologist who did a biopsy. PC was detected, with a G score of 3+3. The urologist was very open that although he was a surgeon and if he were in my shoes he would have surgery, he encouraged me to get a second opinion and said I may want to consider active surveillance if I was not a \"nervous Nellie\" and could live the uncertainty. I did that, and entered an active surveillance research program in late 2010. My PSA in my annual exam locally was 5.2 in 2010 and 5.1 in 2012. The PSA readings obtained in the AS program were 4.2 in May of 2011, 4.0 in November 2011, and 3.9 in May of 2012. Thus, the tests in the AS program are pretty consistently about 1.0 lower than the ones done locally. I had another biopsy in the AS program in November of 2011. Although the report was the same as the earlier biopsy (G3+3), the procedure itself was not very pleasant and I had a lot of bleeding. I am scheduled for a third biopsy in January of 2013. I just got a notification of a change in the program that would now require a rectal swab to make sure I did not have any super bugs that would require a different prophylactic antibiotic prior to the biopsy. This got me to thinking - the research program calls for a yearly biopsy. The biopsy is unpleasant, is not a totally benign procedure, and carries at least some risk of infection. My GP says he would not think an annual biopsy would be absolutely necessary, given my age (6, PSA history, and pathology. In 2010, I was gung-ho to participate in the research program for the betterment of mankind, etc, etc, but am now having second thoughts. I don't think I am being a total wimp in not looking forward to annual biopsies, but do not want to compromise my health. So - I would be interested in your thoughts as to whether my current inclination to lengthen the periods between biopsies is reasonable. Thanks, Bob",
