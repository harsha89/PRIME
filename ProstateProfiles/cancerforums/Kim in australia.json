      "Content": "You really have had some great comments and advice on your situation and glad to hear that the close monitoring will continue, really hope you do not end up having to join this club. I had a biopsy done just a few weeks ago and it was under a general anesthetic and while the actual biopsy method was different to the first one I had five years ago that one was also done under a general anesthetic. I came around very quickly after the procedure with no ill effects from the anesthetic at all, just some brusing around the perineum and being a little sore for a couple of days but was back at work the next day. So I really had no idea what they might of injected into what after I counted backwards from 5 and only got to 4... Your comments on a fear of being overtreated are interesting as I am now facing further treatment after failed brachytherapy and very much have a similar fear albeit for very different reasons. At the end of the day in my humble opinion you are an intelligent guy who has done some research and sought the knowledge and experiences of others. So obviously you have a capacity to evaluate, be fully informed, be in total control and call the shots when it comes to treatment. I can tell you I very much understand how much pressure your family, friends and health professionals can put you under at times, experts everywhere. I think thats where this forum is great in that you can hear directly from those who have experiened it and their partners first hand and for me thats worth it weight in gold. There is little to fear in the biopsy itself and its over in no time so when your turn comes around don't hesitate. Wishing you all the very best.",

      "Content": "Hi from Australia and thanks for providing such a great forum, one I have read over the years and found very informative. This is my first post. I had brachy just over 5 years ago, I was 53 at that time and in reasonably good health otherwise. I was presented with two options, remove it or brachythearpy. At that time here in Australia robotic surgery was only just being introduced and given my age and desire to minimise side effects I opted for the implants. I have had few side effects over the years but declining sexual function has been one of them and the other constant lower urniary tract symptoms including urgency, poor stream and having to get up at least twice during the night. I have tried a couple of different medications, Flomaxtra and Vesicare both of which are quiet expensive here and have proved to provide very limited relief in my case. For the first three years following the implants I saw the radiation oncologist every six months and my PSA's declined to .6 and I was told that was all fine and went to annual review. In October 2014 (five years to the month since the brachy implants) my check indicated that my PSA rose to 2.5, it was suggested that it could hopefully be an infection so I went on a course of antibiotics which were repeated then had a follow up PSA test. So a month later that test had my PSA at 2.85. So back into hospital mid December 2014 for a biopsy and unfortunatly the cancer is back, Gleeson score of 4+4 with December PSA at 3.4 so another PSA to be done next week. At this stage I am not sure where is this is going to lead me, looking at the possibility of a Gallium 68 PCMA PET scan which is being trialled at the hospital where I was originally treated, just to assist in maing a decision on treatment options. Options presented thus far are hormone threapy or salvage prostatectomy but it has been explained that salvage is high risk and may be pointless if metastatic spread has already occured which is stongly suspected but they would hope to be able to establish with the PET scan. Thats it up to now, am getting a second opinion the Jan 21st and back to see my current treating Dr on the 22nd and will make some decisions on where to next.",

      "Content": "Thanks Chuck for your thoughts and good wishes. At this time I dont have a staging estimate, it will be one of the first questions I will be asking when I go back on Jan 22nd. It was bad timing that this all happened just prior to the Christmas break, I got the results on December 19th and was in a bit of shock to be honest so while we spent an hour talking there were a few questions that I did not cover off on and are on my list for the next appointment. Concern was expressed at the rate my PSA was rising, it seemed to me more so than the actual number and that the rising rate may assist in determining just how aggressive it is. There has been a very low success rate for salvage surgery here without serious complications and long term side effects that from my perspective would have such an impact on my quality of life I am not considering it as an option but have not totally ruled it out. It seems there is no consensus by the professionals as to if and when hormone therapy may be of value, seems that some say commence immediately while others say to leave it as long as possible. Hopefully I will know more in the coming weeks. Thanks again! kim",
