      "Content": "Originally Posted by ASAdvocate Chris, your PSA and PHI numbers are excellent for a man on AS. On the other hand, that is a very low free psa, about the lowest that I have seen. Not sure what to make of that. Since the PHI score includes the psa and fpsa numbers in its calculation, that is the overriding result, and it is good. Maybe someone else has an opinion on the fpsa, or it is an error. ASA, Regarding the free PSA% number my Dr. confirmed what you were thinking that the PHI being more accurate trumps the free PSA% by itself. Regards, Chris",

      "Content": "Hello to all, I just got my results back yesterday (of course with no interpretation) for my first PHI test. The results are in my signature but I will also post here: PSA (hybritech) 3.8 ng/ml PSA (% free) 5% PHI 31.0 So it looks like my PSA actually went down from 4.7 to 3.8 or am I confusing with the wrong number? This seems okay but I don't really know and would appreciate any feedback. Best regards, Chris",
