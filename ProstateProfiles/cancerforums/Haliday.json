      "Content": "Haven't posted much. We have just been doubling up on fun and travel. We are 4 years into this journey of Stage 4 and feeling lucky. My signature tells the story. Nick's attitude continues to amaze me. He is jumping at everything life offers-he learned to play guitar, travels to see his favorite teams play and goes on every cruise we invade our savings to pay for. He exercises and takes frequent naps. He loves me. We havent given up a shred of intimacy--it is different, though. We laugh and treasure every moment we have. Sad to see the HT holiday end but 6 months without the toxic Lupron was great. Luck to all. Live your life, live your life.",

      "Content": "After the biopsy, the doc says it is \"real\" cancer, not the watch and wait indolent kind. It is stage T1c; he had Gleason scores of 6 in two cores and 7 (4 +3) in 6 cores for a total of 8 out of 12 . This, along with the high PSA scores of 147 and second test at 103 puts him in a \"high risk\" category according to the literature. So doing NOTHING is not an option. We are sending the slides to Johns Hopkins pathology for a second opinion. It does not appear to have spread beyond the prostate BUT the high PSA might mean micrometaseses according to the doc. So, urology doc sez go with hormonal/radiation route OR Da Vinci robotic surgery for a radical prostatectomy (say THAT three times--we just call this option GDO as in get the damn thing out). We have an appt with a radiology oncologist Monday morning. We are reviewing EVERY treatment option, including HIFU, to assess if it's the right thing for us. Goal of course is to preserve life (VERY doable, this is a curable cancer with great survival and long- term stats). We know my husband is highly likely to die of something other than prostate cancer. And to asses long- term functionality of the two things that penises do. Or as I told the doctor yesterday to his laughter, \"peeing and f******\". Quality of life, people, quality of life. We have been married less than 2 years . We are being deliberate in our decision-making process. And are in an \"all information is good, information-seeking mode\". We have the two top books on the topic and are tied in with two great community discussion groups/chat rooms' including this one! We would like to commit to a treatment plan within a month or so. And then enjoy the holidays, our long-planned trip to Rome and transatlantic cruise. We will tackle this beast in 2014. What else? Oh, his prostate is 76 grams and has urination problems that are annoying but not severe. He is 65 and in excellent health. Kaiser Permanente is our provider--we live south of SF. Dr. Kwon is the diagnosing urologist who told us he has done hundreds of Da Vinci procedures. We welcome sympathy and advice from so many of you who have trod this path before us.",

Having said that, MY first thought was that she may think \"artificial\" means with not being desireable to you. As opposed to your lack of function being completely a physiological thing. (E.g. If he needs to have an erection artificially I must not be enough). Do what you can to reassure her. . .After a year on Lupron, my husband has no desire. Hell the swimsuit issue does nothing for him. BUT, the Viagra is still working and we make regular appointments to have sex once or twice a week. And he loves pleasing me. And I love him for that.",

      "Content": "Update--the fog is lifting on the triple digit PSA. Up at dawn to visit with Dr. Peter Carroll at UCSF. Before the consultation, Nick had a new test-an ultra- sound that actually showed a hidden tumor at the top of his prostate. This was a welcome sighting as, in all likelihood, it explains the high PSA and MAY mean the high PSA does NOT mean micrometateses (to bones, lymph nodes, etc). It is a tumor that is in a tough place to biopsy as well. SO the next steps are a NEW test--this time a PET scan--to confirm the extent of the cancer. And a third PSA test. This will guide the final decision as to treatment option. Doc says 50/50 surgery vs. radiation unless this test reveals that cancer is outside prostate which means radiation and hormone treatments should be the first choice. We are MUCH more inclined to go surgical route if at all possible. Also if PSA drops or is the same, definitely means the high PSA is due to the anterior tumor and NOT micrometaseses. Does this make sense to others in the brotherhood? the Walsh book actually had a paragraph about anterior tumours and high PSAs which I had highlighted. Carroll says we could go with nerve-sparing with high probability for continence, less promising for ED Also, the doc confirmed we are good to wait until January to treat. Hello Rome and Pacific Princess! We plan to squeeze a lot of fun in between now and the end of the year.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Haliday, although it will be great for sure to be rid of many of the HT side effects, I think you both need to have realistic expectations about the time frame. Many men who get off HT for a break find they still continue to have the side effects for an extended period of time. Hopefully you will be one of the lucky ones who experience a quick relief from the side effects. Good Luck Allen Oh Allen we know we know. We are the most realistic people on the planet.

Plan to go back on Casodex/Lupron when PSA hits 5 or so. . .(remember Nick started at 147). Doc sez it is typical to be able to be on holiday for as long as he has been on HT. No more hot flashes, fatigue, hairless armpits, extra 10 pounds or indifference to naked women? I am not sure what he is more excited about.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Bravehardon Haliday, although it will be great for sure to be rid of many of the HT side effects, I think you both need to have realistic expectations about the time frame. Many men who get off HT for a break find they still continue to have the side effects for an extended period of time. Hopefully you will be one of the lucky ones who experience a quick relief from the side effects. Good Luck Allen Oh Allen we know we know. We are the most realistic people on the planet.

Nick has been on lupron since Dec of 13 and we are still having great sex twice a week. Yes, it is scheduled as he started taking Viagra along with the Lupron. He sez he doesn't think about sex all the time like he used to, which is weird. But he loves me and making me happy makes him happy. He doesn't have orgasms and there is no ejaculation but it is intimate and cuddly and wonderful. We will do whatever it takes to maintain this aspect of our life together. If the Vitamin V stops working, we have a drawer full of toys. Good luck. Don't despair. It ain't over till it's over. Until then, grab all the gusto you can get!",

Perhaps you could just show him this thread. And wait. And listen. And stand firm. I also worry that he COULD be rushing into a treatment that MAY not be the right one for HIM. Again, since this affects you too, invoke the right to be a part of the research and decision-making process.

      "Content": "Thanks newporter. I liked the Walsh book. And what wasn't in the walsh book was in the Scardino book. I have run the nonograms. And looked at Han and Partin tables. All very encouraging as to surviving. I will absolutely look at the site you suggested We have some second opinions and consultations within the next few weeks. A big trip planned to Italy in December but plan to hit it hard--leaning towards surgery--in January. Which also gives us time to change medicare supplement insurance to get the best surgeon at one of the national cancer centers with the least out of pocket costs possible!",

Don't get rushed into anything by anybody. We took our time with second opinions and more tests and now have a PLAN. Here's hoping you have a loving partner and/or friends. And read! Read the Patrick Walsh book and the Scardino book. These are my bibles (knowledge calms me). I will follow your journey with interest.",

Talk about sex and intimacy early and often. And keep that part of your relationship vibrant, whatever it takes. Work with your spouse to create a plan for how to talk anout his condition with friends and family. Consider creating a page on a third-party site like caringbridge.org to share medical details so you can prevent the disease from taking over your life. Don't wait to do the things you love--together and individually. Live your life. Live your life.",

      "Content": "My husband Nick has been on Lupron for 17 months now. He, too, was and still is thrilled by the good side effect of peeing like an 18-year old. He started getting hot flashes about a month in. Still has them several times a day. His man boobs sprouted a tiny bit but nothing too terrible. The loss of muscle mass and fatigue is serious. He walks a few times a week and has only gained a few pounds. Takes naps every day. And he has lost most of his body hair. His balls are a tad smaller but nothing lost in the penis size department. He has no sexual desire--which he sez is the oddest side effect after a life of thinking about sex constantly. BUT despite warnings that it may not work from our doc, after 17 months the Viagara works very well. It is \"appointment\" sex but we love every single moment of it. So important to make appointments at least twice a week! He is going on an HT holiday no. Won't have another shot until his PSA creeps back up to 10. He is looking forward to the side effects reversing at least a little. Good luck. Let us know how you are doing!",
