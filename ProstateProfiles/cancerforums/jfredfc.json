Also when sneezing or at work, as I am always up and down at work. So is the spurting versus the constant dribble I had a sign of my Kegels working? I do them twice a day and also at night the flow is greatly reduced. Just wondering if anyone has this experience also and is it a good sign? This almost me to a tee. Same time period and everything. Sometimes its when I get up out of the chair.",

Granted the little lady hasnt been cooperating too much lately but the little man works with Viagra and a ring. I also had neck surgery around New Years but it went great. I take 300mg Wellbutrin daily. Could my hormones be out of wack and causing this? Thanks for the ops.",

I am having my 18 month checkup on the 29th and going to get labs drawn Friday so I can have them when I go to surgeon. I was going to ask them to test my testosterone levels this time. Everytime I get them to test that, my Dr always laughs because one time her nurse checked that I was a female and everything showed I was a true stud. When the nurse called me and told me the results and said Dude you should be a stud, being the cute guy I am, I asked did she want to find out. When they had to redraw it the next week she got her revenge with the needle.",

The frustrated part is that at time, I feel like a sexual cripple. I have tried Cialis and Viagra and they dont help but part of the problem there is that anytime, I try to self-stimulate or my wife tries to, I had leak badly. All I hear from the DR is that it just takes time. It got so bad yesterday when we tried, after completely voiding, I leaked real bad, she said she wanted to stop and I got up and left the house for while so I could go scream and cry for a few minutes. At times I just want to beat my head against the wall. Any thoughts guys?",
