I know the lab results don't change the facts of the biopsy,I'm not having second thoughts... And I don't necessarily want to open up a big debate on the value of psa readings...

Luckily, had no complications and made the nine hour drive back down (with breaks every hour or so to walk around and prevent blood clots) with no issues. One thing I did do before heading up was to set up relationship with a local uro, in case something came up in the weeks/months following the surgery. I am planning on going back up next week for my six/seven week follow up (and probably will do so for most other follow ups), but that was a personal choice to keep the conversation running with the same doc, labs utilized, etc. in my case, it wasn't as important to have a long lasting relationship w a local uro, as I'll be moving from the area within a year.

      "Content": "Tomorrow will be seven weeks since my surgery, and on Wednesday I'll get my first post-op PSA. I wasn't really nervous till this past weekend, but you guys know how that goes... Continence recovery continues to progress, albeit in a non-straight line path. Last week I switched over to Chuck's posted Mayo Clinic kegel instructions, and I think that's helped the dripping a lot better than what I was doing before. Time will tell. For the most part, how tired I am significantly impacts how dry I am... but I think that the fatigue sensitivity is also improving. I've avoided alcohol and caffeine since the surgery, but tried a cup of coffee yesterday... all good. Ironically, if anything, I was drier than before. Hope it continues (surviving work without coffee will be tough...)! On the ED front, zero progress until this past weekend. I've been on daily 50mg Viagra since catheter removal, but might as well have been taking Flintstone vitamins... then last night (with a little coaxing), reached 2/3-mast. Not necessarily usable for any action, but it certainly gave me hope that there's something going on down there. Dry O's will take some getting used to, but I'll settle if that's my only issue! I've been putting off trying the pump (sorry, but the thing looks like a cross between a grenade launcher and a potato gun); might hold off for a few more days to see if I can repeat and exceed last night's progress. Not sure if it's the coffee or yesterday's sorta-wood, but today I feel a LOT more like my old self... Just need to get through this PSA test and hopefully get a clean path report (6-10 weeks for me, using a military hospital... nerve wracking!). Crossing my fingers, thanks to everybody for their informative posts!",

      "Content": "Tomorrow will be seven weeks since my surgery, and on Wednesday I'll get my first post-op PSA. I wasn't really nervous till this past weekend, but you guys know how that goes... Continence recovery continues to progress, albeit in a non-straight line path. Last week I switched over to Chuck's posted Mayo Clinic kegel instructions, and I think that's helped the dripping a lot better than what I was doing before. Time will tell. For the most part, how tired I am significantly impacts how dry I am... but I think that the fatigue sensitivity is also improving. I've avoided alcohol and caffeine since the surgery, but tried a cup of coffee yesterday... all good. Ironically, if anything, I was drier than before. Hope it continues (surviving work without coffee will be tough...)! On the ED front, zero progress until this past weekend. I've been on daily 50mg Viagra since catheter removal, but might as well have been taking Flintstone vitamins... then last night (with a little coaxing), reached 2/3-mast. Not necessarily usable for any action, but it certainly gave me hope that there's something going on down there. Dry O's will take some getting used to, but I'll settle if that's my only issue! I've been putting off trying the pump (sorry, but the thing looks like a cross between a grenade launcher and a potato gun); might hold off for a few more days to see if I can repeat and exceed last night's progress. Not sure if it's the coffee or yesterday's sorta-wood, but today I feel a LOT more like my old self... Just need to get through this PSA test and hopefully get a clean path report (6-10 weeks for me, using a military hospital... nerve wracking!). Crossing my fingers, thanks to everybody for their informative posts!",

      "Content": "Second routine (i.e, quarterly) PSA since my RALP back in January. Still undetectable. Next test in September. Doing great overall. 99% continent - every once in a while I'll get a very minor drip unexpectedly, but more a fluke (or me challenging a fart and losing) than anything else. ED is still very much a work in progress. Doc sent me home with some Muse, which scares me even more than injections. I keep looking at the box of the stuff and think of Arnold the Terminator stating \"I cannot self-terminate.\" We'll see how that goes. All that said, I'm happy with where I stand today. It's hard to believe it's only been five months since the surgery, and most days I don't even think about the disease.",

      "Content": "Another day down. Day 2 gave me a little better idea of what mt weak areas are wrt incontinence. - On the plus side, the burning sensation while peeing has gotten better. Not 100% yet, but definitely doesn't make me wince anymore. - Another dry night in bed. Granted, I got up every four hours or so to empty the bladder, but I'll still claim the win. - Stream strength and actual amount of pee coming out when going to the bathroom is variable. I've been preemptively going every hour or so, so I think there just isn't a heck of a lot to dump overboard. - Control a little improved while seated. On the other hand, really poor control while on my feet.

      "Content": "Update - nine days since catheter removal, and twenty days since the surgery... Bottom line, much improved since the day I got unhitched from the cath, but still a ways to go before declaring victory. Four days after cath removal, I ditched the full up Depends diapers - wasn't all that comfortable, and the heavy duty pads seems to do the same job. I used to be a boxer shorts guy, so it's also been a discovery process on what underwear works for me. Boxer briefs seems to be ok these days. For most of last week, I was intensively (4 sets of ten per day) doing kegels, along with a daily 2.5 to 3 mile walk. Virtually dry while sleeping, mostly dry in the morning, a little leakage while walking (seemed to improve a little during the week), but poor control in the afternoons, especially if I'm on my feet or shift body positions while sitting. I started getting a little sore down in the perineum area towards the end of the week, so I took a two day break from kegels and skipped a walk yesterday. The break seems to have helped a bit - on Saturday, I made it through the day with three pads, and yesterday was a two pad day. Somebody mentioned in another thread to expect all sorts of weird things pee-wise, and that's no joke. It seems whenever there's a blood clot that might be passed, I get a split stream (can be messy), that resolves if there's enough force of flow or once the clot pops out. Also, more bleeding in the urine the last couple of days. I'm thinking that between the exercise break and maybe some healing around plumbing reconstruction, we're starting to see the beginnings of progress. Not much on the ED front. Still taking daily 50mg Viagra at night, but zero results. On a couple of occasions, it felt like the beginning of something, but no liftoff. Not ready to panic just yet, but would like to see some progress. I might wait another week or so before messing with the pump. Stomach incisions are also healing - the superglue is starting to flake, skin starting to itch, and it's all pulling tight if I stand up after sitting for a bit. Aside from the occasional discomfort in the perineum (might be aggravated by the bottom of the pads sometimes bunching up), no pain. At most I grab one 800mg Motrin, and that's been every other day. Finally, weened myself off the Colace. Had my first unassisted BM this morning. Still miss my coffee, beer and scotch, but will hold off until I see more improvement. Sorry for the long entry, but I thought another input to my pee chronicles might help other folks interested in a blow by blow account on recovery progress.",

      "Content": "Catheter removed yesterday, nine days post-op. Was able to pee into a jug and stop the flow ok. Slight leakage (dribbling) on the drive back. Soaked up a pad doing my daily walk. By noon, the floodgates had opened. Never wet my pants but by the time the day was over, I had gone through six pads. Pretty dry overnight, so at least a minor victory. Other observations: - I rarely get the old \"I need to pee\" sensation. I'm assuming that's because the leakage is keeping the bladder level down, plus in general it seems all the body signals are still trying to settle into a new normal ops. - Slight burning sensation when I deliberately pee. None at all when I leak. I'm hoping that's just healing in progress. - still occasional aches and slight shooting pain late in the day in the perineum area. Doc said that was normal. - Prato, I initially saw the same black specs you mention in your post. Looks like tiny clots to me. Question: In the process of building strength back up down there, once you get to a point during the day when you're pretty much uncontrollably leaking... Is it better to just carry on with the day and press on, or should you just shut things down, clean yourself and hit the sack (where there seems to be some dry refuge from the leaking)? I was going to wait another days before resuming the kegels and start my little blue pill regimen.",

      "Content": "Another day down. Day 2 gave me a little better idea of what mt weak areas are wrt incontinence. - On the plus side, the burning sensation while peeing has gotten better. Not 100% yet, but definitely doesn't make me wince anymore. - Another dry night in bed. Granted, I got up every four hours or so to empty the bladder, but I'll still claim the win. - Stream strength and actual amount of pee coming out when going to the bathroom is variable. I've been preemptively going every hour or so, so I think there just isn't a heck of a lot to dump overboard. - Control a little improved while seated. On the other hand, really poor control while on my feet. Even with preemptive bathroom breaks, the slightest odd motion would be accompanied with dribbles. - At the end of the day, took a 2 mile walk, showered, ate cannoli (if I can't have scotch, at least this...), did a set of Kegels, and the sphincter quit.

      "Content": "Another day down. Day 2 gave me a little better idea of what mt weak areas are wrt incontinence. - On the plus side, the burning sensation while peeing has gotten better. Not 100% yet, but definitely doesn't make me wince anymore. - Another dry night in bed. Granted, I got up every four hours or so to empty the bladder, but I'll still claim the win. - Stream strength and actual amount of pee coming out when going to the bathroom is variable. I've been preemptively going every hour or so, so I think there just isn't a heck of a lot to dump overboard. - Control a little improved while seated. On the other hand, really poor control while on my feet. Even with preemptive bathroom breaks, the slightest odd motion would be accompanied with dribbles. - At the end of the day, took a 2 mile walk, showered, ate cannoli (if I can't have scotch, at least this...), did a set of Kegels, and the sphincter quit. Even laying down pretty much no control for about an hour. Then held ok for rest of night while I slept. As a side note, I started the Viagra regimen last night as well. Didn't notice anything, good or bad. Spending most of today seated while making the trek back from MD (where I had surgery) to SC, where we actually live. Will stop every hour or so to walk,, etc. I imagine a little bit drier today since I'll be mostly off my feet. More to follow in the next few days...",

      "Content": "Update - nine days since catheter removal, and twenty days since the surgery... Bottom line, much improved since the day I got unhitched from the cath, but still a ways to go before declaring victory. Four days after cath removal, I ditched the full up Depends diapers - wasn't all that comfortable, and the heavy duty pads seems to do the same job. I used to be a boxer shorts guy, so it's also been a discovery process on what underwear works for me. Boxer briefs seems to be ok these days. For most of last week, I was intensively (4 sets of ten per day) doing kegels, along with a daily 2.5 to 3 mile walk. Virtually dry while sleeping, mostly dry in the morning, a little leakage while walking (seemed to improve a little during the week), but poor control in the afternoons, especially if I'm on my feet or shift body positions while sitting. I started getting a little sore down in the perineum area towards the end of the week, so I took a two day break from kegels and skipped a walk yesterday. The break seems to have helped a bit - on Saturday, I made it through the day with three pads, and yesterday was a two pad day. Somebody mentioned in another thread to expect all sorts of weird things pee-wise, and that's no joke. It seems whenever there's a blood clot that might be passed, I get a split stream (can be messy), that resolves if there's enough force of flow or once the clot pops out. Also, more bleeding in the urine the last couple of days. I'm thinking that between the exercise break and maybe some healing around plumbing reconstruction, we're starting to see the beginnings of progress. Not much on the ED front. Still taking daily 50mg Viagra at night, but zero results. On a couple of occasions, it felt like the beginning of something, but no liftoff. Not ready to panic just yet, but would like to see some progress. I might wait another week or so before messing with the pump. Stomach incisions are also healing - the superglue is starting to flake, skin starting to itch, and it's all pulling tight if I stand up after sitting for a bit. Aside from the occasional discomfort in the perineum (might be aggravated by the bottom of the pads sometimes bunching up), no pain. At most I grab one 800mg Motrin, and that's been every other day. Finally, weened myself off the Colace. Had my first unassisted BM this morning. Still miss my coffee, beer and scotch, but will hold off until I see more improvement. Sorry for the long entry, but I thought another input to my pee chronicles might help other folks interested in a blow by blow account on recovery progress.",

      "Content": "Thanks guys. Jnight, yeah, I'm finally ALMOST completely over the sore throat. At least for me, the irritation actually got worse as I imagine my throat was healing - instead of full-on pain in the throat (esp when waking up), I was getting itches/tickles that caused some coughing fits. That, in turn made my bum hurt worse, some leakage around the catheter tube, etc. Only thing that seemed to calm it down was some Jolly Ranchers (which I usually hate). I agree on the not laying down advice - but I might put off my long walks till later in the day, so that the involved muscles can relax a bit sooner, instead of having a whole day to fight through. Dunno, will have to try and see.",

I was going to wait another days before resuming the kegels and start my little blue pill regimen.",

      "Content": "Update - nine days since catheter removal, and twenty days since the surgery... Bottom line, much improved since the day I got unhitched from the cath, but still a ways to go before declaring victory. Four days after cath removal, I ditched the full up Depends diapers - wasn't all that comfortable, and the heavy duty pads seems to do the same job. I used to be a boxer shorts guy, so it's also been a discovery process on what underwear works for me. Boxer briefs seems to be ok these days. For most of last week, I was intensively (4 sets of ten per day) doing kegels, along with a daily 2.5 to 3 mile walk. Virtually dry while sleeping, mostly dry in the morning, a little leakage while walking (seemed to improve a little during the week), but poor control in the afternoons, especially if I'm on my feet or shift body positions while sitting. I started getting a little sore down in the perineum area towards the end of the week, so I took a two day break from kegels and skipped a walk yesterday. The break seems to have helped a bit - on Saturday, I made it through the day with three pads, and yesterday was a two pad day. Somebody mentioned in another thread to expect all sorts of weird things pee-wise, and that's no joke. It seems whenever there's a blood clot that might be passed, I get a split stream (can be messy), that resolves if there's enough force of flow or once the clot pops out. Also, more bleeding in the urine the last couple of days. I'm thinking that between the exercise break and maybe some healing around plumbing reconstruction, we're starting to see the beginnings of progress. Not much on the ED front. Still taking daily 50mg Viagra at night, but zero results. On a couple of occasions, it felt like the beginning of something, but no liftoff. Not ready to panic just yet, but would like to see some progress. I might wait another week or so before messing with the pump. Stomach incisions are also healing - the superglue is starting to flake, skin starting to itch, and it's all pulling tight if I stand up after sitting for a bit. Aside from the occasional discomfort in the perineum (might be aggravated by the bottom of the pads sometimes bunching up), no pain. At most I grab one 800mg Motrin, and that's been every other day. Finally, weened myself off the Colace. Had my first unassisted BM this morning. Still miss my coffee, beer and scotch, but will hold off until I see more improvement. Sorry for the long entry, but I thought another input to my pee chronicles might help other folks interested in a blow by blow account on recovery progress.",

      "Content": "Another day down. Day 2 gave me a little better idea of what mt weak areas are wrt incontinence. - On the plus side, the burning sensation while peeing has gotten better. Not 100% yet, but definitely doesn't make me wince anymore. - Another dry night in bed. Granted, I got up every four hours or so to empty the bladder, but I'll still claim the win. - Stream strength and actual amount of pee coming out when going to the bathroom is variable. I've been preemptively going every hour or so, so I think there just isn't a heck of a lot to dump overboard. - Control a little improved while seated. On the other hand, really poor control while on my feet. Even with preemptive bathroom breaks, the slightest odd motion would be accompanied with dribbles. - At the end of the day, took a 2 mile walk, showered, ate cannoli (if I can't have scotch, at least this...), did a set of Kegels, and the sphincter quit. Even laying down pretty much no control for about an hour. Then held ok for rest of night while I slept. As a side note, I started the Viagra regimen last night as well. Didn't notice anything, good or bad. Spending most of today seated while making the trek back from MD (where I had surgery) to SC, where we actually live. Will stop every hour or so to walk,, etc. I imagine a little bit drier today since I'll be mostly off my feet. More to follow in the next few days...",

      "Content": "Another day down. Day 2 gave me a little better idea of what mt weak areas are wrt incontinence. - On the plus side, the burning sensation while peeing has gotten better. Not 100% yet, but definitely doesn't make me wince anymore. - Another dry night in bed. Granted, I got up every four hours or so to empty the bladder, but I'll still claim the win. - Stream strength and actual amount of pee coming out when going to the bathroom is variable. I've been preemptively going every hour or so, so I think there just isn't a heck of a lot to dump overboard. - Control a little improved while seated. On the other hand, really poor control while on my feet. Even with preemptive bathroom breaks, the slightest odd motion would be accompanied with dribbles. - At the end of the day, took a 2 mile walk, showered, ate cannoli (if I can't have scotch, at least this...), did a set of Kegels, and the sphincter quit. Even laying down pretty much no control for about an hour. Then held ok for rest of night while I slept. As a side note, I started the Viagra regimen last night as well. Didn't notice anything, good or bad. Spending most of today seated while making the trek back from MD (where I had surgery) to SC, where we actually live. Will stop every hour or so to walk,, etc. I imagine a little bit drier today since I'll be mostly off my feet. More to follow in the next few days...",

Their protocol post-surgery is a little different - basically, stuck in bed the first night for observation (don't remember most of yesterday), then transferred back to my room early this morning with freedom to walk as much as I want.

No gas pains, just a little discomfort around the catheter entry and weakened ab muscles. Passed gas several times, and finally enjoying some solids.

      "Content": "Still awaiting the results of my pathology report from getting RALP'd back in late January. The good news is my PSA this week was undetectable, but the surgeon off-handedly mentioned that if the path report came back with positive margins, she'd be inclined to recommend Adjuvant Radiation treatment. The more I think about it, the more this freaks me out, esp. since the problem spot on my (now removed) prostate was on the left apex and I had a small but palpable nodule via DRE. That said, my PSA never got high (in fact, it was at its lowest level the week before surgery) and I'm very much hoping that my Gleason 3+3 won't get bumped up in the pathology. Does this mindset seem a bit too aggressive? I guess my main concern is not being 100% yet on the continence recovery (I think I'm doing well, but I'd like to see more recovery before being happy that my current state is as good as it gets for the rest of my life), and have seen barely any progress on ED. My understanding from reading posts on this forum is that radiation following surgery will essentially ensure that you'll never get better on the urine/ED functionality than where you were when you started zapping away. I'm told the reason why the pathology is taking so long is because the lab Bethesda uses takes a lot more slices than the conventional 'quartering' technique. Therefore more slides, more to analyze, yadi-yada. Even though the PSA result was great news, I think I'm now more freaked out than I've been since this journey started... argh.",
