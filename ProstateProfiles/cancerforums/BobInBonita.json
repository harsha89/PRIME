I wish you didn't have to be here, but we have countless years of direct experience as either patients or caregivers, so hopefully will be able to answer your questions. I'm assuming that you have prostate cancer, since you're dealing with a urologist for surgery. I'm moving your post to the \"prostate\" forum where guys will be most likely to have experience with the downward facing position and possibly glaucoma. Best wishes for successful surgery. Bob",
