      "Content": "I'm six weeks post-RALP and still have tenderness/slight soreness in my testicles. In fact, it has been surprising how sore and for how long. The swelling has nearly subsided, and the color is no longer eggplant purple, but the soreness remains. It has gradually improved over time, but I was not prepared for the level or duration of this pain. Like another post said, support seems to help so ditch the saggy boxers and buy some hugging type of underwear. I noticed an immediate improvement when those big swollen balls weren't swinging around down there! In fact, it was the connecting tissue and not my actual testicles that had the most pain as time went on. Don't get me wrong; my testicles hurt like hell for the first four weeks post-op, but the tissue inside my scrotum that connects to each testicle remains sore even now, six weeks later. For underwear, I like the Champion boxer-brief made from dry-fit fiber. They're lightweight, breathable and cool, plus a 4-pack at Target only costs $24.00. They also help hold pads in place very well and dry quickly if a dribble leaks out. Good luck and know that it does get better.",

I am now in that surreal place between diagnosis and RALP surgery, each day trying to function normally while feeling a strange cognitive dissonance in this new world. I know that none of us can ever really know how we will react until we hear those words, but I was not prepared for the profound psychological impact my cancer diagnosis would have on me. I would really like to hear from other men about how they cope with the sheer weight of the word. How do you stay positive? How do you maintain that \"brave face\" in front of your wife when you're fighting back tears, knowing that you have to stay strong for her? I don't want my fear (and it is significant, of course) to seep into her psyche. I know she has plenty of her own fear without seeing me so emotionally sensitive.

I went to the Johns Hopkins website and learned that this service costs $800. The Urology Dept has a flat rate of $550 and there's an additional $250 for prostate path. Since this is self-pay and not an insignificant sum, I'm wondering if anyone can advise me on their experiences with this or any other provider.",

      "Content": "Thanks for all the great advice. My search for answers is more about the next phase of the journey, after surgery. I never really doubted my Uro that RALP was the best option. I just thought maybe another reading of my slides, if significantly different, might potentially give me a glimpse of my post-surgery prognosis with respect to radiation. I have one of those minds that is always looking at the next step, trying to see where the dominoes will fall before they are set in motion, always looking for danger on the horizon. I'm a scientist by trade, and I can't help but try to understand everything I possibly can about a subject. I often joke to friends and colleagues that I'm a slow learner, bur when I learn something, I know it up one side and down the other! After reading your excellent responses, and doing much research on my own, I realize that with PC, the only way to know what comes after is to first do the next thing. And then deal with the next thing, whatever that might be. I'm not looking forward to the pain, incontinence, ED, but I am ready, hell eager, for the next step. This forum and your sincere responses have helped move me in the right direction.",

They will be frozen and the pathology report will come at the same time as the report on my prostate. Is this SOP for someone with my numbers? Did I misunderstand her? Also, what are the implications of a negative result from a lymph node biopsy? Is it an indication that PC has spread to other tissues/organs? Thanks in advance for any insight.",

      "Content": "David - congrats on such a great recovery, and thanks for sharing your story. Staying in a positive place mentally can be difficult at times, but hearing of your success really makes all of us feel better. The reminder to stay in a positive place and be mindful of the good things in your life is wise advice. My wife and I just spent four days with our niece, her husband and their beautiful daughters. We ate, drank, played games and just reveled in being together. My RALP is January 24. This time with them has been an elixir. Thanks again for reminding us to focus on the things that bring us joy. It really does help.",
