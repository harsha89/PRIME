      "Content": "My PSA was rising after surgery, but before Lupron and radiation, which were done together. So I was never on Lupron alone. With a few weeks to go in radiation, I was at .02, which was encouraging (but not 0!). I feel good energy-wise, in pretty good shape, did a 5 mile hike on Sunday. Bowels have been frequent and loose (or worse) during the treatment, but cutting caffeine helped a lot. They say I should be back to \"normal\" in 2-4 weeks, at least from the radiation effects. I literally had my morning routine down to the minute to walk into radiation full but not so full I lost it. (which happened once; embarrassing!)",

I already know that what was left behind in me was aggressive, as it had a one month doubling rate. So I'm concerned with any number right now. My main side effect from Lupron is the hot flashes. I have them pretty often, and it does mess with my sleeping a little. Besides the other huge effect on libido, it's not a problem. I also have some very minor bowel problems (smaller, looser, more often) from the radiation. Over all, the greatest challenge is having empy bowels and a completely full bladder at a specific time every day. (This helps move that stuff aside and away from the beam). Very uncomfortable!",

I had my annual physical yesterday (creature of habit, I guess) and asked for a PSA test. My doctors have said before that on hormones it should be \"non-detectable\" now, but my test came back .02 -- not <.02 Cause for worry? Thoughts? I'm waiting on them for answer too.",

      "Content": "I meant \"0\" to be the same as \"undetectable\". My understanding is that any measurable PSA more than a few months after RP is cancer. I would love to be wrong about that! I already know that what was left behind in me was aggressive, as it had a one month doubling rate. So I'm concerned with any number right now. My main side effect from Lupron is the hot flashes. I have them pretty often, and it does mess with my sleeping a little. Besides the other huge effect on libido, it's not a problem. I also have some very minor bowel problems (smaller, looser, more often) from the radiation. Over all, the greatest challenge is having empy bowels and a completely full bladder at a specific time every day. (This helps move that stuff aside and away from the beam). Very uncomfortable!",

So I had my surgery done at Santa Monica UCLA. Dr. Chamie is my Urologist and Dr. Wong did anaethesia. He had to take a little extra urethra because it looked suspicious for cancer outside the prostate, but he did save my sphincter. Also took a bunch of lymph nodes. I was unconscious before reaching the operating room, so I didn't get to meet my machine. Spent one night in the hospital (ZERO sleep thanks to some nurse or whoever coming in every 30 minutes), and was discharged yesterday. Six incision sites. So now its pain control (hydrocodone) and getting used to this annoying catheter and bag (comes out on May 26, next Thursday). I'm eating okay but haven't had a BM yet; I hope that happens today, I think I'll be more comfortable. Anyone get referred shoulder pain? Maybe from gas/pressure; it can be as bad as the incision sites. I'll post my progress in this thread as I recover. Thanks again guys, now we wait and see if they got it all. Fingers crossed.

      "Content": "Had my DaVinci on Monday, came home yesterday. I was much more confident thanks to all of you. My first post was \"post-op questions\". So I had my surgery done at Santa Monica UCLA. Dr. Chamie is my Urologist and Dr. Wong did anaethesia. He had to take a little extra urethra because it looked suspicious for cancer outside the prostate, but he did save my sphincter. Also took a bunch of lymph nodes. I was unconscious before reaching the operating room, so I didn't get to meet my machine. Spent one night in the hospital (ZERO sleep thanks to some nurse or whoever coming in every 30 minutes), and was discharged yesterday. Six incision sites. So now its pain control (hydrocodone) and getting used to this annoying catheter and bag (comes out on May 26, next Thursday). I'm eating okay but haven't had a BM yet; I hope that happens today, I think I'll be more comfortable. Anyone get referred shoulder pain? Maybe from gas/pressure; it can be as bad as the incision sites. I'll post my progress in this thread as I recover. Thanks again guys, now we wait and see if they got it all. Fingers crossed. I need to know which brand of diaper is best, what did you all use? Is Tenna good? I have a coupon, lol.",

      "Content": "Hi all, Just a quick update. My first post-op PSA is 0.03 -- it's not a perfect zero, but the Uro thinks it could be a bit of benign tissue left behind. So I'm fine for the next three months and/or for as long as it stays under 0.1 I'm continent unless jumping or jogging, just a drop escapes now and then, no getting up at night. Sexual function is at 80-90%, just a little weird, but good. Thanks for all the support, next update in 90 days!",
