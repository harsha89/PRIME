      "Content": "I am 7 months out from surgery with a PSA of <0.02 at 2, 3, and 7 months. PSA before surgery was 5.2. I had a Acinar Adenocarcinoma Gleason 4+3 that was fully contained AND a Ductal Adenocarcinoma Gleason 8 that had a small <2mm focal margin on pathology. Fat removed around focal margin during surgery showed no signs of cancer. My question is the following: Will I know if the Ductal Adenocarcinoma cancer is spreading? Will it give of enough prostate specific antigen to detect a rise in PSA or am I blindly thinking I'm cured by my low PSA numbers when in reality my ductal cancer is spreading. A bone scan or CAT scan will only show cancer when it already has spread. By then it is too late for a cure. I guess I want to know if I can rely on low PSA reading to confirm ductal cancer has not spread. Anyone have any experience with this? My surgeon said ductal gives off PSA just like acinar but I have heard conflicting opinions on this. Even if it doesn't give off as much as an acinar adenocarcinoma will it give off enough to detect a PSA rise?",

      "Content": "Hi Nick, Surgery went well. I was the second surgery of the day for Dr. Ahlering. First surgery went 5 hours as the guy had 2 hernias to repair as well as the prostate removal. Was waiting from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM in pre op before surgery. Surgery lasted 3 hours. Dr. said prostate came out easily so I am assuming that is a good sign. He is cautiously optimistic. Will have pathology report a week from today. Two days later no blood in urine. 6 incisions show no sign of infection. Stomach swollen and incisions hurt. Will get catheter out next Tuesday. Prostate weighed 67 grams. Doctor told me to walk 2 miles a day! How did your surgery go. How are you doing. Steve",

Both of which I did not have. Just food for thought for anyone considering surgery.",

      "Content": "I had a prostate MRI two days ago. This was 5 weeks after ultrasound biopsy. MRI confirmed presence of Gleason 8 and Gleason 6 tumors and high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Final impression was that there is no sign of extension of disease outside the prostate. Seminal vesicles are normal. Had the MRI reviewed by my Radiation Oncologist. He informed me that MRI's are only 80% accurate and that it it is a highly aggressive Gleason 8 tumor the tentacles could actually extend beyond the capsule and the MRI would not pick that up. So all good news is tempered with more uncertainty. Meeting with surgeons tomorrow and next Tuesday. Guess I won't know how far I am out of the woods till after surgery.",

Date PSA 10/10/2008 2.3 9/18/2012 2.6 8/25/2015 4.5 9/17/2015 3.4 12/30/2015 3.28 4/15/2016 4.05 8/11/2016 4.66 8/17/2016 3.9 1/11/2017 3.9 7/14/2017 5.1 8/21/2017 5.78 Had prostatitis 11/7/2017 4.4 2/10/2018 5.2 2/14/2018 5.05 After my PSA hit 5.78 with prostatitis it dropped to 4.4. We thought it was going to continue to drop to 3.9 but when it went back up we decided to do a biopsy. The biopsy showed 2 of 12 cores had cancer. The middle of the prostate sample had the Gleason score of 4/4 for 40% of the sample. The bottom right core had a Gleason score of 3/3 for 10% of sample. I live in Southern California and there are two excellent RALP surgeons here. Dr. Tim Wilson and Dr. Tom Ahlering. Both have done thousands of robotic assisted laproscopic surgeries. I am still going to meet with a radiation oncologist next week but I am pretty sure I want surgery. I worry about the fact that 1) If the radiation does not get all the cancer I cannot have surgery due to scar tissue formation, and 2) accidental radiation to nerves, rectum, and bladder. God forbid the radiation hits my nerves and cooks them. With a good robotic assisted laproscopic surgeon I am confident that I will regain continence and sexual ability. I would be interested in your opinion of what you would do under my circumstances now that you have had your cancer treatment and know my circumstances. Do you think I am going about this the right way?",

The middle of the prostate sample had the Gleason score of 4/4 for 40% of the sample. The bottom right core had a Gleason score of 3/3 for 10% of sample. I live in Southern California and there are two excellent RALP surgeons here. Dr. Tim Wilson and Dr. Tom Ahlering. Both have done thousands of robotic assisted laproscopic surgeries. I am still going to meet with a radiation oncologist next week but I am pretty sure I want surgery. I worry about the fact that 1) If the radiation does not get all the cancer I cannot have surgery due to scar tissue formation, and 2) accidental radiation to nerves, rectum, and bladder. God forbid the radiation hits my nerves and cooks them. With a good robotic assisted laproscopic surgeon I am confident that I will regain continence and sexual ability. I would be interested in your opinion of what you would do under my circumstances now that you have had your cancer treatment and know my circumstances. Do you think I am going about this the right way?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Leach, there are 3 studies on intraductal PCa in the Subforum, Thread (D) #15. You can read the full texts, but from a quick look at the abstracts, it appears that the risk seems centered on the increased likelihood of there being a higher Gleason score and greater chance of adverse pathology findings at surgery. You appear to have come out on top in that regard, with only a G8 (and not 9 or 10), a minute positive margin, Club Zero PSA, and nothing else! Ask your docs, but I think you are with the rest of us in the prostate-contained, high G group: we are optimistic, but will have to keep out eye on our more frequent PSA testing going forward. Let's enjoy life! Let us know your docs' thoughts on your results so we'll all be more informed. You might consider or ask about the value of genomic testing of your removed prostate tissue. Not in the zero club. Will get first PSA test on June 18th. Having Decipher test done. Waiting on results.",

      "Content": "I finally looked at my pathology report. I had gotten married and had been out of town for the last month. I had robotic surgery at UCI by Dr. Thomas Ahlering on April 18th. I was his 1741 patient. I am now 6 weeks out and have no incontinence. I also am able to get an errection although I have to admit an orgasm is nothing like it was before the surgery. Here are the highights: A. Anterior prostate fat, excision: Benign fibroadipose tissue. B. Adenocarcinoma, ductal-type, Gleason 4+4=8 (grade group 4), left mid medial, 0.7cm -Additional foci of adenocarcinoma Acinar-type Gleason 3+4 (15%) =7 (grade group 2), multifocal, bilateral, largest 1.1 cm -Organ confined Extraprostatic Extension - Not Identified Seminal Invasion - Not Identified Lymphovascular invasion - Not identified Margins (specimen): Apical / Distal Focally Positive in anterior, <2mm (anterior prostate fat -negative) Bladder neck/Proximal: Negative Prostate surface: Negative Perineural Invasion: Not Identified Vas Deferens: Negative for tumor Pathological staging: pT2. What the surgeon told me was that they found foci cancer cells on the surface of the prostate but the surrounding tissue was negative for cancer cells. Don't know if that is going to be a problem or not. Any comments?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by DjinTonic Leach, there are 3 studies on intraductal PCa in the Subforum, Thread (D) #15. You can read the full texts, but from a quick look at the abstracts, it appears that the risk seems centered on the increased likelihood of there being a higher Gleason score and greater chance of adverse pathology findings at surgery. You appear to have come out on top in that regard, with only a G8 (and not 9 or 10), a minute positive margin, Club Zero PSA, and nothing else! Ask your docs, but I think you are with the rest of us in the prostate-contained, high G group: we are optimistic, but will have to keep out eye on our more frequent PSA testing going forward. Let's enjoy life! Let us know your docs' thoughts on your results so we'll all be more informed. You might consider or ask about the value of genomic testing of your removed prostate tissue. Not in the zero club. Will get first PSA test on June 18th. Having Decipher test done. Waiting on results.",

I was waiting from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM in a pre op bed before surgery. Surgery lasted 3 hours. Dr. Ahlering said prostate came out easily, no sticking to anything so I am assuming that is a good sign. He is cautiously optimistic. Will have pathology report a week from today. Two days later no blood in urine. 6 incisions show no sign of infection. Stomach quite swollen and incisions hurt, especially if I cough. Will get catheter out next Tuesday. Can't wait. Had first poop yesterday. What a relief. Taking stool softeners twice daily, drinking prune juice three times a day and using 400mg Motrin for pain. First day post op I had a fever of 100.4 for a while but now it is back down to normal. Prostate weighed 67 grams. Doctor told me to walk 2 miles a day! Glad my wife is a nurse. LOL. Taking it one day at a time. Thanks for all your support.",
