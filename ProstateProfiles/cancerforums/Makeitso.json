      "Content": "Hello all. This is my first post I\u0092m a 54 year old father of 2 who has had a history of Chronic Prostitus and elevated PSA. Last year doctor performed Biopsy on Prostate (40 core samples) and under twilight (like colonoscopy) that resulted in negative detection. Throughout 2017 PSA remained high and urologist recommended a Prostate MRI. MRI detected a 1.5 cm echo abnormality and now recommending a Fusion Biopsy. He informed me this Biopsy is performed in office not in Hospital. He stated for the FB they will perform a prosthetic block (gel), medication around prostate (I\u0092m assuming shots to numb nerves in prostate) and Valium to calm my but down. Or I could option to get template Biopsy (another 40 core sample procedure) in hospital and be put under like last year. He said they will use MRI results to zero in on the area in question and take more samples than FB but he couldn\u0092t guarantee that they will hit the exact spot. So I\u0092m at a decision point here, do I suck it up and deal with the discomfort and pain to do the fusion biopsy in the office but hit the spot in question? Or opt for the template Biopsy so that I can be put under but not have the gaurentee of hitting the sweet spot in question even though they\u0092ll be doing 40 samples vs 12. I am a very big chicken. But I have read on some of the message board posts that the worst part is self imposed anxiety I\u0092m putting myself through. I can accept some pricks of pain here and there. Any input from you all would be greatly appreciated. I feel stupid that I\u0092m himming and haughing about the biopsy and have yet to face the real tough decisions I hope I will not have to make. I would like to make the decision in the next few days so any of your valued input and time is so so much appreciated. Thanks Big Baby",
