      "Content": " Hi, i'm new to this but I thought I would give it a try. Maybe someone can help me. I am 28 yrs. old and I have been having pain and a green/black discharge for about\n a year now. I finally went to the doc. in March he was concerned so he ordered an ultrasound to be done asap. I went they said I had fibrocystic changes and two complex cysts in my right breast they never checked the left one.  They said for me to go back in 6 months for another u/s. My doc wasn't happy with this he said I should  be checked right away. He sent me to a surgeon. I assumed a biopsy or something would be done. Nothing was the Doc. felt around and said there is nothing wrong with you they say I am too young to worry about\n anything. I have two friends with breast cancer and they tell me that what I explain doesn't sound normal. My family feels I should get a couple more opinons. What do you think anything will help. I'm at a loss.\n ",
