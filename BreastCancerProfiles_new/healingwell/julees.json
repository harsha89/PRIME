      "Content": "   I am 42 years old. When I was 29 I had cervical cancer and had to have a hysterectomy. about six months ago I had a colonoscopy; they found \"something\"   but said they caught it in time. Last week I had my first mammogram (Yes, I know, STUPID!). Anyways, they told me that my right breast is asymmetrical and I have to go in for another mammogram.   So, the question: Can a person be \"prone\" to cancer? I know cancer can run in families and such, but if you have cancer once (maybe going there twice if not caught?), does that mean your body is more likely to be making crazy cells?   Thanks for any input. I know this is probably a stupid question, but honestly, I hate having to ask questions so have never gone there with my doctors. Yes, I know (again), STUPID! I like to pretend I'm very positive and not worrying about it with my doctors and, even more so, my family. But then when you're alone the questions start running through your mind, you know?   Thanks again ",
