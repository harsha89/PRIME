      "Content": " So I had my contrast mammogram..they told me what they are looking for are hotspots and cellular changes..the first minute of the contrast gave me a hot throat and my behind felt hot..they said it would feel like I was peeing myself which it did..then I had an ultra sound which they said was to have a good look because sometimes the tissue is folded over and they cant see..it was kind of uncomfortable..so now I wait again ..this will be a long stressful wait....
