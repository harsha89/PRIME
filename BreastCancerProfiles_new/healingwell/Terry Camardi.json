    "Content": " So here I am 5 years later after being prescribed Letrozole and yes sex is extremely painful. Lubricants help a bit. I'm married to my childhood sweetheart & he's Italian. \n Also my finger joints hurt at night. Always tired. Terrible hot flashes. \nSo my doc put me on an antidepressant for the hot flashes (Venlafaxine). It worked. \nAlways tired...my doc said it cd be from being on an antidepressant...since I would not normally need one. \nI am excited that it's almost my 5 year mark so I can get off these meds & hopefully feel like my old self real soon.
