    "Content": " I just found this site as I was checking yet more medical sites about\n BC.\nA routine mammo turned up suspicious Microcalcifications yesterday. The Dr. suggested either waiting 6 months for another mammo or biopsy-he said his level of suspicion is very low but the only way he can be 100% is via biopsy. I have a biopsy scheduled but I am almost regretting it because of the agonizing wait and fear!\n I'm writing because it really does help to read about\n/hear from others in similar situations. And my heart goes out to the young woman,Melissa, who lost family members recently in a car accident. Just remember, the chance that you have breast cancer at your age is SMALL. I would say try not to worry but it is much easier to say when you're not the one awaiting tests and news!!! Also, I am not someone who thinks everyone needs meds for everything but because you have been through so much and are having such a terrible time right now, you may want to ask your doctor for a few anti-anxiety pills (Xanax for example) just to help get you through the next few days. \nBest ",
