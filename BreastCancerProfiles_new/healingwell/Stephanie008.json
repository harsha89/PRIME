I went in for a mammo and they found cluster microcalcifications. They did the biopsy and it came back Stage I cancer. I had radiation treatment and so far I have been cancer free for 1 year. I go again in 6 months for retesting. I understand your concern. When I had my biopsy it took them almost 3 weeks to get back to me as to whether it was cancer or not. It was a nightmare waiting all this time and worrying did not help me at all. I am hopeful that you will be okay. Please keep us posted. Keep your faith as when these things happen, the best thing is to pray and always keep your faith. ",

      "Content": " I was diagnosed with breast cancer, Stage I in 2008. I was very lucky to have had it caught so early.  I had radiation treatment for almost 2 months. I got my year mammo back in June and they stated that there was some scar tissue or they thought it was scar tissue due to the radiation, and to follow up in 6 months. I just went for my 6 month check up and the scar tissue is still there. According to radiologist it shouldn't really be there so he is recommending a stereotactic biopsy to confirm what it is that he sees.  He wants to make sure it is scar tissue and not a growing tumor.  I am a bit nervous.  Has anyone had a stereotactic biopsy. What should I expect?  One of the symptoms I had before I was diagnosed with breast cancer was itchyness.  I am scared because my breast is itchy again and it scares me a lot.  Anyone has any input or any itching and had breast cancer?  Thank you.\n ",

      "Content": " Bev,\nI had the same thing told to me by physicians, that itchiness had nothing to do with diagnosis. I disagree. I believe itchiness has a lot to do with diagnosis. Before I was diagnosed with BC, I lived in Boston and I continually complained of itchiness and burning on the left breast. Docs kept telling me it's due to exercise not anything to worry about\n. Even my mammo showed calcification and I continued to complain about\n itchiness and swelling and burning, they continued to tell me nothing. When I moved to FL I went in for my routine mammo and they found calcification and the doc in Florida decided to biopsied. Well guess what? I had Stage I cancer and I knew it because I know my body and I just knew that was not normal. After my biopsy and treatment, the itchiness, burning and irritation stopped. After almost 2 years after treatment, I am experiencing some itchiness again so now I am not sure if this is due to the healing process post radiation or if something is going on. My doc does not think it is back but she is going to compare all xrays and let me know if it could be the pins I have in the breast to note the area of radiation that could possibly be irritating me this time. Bottomline, you know your body and I knew back then when I was itchy and burning that this was not normal. Thank God I moved and my new doc found the breast cancer early enough to save my breast too. Amen!!! ",

That is the area that the MRI and Radiologists cannot detect as completely clear because of the possibility that it could and could not be. No guessing on this. My biopsy will be in February.

I have a very good friend of mine who is only 26 years old and she has Lupus. She was hospitalized in August of 2010 and almost lost her life. She was in remission for 10 years, but thank God she is much better now. Is there a reason why you decided to not do reconstruction surgery? is it because your body will not be able to handle due to SLE? I am just curious because I know that this is a tough decisioon to make. I also know of someone who was diagnosed with MS at the age of 19 and then later in life breast cancer. She opted out of reconstruction surgery because the doctors recommended that her body will not be able to handle it due to her MS. My thoughts and prayers are with you. keep up in touch with your progress. I am glad you are in this forum. \nsimplistic007 ",
