    "Content": " Not a BC patient. I did have melanoma. \n Perhaps try a diet that is low in grains/sugar - and molds. NO peanut butter. NO CORN! No grains at all. I believe there are those that feel the molds in our foods can contribute to many cancers. Aflatoxin is a big one - but it is almost secret! (We buy ONLY grass fed/grass finished beef and bison. Free range organic fed--bug eating chickens/turkeys. Wild caught salmon. Cod. No canned anything--unless certified bpa free. Organic body products and makeup. Hair products are carefully screen for toxins/chemicals.)\nAntibiotic use has been seen as a causative in many breast tissue cancers. Our food is full of AB.\n Check for any fungal/yeast infections! If they are in nails - there could be others. \n Iwould get my gut health in order quick. Immunity and mental issues are handled by your gut. I kid you not. \n Got a good epa/dha omega 3 fish oil? Fermented food probiotic. \nProbiotics should be in the form of a CLEAN non-sweetened with anything unless YOU sweeten it - yogurt or kefir. I go for goat...easier on the tummy. May sweeten with mashed blueberries and just a bit of organic LEAF ONLY stevia. \n Bread and corn is the enemy. It is in everything. Try to remove it all. Please. :)\nNo soy, either. Ug. That stuff is bad. Go for fermented. \n I follow Dr. Brownstein protocol. Dr. Flechas. I found thru: Breast Cancer Choices.\n My daughter and I are on Iodoral every day since 2010. There are other supps to take along with the iodine. I am so happy I found that site. So happy I began the iodine. It gave me my life back.\n ",
