    "Content": " I am a 42 year old woman, started Tamoxifen just over a year ago. During the course of that time, I have had two situations of extreme anxiety when running workshops/acting as a panelist before large groups of people for work. The first time, I chalked up the professional \"train wreck\" to a fried nervous system after the radiation. The latest episode not as easy to explain. Although in complete command of what I am saying and not nervous before going up to speak, a swell of paralyzing anxiety has overcome me in both situations, making it nearly impossible to complete my presentations, wobbly voice and all, even though I simply want to get on with it ... I realize I can't blame all my problems on Tamoxifen but wondered if anyone has had a similar experience? Many thanks! ",
