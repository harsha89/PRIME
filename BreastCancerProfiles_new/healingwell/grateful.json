    "Content": " I'm a year past chemo (taxol, carboplatin) and Herceptin. I see online I have 50/50 chance of surviving HER 2 positive -er-pr 5 years. After that the stats get better--something like 69% chance to get to 10 years. Feeling much more optimistic and at peace with all this now, but think I'll never be carefree again. Have a wonderful life--want desperately to stay well! \nMy doctor says I have a \"fair chance\" of surviving this. Would love some success stories. \nAny advice? Many thanks--and good wishes to all.
