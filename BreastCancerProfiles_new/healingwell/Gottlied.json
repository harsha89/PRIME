    "Content": " I have suffered breast cancer at my youth, 20-year-old. At first I had severe pains in one of my breasts, and there was also a some-what large and hard lump in the same one. However my other breast seemed perfectly normal. I don't know if this had anything to even do with it.I went to the doctor, I would like to know what this meaned, and if it meaned that i might have breast cancer. Was it even possible to have breast cancer at age 20? \nFortunately, I went to the doctor and get an accurate diagnosis and correct treatment. I am fine now.I have paid 200% attention to breast health and how to prevent breast cancer.\n ",
