      "Content": " I went to my gyn. last year with a complaint of a small hard nodule in my right breast beneath the nipple.  She thought it was nothing to worry about\n.  A year later it is still here.  The thing is that it is the same size as it was.  Never got bigger.   I am going back in a month for a re-check but is that a good sign that it is the same size? Would it be bigger by now if it were cancer?  It is smaller than a pea and round.  just need a lil peace of mind.  Going to the dooctor anyhow.  Thanks so much!
