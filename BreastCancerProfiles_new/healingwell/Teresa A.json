      "Content": " I am new here, this is my first post.  My mother was diagnosed with dcis in 2000 (pre-menopause at age 42) with calcifications to the other breast.  She opted for a mast. on both sides.  I also have an aunt that had breast cancer, another with ovarian cancer, and one with cervical cancer.  I was wondering if anyone here has had genetic testing?  I don't think it is something my insurance would cover and I am concerned about\n the cost.  I had my first mammogram this year and it was fine (I'm 31).  I would love to hear from anyone that has had experience with genetic testing.  Thanks,\n ",

      "Content": " Thank you for your replies!  I called my insurance company today and they do cover genetic testing in some instances.  I will have to see my doctor first to get referred.  I would consider getting a mastectomy as a preventative measure as well.  After watching my mom go through hell I will do just about\n anything to avoid that.  Thanks again,\n ",
