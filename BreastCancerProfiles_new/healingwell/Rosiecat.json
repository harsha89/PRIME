      "Content": " Thank you all for your kind words and for information on whats coming up. I think that I will call my ins tomorrow to ask about\n going to the breast center. That way Tuesday I will already know if ins will cover it and can let my doc know. We also got a digital mammo machine at our local hospital (they have been running all kinds of commercials) so at least I will know that I am getting advanced care. Again I thank you all for your support. Hopefully Tuesday will bring good news and will help to ease my mind. ",

LOL!\nI called today thinking that maybe they would have the results back but not yet. I guess I will just have to wait until my appt on Wed. I will update after I find out what it is.\n ",

      "Content": " I just turned 33 last month.  Quick history: Pre-cancer cells on cervix with cone biopsy removal at 21.  No children, although I did fertility treatments for years (which worries me because of all the extra hormones)  I had a hyst last Dec due to severe endo.  I still have my right ovary but had to remove my left due to damage.  My mat-grandmother and a mat aunt both had breast cancer. Don't know if other cancers matter but I also have many other family members with other forms of cancer. Last month I found a small lump in my left breast.  It is slightly smaller than a marble.  It is located right beside/behind my nipple on the outer side of my breast. It is very hard and almost has a jagged feeling to it.  I am not able to move it around so I can only feel the part that is closest to the skin.  It almost seems to be attached to the thicker area located right behind the nipple.  It isn't causing me any pain and I haven't noticed any skin changes.  I'm just really scared because I have never felt a lump and then to have it seem like the exact kind that I don't want to find.  I have an appt Tuesday with my gyn so I'm hoping that I can get some answers.  Until then I am losing my mind!!! I really don't want to mention it to any of my family yet because it could be nothing.  My husband is already freaking out so he is of NO help right now.  I'm kinda at a loss because I just don't know.   Well I guess thanks for just letting me get all of that off my chest.  I have been reading the post for a couple of days and everyone here is so supportive. \n ",

      "Content": " I met yesterday with the surgeon.  She will be removing the two larger cysts from my left breast and also the fibroadenoma from my right breast.  The surgery is scheduled for Nov17.  They are going to use a guide wire to remove the fibroadenoma.  Can someone tell me what that will be like?  They told me that I would have to be there around 9 but the surgery wouldn't actually be until 11 or 12.  Does it take that long?  Will it hurt or be simular to the biopsy?  Also, I will have a 2hr ride home after surgery, do I need anything for the ride home?  Should I buy any certain kind of bra for the ride home? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  ",
