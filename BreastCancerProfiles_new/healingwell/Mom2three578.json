      "Content": " I found a lump during my monthly check that I have never felt before. It is about\n two fingers wide in length and feels flat not round. Its not hard like a rock but harder then the surrouding tissue. I am planning on seeing my ob/gyn but need to wait for a health insurance change so I was hoping someone could ease my mind until then. If any of you have had similar lumps would you mind leaving a comment for me. Thanks! ",

      "Content": " Thank you for the reply pbj. At the advice of my family I ended up going to my doctor anyway to have it looked at. They scheduled an ultrasound and if the radiologist felt it was necessary a diagnostic mammogram to follow. I am happy to say that my mass is what she is almost certain is just an enlarged lymph node. With that being said I do have to follow up in six moths with anther ultrasound to make sure it has gone down to normal size and also have my baseline mammogram done (because I will have just turned 30). I feel very optimistic about\n everything and my mind has been eased. ",
