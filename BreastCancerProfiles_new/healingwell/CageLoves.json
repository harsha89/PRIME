      "Content": " Hello, everyone. I have this lump on my right breast. I had the mammogram and ultrasound and my doctor said that there's a very low chance that it's malignant. He didn't think biopsy is need. It hurts sometimes especially when I'm lying down. I'm deciding to have it removed nonetheless.\nMy concerns are after the surgery are 1. I work in a lab and have to lift boxes and grind hard samples constantly. How able would I be when I go back to work after the surgery? 2. What does the breast usually look like after the surgery? Will my breast tissues eventually fill out the space where the lump use to be? How does it feel after the surgery?\nI appreciate any input. Thank you. ",
