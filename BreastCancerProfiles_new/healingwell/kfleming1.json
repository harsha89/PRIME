      "Content": " Thanks Robert, it has also taken me forever to find somewhere that can prove they ethically source their hair, it is an issue that bothers me greatly so that was the first step I wanted to take in terms of purchasing a hair piece.\nWhat is your hair piece like and how was it applied?\nI suffer from alopecia and am very interested in going for a hair replacement procedure... any tips?\nThanks!
