    "Content": " I appreciate that encouragement Pam. My wife got a call back a couple of days ago because of calcification in her left breast. The person who called told her they didn't think it was anything to be worried about\n but they just wanted a better look. However, we both lost our mothers in their 40's to breast cancer (we are both 42) so you can imagine it has caused our anxiety to skyrocket. The earliest she could get an appointment for addition tests is almost two weeks away, so I've been doing research for two days in an outward attempt to help ease her fears...but inwardly I'm trying to ease mine.\nFortunately she has been getting regular mammograms for years now, and just this past February had a voluntary MRI just for precautionary purposes, so I'm praying that even if this is a worst case scenario it will have been caught very early. But more fervently I'm praying that this will be a best case scenario of nothing more than harmless calcification! ",
