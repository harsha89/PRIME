    "Content": " I felt a lump in my right breast two days ago. I was able to get an appointment today with a doc. She did a u/s and showed me a cyst. She pointed out a bit of something inside the cyst and said this probably makes it a complex cyst. She told me to get a mammogram within the next two months. She didn't seem to think it was anything to be alarmed about\n but said to get it double checked with the mammogram. Is this really nothing to worry about\n? I am 29 and an American living in Germany and would appreciate any feedback in English that you can give me. ",
