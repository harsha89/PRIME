      "Content": " Thank you for your reply. I have a biopsy Tuesday. Fortunately my Dr. ordered a bilateral sonogram. They found a 6mm lesion. My Dr. could have saved my life. I'm still hoping its nothing. The surgeon said about\n a 70% chance its something benign. If it is something it is a stage 1a or b and highly treatable. I'm taking one step at a time. Thank you again. ",

      "Content": " I recently went for my annual mammogram. I'm 57 so I've \nhad 17 mammograms as I go religiously each year. I've been called back every few years for a diagnostic mammogram and or sonogram. I was called back for a sonogram on my right breast . My doctor went ahead and \nordered a bilateral sonogram just to be safe. Today I got a call from my doctor that they wanted to biopsy my left breast, which they didn't even have any problem with. My \nright breast was fine. I had had all my previous mamommagrams at another breast center. I work in the medical field and now work for a for profit hospital where I had this years mammogram. I'm finding it very suspicious that the breast not in question is the one they \nwant to biopsy. Maybe I'm cynical, but could a for profit facility call for more breast biopsies? Of course I'm going to have it done, but wonder if my doctor only ordered a sonogram on the right breast or I refused to have both done. Would I have gotten the all clear? Has anyone had \na similar situation. Thank you! ",
