    "Content": " Hi DudleysMom,\nThanks for your posts! I too had a very bad time with my stereotactic breast biopsy (for microcalcs) a few months back. (Results benign). Though not quite as bad a time as you had! \nIn my case, the bruising that showed on the skin took weeks and weeks to heal. Even now I still have pain after vigorous activity (even though they said I could resume normal activity shortly after the biopsy, ha). I also still have lumps/knots at the incision site and elsewhere in the breast that weren't there before the biopsy. (I am getting those checked with a specialist soon.)\nIn the meantime, when I visit my doc, I will keep your story in mind! \nAlso, for fibrocystic pain (which I also have), talk to your doc about\n your iodine status; if you're iodine-deficient, correcting the deficiency may help, at least according to a few studies. (I found the info at this Oregon State University website: http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/minerals/iodine/#goitrogen --Scroll down to the Disease Treatment - Fibrocystic Breast Condition section to see a summary of the data on iodine and fibrocystic breast disease to date.) \nI switched back to iodized salt, which seemed to help a little; I'm also going to ask about\n it at my appointment with the breast specialist.\nThanks again for sharing your story.
