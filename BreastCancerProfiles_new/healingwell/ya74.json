    "Content": " I'm 40 and after my first mammogram, ultrasound and core needle biopsy I was diagnosed with a radial scar / complex sclerosing lesion. I have an appointment tomorrow with Surgeon but wanted to be prepared on what to ask. I understand from this post and other resources in internet that the best approach is to take it out. I also read, still cancer is not fully ruled out as radial scar could be hiding it.\nAny info at this point from some of you that have the same diagnosis would be highly appreciated. it has been a difficult time since this started as my diagnostic mammogram came back with BIRADS 5 and it was a relief to get radial scar but now I understand I could still have cancer.
