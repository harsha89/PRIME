    "Content": " Hi Ladies! \nFor those of you with burning pain in your breast and you're concerned with Inflammatory Breast Cancer (IBC) and you know that a Mammogram and Ultrasound don't always show if IBC is present, another great option that is FDA approved that WILL show IBC is a Breast Thermography scan. \nBreast Thermography shows temperature changes and inflammation in the breast tissue. It is well known to show estrogen dominance changes in breast tissue that can predict cancerous changes 7-10 years before the cancer actually appears. Breast thermography can also show inflamed breast tissue around tumors, blood flow to tumors that might be missed by a mammogram/ultrasound, and other wonderful insight into breast tissue health. \nBreast Thermography is highly recommended for women of all ages as a breast health exam in addition to the annual Mammogram (since breast thermography helps predict disease before it occur whereas mammogram only helps find disease once it already happens). Breast Thermography is also really great for women 20-39 years old for breast health exams when you can't get a mammogram because your breast tissue is too dense and insurance won't cover a mammogram. I have a breast thermography done annually because I have estrogen dominance in my breasts (shown on the thermography scan) and I'm trying to balance my hormones to ensure the excess estrogen doesn't cause cellular changes in my breasts and lead to breast cancer.\nBreast thermography usually runs somewhere in the ballpark of $200 for the scan and has immediate test results so you know the result of the scan the same day as your appointment. Like I said it is FDA Approved so it is a great additional test in your arsenal and well worth the cost if you need peace of mind.\nIf you google \"Breast Thermography\" and the name of your city you can find centers that do breast thermography scans in your area - I would recommend checking the \nlocation you choose on Yelp.com as well (free ratings website) to see if the breast thermography \nlocation you choose has good ratings or not from women who have gone there previously for scans.\nI would sincerely encourage each of you to do some research on Breast Thermography scans. They can really help you determine the health of your breasts.\nHope this helps!\n ",
