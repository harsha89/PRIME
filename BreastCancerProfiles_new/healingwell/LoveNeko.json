      "Content": " I'll give a little history first...\nI am recently diagnosed - December 19th, 2006... after finding a lump in my right breast and another by my OBGYN. I had a mammogram and ultrasound. The mammogram came back clean and the ultrasound confirmed the two lumps. They scheduled the biopsy of my right breast. I waited 4 days to hear the results. I have two tumors, both have infiltrating ductal carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ, one at 8 and another at 11 o'clock and 2.5 cm. I was referred to a surgeon the next day. After my exam, she was concerned about\n the left breast too, and ordered a MRI of my breasts, but I had to wait for my monthly cycle to start, stop and be 10 days out.(this was during Christmas and New Year's) The MRI showed something suspicious in my left breast and she has now scheduled an ultrasound for that breast which will be next Tuesday, results on Wednesday. \nOnly one person knows, my hubby, I haven't told my children... I just don't know how, my daughter is 15 and my son is 8. So far with each test, I have bought time, but my surgeon wants to go to surgery soon, she thinks on January 26th.\nI need someone's insight, how do you tell your children what is happening without scaring them, yet being truthful. I mean my son is young and I don't think it will occur to him how sick mommy is, but my daughter I'm so scared this will affect her life deeply and with school, etc...\nPlus I haven't told my sister, we had a falling out with the death of my husband's grandmother who raised him. I saw her during the holidays but felt no need or desire to tell her.\nWe plan to tell the children and his family and friends after we hear the results of the upcoming ultrasound. \nAny inputs is greatly appreciated.\nTHANK YOU ",

      "Content": " To answer Deb, I live in Virginia and I turned 41 this past November. I have a bakery business that I just recently re\nopened again after helping my sister with her business for the past 2 years.\nThanks for all your inputs, its good to get some advice to what has been weighing on my mind. \nHas anyone changed their diets? The cancer society booklet says to not eat sugar, which is fine by me. I have been reading on some internet sites not to eat animal meat, refined flour and all grains, and sugar. To watch fruits if they are high in natural sugar too.\nThanks!\nKimberly \n ",

      "Content": " Thank you both so much!\nI plan to be honest and positive. Great minds must think alike I called my daughter's school last week and asked that all her teachers watch for signs of stress. I haven't done it for my son yet, I think because of his age, it won't affect him as deeply like it will my daughter. But I will mention something to his teacher and school soon. \nMy daughter has a couple of friends and one close friend, but she has never called our home or came over, mmm... that one will be tricky. Maybe the school can help me.\nWhen I have the mastectomy or possible double mastectomy will I be able to drive after a couple of days? I'm self-employed and I take my children to and from school everyday. I'm not sure how this is going to go, especially with the chemotherapy.\nI'm no sure how to tell hist family.. I think it's best in person but I might lose it or Maybe over the phone is safe for me. Or maybe I should let my hubby do it, but that is putting stress on him.\nFYI: We see his family usually at holidays and special events, but not on a normal basis. He calls his mom about\n once a week, but his dad everyday since his operation. (They are divorced.)\nI don't want people making me feel like a patient/victim or feel sorry for me. But I want support through this, I have acquaintances, my best friend is my dear hubby. Is there a guideline on Who do you tell? or chose to tell?\n \nTHANK YOU for the support, I really need it. \n ",

      "Content": " Well I thought I would give an update. I had to have an ultrasound biopsy of my left breast after the results of my MRI. The left came back okay, thank goodness. My Mastectomy of my right breast is on Friday Morning. My dear hubby is more nervous than me, he's worried to the point of being sick.\nI have never been operated on before and I think that's when I will break down some... Remembering my family faces just as they wheel me away from them. The surgeon says if I have two drainage tubes when I wake up then they found cancer in the lymphs nodes. I wish she didn't tell me that, my first thought will be when I wake up is to check.\nI hope everyone is doing well \n \nKimberly ",

      "Content": " Well the 6 needle injections they give you when they prep you for the operation was worse than the pain I felt waking up after the operation, though that was pretty bad too. I got home late yesterday and I feel weak when I move around too much, but I'm not on any pain meds right now, which I think is good \nOkay the nurse and doctor said that I could shower and let the water run over the stitches and tape, a very nice lady came to see me yesterday just before I left the hospital and see said to bath around the area and drain tubes. Any suggestions? I want to wash my hair, my hubby said he would take me to a salon and have my hair washed and styled.\nPlus these 2 drain tubes? right now I have them attached to a long cord that is around my neck which is working better than having them pinned to my shirt or pants. My next doctor appointment is this Thursday morning and my Oncology appointment is on the 12th of February.\nThanks again for your support, when they came to give me my shots to put me under, I felt that I wasn't alone any more and that I was going to be okay, THANK YOU.
