    "Content": " Hi! After two mammograms, I had A stereotactic core needle biopsy because there was micro calcifications in my left breast in one spot. I actually had it the same day I went back for a second mammogram\u2026.I felt their urgency. I had a breast reduction 8 years ago\u2026can that cause micro calcifications? and if so, are they usually benign? I had the biopsy on Thursday but told them to wait until next Friday to let me know the results\u2026.because I am going on vacation and do not want to ruin the family trip if it is positive\u2026.\nThanks!
