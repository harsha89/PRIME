      "Content": " I'm 25 years old. I have a grandmother and aunt with a history of breast cancer on my dad's side and grandmother with ovarian cancer on my mom's side. I noticed a lump a month ago, but have fibrocystic breast tissue and let it go a menstrual cycle to see if it would go away. It was still there a month later so I went to my doctor, who found it immediately. It's about\n the size of a pea, it's moveable and kind of rubbery, which I guess sound like good signs. She seemed concerned anyway, because of the family history and had her nurse walk me over to the imaging center in the building at the end of my appointment. They took me right away.\n I had an ultrasound, but my breast tissue is so dense that they couldn't see anything. It was on Friday, so I'm still waiting for official results of the ultrasound, but the tech told me that the radiologist's recommendation would be to \"wait and see.\" I know that my age and the characteristics of the lump indicate that it's probably nothing, but I can't help freaking out about\n this and hate having to wait. \n Has anyone else had palpable lumps that don't show up on ultrasounds? From what I've read online, cysts sound like they show up on ultrasounds well. Is it possible to have all the indicators that it isn't cancerous, and still have it end up being malignant? I hope that I can convince my doctor to do a biopsy just to easy my mind. I don't think anything short of that will decrease my anxiety.\n Any input would be great! ",

      "Content": " Update! I went to a breast surgeon and she said it's probaby an enlarged gland due to my abnormal period. She did a thorough exam and said it doesn't require a biopsy now, but to keep an eye on it. \n I know how scary it can be. I know my dr said that at our age, cancer is the least likely culprit. However, my best advice is to push until you have an answer. Will you feel better if it's biopsied? Then make them do it! I didn't sleep well for 2 weeks and you cant do that to yourself. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Keep us updated. ",

      "Content": " Ahna B: \n I can understand why you would be scared. I hope the benign tissue diagnosis calmed your worries a bit. My theory on second opinions is: what can it hurt? It will do nothing but ease your mind if it's benign and catch something if it isn't. I say go for it if it will make you feel better. I know my dad's oncologist is a huge supporter of second opinions and sets them up himself. If you're not comfortable asking your doctor to set one up, you can find the new doctor yourself and then you'll just have to have a copy of your records sent. Don't worry about\n \"demanding\" anything. It's YOUR health! You have to be comfortable and take care of yourself. Nobody is a better advocate for your own health than you! Good luck with everything! ",

      "Content": " Thanks! The Dr. is supposed to call me tomorrow after she looks at my ultrasound herself. I'm going to ask for a biopsy when she does. All the information she gave me telling me not to worry isn't making this nagging anxiety go away. ",
