      "Content": " Hi Bernadette: So this tumor you had removed clearly showed up on the 2003 films and it was noted in the report. WHY was it never mentioned to you? Usually they report to the doctor who gave you the prescript\nion for the Mammogram. When I got my results, they contacted the doctor who requested the mammogram. You usually can't show up and say, \"I want a mammogram\". At least I've never done that. I was always been given a prescript\nion for the mammogram. And the results were typed in report form and mailed to my doctor. If you had no referring doctor, then for sure the doctor who interpreted the films should have told you. I went in for a mammogram because I was going to have a boob job. No one expected to find anything. Of course the mammogram did and that's why I had the bilateral mastectomy. But the doctor told me right then and there, right after he finished the ultrasound. He said he would send a report to my doctor - who was my plastic surgeon. So, if you had a doctor who referred you, he should have been given a report. Have you confronted him as to why he didn't mention this? And if he knew and said nothing to you, do you feel comfortable staying with him as your doctor? The same with the doctor who did those 2003 films?? So what is your dilemma? Are you trying to decide if there is enough for mal-practice? You said you weren't the suing type. Are you just trying to figure out who dropped the ball? Because it's obvious someone did. I'm sorry, I really feel like I'm not helping. I just picked through your post and tried to help you based on your concerns. It seems like you're concerned with who dropped the ball in your case. Now that you know (or at least have your suspicions) what are you planning on doing next? Have you received the results of the tumor?\nSorry, I know I just asked you more questions than gave you answers. You don't have to answer if I totally frustrated you.\nJaymie\nI'm a teenager trapped in a 40 year old body!\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Lori and Bernadette. I'm new to this, and I'm not sure if what I am doing is right. But I wanted to thank both of you for replying and welcoming me to the group. I sure hope this reaches you somehow. Anyway, I feel like the new kid joining the party; standing off to the side. Everyone here seems to be going through SO MUCH more than me, and here I am asking questions about\n how I'll look, how my breasts will feel, is this sensation normal........ I felt this way, too, when I went to the Questions and Answers session that UCLA held. All the other women in the group had far more serious BC than me; and all my questions were geared toward recovery and looks. I was sent to this site by a friend, and she told me everyone is encouraging and helpful and not to feel shy about\n asking. She said no one judges you, that everyone's here to help one another. So I really want to thank you for welcoming me and responding. Love, Jaymie\nI'm a teenager trapped in a 40 year old body!\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Bernadette: Since you welcomed me, I thought I should at least pop on to your post. I want to make sure I understand your post correctly. When I requested my mammo and U/S films, inside the folder was also a copy of the report from the doctor who read my films. When you got copies of your file, did you get a copy of the report from both those film studies. You wrote \"they show the cyst, they show the areas of concern\". Is this you looking at the films, or is this in a typed report? Then you wrote, \"this is exactly where I had my tumor removed last month\". The tumor you had removed, was this the cysts you saw on the 2003 films?? You said you were never told about\n this? This is what leads me to believe you did not receive a typed report. It would be quite obvious to another radiologist if he had the actual 2003 films (and the typed report), if this tumor was present in 2003. Obviously if it was present in 2003 and there is no mention in the report - you now know who dropped the ball. But if it wasn't present in the 2003 films, and this tumor wasn't detected until recently, then there's a chance no one dropped the ball and you just developed this since your last film studies. What are you going through now? (You wrote, \"..... instead of all I am going through now\". Is the doctor who found this recent tumor the same doctor who took your 2003 films? Have you ever had anyone else look at your 2003 films? (I actually had FOUR doctors look at my films, and they all said the same thing.) I'm sure you are extremely frustrated. That's why I'm asking so many questions, to see if I can give you some support and help you as much as I can. Just after reading your post, so many questions popped up in my mind. Sorry this was so long. Thanks again for your post on my question (I posted a response to you back on my post. I'm not sure if that's how things are done, so I did it there.) :) Jaymie\nI'm a teenager trapped in a 40 year old body!\n ",
