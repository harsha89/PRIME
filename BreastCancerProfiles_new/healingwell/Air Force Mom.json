      "Content": " tbossk - I'm in the exact same boat as you. I had my very first physical - which included my very first mammogram a couple of weeks ago. I've always been healthy and never went to the doctor. Now my insurance more or less requires us to get a physical every year. The tech also told me not to worry if I get a call back that it's extremely common. I'm a stats person, so it comforted me to read that 92% of callbacks turn out to be nothing. I also read on an earlier post that 80% of lumps are benign. I know I have these great odds, but I'm still terrified. My husband has been wonderful. He says whatever it is, we'll get through it. I am just worried how my kids will handle it if something is wrong. I haven't told them anything yet. I didn't want them to worry since I don't really know anything at this point - and it could very well be nothing. When the nurse called me, she said it could be calcium deposits or even a mole - so it sounds like it is small. I was so much beside myself when I got the call back, nothing really sank in and I didn't ask any questions. I go for my 2nd mammogram and ultrasound on Thursday - December 29th. I'll take any prayers I can get. I'm a strong believer. ",
