      "Content": " Â I went yesterday and picked up my reports and film from my obgyn and the radiologist.The radiologist reports the following. Suspected benign findings within both breast of microcalcifications in the left breast and suspected one or two right benign intramammary lymph nodesand dilated ducts behind the nipple, recommend the patient have a six-month bilateral mammogram. I have made an appt. with a breast specialist just wondering should i keep the appt. this report doesnt sound to bad the bi-rads category 3 probably benign so what would you do. thanks, Kay ",

      "Content": " It's the 23rd and i had my appt. today he said the right breast looks better than it did back in july. I'm having to wait on results from the radiologist on the left breast he did point out some calcifications in the left breast and said he'd see what the report says and we'd go from there. So now it just a waiting period again bummer i hate waiting if the report is good he wants to see me again in 6 months. Does that sound like standard procedure to you ? \n Thanks for letting me come here and vent Kay ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone, my name is Karen and i've been a member of hw since 04. I usually post on the crohns forum but have a few questions regarding some breast issues i'm having. I really hate to admit that i waited 10 years between mammo's and gyn visits due to the lack of insurance. I just recently got insurance that covers gyn visits so i made an appt. and my doctor had me to do a mammo while i was there. I got a call from my doctors office said they saw an area that need to be looked at better so she had me see a radiologist. I get to the radologist appt. and the girl does another mammo shows the doc he see's something so he has her do it again . I winded up having 3 mammo's and 2 ultrasounds. The radiologist said that i have a nodule under the right nipple and he'd send the report to my dr. office. My doctors office called and said the report showed that i also have enlarged ducts along with the nodule. Well yesterday i recieve a letter from the radioligst saying they want to see me again in 5 months to make sure the area is stable. My question is have any of you had this happen and if so what was the outcome. I'm trying really hard to not get worried but i just feel like i'm in limbo if you know what i mean. Thanks for letting me come here and vent a little. I have to say i have been lurking around and reading the post here you all seem to be such a wonderful group of ladies. thanks so much Karen. ",

I now have an appt june 25th with a breast specialist better to go on and ease my mind. Thanks again will post with my results soon as i know them. Kay ",
