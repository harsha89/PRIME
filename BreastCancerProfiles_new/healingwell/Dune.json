So glad all of you survivors are here and so positive. Certainly this horrible disease brings out the figher in all of you! Life is so worth it though!! ",

      "Content": " Everything I have heard is positive for this drug although the pain is a real downer for her. I can't imagine how it is. I didn't know whether mild exercise would help like it does for some arthritis or make her feel even more soreness and pain. I am just trying to be supportive. My sister is 13 yrs my senior but we have always been so close. I must get her to try using a computer, she doesn't have one. She needs a support group. She doesn't drive either and we live in a very rural area. So all of you are a boost. Have a great day and weekend Happy! ",

      "Content": " Thanks Mikki. The Femara is an excellent drug. My sister's breast cancer was in final stages, even in her one lung and yet 2 yrs later she is still here and feeling well. She didn't get sick from chemo and only side effect now is the bone pain. Wonder what it does exactly to cause it. ",
