      "Content": " Thanks Bev. Biopsy is 3/27 and I will know something then. I looked at ultrasound pics and saw lump...has 6 triangle shaped things growing out of center, seems to have calcificatiions in middle. Doc did not like edges. Surgeon says may be able to remove almost all of it during biopsy. Still anxious but thank you for your remarks and glad you are OK! ",
