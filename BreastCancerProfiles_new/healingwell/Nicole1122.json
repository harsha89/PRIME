      "Content": " Hi, I am not sure if this is the right place to post so please excuse me if it isn't. \nMy OB found a lump on the underside of my left breast 4 years ago. I was sent for a mammogram and then to a surgeon. The surgeon felt the lump and told me I had a Fibrocystic breast. That was where the journey ended, or so I thought.\nFour years passed and I hardly thought about\n this lump. I had my yearly exams but switched OB's and at the last exam I am not sure if it was mentioned (I had my 1 year old with me and it was hectic). In the past few months I have felt itching in that nipple (horrible itching!) and pain radiating up the side of the left breast (not on the lump). I feel the lump has grown-- almost like a thick, irregular lump that is fixed to the chest wall. the skin on top of my breast toward the chest area seems to be slightly more poreous (sp?) but I am not sure if that is just age (I am 32).\nI have my annual OB appt tomorrow but my question is whether this is something to be concerned about\n or not. I will mention it, of course, but I am wondering if these things grow and/or cause pain and itchiness?\nThank you to anyone with advice. Best of luck to you all. ",
