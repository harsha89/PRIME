    "Content": " I've had stage 4 breast cancer for almost 3 years, and have been on chemotherapy the entire time.  Initially metastasis to liver, lymph and bone, but has just been seen in the liver for the past 2 years.  I've done well overall, despite a few problems with various drugs.  In April 2008 had lots of new tumor growth in my liver and switched drugs.  No new growth since, but no improvement either.  \n \n \n \n ",
