    "Content": " I am 40 years old and since the age of 35 I have been getting Mammogram (some diagnostic) This time they found a new cyst. This cyst I new was there, but it was small. I have been having some tenderness and pulling pain. They said it was not cancer and they would watch it ,but I am still hurting. I have a family history of breast cancer and I also have the fibrocystic breast disease. What should I do? I am hurting, but I do not think they want to do anything, but watch it. I am not happy with this.. Please advise me. ",
