    "Content": " I'm 53 and after having clean mammograms since the start, the radiologist found what he thinks is a fibroadenoma this January at my annual exam. His advice was to do nothing and perform a second mammogram/sonogram after 3 months to see if it changed. I had the second set of procedures and there was no change so he felt confident that it was a benign adenoma. However, my doctor disagreed on assuming it's a fibro and referred me to a breast surgeon for a 2nd opinion. I had that appointment yesterday and the surgeon's recommendation is to proceed with a needle biopsy. Her reasoning is that it is very rare for a woman over the age of 50, with no children, to be diagnosed with a fibroadenoma so she wants to take the conservative approach with biopsy/pathology. I'm in agreement.\nMy question, is there anyone on this board who has gone through something similar, with a fibroadenoma cropping up after age 50?\nSue ",
