    "Content": " Ladies....et al,\nI'm the partner of a BC sufferer - Tis N2 M1 and have stumbled across the HealingWell site and your subsequent thread. Facinating reading and I'm compelled to add my 2cents and hopefully get some feedback for questions I have. \nIn our case, my wife was prescribed femara 3 years ago after surgery to remove her right breast and adjoining nodes. One of the side affects of the femara was calcium depletion which she had to take supplements for. During this time she experienced little or no pain. \nSadly and quite unexpectedly, we recently discovered metateses to several bones causing lesions which lead to a number of fractures. The fractures have caused some pain but nothing like the treament she is now having for it. Her onc has taken her off the femara and has prescribed tamoxifen instead. The pain that you've been describing is what she is currently experiencing with this new drug which is having to be managed with strong pain killers, with only so so results. \nIn our case femara wasn't causing any pain, tamoxifen is. Has anyone else found this to be the case and if so, how did you manage this. We are also aware of other oestrogen inhibiting drugs and some that have been mentioned in the above corresondence. \nWe put a lot of faith in our clinicians but there also seems to be a lot of guess work in their prescript\nion, I've got a lot more comfort from reading your replys than from our specialists.\nAny feedback would be most welcome...thanks Matt ",
