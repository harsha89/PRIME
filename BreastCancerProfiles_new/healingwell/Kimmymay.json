      "Content": " I do have a appointment for this Tuesday morning but just wanted to get some feed back, if anyone can give some. I have noticed some changes in my right breast since my mamo and ultrasound last month but that was on a different \nlocation. I noticed during my routine exam that I have a small dimpling in my aerola just under my nipple, I think its noticeable only because I know its there, Its almost like a hole when I press on it. and I also noticed that when I raise my arms and look at my left breast compared to my right there is a noticeable difference. My whole aerola seems to sink in. I had a lumpectomy in march 2013 because of a mass and cyst but that was done on the top right of my breast! Not even close to this new thing. Now I asked my doctor numerous times and she just keeps calling them Flat epithelial atypia cells nothing more! I am considered high risk because of that. The tissue of both breasts is heterogeneously dense. so I go in every six months for exams.\nBut this new thing that is going on is just weird has anyone eles experienced anything like this?\nThanks\nKim ",

      "Content": " Woogie,\nThank you for your reply, Most people Ive talked to have told me No news is good news, Ive come to hate that saying ha ha ha\nIm assuming if it was cancerous they would of let me know, So I keep my chin up and think positive. I thought the same thing after thinking about\n why would they want to remove it if its not cancerous, from what Ive learned just cause it doesnt have cancer cells now doesnt mean it cant turn that way. So better safe then sorry I guess! \nI will update after I talk to the surgeon, who hopefully will shed some more light on this crazy situation!\nThanks again! \nKim ",
