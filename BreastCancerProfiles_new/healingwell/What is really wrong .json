      "Content": " Hello to all. Hoping for similar stories to help ease my mind. \n1st mammogram 1/24/19. Didn\u2019t hear anything for 2 weeks, thought I was clear\nGot called back for follow up diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. To say I was scared is an understatement. Since last week I have barely slept or eaten. Went today and saw a white spot in question. Ultrasound was a bit more challenging as the tech couldn\u2019t find it. Radiologist came in and guided her. Still unsure I had to sit up in order for the image to be picked up. \nRadiologist seems sure it\u2019s a Fibroadenoma and stated he\u2019s 95% sure it\u2019s benign. Of course only a biopsy will tell. \nDue to my health anxiety which was clear to them he gave me the option to wait 6 months and return or for a piece of mind get the biopsy since he felt due to nervousness I probably wouldn\u2019t make it to that point. \nOf course I\u2019m going 2/26 for the biopsy but I must admit I\u2019m fearing the worst. Radiologist was very sensitive to my feelings and kept stating I would be fine. \nIn reading I see that this is more common in your 20-30\u2019s but I am 41 so I believe this is why I fear it\u2019s something more. As per the radiologist, the spot is smooth and gives no indication of anything dangerous. \nAnyone who can relate or has been given the same diagnosis please chime in so I can hear your story. This means the world to me and I see there is loads of support on this forum\n\u2014 no history of Breast cancer in family both sides ",

      "Content": " Thank you. I received my ultrasound results yesterday. \nNot exactly sure what I\u2019m reading but the part that stood out was the BIRADS 4 Score. Doctor also noted that it\u2019s 0.8 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm circumscribed hypoechoic nodule deep in breast\nHis recommendation is ultrasound guided core needle biopsy as the patient is very anxious and cannot wait for short term follow up\nI\u2019m afraid of that score now. Sorry for rambling but my nerves are on a million. I somehow feel every pain possible when I never felt pain before outside my cycle. \nAre biopsies only given if the score is a 4 or is it possible he thinks something is wrong although he was very confident when stating he is 95% confident it\u2019s benign. I just can\u2019t function these past 2 weeks. \nI apologize for the long post but the responses mean so much to me. ",
