      "Content": " I don't know, but I am quite anxious for Wednesday. I have recently moved within the last year and called today to get my old films sent to the surgeon. I have a feeling these may have been there for some time and because the technology is not quite as good as the digital, they didn't pick up on it. This makes me nervous too because I wonder how long it really has been there. Having this time to think is not good either. I'm getting more and more anxious. It's good to have people to talk to.\nThanks, Linda ",

      "Content": " Saw the surgeon today. She recommended a full excisional biopsy. I am scheduled for surgury next Thursday. Thank god I'm a teacher and have the summer, otherwise I would be taking lots of time from work. I guess I'm glad this is happening now rather than later. The doctor did say my microcalcifications were indeterminate. They could go either way....so she said get rid of them. The thing is they can come back.....oh boy. Can you all tell me what to expect for the surgery/\nThanks, Linda ",

      "Content": " Just last week I went to the radiologist for second views on something they called suspicious. After two more views were taken a nurse?? came in to tell me that the doctor would be calling me. They couldn't tell me there. The doctor called later and said the radiologist saw calcification with patterns that were worrisome and they recommended a biospy. My gyn suggested a second opinion which I am going for on Wednesday. I am a nervous wreck. I have also had dense/calcifications before but this is the first time it sounds serious. Has anyone every had a similiar experience.\n \n ",
