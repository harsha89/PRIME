    "Content": " Hi Everyone, I'm new here and wanted to share my experience with everyone here. \nI went for a Mammogram/Ultrasound and the results came back that I have a Nodule in my right breast. I was immediately sent to see a Surgeon. I told him that back in 2010, I was informed by the imaging facility that I had a cyst on my right breast. That it was very small 3mm and that we just needed to keep an eye on it, but that it was nothing concerning. I was shocked to learn, that this had grown in size and is not a cyst but a nodule and that I need to undergo a lumpectomy to have it removed. The surgeon said that these things do happen, it changes due to hormones. We don't know why. But it's becoming more common, perhaps it's the environment or the food. Basically, he attributed it to me having undergone IVF Fertility Treatment. He said that the Infertility medications could very well have caused it. And that I must have it removed surgically and have a biopsy done. I felt the lump, it felt like a small ball in the upper right side of my breast. So, I agreed to have the surgery performed. I was going to go to Sloan Kettering in NYC for a second opinion, but after discussing it with my husband thought it wasn't necessary. There was a lump there, no question. We felt it. \nMy operation was scheduled for yesterday. I went through my medical clearance and pre-surgery testing. I was brought up to the operating room, wearing my hospital garb, lying on the gurney. The technician came in to take an ultrasound of the lump. She said, \"Just a few more images and we'll start the surgery... the surgeon's waiting for you.\" I told her that the surgeon's assistant told me that I need to remind someone that there are actually two lumps (one that you can feel on top, and one that you cannot feel on the bottom of my breast). She asked, \"Who told you this?\" I responded, the doctor's assistant when she was scheduling my surgery date. The technician checked with the Ultrasound and was completely baffled. She only saw one lump, the one I could feel. Very confused, she told me to wait one second. She called the surgeon and asked him. He looked at the films and said, \"I don't know who told her that. She only has one lump.\" At that point, the woman came back in the room with a Radiologist who specializes in breasts. As soon as, the Radiologist looked at the Ultrasound, he said, \"You don't need surgery! That's not a Nodule. That's a Cyst. There's no way that is Cancer.\" I could not believe it. I was stunned. I was, literally, minutes away from being cut \nopen for absolutely no reason at all. The Radiologist spoke with the Surgeon. The Radiologist came back with my husband and explained that I could have him perform an Aspiration, where he would give me a local anesthetic and simply drain the cyst of fluid. If it collapses, it's a Cyst (if not, then I would need to be operated on). But he was absolutely 100 percent certain it's a Cyst. And just to be extra safe, they would send it to a Pathologist for a Biopsy. Of course, without hesitation, I agreed. He drained the fluid, and the Cyst collapsed just as he suspected it would. The Surgeon came in afterwards to check me. I could see he was absolutely mortified and embarrassed. Someone in the hospital told me this happens all of the time. \nMy husband and I are still shaking our heads, when we think of what could have happened. My husband said it best, \"I'm 80 percent ecstatic and 20 percent very angry!\" It's so true...\nI wanted to share my experience. If this helps one person, it was all worth it. ",
