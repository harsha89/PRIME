      "Content": " There is a law that states that a routine mammogram for women age 40 + can have a routine mammogram once a year and the deductible is waived. We need to have that law amended to get the insurance companys pay for a diagnostic mammogram as well, with the deductible waived as well.It is called the \"Mammography Act\" (Act 148 of 1992). This act needs to be revised for the well being of all women. Write to your state senators about\n having this act revised. Your help is needed. Thank you.\n Etchie ",

      "Content": " I am aware of the difference between a routine screening and a diagnostic mammogram. In Penna. where I live there is a law that says ins. companys must pay 100% for a screening mammogram. I feel the law should be amended to have the insurance companys pay 100% for a diagnostic mammogram. I am refering to the Mammography Act (Act 148 of 1992). Both types of mammograms should be paid in full by all insurance company's. I live in Pennsylvania, but this act needs to be amended or put into law in all states. We all pay wayb too much for our insurance premiums and many people are on fixed incomes, as I am. Write to your state senators regarding revision of Act 148 of 1992, please help get the act amended. Thanks\nEtchie in Pennsylvania ",

      "Content": " Candy,\n I live in Pennsylvania. Mammography act (act 148 of 1992) required insurance companies to waive the deductible for routine screenings. I am hoping that the act will be amended to waive the deductibles for a diagnostic mammogram as well. Every insurance company I checked with, including Medicare, require that a patient meet all deductibles before paying a percentage for a diagnostic. We need to write to our state senators in order to hopefully get the act amended. Not having to meet the deductibles would make a huge difference for women. All I want is for the deductible waived for both types of mammograms. Thanks for responding and I hope all is well with you.\n Etchie ",
