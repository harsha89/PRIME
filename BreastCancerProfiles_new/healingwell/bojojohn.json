    "Content": " Jojosgirl1 -- My situation almost mirrors yours identically!! \nI'm 52 yrs old, going through menopause, after losing 105 lbs from gastric bypass surgery a year ago. I have dense breasts as well and recent mammo and breast US showed microcalcifications in my left breast--BiRADS 4b. I had had an excisional biopsy 5 yrs ago on that breast with benign results. I just had a sterotatic biopsy on Dec 2nd and the results came back as invasive cancer. I meet with the breast surgeon tomorrow to go over the pathology report so I have no idea what to expect.\nHow has your outcome been? Would love to hear more from you or mbrimatt!! ",
