      "Content": " My aunt recently was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer which has traveled to her bones. She has opted for the pill version rather through IV. She has always been one who treasures her appearance and doesn't want to lose her hair. They are going to operate on her breast in a few weeks. I know she is scared but she'd rather go that route and said she'd try the pill first. Is it advisable? She is 53 years old and we don't know how to handle this. Please help.. ",
