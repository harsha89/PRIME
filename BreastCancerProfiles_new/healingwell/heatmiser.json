      "Content": " Hi,\nI'm normally on the crohn's forum. I just want to get some advice. I was adopted and recently found my birth siblings. Also found out my birthmother had breast cancer and did undergo a mastectomy. Maybe about\n 12 years later she died of lung cancer, but she was a heavy smoker and drinker. \nLast year I had my first mammogram, before knowing any of this history. The found microcalcifications and did a biopsy, which thankfully came back ok. Now I am overdue for another mammogram, and kind of scared to do it because my health insurance/financial situation is really bad right now. I fear that they will find something, and want further tests that I can't afford. I kind of feel like it's easier not to know than find out I need help that I can't afford, if that makes sense.\nBesides getting a mammogram, is there anything else I should consider now that I know this family history? And is there any help for people who can't afford the follow up if something is found? I'm sure I don't really qualify for any state aid despite how bad my situation is right now.\nI take some comfort is knowing my 3 half-sisters are older and none of them have breast cancer at this point. But is that a false comfort? How doomed am I having a mother with breast cancer?\nThanks for your help. ",
