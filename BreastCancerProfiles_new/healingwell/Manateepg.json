      "Content": " Marianne, \nThanks for the information. I see the onc on 8/23 and will ask him about\n writing a letter for me. He should have some pull since he is on the Cancer Center Board of Directors at Memorial Hospital in Hollywood,FL. I have not heard anything back from Avmed about\n my 1st Level appeal so hopefully \"No news is good news!! \" I have googled Oncotype DX and found serveral articles which I will include in my personal letter to Avmed. I really hope Avmed pays it all but even if Avmed agrees to pay a percentage, I would be happy. If I was older and on Medicare I would be home free because Medicare I heard pay for the test but I am only 47 so I'll just have to fight it. I am Irish and us Irish know how to fight!!!!!! I will keep you posted. Thank you again for the information. \n Meg ",

      "Content": " Hi Everyone, \nI have not posted in awhile and wanted to update everyone. Well the good news is that I finished rads in April and I am feeling pretty good. I am getting my energy back and have had no side effect from the Femara. \nRemember when I was sooo happy about\n Avmed paying for the Oncotype DX test??? .... well I got a denial letter from Avmed saying they will not pay for the test because it is classified as \"experimental\". Gemomic Labs is appealing for me so please keep your fingers crossed for me. I will mentioned that United Healthcare and Premera Blue Cross have paid for the tests (thank you Jean and MiaB) and maybe that will help. If anyone else has had the test paid by insurance or have any advise on the appeals process please let me know. I will keep you posted on my saga.\nHugs to everyone\n Meg ",
