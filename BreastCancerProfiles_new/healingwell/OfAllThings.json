      "Content": " Hi, I have a callback appt. on Friday (right before Christmas!) & have been looking online to get some reassurance. I'm glad I found this site! I just turned 42 & have four kids ages 1 - 9 so I've been freaking out about\n leaving them so soon (yes, my mind goes to the worst case scenario). I just had my mammogram this past Sat. so my wait isn't long at all but boy, this came as a shock. I can't feel any lumps & have no symptoms. I have been losing weight for the past few months--easier than I ever have & I'm at my lowest weight that I can remember--so I almost called a doctor a couple of months ago just to get it checked out but then felt silly so I didn't (I mean--I WANTED to lose weight, right?). I've read that's only a symptom if your cancer is pretty advanced though. My last mammogram was two years ago (because I had a baby a year ago). ",
