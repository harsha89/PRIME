    "Content": " Hi ladies. I'm sooo relieved and grateful to find you here! I had a dbl mastectomy 4 weeks ago. My PS put in my expanders at the same time. I'm a bartender in a busy place, I took 3 weeks off work, returned to work, worked TWO DAYS and on the third day the pain was more than I could handle and I came home. It feels like funny little fires skip across my chest wall every time I take a step. I also have bouts of PURE TIREDNESS....that no amount of coffee can fix. I don't even know what to ASK...it's so nice to know there are women out there who nderstand what I'm going through. I have calls in to my PS, he is a doll buy its like he isn't taking me seriously. At one point he told me to try Motrin. I'm only 39 years old, I eat great foods...I don't want to be in this kind of pain. Would love to hear from some of you. I can say....if I run a REALLY HOT bath with lots of Epsom salts, that seems to help and so does a product my sister sent me. It's called Relieve Me by Rocky Mountain Oils. Anyhow, can't wait to hear from you.....help!! ",
