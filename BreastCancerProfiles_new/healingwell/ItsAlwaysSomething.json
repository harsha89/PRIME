      "Content": " Hi Merrida-\nWhen I was younger, I had the same characteristics as you describe...fibro cystic with some calcifications. \nI'm now 71 and was told a while ago that the fibro cystic issue no longer existed. No mention of anything but \"normal\" for years. That's why this situation took me by surprise.\nThanks for the info and assurances.\nI got out my mp3 player with meditation messages and will take any \"relaxing\" med they offer. Tolerated colonoscopies every 6 months for a while so I guess I can deal with this.\nIAS \nFemale, USA\nDiagnosed pancolitis 12/2003.
