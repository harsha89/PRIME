    "Content": " Hi everyone,\nI just got my result recently (yesterday) and I am also a double negative and Her2 (3+), node negative. I did not realise that it was so bad to be double -tive until I read this site. I have to undergo further surgery (they want to remove a bigger margin around the area in which they removed the tumour) and they are planning chemo after that. \nFrom what I read on this site should I expect to have a much lower life expectancy with ER PG negative cancer? be objective please I am 34y/o, single and I would like to know what I should expect so I can make plan etc.. I need to find a goal and a reason to live and fight if I cannot have a family etc.\nThanks\nKari ",
