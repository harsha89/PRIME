      "Content": " I just got back from my follow up mammogram and ultra sound. I'm 63 years old and have had annual mammograms. This is my first time being called back. The radiologist said it was a cyst and to do a follow up in six months. I asked if I needed to have it aspirated and she told me it was my decision but she would send the report to my doctor with the results plus recommending a six month recheck. She did hand me a pamphlet about\n the procedure for aspiration. I'm a total worryier so wonder if I should have it aspirated for piece of mind. I have an appointment with my gynecologist on 29 October so will ask her opinion. ",
