    "Content": " My name is Jennifer, I'm 28. I know this is a breast cancer forum, but I really couldn't find any other category that fit me. Since my cancer is of the \"female\" sort, I thought I'd try to fit in here. I was diagnosed with Stage II-A ovarian dysgerminoma in June 2006. It is a VERY rare ovarian cancer, comprising only 1%-3% of all ovarian cancer diagnoses. It occurs in late adolescence to early adulthood (I was 23 at the time of my diagnosis). I had my left ovary and tube taken in 6/06, aggressive chemo through 12/06, and went into remission. Then I relapsed in 2/07 and had a mass removed from the right ovary. I have been in remission since late Feb. of 2007. I already had a son at that time, so my doctor tried to convince me to have a complete hysterectomy. At 23, and being unmarried at the time, I was very much against that. It's a good thing too, because I found my soul mate and married him in 2008, and welcomed our beautiful daughter Isabella to our family 9/2/09! Now I'm facing something really scary,though... I went to the ER with severe abdominal pain 2 weeks ago, and a CT scan found lesions on my ovary, right adrenal gland and liver. I had a follow-up MRI yesterday to investigate further. Now I'm sitting here with my phone in a death grip, waiting for that make-or-break-it call from my doctor with the results... ",
