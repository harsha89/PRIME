    "Content": " Hi, Im Ilana and im 26 years old...my problem started a few years ago when i got my nippled pierced...i got an infection in my breast (which i took out the piercing right away)...so i saw a doctor and he gave me some antibiotics which worked.  I had a baby a year ago and got clogged milk ducks and again got on some medicine but this time it didnt work so i went and got a ultrasound and they said it was just scare tissue from the piercing.  about\n 2 months ago i went to see the doctor again and he looked at it and felt the lump and said that there wasnt anything to worry about\n and said that i didnt even have an infection which i didnt think was true cause its painful, tender, and a little discolored but he just dismissed me.  Now i have 2 lumps in the same area and a doctor thats not taking me seriously.  I would just like your opinions on this or if any of you have advice on how to treat a breast infection.  Thank you.
