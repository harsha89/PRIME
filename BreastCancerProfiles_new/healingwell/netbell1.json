      "Content": " Waiting for Biopsy results later today going crazy here, i had breast cancer 9 years ago had a partial mastectomy had 3 lumps were all cleared and i went on tuesday for my regular mammogram and ultra sound and they found a very small lump that the doctor said he cant be 100% on so he done the biopsy then and there.\nI hate this waiting i suffer from Anxiety disorder as well so that is not helping the thoughts that go through ones head is mad and u try and not worry but its not that easy.Family i have 5 kids are great and trying to be positive but its horrible cause they are scared to i didnt tell the youngest as she is only 9 and no point till i know.\nThe doctor said the lump is so small and that is a good thing i just dont want to go through this again as of course no one would.

      "Content": " Hi ladies i am new in the cancer forum i am in the anxiety forum as i suffer from anxiety but i had breast cancer 9 years ago and have going along great until tuesday i had my regular mammogram and ultra sound and he found a very small lump that he could not say 100% that it was nothing and in the same breast that i had the dancer in so he done the biopsy then and there which was good as i hate the waiting but i had to wait till friday for results and yes it was cancer the plus side the amazing doctor managed to clear it with the biopsy and it was quite small.\nSo now i have to go and have the chest X-ray , liver and spleen ultrasound,and the full body bone scan im so scared i dont want to go through this again even though in my heart i feel positive that all is ok and i won't die from cancer.\nAt the moment my biggest fear is having the radiation injection before the bone scan because of my anxiety i have a huge fear of taking any medications even a vitamin pill as i had bad side effects from zoloft years ago and ended up in hospital i know it wont hurt me but im so scared the last time i had the bone scan i didnt have the injection cause i freaked out but they say i have to have it so they can see properly.\nIm so tired i had hardly any sleep through worry and anxiety i just want this all over and everthing to be ok i could handle this so much better if i didnt have the anxiety fighting off panic attacks on top of the normal anxiety is horrible.\nThanks for listening\nHugs Net ",
