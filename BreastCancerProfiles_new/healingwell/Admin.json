      "Content": " Hello all!\nToday we launched a much anticipated forum redesign to match the new look and feel of the rest of the web site. I hope you like it. This new design offers many benefits. Most significant among these is that it is now mobile friendly and easy to use from your smartphone or mobile device.\nThere are still a few cobwebs we have to clear and screens that need fixing. These include the My Profile section, the Profile page, the Members listing, Active Users screen, and a few administrative screens. We will be tweaking these in the weeks ahead. Also the Help section is a bit outdated and will be revised ASAP.\nYou'll notice one obvious item missing. We don't have chat functionality anymore. Our chat software was just too outdated. I'll be looking at more modern solutions in the days and weeks ahead that maybe we could integrate.\nAnyway, check out the changes. I think you'll enjoy it. Just reply to this thread with any problems you may run into. I may not be able to respond to everyone's comments but I will be tracking them. Thanks so much!\nPeter\nPeter Waite\nHealingWell.com\n ",

I may look into making it available on the web site later.  You can check if you are subscribed by going to the Newsletter link above and try resubscribing.  If you are already subscribed, it will tell you. \nPeter Waite, Founder/Editor\nHealingWell.com - Community, Information, Resources \n ",
