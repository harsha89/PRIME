    "Content": " I have spent the morning reading loads of posts here. You are all brave women.\nHere's my situation, 49 mother of 2, always have had regular mammo's and have been told in the past few years I had calcifications, a couple of times I was asked to come back 6 months later for a re-check but thats it.\nThis last mammo they called from the radiologists office and told me I had microcalcifications and wanted me to meet with a surgeon! OK, at the end of that phone call I wasnt really too uptight yet, then I went 3 days later to meet with a Dr. I had never met before. Firstly he explained he wanted to do a biopsy, a sterotactic biopsy but because of where these microcalcifications are located (close to my chest wall) and because I am small breasted they may not be able to be successful with the stereotactic in which case he would have to operate.\nAlso said that in his opinion I was a 3.5 on the birad scale.\nSo, now I'm scared, of course I have been on the Internet looking at every possible case scenario.\nAnyone who has had this stereotactic procedure done I would appreciate some info on it.\nI'm generally a positive happy person...\nHere's the kicker, my pap (had the same day as my mammo) came back abnormal also and I have already had a biopsy for that!\nno results yet\n ",
