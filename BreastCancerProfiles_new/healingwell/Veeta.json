    "Content": " Hi huff,\nIm also suffering from pain in my left breast and ribs. There is a sore spot deep inside my thoracic cavity and the ultrasound and mammogram are unable to capture it. Only thing the surgeon said is, as long as there is no change in breast tissue, everything is fine. So they repeat the mammo every six months. But iam not scared. Iam ready to face anything. Just relax and do some brrathing exercises, it should help. ",
