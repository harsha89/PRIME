    "Content": " Debris is anything that is not fluid. There are simple cysts and complex cysts. Simple cysts have only fluid in them, have well-defined borders and something else. Complex cysts are any other cyst that doesn't meet the criteria for a simple cyst (i.e., fluid and debris in your case). I have a complex cyst that I can feel and am having it biopsied on Monday. Good luck to you! ",
