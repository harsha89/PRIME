      "Content": " Hi Hanapepe,\nI am too on tamoxifen... 5 months passed too since I started taking it. Oh, for me too, \"the five year period\" is a very long time. I started calculation since the first day, then I started to think that it is crazy!!\nMy side effects are different from yours; facial hair and eyebros falling with slow growth. What is your dosage of tamo.?\nI think we will be tamoxifen takers friends as we have started at the same time. I don't have hot flashes which I passed during the chemo.\nI am premenopausal but suppressing my ovary for at least 2 years as I am diagnosed with grade III ( some high risk during the 1rst 2 years)\nu can share me the hard experience\nBest wishes ",

      "Content": " Hi, \nI am too on tamoxifen for about\n 3 months. I am passing a state of deep depression. My oncologis supressed my ovary too to block all hormones in my body as I am premenopausal. This caused me depression as I lost my period . The side effects of the medications caused some eyebrows loss and growing undesirable facial hair which was not present before. \nHave you passed such side effects ( eyebrows loss, facial hair). Till now these are the only noticeable side effects together with depression.\nI am thinking of consulting a psychiatrist but I am hesitated as I don't want more medications. Do you recommend visiting one or the depression may go away by time?\nI have to be on tamoxifen for 5 years!! I think it is too long but he says it is a must. Have you the same case?\nGod be with us all\nnan ",
