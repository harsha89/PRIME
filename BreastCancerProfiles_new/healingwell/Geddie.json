      "Content": " This is my first time here, and I found this site after searching the internet for answers. I was so glad to find it! \nI am 50 years old and there is no history of breast cancer in my immediate family. Last year after a routine mammogram I received a letter stating I needed further evaluation. I scheduled the 2nd mammogram and ultrasound per instructions. After the mammogram they told me I didn't need the ultrasound because everything was clear. I was so relieved!\nThis year I went for my yearly mammogram (on Monday, 10/31), and I received another letter in the mail stating the same as the year before. I have another mammogram and ultrasound scheduled for Monday morning. I am really scared. I want to believe everything will be okay again, but what are the chances of being called back for the second year in a row and nothing being wrong? I keep thinking \"what if they missed something last year?\" Has anyone else been called back two years in a row? \nThanks in advance for the support and encouragement. \nGeddie ",

      "Content": " Yes, the area is the same. Last year, however, they didn't even do the ultrasound because the call back mammo was okay. I wish I had insisted to do the US anyway. Maybe it will be okay again. \nGEDDIE ",
