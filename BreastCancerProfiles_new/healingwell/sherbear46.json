Three days later I heard it was not cancerous. The surgeon did tell me that I needed another ultrasound in 6 months to see if it is growing because they can get huge. She said she removed one the size of an orange. Yikes. I'm not sure why they are sending you for more pics though. I did ask my surgeon what would happen if it was cancerous.

Its just a simple procedure and you will know the results in a few days. I kinda looked at it the same as going in for a Pap. Almost always its nothing but sometimes you have to go back in for another test or look see etc. You get through it and until I hear the words Cancer I refuse to drive myself insane. Good luck to you and hope all goes well.\nCo-Moderator UC\nSheri-39 years old\nDiagnosed UC/IBS April 2009-suffered over a year prior to diagnosis. \nCurrently taking Lialda 2 tabs in AM and 1 in PM, Protonix 40mg every day, Allegra, Singulair, Xyzal Probiotics, Vitamin D3 and Generic Rowasa enema twice a week.\nCurrently in Remission since June 2011.
