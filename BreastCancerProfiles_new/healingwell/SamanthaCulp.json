    "Content": " Hello everyone,\nMy Mom was diagnosed with Breast Cancer for the third time about\n four months ago, this time it is stage 4 with mes in her liver, bones, neck and back. It seems everyone has given up on her, including her doctors, she is suffering in pain with fluid around her stomach because of her liver due to the cancer. I am currently pregnant with her first grandchild due in March. Can anyone tell me if they have had positive results with pill form chemo? If anyone can offer their prayers for a miracle or keep my family in their prayers I would really appreciate it, I love my Mom very much and don't know what I will do without her. ",
