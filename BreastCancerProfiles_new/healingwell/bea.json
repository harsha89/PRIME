      "Content": "  Thankyou for your reply,I  think i worded that wrong.I was prepped for surgery at 7 am and did not have surgery till 3pm and was wondering if anyone else had to wait that long?Then I was reading my surgical report and it said one out of twelve lymphnodes with mestatic  carcinoma measuring 3mm at its greaatest dimmension. I would have thought that was important for me to be told. ",
