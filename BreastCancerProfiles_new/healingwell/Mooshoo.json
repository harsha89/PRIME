    "Content": " Hi, I'm 35 years old and six months ago I had my first mamogram, at the time they called me and asked me to go back for another mamogram and the doctor said that they found microcalcifications and recommended another mamogram in six months, I had that done 2 weeks ago and they called me to tell me that I will need another one in six months, I really don't understand why, so I decided to go see my doctor and asked him to explain to me a little more, since the letter they sent said that it was \"probably not cancer\", which kinda tells me that is not cancer now but it could be later? \nAt least my doctor asked me if I would feel better moving to the next step, biposy, and I said yes, so now I have to go on September 30 to see the general surgeon. \nIs there anything that I should ask him? What should I expect?? \nThank you. ",
