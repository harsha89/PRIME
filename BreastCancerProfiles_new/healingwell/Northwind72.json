    "Content": " On Feb 9, 2015, I went through surgery to replace a new breast expander on one side. My surgeon found that due to the previous infection there was a lot of scar tissue that needed to be cleaned out and she ended up doing a flap procedure to make an adequate support for the breast expander and future implant. This has been a difficult week with more pain than when they removed the infected expander, and more nausea for a longer period, but that could just be me. I am healing well finally and all is looking good at this point. I have had the same concern as you livenlaugh, \"what if I get an infection again?\" I too would like input from someone who has either made it through to completion or given up. I had a bilateral mastectomy and the left side is waiting for expansion and replacement. The right side hopefully soon. ",
