    "Content": " Hi. I am a 28 year old female. I have been Breast feeding my son for a little over 3 years now. I recently noticed that in the areas around my nipples (Areola?) I have sunken in/dented areas. It seems to be in both breasts almost around the same areas. I've worried myseld sick the past few days. My yearly exam is this Tuesday. I also called my doctors office and ask if I needed to try and come in sooner and was told that they could check me at my appointment Tuesday. I know that breastfeeding can affect the way the breasts looks but was wondering if anyone had any insight into this is? Any comments appreciated. \nThanks ",
