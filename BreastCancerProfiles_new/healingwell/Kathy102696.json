History of breast biopsy with benign result. There is no history of the patient's mother, sister, or daughter developing breast cancer.\nTECHNIQUE:\nFull field digital mammography was performed. Craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views of both breasts were obtained. At the patient's request 3-D imaging/Tomosynthesis was not performed at this time. Computer assisted detection was utilized.\nCOMPARISON:\nPatient had a prior mammogram from outside facility. No prior mammogram available for comparison at this time.\nFINDINGS:\nThe breasts are composed of heterogeneously dense fibroglandular tissue, which reducing the sensitivity of the study. A biopsy clip is seen in the posterior upper outer quadrant left breast. There are multiple nodular densities in both breasts, the largest one measuring 2.5 cm in the posterior central portion of the left breast. No suspicious cluster of microcalcifications is seen. There is no evidence of axillary lymphadenopathy.\nIMPRESSION:\nHeterogeneously dense breasts. Multiple nodular densities in both breasts. No evidence of suspicious cluster of microcalcifications. Comparison with prior mammogram study to assess stability is recommended. If prior mammogram is not available, further evaluation with additional mammographic imaging will be recommended.\nBi-Rads Assessment Category: 0 (Need Additional Imaging Evaluation and/or Prior Mammograms for Comparison)\nADDENDUM:\nAddendum dated 09/30/2016.\nPrior mammogram study dated 07/29/2015 from outside facility is available for comparison. There is a nodular density in the posterior central portion of the left breast, new or increased size compared to the prior study. Further evaluation with additional mammographic imaging and targeted ultrasound for the left breast is suggested. Additional multiple parenchymal nodularities in both breasts are stable.\nBi-Rads Assessment Category: 0 (Need Additional Imaging Evaluation and/or Prior Mammograms for Comparison) ",
