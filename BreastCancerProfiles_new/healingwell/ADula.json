She had so enjoyed it as a child and wanted her children to have the same memories. Unfortunately, they weren't there this year. I think it is too hard for Mike to be with his church family because they are all such a part of Becky.\nI sure miss that girl. It seems everywhere I go I am someplace we went together. But I always have happy thoughts. Because we had a party no matter where we were. That is what I miss. The good times. \n Becky's church has taken me in as one of their own and that has helped. They really are a wonderful group of people. I know they have all known her all her life but they understand how I miss her as well.\nI think of you all often and hope everyone is doing well. You are all always in my prayers.\nLove & Hugs,\nAngela ",

      "Content": " Becky's Birthday was so lovely. We had a spur of the moment celebration yesterday at lunchtime. Mike's sister and two sisters-in-law, a church friend and myself had lunch and laughs. Mike's Dad and Step Mom came by later and brought (guess what!) cake and icecream. Just before the kids came home she went up for a rest. She and Mike had dinner out plans. There were Birthday cards that ran accross her entertainment center, accross the bookcase to the left of the fireplace, accross the mantel and accross the bookcast to the right of the fireplace. AND there was a stack 3 inches thick that came in the mail yesterday. She has received at least 10 flower arrangements.\nBecky asked that I thank you all so very much for all your thoughts prayers and birthday wishes. We think of you all so often. You are never far from our thoughts. With everything Becky has going right now it is hard to get the time to sit down at the computer. So this is one thing I CAN do for her out of so much that I can't.\nSo Thanks again for being here and doing what you all do best, love, listen and support.\nHugs and love to all,\nAngela\n \n \n \n ",
