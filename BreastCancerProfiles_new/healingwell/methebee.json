    "Content": " Although it is incredibly (and I mean incredibly) rare, 17 year olds can get breast cancer. Honestly, it's natural to be afraid of it. I'm turning eighteen in two months and I've already had two lumpectomies, and a core sample operation due to breast tumors. The two tumors I had were fibroadinomas, which is a fancy way of saying that they weren't cancerous. They were just where random cells decided to get together where they shouldn't. The only reason I even bothered to get them out (because normally they don't hurt anything), is that they were growing. If they are growing or even if you have the sneaking suspicion that it's something worth checking out, GET IT LOOKED AT. I went to two doctors who told me that they were \"probably just cyst\" \"especially at my age\". But I knew that something was up, so I got it looked at further. Just remember to keep your head about\n you as you get yourself checked out. And remember that you know your body better than anyone.\n-Me The Bee \n ",
