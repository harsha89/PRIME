      "Content": " You story sounds similar to mine. The \nopen incision biopsy was mammogram guided tot he chip they placed when doing the needle biopsy. (The mammogram machine injected what appeared like a fishing line with hook on the end!) The surgical oncologist mad a 4cm incision just about\n my areola at the 12 o'clock position and carefully tacked both sides to avoid a tear. The spot he needed to reach was all the way down to the muscle. He swirled the wire around and popped out a perfect cone shape. The surgery was done on a Wednesday. Thursday was the worst day for pain, but I was back to work on Monday.\nI do not believe that you should still be in significant pain. I would encourage you to call your doctor. Had you been icing regularly? The other thing, it will take a full year before all of the swelling is gone. A few weeks removed from my surgery I was super excited about\n my healing. A year later, not so excited and opted for some minor reconstruction.\nI wanted told the doctor that I wanted a double mastectomy - he indicated that was too radical and too high risk.\nHe said that I did not need radiation because mine was still fully contained in the lobes.\nI am on Tamoxifen treatment for at least 5yrs which has been no walk in the park either, but doctor's do not want to speak about\n that.

      "Content": " I just saw your post as well. Yes, there is no denying that you are scared but you need to follow up with your doctor ASAP -if you describe you symptoms, they will usually rush you in.\nI was an extremely early detection thanks to consistent mammograms at the same clinic and very thorough radiologists. Mine was caught when it appeared as nothing more than pixy dust. So I am a poster child for early detection and being your own help care advocate.\nPlease see your doctor. I will say that after my lumpectomy, I too found a very painful lump. My oncologist saw me the same day I called - I was across the driveway for a mammogram and an ultra sound and then back across the driveway to my oncologist. She had the report before I had returned. What I had found was a lymph gland. My oncologist told me that breast cancer lumps are rarely if every tender to the touch.\nI hope that helps calm you while you wait for your doctor appointment.\n-------\n1.5yrs clean and on Tamoxifen ",
