      "Content": " Hello all,\nI am new to this forum - foregive me if I should begin a new post rather than replying to this one. It's so refreshing to read stories and see that we all struggle with difficult decisions. My OncoType DX score is 17, on the high end of the low risk category but still low risk. Two oncologists at leading cancer programs in New York City tell me the benefit of chemo is only 3% (regimen of CMF). I am not convinced that this benefit outweighs the risks of chemo (including 1% risk of secondary leukemia from chemo) and am leaning towards foregoing chemo. All other factors are good - I had a bilateral mastectomy 4 weeks ago, tumor size of .6, negative lymph nodes and no vascular invasion. Both oncologists suggested I could \"try\" chemo and stop if not well tolerated. I suppose I'm looking for support from other women who have not regretted their \"decision\" to forego chemo. \nThanks,\nAnjie ",
