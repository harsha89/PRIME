      "Content": " Thank you Eveie,\nMy surgeon does not want me to have reconst. until later either. I guess they want to make sure everything is going well and healed. I'm not sure why, but I guess that would be one more thing for me to stress on. There is just so much to take in and learn in a shor amount of time. Do you have any experience with Horm. neg. HER+. I know it's not the best outcome, but not the worst either. I am thankful for the discovery for Hercepton which I am assuming I will be given. I had a feeling going into the lumpectomy that they would say (C). Finding out that I fell into the 20-25% group took the sails out of me. I am definately going to have the genetic testing done, I have 3 sisters, 7 neices, and a daughter. I am going to make sure that they have all the info I can gather for them if God forbid, it strikes one of them. My mother's was diagnosed very late, 30 years ago and my poor Dad is trying to tell me what he can, but in the old days they went for Raddicle mastect. and I think she just had radiation. If she was HER 2 + she didn't stand a chance. She died within 8 months. I am just so hopeful the next 30 years will bring about\n great break throughs for the generation's to come.\nI just moved 1000 miles away from all my friends 6 months ago, so I have felt a little alone at times. They are all rallying to the e-mail and phone for me. I have an all out request for all the funny stories and such they can send. I am leaving for San Diego tomorrow for a week at the beach with most of my immediate family and kids. It should be a great distraction and strength building for my surgery on the 14th. I am looking forward to the close friendships I should make at the Cancer Center over the next months.\nAlso, I am already planning my all out Personal Breast Buddy campaigne that I am going to take on. I feel that this whole thing should have been found last year, and do to my lack of knowlege and a lack of checking out a palpable thickening that was not checked out after the mammo came back normal has unfortunately left me in a worse situation. I am going to make sure everyone in my life knows that Mammography is not the only thing to count on, when something is felt. Amazingling, a week before I had my lumpectomy, one of my best friends called to tell me she had Breast Cancer. She started Chemo last week. We have each other now for support, and since our husbands are also good friends they have each other too. \nI will try and remember to find my joy in each day of my journey. In spite of everything I have a lot to be Thankful for. ",

      "Content": " You are right of course, I am saving my life. And I firmly believe this as i have know intention of letting this beat me. I am hoping that the morning of the surgery I will have the calmness an peace that cam over me at my lumpectomy. My sense of humor had returned and I just knew that at least something was actively being done to rid me of the cancer. I don't think you are working backwads at all, I can't imagine that anyone can be completely prepared, now matter how many pictures we look at. I tell my husband that I will just close my eyes when I take a shower, get dressed and be O.K., he tells me not to SH-- myself, I will struggle, but it is O.K., he does not care in the least (so he says) wheather I have breasts or not, he certainly did not marry me for them, as I was very small breasted and thin at the time. Can you tell me, even though your breasts are gone, does the skin that is left have any feeling of touch, not the arousal kind, just the warm comforting kind, that makes you feel close when snuggling? I will miss that safe, comforting feeling of closeness that contact can provide as you fall asleep. ",

      "Content": " Hi gma,\nYes I have certainly learned a lot. I am not always sure whether that is a good thing or not. I just feel the need to know what is happening to me, so I can mentally prepare for it.\nWhat you can't find is how to overcome the fear and sadness some days. It has certainly helped reading about\n all the women who have faced this situtation. Many are in a much worse place than I am. I suppose with time I will learn how to push it all back into my mind a little, it's just there first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Right now with only a little over a week until my surgery I feel like each day gone is one less day that I will be the same. I stay pretty upbeat most of the time, and then it just grabs ahold of me. Having a place like this to put my week moments into words with people who understand helps a lot. I don't feel so alone.\nIf anyone can give me some good advice on how to mentally prepare for the grief of losing my breasts, which I never felt that much attachment to until now, I would appreciate it. This morning I am having a hard time with courage, you all have so much. ",

      "Content": " Hi, I am new to this board. I have been diagnosed with Stage II ductal Carcinoma with some DCIS. I had a lumpectomy about\n 3 weeks ago. I have been found to be Hormone Neg. and HER 2 positive. I have been advised to have a mastectomy. I have chosen to have a Bilateral in a little over a week. My mother died from Breast Cancer 30 years ago at age 47. I am 47 and scared to death. Thank God for Xanax. I so appreciate the support of Mastectomy/Bilateral or not.\nI have not met with the oncologist yet, which is driving me mad. But I do finally have an appt. the day before the surgery. I am questioning myslef if I should have both or one. I know that my type of Cancer is fairly agressive type, yet still somewhat early in stage. Can anyone tell me if they think I will have both Chemo and radiation? I have had trouble finding info on this with the HER 2 positive thing going on. I had originally thought I could avoid radiation by having the mastectomy. I will do it of course, but I have to rethink my reconstruction options. Just want a few opinions to prepare me. A week is a long time to know the oncologists opion. My margins are clear, nodes looked good at lumpectomy but have not been tested yet. Any opionions to help me prepare for any of this would be greatly appreciated. \nI have a great husband like Viper, but some of these issues I have to resolve on my own.\nThank You ",

      "Content": " Brigetta from Tri-Cities, WA moved here 6 months ago from Central Valley, Ca. Diagnose July 9, 2006. Have what I know so far to be early stage II, Invasive Ductal Carc. with some DCIS. Had Lumpectomy on 7-9. Have been found to be Hormone neg. and HER 2 +. Have been advised to have mastectomy, do to family history and agressiveness I guess. I have opted for Bilateral, surgery is on August 14th. I hope this will help me not have to revisit at leat this part of it all again. Surgeon doesn't do immediate reconstruction, not sure exactly why. I am scared to death and depending on Xanax to get through the days until them. I am 47 the same age my mother was when she died of BC 30 years ago. I know things have change so much since then and mine was found at a much earlier stage. But it doesn't take away all the fear. I have a great husband of 23 years. Two Fantastic kids, Heather 17 a senior this year. Cameron my son is 14 and starting H.S. this year. ",
