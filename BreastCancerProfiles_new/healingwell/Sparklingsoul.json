      "Content": " Thanks, Alcie, for the advice!\nI thought they give you a local before putting in the wire? I can't believe they put a wire in you without a local.\nI'm fine with conscious sedation--I don't want to be aware of the surgery.\nDid you have to take Vicodin after your surgery? For how many days?\nThanks so much,\nDebra ",
