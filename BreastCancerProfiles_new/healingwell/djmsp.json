      "Content": " Well, my Dr called this morning to tell me I have Infiltrating ductal cancer and that pathology tests will grade it and she will be referring me to a surgeon. Do most people go to breast cancer centers? I would like to go to someone that specializes in it. She was going to refer me to a general surgeon and I asked her about\n a specialist, so she said she would call me back. Can I find my own Dr or does a person need a referral. Geez, I think Ihave a lot to learn. And to think, I just had this mammogram done originally because my job insurance offers it free.... ",

      "Content": " I am 57. Went to an oncology surgeon today, who told me I could have lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy, or given my family history, she would totally agree with mastectomy. My father had breast cancer, and my mother died at 51 of ovarian cancer. \nMy path came back ER pos and pr pos, and graded 1. also Her? neg. Dr said that's the \"good kind\" to have? Gee- didn't know there was a \"good kind\". Wants me to have genetic testing done with a return of results in about\n 2 weeks, then decide on lumpectomy vs mastectomy. Or, have lumpectomy done sooner, if I prefer, then go from there. Also will refer me to radiologist and oncologist. Sooo, I guess wait and see ",

      "Content": " After compression mammogram and ultrasound, with a bi-rad of 4 supiscious fr malignancy, I had an ultrasound core needle biopsy of 7mm mass. The radiologist kept missing because he said it was hard and moved. he went through it once and got tip he thinks, after 9 tries. What I wonder, is will pathologist be able to tell what is breast tissue from what is lump? Will I get a negative result? ",
