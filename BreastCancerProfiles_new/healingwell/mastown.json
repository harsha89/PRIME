    "Content": " Â Sue,47, Maine just dx with dcis 2 weeks ago waiting for my Dr. to schedule a mri on both breast. to make sure that it is only in the one spot on my left breast. I really don't like the waiting much. I am a little nervous even though I know this is very curable. I just do not want this to come back. \n \n ",
