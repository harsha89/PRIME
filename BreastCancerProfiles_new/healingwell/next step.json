    "Content": " Dear Ladies my first time on any forum. Was diagnosised with IBC 4 years ago Nov6,'07. Am 47now and doing great. Was told only had 12-18months then. Have proved everyone wrong. Have friend is 12 1/2 years out. I used new chemo called Epurubacin. Don't let anyone talk you into giving up. Get frustrated that everytime I cough more tests. Just had $100,000 worth of tests this summer. Wasn't cancer but told liver failure. Case sent to Harvard drs back east and waiting for diagnosis/treatment plan. I'm not beat yet and plan on enjoying my 9 month old grandson not only now but forever. Live in super small town but 5 cases of IBC here. I'm only one alive and only one that had new chemo. Do your research. MY oncologist taught my husband and I how to research. If your dr doesn't want to discuss what you know GET A NEW DR! research everything you're told.\nnext step ",
