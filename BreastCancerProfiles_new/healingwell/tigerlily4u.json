    "Content": " I am 42 and when in for my Mammogram a little over a week ago. Yesterday almost at 5pm my Doctor called me and refured me to a surgeon. The radiologistÂ  how sent my Doctor the results did not put what breast this was found in. I go year for my mammorgram and that is a good thing. A few eeks ago I started getting hot for no reason. It was below 50 outside and not heat was on in my home. I then did a breast exam and noticed a change on my right breast almost under my arm. It is shaped like a ciger and is about\n 1/2 inch long. It is hard and doesnt move. It is tender in that area. When I had the mammogram they did and exam and she said she found nothing out of sorts. I cannot call ther surgen until Monday because my Doctor did not call me until they where colse. So now im am going nuts thinking the worst. I know i shouldnt do this but i am scared. ",
