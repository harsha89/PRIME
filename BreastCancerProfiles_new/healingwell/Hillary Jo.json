    "Content": " I had a stereotactic biopsy yesterday on both breasts due to microcalcifications found on a mammogram. Although I can usually tolerate pain, I was not looking forward to the procedure, mostly becauise I had read some on-line horror stories.  So, I wanted to make sure that you and others hear a positive story.  Since both breasts were biopsied, I was there for 2 - 2 1/2 hours.  The prone table was a little uncomfortable and it was hard to lay still, but I am so glad I did it.  The pain was VERY minimal.  I felt the lidocaine stick and that was about\n it.  When the probe was inserted, I could feel sometime happening but no pain.  The other breast was the same.  When I finished the biopsy, I told the mammographer that I could have driven myself home.  When I got home, I was waiting for the pain but it never came.  I did not need to take any type of pain reliever.  Luckily, the results were benign.\n \n \n ",
