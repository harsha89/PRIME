I just wanted to see if anyone knew if my grandmother on my father's side of the family had breast cancer, if my (as a 22 year old male with breast tissue) chances are greater.\nAs for making an appointment, I'll probably just mention it next time I get a physical at the end of the year.\nBut yeah, I wasn't overly concerned, and not concerned enough to go get a breast exam. I just wanted to see if that would increase my chances of getting breast cancer along with the fact that I have more breast tissue than I guess the average male though it's not TOO excessive. It's easy to hide, haha. Does anyone know?\nThanks.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, I am a 22-year old male. I have male breast tissue, more-so than other guys I'd say. I mean, it's not too bad, and no one really notices unless I have my shirt off. I guess it has to do with the fact I tuck in my shirt tight enough to avoid visual evidence. Anyway, is male breast cancer something I need to worry about\n? I have a physical yearly, but my doctor doesn't seem to mention anything about\n it. When I look, there aren't any bumps or abnormalities at all. I mean, the only time I think I might feel a bump is when my nipples get hard, and there are bumps around the nipple, but I think it's just from it getting hard. A lot of times when I think about\n health issues too much, I get it in my head that I really feel something when I'm really fine.\nI also read on a website that when women wear bras it increases their chances of getting breast cancer. I wondered if tucking in of the undershirt tight would cause similar instances. I also read this on WebMD: \"Rumors have spread rapidly by e-mail, but no studies have shown that antiperspirants, underwire bras, cell phones, or breast implants can increase the risk of, much less cause, breast cancer. The biggest factors for breast cancer are being a woman and growing older.\"\nI'm just curious, and I should mention that I get anxiety pretty bad about\n health issues, so I thought coming to this forum might help ease my mind a little.\nThanks so much!\n ",
