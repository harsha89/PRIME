      "Content": " I found this forum a few months back when my Dad was diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer. I then starting looking in the breast cancer section when my best friend of 25 years was diagnosed with metastasized breast cancer. We are both only 38.\nThen a few weeks ago I found a lump at 12 o'clock in my right breast. I already had a order slip for a Mammo so I went in for scan. The scan came back normal. I went in to the obgyn and feeling it herself she sent me for an ultrasound. \nThe tech found another 8mm lump at 10o'clock. The first one is 2cm. The radiologist immediately said that I needed a biopsy.\nI had the biopsy on Thursday. The radiologist said she had to be honest that she was concerned. The shape looks like a + that's founded on the edges. My biopsy site is itchy and still painful.\nThey are making me go to the hospital on Monday afternoon to get results. My question is do you think the radiologist already knows I have cancer and just has to wait for the biopsy to tell me? Is it possible to have this much bad luck. My poor mom ðŸ˜ž I have two young kids 4 and 8. I have a bad feeling about\n all of this. ",

      "Content": " I can't believe how many people have read this and not responded. I'm on the prostate page often because of my Dad and can't believe all the support people offer. \nI'm sure that the ultrasound showed a regular round of oval mass with clear lines or they would have biopsied. Haveing a biopsy is no piece of cake. I would watch it close and get a second opinion if your still worried. ",
