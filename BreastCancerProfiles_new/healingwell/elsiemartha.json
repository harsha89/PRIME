      "Content": " I just got back from my doctor's office. The mammo done last week showed an \"increased prominence of a stellate nodule in the right breast\". Not sure what that means except that I read that stellate masses often indicate cancer. Can anyone confirm that?\nI am having a magnification view tomorrow and also an ultrasound. Will be seeing my Dr. next week when the results come back. I should note here that in the last year I switched doctors and this one is a real gem. She and her nurse practitioner are the best.\nAnyway, can anyone shed some light on what a stellate mass is? ",

Two radiologists looked at it in the magnified view and both said it was not stellated/spiculated. I have an appt. with the surgeon on Sept. 27th. I suspect that she will tell me then that she can take it out or leave it in. I am inclined to have it removed just to be on the safe side. ",
