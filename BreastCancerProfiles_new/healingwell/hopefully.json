    "Content": " Last night I found a lump in my right breast..it's solid and feels like it's in my breast tissue. I've always occasionally checked my breasts, but never found anything like this before.  My mother is currently battling breast cancer and I'm not sure if I can deal with it being a possibility for me right now as well.  I'm going to see a doctor this afternoon, but I'm sure all he'll say is - yes, you have a lump - let's do a mammogram and a biopsy.  I'm not sure how I'm going to get through this.  I know it could be benign, but i've never had lumpy breasts and nothing like this.  I barely slept last night thinking about\n it all and I don't even have a diagnosis.  I am just so scared....
