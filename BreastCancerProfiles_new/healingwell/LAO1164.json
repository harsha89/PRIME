      "Content": " Hi-\nI am having a strange feeling and was hoping you all could help.\nMy mom had breast cancer at 42, which returned at 49, and she later passed away. Only person in family to have any illness or die from anything other than old age.\nI am 31, in good health, and went for a breast consult in December. While there, the P.A. squeezed my right nipple (I guess to check for discharge or lumps). I remember an intense pain, but thought that was due to her squeezing. In the past couple of weeks, I've noticed the same pain when putting on clothes that rub against the nipple, or hitting the nipple by accident. The pain comes if I bend the nipple down. It doesn't hurt otherwise. I do not have any pain on the left side or when doing the same thing to the left. I can not feel any lumps or anything different than the left side.\nI am going for a mammogram and MD appt this week.\nI would appreciate any insight you can give!\nThank you! ",

      "Content": " Thanks for your reply! I have to admit, it was a little scary to read. I appreciate and agree with what you said. However, wondering if there are any benign conditions/reasons for pain? Also, if you've had pain, was that at the site of origin, or how far advanced was it? I know there is pain in later stages. Sorry, just feeling anxious and looking for some non-cancer reasons that could explain the pain... ",

      "Content": " Thank you so much for the support. It's just easy to get anxious as you all know. I'm trying not too. Unfortunately I had to reschedule until Monday the 20th. But they did order a mammo and ultrasound to be thorough. Sounds like they are doing the right thing. Thanks for all the insight, and I'll keep you posted! Please keep me in your prayers. ",
