      "Content": " Donna, I too got a callback today. I missed the call so I will have to call tomorrow to schedule the appt. I'm guessing that they won't be able to tell me much. I am 36 and this was my very first mammogram. I think that my breasts are dense and I'm wondering if that could be the reason. I hate worrying but I always do. I'm sorry that you don't have support! I am praying for both of us that it's nothing. ",
