      "Content": " Ellen, I'm still looking into all of this myself.  Here's some info I found on the web that might be of use: Leisha A. Emens and Nancy E. Davidson 2 The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, Maryland 21231-1000 Abstract Hormonal manipulation has been used for over 100 years to treat breast cancer. Ovarian ablation/suppression and tamoxifen are currently accepted adjuvant endocrine therapies for premenopausal breast cancer. Methods of per manently ablating ovarian function include surgical oopho - rectomy and radiation-induced ovarian failure; medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues is a reversible approach. Adjuvant chemotherapy frequently results in permanent amenorrhea and thus rep- resents an indirect form of ovarian ablation. Although early randomized trials of ovarian ablation suffered from small sample sizes and design flaws, a meta-analysis of their re- sults through the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collabora- tive Group demonstrated a clear benefit from ovarian abla- tion as a single intervention in the adjuvant treatment of women less than 50 years of age with breast cancer. The ovary is the major site of estrogen production in the premenopausal woman. A smaller amount of estrogen is pro- duced as a result of the aromatase-mediated conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrone and estradiol in extragonadal tissues. In contrast, peripheral aromatization is the primary source of estrogen in postmenopausal women. This major difference in the means of estrogen production mandates distinct strategies for disrupting its production in premenopausal and postmenopausal women with breast cancer. Accordingly, ovarian ablation/suppression is the most effective means of decreasing estrogen production in premenopausal women, whereas aromatase inhibition is emerging as the backbone of hormonal therapy in postmenopausal women.   If you want ALL 27 pages, I can email it to you.  I can't find the web link, but if you search under their names maybe it will come up.   Best of luck!
