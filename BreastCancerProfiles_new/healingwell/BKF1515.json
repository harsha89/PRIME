      "Content": " Dear Lemonz, Thanks for your reply and I'm honored that you shared some of your story with me. I am so glad for you and other IBC-sufferers that you are a success story. I will definitely keep your symptoms in mind and try not to think about\n it too much. The problem is that the more I think about\n it, the more the area (and my breast) hurts and the more I look at it, the redder it gets. So I know I just have to leave it alone or I will drive myself crazy. I will let you know if I get a prognosis at the dr. next Mon. ",

      "Content": " Thank you, I know looking up symptoms on the internet can be dangerous. I have used an antihistimine cream which hasn't seemed to help. I've also cut out most products and tried to think if I've used something new which I haven't. I tried not scratching for more than a week and the rash got better visually but the need to itch never really went away. I have a dr's appt. in 7 days but am feeling so much anxiety about\n it, I feel like I can't wait till then. Thanks very much for your reassurance though. ",
