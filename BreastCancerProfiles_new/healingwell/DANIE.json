      "Content": " Teresa,\nMy mom had ovarian cancer at 50 and breast cancer at 84 (she's still alive and doing really well at 87) and I decided to have the genetic test last year. Unfortunately I was positive for BRCA2. My brother did not go for testing but his daughter did (27 yrs old) and unfortunately she is also positive. I am in the process of having my dad tested now (there's pancreatic cancer in his family) and if he is negative then we know it comes from my mom.\nI'm tested a few times a yr with mammo/dilon scan (a form of mammo but no x-rays)/breast mri/ultrasounds. Next year I will get a digital mammography instead of a regular one, it's apparently more precise.\nI am aware of the prophylactic mastectomies but everyone around me is horrified at the thought I would actually do it. My insurance would pay for it since it's cost effective. Apparently cancer/chemo costs more than $400,000 per patient!!\nGood luck to everyone, let's hope there is something on the horizon for all of us. There might be something in about\n 10 yrs but who knows! ",
