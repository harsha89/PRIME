    "Content": " Hi my name is Darla and I was diagnosed with breast cancer in march 06. I had a lumpectomy and radiation/chem and finished treatment in march 07. I decided to have genetic testing done in sept 07 and I tested positive for BRCA1. I had my ovaries out in nov and my oncologist recommends double masectomy in the near future. I have an appointment on Jan 25th to see breast surgeon. I definetly want immediate reconstruction but need more info. I have been reading about\n a procedure called DIEP flap. Apparently there is not a whole lot of surgeons that perform this delicate procedure. Do you have any info or experiences you can share with me reguarding this? darla ",
