      "Content": " Hello,\nI am a member of another forum here and scheduled for prostate removal surgery in a few days. But the second issue which is troubling me is pain in left breast nipple area.\nThe pain has been on & off for past 5-6 months. The left breast is little enlarged and the pain goes away after the shower and the pain starts again in the late afternoon to evening.\nHave been taking some high pressure medications for last 8-10 years and took some prostate reduction medications for a few months last year.\nJust had bone scan done for prostate cancer prognosis, and bones are clear..\nI am posting here for help on what type of doctor should I see? Talked to both radiation oncologist for prostate and the urologist - and they both said its not their expertise (although I think if its a side effect of any of those drugs, they should have known about\n it). My PCP is not able to identify the cause of this pain.\nI just want to find the right specialist who can diagnose the cause of male breast pain.\nThanks for any inputs in advance.\nBest\nEin ",
