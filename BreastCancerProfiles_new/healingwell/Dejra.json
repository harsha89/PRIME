      "Content": " Hi and thanks to both of you.\nShe is the most stubborn person. She has moved to Hawaii with her daughter and we are hoping she will convince her to at least get a diagnosis. She can't use her arm hardly at all. I would like to print these posts if you don't mind and send them to her. Maybe it will help.\nI myself like alternative medicine until it is too far then I'm off to the Dr. She is in her 50's. Maybe deep inside she thinks she is ready to die. She is lively and friendly just stubborn. ",

      "Content": " I have a friend who has a very enlarged breast it is like she has a grapefruit in there and now it is moving under her arm. \nThe information I have is that it has been slowly growing over 2 years and is uncomfortable. She is a believer in alternative medicine and has not been to a medical Dr. If it were cancer she would be sick. She is not. so what could it be? any help will be appreciated. \n ",
