      "Content": " Well last night I found a lump.  I thought perhaps since I've been workin out for the past three days it was just sore then I felt it!  I dont know what to think.  I haven't make the call to the Dr. yet so this may take weeks or something.  I'm 42 with a beautiful family.  Is all breast cancer curable?  On one hand I think it's NOT cancer, then I FEEL it and I know in my heart it is.  I'm just afraid and worried.  Will be making that call soon as they \nopen this morning.\n ",
