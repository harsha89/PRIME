    "Content": " Tammy i accidently lurked over here to the breast cancer forum, tried tohit bipolar but hit breast cancer instead, so I thought i would reply , and let you know that you and all here at healingwell in all the forums are in prayers this site has been a real saver for me and many others and I am sure you know that too!! I am glad surgery went well. Reading about\n the feathers reminded me of a story I had read in an Angels on Earth magizine, it put out by guideposts, anyway I can t rembere the story verbatim, but the husband without his wife knoing had placed a pink feather in drawer( at least I think this is how it goes, but you will get the idea), somehow she new without seeing or being otld the feather was there, and when she came too she immedialty asked where is the pink feather, and hte husband was shocked as he had said nothing about\n it at all, and they had not discuassed pink eathers prior to that, she just knew it was there, anyways I thought that was an uplifting story I read, and wanting toi share it, my aunt had breast cancer , and she had a breast removed several years ago, she remians cancer free. My other aunt had ovarian cancer and as far as I knwo she is cancer free too, so there are happy ending out there too, I hope and pray you recover quickly...with much love...Sheryl\n \n ",
