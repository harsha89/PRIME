      "Content": " Hello,\nI am 44 with a history of 'lumpy breasts' as my doctor would call it. When I was 30 I had two lumps removed which were confirmed benign. In January I started experiencing sharp pains in each breast. I recently had a mammogram which came back normal. I was referred to the breast specialist because of the pain and an ultrasound was performed. They found several cysts and a complex mass. I am scheduled for a thin needle biopsy on June 4th. I really don't know what to expect and pretty nervous. I figured joining this group could offer insight and encouragement while I play the waiting game. ",
