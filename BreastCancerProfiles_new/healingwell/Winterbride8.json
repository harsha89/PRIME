      "Content": " I HAD MY DOUBLE MASTECTOMY IN MAY 2013 AND HAVE THE CONSTRICTION AND PAIN MANY OF YOU DESCRIBE. I DID THE PT THING FOR 8 WEEKS AND CONTINUE TO MASSAGE THE AREA SEVERAL TIMES A DAY. I AM ON NEUROTIN BUT IT CAN MAKE ME SPACEY. LYRICA DOES NOTHING. MY ONCOLOGIST SUGGESTED STEROID INJECTIONS BUT I AM STEROID REACTIVE. I USE MEDITATION AND PRAYER. I LIVE IN A RURAL AREA SO MOST ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE. IS ANYTHING NEW COMING? SEEMS LIKE THERE ARE A LOT OF US SO SURELY SOMETHING MUST BE HAPPENING. ",
