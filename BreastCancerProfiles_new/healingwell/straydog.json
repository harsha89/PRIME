      "Content": " Hi Amanda & welcome to the forum. Of course you are scared, but please try not to let the anxiety take control. These weird feelings you are having in your breasts now is your anxiety working on you. The finding on your mammo is very common with woman. Asymmetry in breasts can be caused by many things including puberty to hormones just as an example. Because this was found your dr is doing the appropriate thing by making sure there is nothing there suspicious. \nPlease let us know what you find out next week. Spend the weekend keeping yourself busy & you mind occupied. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

A good friends of mine, her son went to law school & he has done very well. When he was in high school, I convinced my boss to hire him during summer break & he did. We kept him busy until he went off to college. His mom & I made several trips to see him while in college. I am very proud of him.\nI did a search here at the forum on Taxol & found some very old threads. Considering the age of those threads I am not sure how useful they will be to you.

Hopefully this cold will not linger so you can move forward. But very happy to read your xrays came back clear!!\nAnd finally, a hearing date for your husband's claim. That is just awesome. It is extremely important that the attorney has all of your husbands medical records before the hearing. Does your husband keep the atty informed of his dr visits & the dates he was seen? One thing I learned when dealing with SS, never rely on them having all of the current medical records. I would go as far to contact the atty well in advance to what records he has in his file too.\nI have been living on a heating pad, boy the massage really did a number on me.

      "Content": " E, I am going to attempt to copy a paragraph here for you to read from the chronic pain forum. It may be something for you to discuss with the dr for your hands.\nYou may also want to look into compounded topical creams that combine lidocane, tramadol, amitripyline, and gabapentin - among other medication combinations. Compounding medications allows customization of medication formulations, upon the request of a physicians, to best suit a patient's needs. Ketamine and clonidine and dexamethasone are also possible neuropathic agents that could be compounded into a creme for application. CentralDrugsRx.com has a comprehensive listing of pain medication preparations that are possible via personal compounding. I would suggest visiting the web site and printing their contents of speciality formulations to review/discuss with any one of your MD physician providers. You might be able to find significant and specific relief with a customized compounded transdermal creme or patch.\nThe above paragraph was about\n people with neuropathic pain that the typical medications do not work well for. I immediately thought of you with your fingers & hands. The lady that posted this info is a licensed physical therapist who is no longer able to be a hands on therapist due to her health. She really has some wonderful insight. Anyway something to consider for those hands. I believe it was Moira that mentioned B12, my husband's dr has him on B12 daily. We both take it, we get the cherry flavored one that dissolves under the tongue. That is the kind his dr suggested. He has diabetic neuropathy in his hands & feet severely. I believe your husband has it too. I intend on looking into a compounds for him & have him take info to his dr to see if he will rx something. In the meantime, I do know they now make analgesics with lidocaine available OTC, may be something you could try. Comes in a tube & you could try rubbing it into your hands. \nPlease take good care of you & be kind to yourself. You have been through a lot with too many speed bumps.\nHugs & prayers being sent your way. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I went to Drugs.com & looked up each of these medications & the side effects. That website gives very detailed information on medications, including what drugs that can interact with each other. All 4 medications appear to have some of the same potential side effects. Each person reacts so differently & it is going to depend on what your friend can tolerate. I have a good friend that went through breast cancer & was cancer free for some time. The cancer came back & it's pretty much everywhere. She is currently doing chemo & she gets sick on the morning of day 2. She has a lot of pain & horrible nausea & has to take medications. She has been on chemo about\n 2 months & she is really struggling. She said she had forgotten how sick chemo made her before. She is a fighter & has battled it so hard for so many years. She is 72 years old. I do not know what medication she is on either. \nIt sort of sounds like this lady is not very informed about\n her treatment. If she goes to the above site I posted she can read there about\n the side effects. It will be questionable on whether she will be able to drive herself.

They will award it for x amount of time, then do a review to see if the person is still disabled, or award it on a permanent basis. Either way, this little windfall could not have come at a better time & will help with your COBRA payments. Since they went back to March the clock starts ticking on the Medicare. Congrats on getting it.\nOh, your LTD will continue with SSD, so yes, you will have to keep LTD informed with records. SSD gets an offset since you are entitled to LTD. Normally the two should bring you up to what you made while working between the two payments. As long as drs deem you disabled the two will pay normally to the age of 65. Once a person turns 65 the LTD stops & you are kicked over to SSD with an increase in the check from them. At least this is how it has always been. \nWow, finally, finally you get a call from your PS. Lets hope she follows through as she says she will. I am so relieved she finally called you. \nWill be praying this thyroid thing is ok!!! Will look forward to a good report once your dr tells you what it showed.

      "Content": " Good morning Linda!! I know what you mean about\n the first name. You know just a thought, your son is terribly young & I have to wonder if he is going through a \"I need to find myself\" type of thing. Perhaps he trying to prove something to himself. This is more common than we realize with people. At 23 he is young enough to live his new life & later change his mind how he prefers to live out his life. He has proven he can maintain with a bare existence. Never give up hope that he may decide to give that life style up at some point in his life. One thing about\n it, when living off of the grid they have to give 500% to exist or they don't survive. He is a survivor. As mom we have to remember this as hard as it is. How you have described his visit does not surprise me at all, including the heated moments. \nI imagine being home & seeing his old life style was pretty much an unraveling moment for him. Living in solitude & coming back to his old life for a visit probably did a real number on his head. He may have thought what was I thinking living this life style & mom & dad are thinking the same thing about\n him living off the grid. I guess it goes both ways.\nNow, about\n your husband & the vegan diet, lol. Oh boy, your son has his work cut out for him. He has done a lot of studying some where to learn about\n living off the grid. Even with some of these so called healthy diets, they are lacking in certain nutrients the body needs. Eating a healthy diet is the key but I am out on the extremist. There are some people in the UC & crohns forum that are on various diets & they are convinced they can control the disease with diet. Most people are not disciplined enough to stick to these diets & fall off the wagon. My thoughts are their disease is so mild the meds they were on put them in remission & they are staying away from foods that can irritate the gut. Lots of different theories none proven. Someone newly dx'd gets shell shocked & denial is usually at the top of the list.\nWe have had members here at HW that has attempted to push their diets on people, I am talking extremist & those people get banned permanently. An example, there was one that was posting in multiple forums telling people your diet is why you have this disease & you are continuing to feed it. There was a mom that posted about\n her 11 yr old daughter had a deadly disease. She blamed the mom, claimed the food caused it, well that one was banned. We have had a couple hit this forum touting some lady in Az beat BC with diet & provided the link. It was naturally a scam. Send me money & I will provide you with CD's to listen to, lol. My problem with this sort of thing is when people are usually dx'd with with a horrible disease the fear factor kicks in & thinking can get skewed & they often fall for BS like this.\nYou are so close to finishing up with your fill ups & can put all of this behind you. Seems like it has taken forever I am sure. But you had some big hurdles to jump that slowed things down. Yes, I am certain you have more patience now than ever.\nIt is bitterly cold this morning. We had an artic front blow through last night bringing rain, sleet & snow south of us. We had some sleet for about\n 20 minutes yesterday. Not enough to do any damage here. But down south, they got it & usually they do not get it often. It is 22 out wind chill of 5. I do not do cold well. Our normal temps this time of year is in the 50's not this. The wind is still bad. I have filled the feeders with peanuts for the squirrels so they will have something to eat.\nHang in there you are almost there!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " So glad you found the info in the PC forum. Hopefully the info Pratoman gave your onc will be on board with. Anything safe is very much trying as long as the drs agree in my opinion.\nYes, I do have a very long history of chronic pain as a result of years of back problems. I have done it all short of surgery. By waiting as long as I did the drs say odds are not good at relieving the pain, same with my neck. Back in 2005, we ran out of options with oral medications so had an implanted intrathecal pain pump implanted for the back pain. The battery in the pump lasted about\n 8 years & the pump had to be replaced. My dr at the time for whatever reason refused to implant another Medtronics pump which is what all drs implant. She had an old style that is considered a manual pump implanted, not computerized at all put in. A month after the implant I threw a blood clot that hit my left lung & had a mild heart attack. Then the catheter on this pump became clogged up & no medication is getting through the catheter that is placed in the spinal canal. I had made a surgery date to have the pump & catheter taken out & ended up with an infection that would make surgery too risky. Now have another infection going on & am battling it. I have no plans to have a 3rd pump put in because of the fears of continuing more surgery when the batteries die on these pumps. I have COPD & tons of other health issues making me not the best surgical candidate around. At best I would get another 8 years out of a new pump which would make me 71 needing another surgery, no thanks. I do have several forums of psoriasis which knock on wood is under control for the time being. I have had countless hospital admissions from it becoming infected & causing cellulitis on my legs. It can be a beast to deal with at times, lol.\nMy gosh, 4 back surgeries!! I am so happy to read that your final one took care of your issues. That is such a rare thing to read anymore. Its refreshing to read someone was helped with surgery. I know there are many, many successful surgeries done every day. I have read many stories here at HW about\n folks having surgery & saying it failed. Anyone having any type of surgery, especially spine surgery needs to be prepared not only physically but mentally as well. Far too many go in with blinders on, not prepared for the post op period, not having things at home ready so when they get released. I have read over & over I had no idea it would be this rough but they never asked questions to their dr or did any homework on their own. \nGet all the rest you need, you have been through a lot. Maybe some of the earlier energy a little adrenaline kicking in too. It will get better. \nStill feeling rough 2nd round of antibiotics plus two shots yesterday, lol. Will kick this for sure.\nSending positive thoughts & vibes your way.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I can't fathom what happened with your toe last night, how horrible.\nI am pretty sure the insurance will pay for the scope without a problem. The dr is correct about\n it being the gold standard. The scope is a breeze its the prep that is the pits.

Again, by you sharing your experience you have & will touch many, many lives. I don't know if you are aware of this or not but to date you have had over 2500 views of your post. Can you imagine how many people you have touched & helped by sharing your experience!! A lot of people are not into forums for various reasons & prefer not to join. However, those people can read the forums they just cannot post on them unless they are members. We have many times at night more guests online than actual members. So please, as long as you feel like posting, please do so.\nI have read the speed bumps you have ran into & you always get across them. As you say, keep that thought I am going to kick this cancer's butt. Don't let yourself get caught up too much in the what if it comes back. That is normal though just don't let it distract you. My sister & several of my friends that have had breast cancer all had the same fear. Once you are declared clear & go for the yearly mammo, you will be a nervous wreck to get the results. My sister finally learned to relax on her 5th anniversary. Remember you are a fighter & fight this you are doing. Hopefully the chemo fog will clear up before long, hang in there. You are doing an amazing job. \nHopefully the new year with bring the disability approval your husband needs. It is so hard to get it & such a lengthy process. By chance do you have long term disability through your employer? A lot of times they have both & when a person goes out they use the short term first & if they exhaust that they switch to the long term. Hopefully you will have it. \nEnjoy your visit with your sons & I hope that you & your family have a wonderful Christmas.

I can tell reading your post what a lift in your spirit this has been.\nI know it will be difficult for your son to adjust being in the hoopla of things. Being in solitude for awhile this visit will be a huge adjustment & possibly overwhelming at times for him. All you can do is give him his space & enjoy your time with him. If he is willing to talk about\n living off of the grid, I am sure he has many interesting stories to tell. If all goes well, he may later end up back in Florida permanently. We can always hope. I would have loved to have seen your face after that phone call.\nYour area where your port was at should settle down in time. Mine looks ugly, sticks up rather high, you can see it through shirts. Depending on the type of straps on bras it can get a little uncomfortable. I figure after this many years there is so much scar tissue involved its just not worth having it removed. If it ever becomes an issue for me then I would check on having it removed.\nHow many fill ups will it take to be finished? You are at the stage of I want all of this stuff completed & over with. I don't blame you a bit. As my mother would say, things happen for a reason even if we never know the reason.\nOur Christmas was different this year. Not the usual hang out day of snacks & a meal together. This is how we have always done Christmas, even after my son got divorced & my daughter. I felt sorry for myself, I don't do change well. I think my son realized his change of plans was not a good one. Hopefully this will not happen again. I did go to a light festival with my daughter & her boyfriend. It was just beautiful & amazing. I did a lot of walking & spent 2 days in bed on a heating pad. However, I would do it again, it was wonderful.\nI can't wait to read more about\n your visit!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

Every person's situation is unique & their own. If you are having a rotten day & need to rant or vent about\n something please know its allowed here. Sometimes just getting junk off our chest helps a little.\nYou know we really never know just how much we can take or handle until we are put in a situation. I am talking dire circumstances such as yours. You had a lot going on before the cancer dx. I feel certain the cancer dx felt like the final straw. With everything going on how could you not be getting depressed. The financial part of your treatment with these high co-pays, the days that you feel so bad all you can do is curl up in a ball & pray for relief. Its ok to have your melt downs as I call them. I have had more than my fair share of those over the years because of health problems. I am one of those that has to be in control of me & when things happen that I feel I am losing that control, well its just not pretty. I still saw you are doing an amazing job of holding things together. \nBack in the day when my health was in such a mess my PCP put me on an antidepressant with the agreement I would get in with a psychologist. He referred me to a lady that turned out to be my saving grace. Of course that was the good old days of cheap co-pays, nothing like what people pay today. Had it been that high I would have really had to limit seeing her. I do hope at some point you can find someone that will agree to see you on a sliding pay scale.\nMy friend that had breast cancer struggled when her hair fell out. She had long hair too. I remember when she went to the Cancer Society here, they offered free wigs to cancer patients. She said the wigs they offered were just absolutely awful looking. She did not get one, she left there in tears. She said it was another reality check that I have cancer. She said you know I understand they are not going to offer a high end wig, but in all honesty I would have gone bald before putting one of those on. She did buy her own wig that really looked good. And she did at times go bald out in public or sometimes wore a scarf or hats. It took her some time to get there for sure & she said it felt like she was taking back some control by doing this.\nWill be curious about\n the results of the testing for the brain fog. I find the testing you described interesting. \nAbove all cut yourself some slack & give yourself a hug each day. Take care.....\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Linda, I am sorry that this subject has caused you more issues. I hope at some point you will begin to feel the more you get it off your chest the better it will be for you, rather than trying to stuff it way down inside. I for one & am sure many others will appreciate you writing about\n the GB experience. It is very much a real health issue that not many know about\n.\nThe healthcare industry has really gone down the tubes in my opinion. I have had too many instances of things happening over the years to have the best attitude towards the entire mess. We are not suppose to get political here, but I firmly believe once we were forced into what I call \"managed care\" through our private health insurance it was a game changer in the care we receive. Before we had the old indemnity policies 80/20 until you met your deductible. Drs could be drs & do what testing they felt was necessary, our quality of care was much better. Our drs did not have some goof ball with no medical training telling him how to be a dr. Even our hospital care was much better then. We didn't have a shortage of medical personnel in the hospitals those days. Now, they run with the fewest people possible, patient care is the pits & the hospital administrator is more interested in his big bonus yearly. All of this at the expense of the patients. As you can tell this is a huge thorn in my side.\nMy brother was inpatient at Health South here. He was in a horrible one car accident, coded at the scene. Once stabilized he was careflighted to Parkland, it was the closest level 3 trauma center. The only problem we had with Health South is he had a trach, for whatever reason the staff could not keep this in mind. So when he pressed the call button of course he couldn't speak. That was a problem. He did receive excellent rehab there. He was in so many different hospitals & rehabs for 4 long months. After his accident Health South had their big shake up & we lost our only inpatient facility & several outpatient ones. \nMy family is small too, I do have concerns about\n getting older but I just try to take things one day at a time. I hope to never be dependent or a burden for either of my kids. I don't have a guarantee for tomorrow. \nNow, I am rambling, lol. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I have little to no knowledge about\n IVIG, I have seen it mentioned in other forums here. Will it be cheaper if you can do it in his office rather than outpatient at the hospital? I think you made a very wise choice to hold off on PT until after radiation is done.\nI have not been posting much this past week or so. I had to have all my lower teeth pulled & fitted with a denture of sorts almost 2 weeks ago. What a nightmare this has been lol. The pharmacist called the dentist & said her long acting pain medication will take care of her mouth pain so he voided the darn script\n!! I was ready to throttle the pharmacist as she was very wrong. There is a huge difference between chronic & acute pain. I spent the first night walking the floors, crying, throwing up.

I told the pharmacist when I took that script\n in I know exactly what you told my dentist yesterday & she denied it of course. I said go ahead & call him again, he will be expecting your call.

      "Content": " E, I don't know how you are holding it together with all of this extra BS from your job & the health insurance. This is just nuts. I do hope that your dr is going to appeal the claim for the Gaba stuff. In fact, I would call their office & verify that they are in the appeal process. In the past couple of years I have seen more & more of meds being denied to patients but once they appeal it things work out. Sick people should not be put through this kind of extra stress.\nI think like you, if the dr is not concerned about\n the Taxol being cut short, I wouldn't worry either. Even though it was cut short, there is a reason we will never know as to why you did do the full course of it. Sure GB put the brakes on it, but there was another reason. Back in 2013 I had a new pain pump implanted. Less than a month after surgery I had a blood clot hit my lung, had a heart attack & COPD kicked in high gear. I was on a vent & went unresponsive. The drs told my husband if I had family out of town to call them because they had little hope for me. Then, the catheter clogged up with that pump & I had surgery scheduled to have it taken out & a new one put. One week before surgery I had a cyst on my back that became infected, so surgery was canceled. I did wound care for 3 months every day & it took a year for it to completely heal. My husband & I talked about\n it & decided that these incidents were an omen of not doing any more surgery unless its life or death type of thing. Now you understand my comment about\n the Taxol.\nOn a side note, I recently got on FaceBook saw a post on a young man that I know. Some of his friends had set up a GoFundMe acct. I had heard he was in a nursing home for 3-4 years & never knew why. He got West Nile virus & developed GB, he is paralyzed from the waist down in a wheelchair. Early on he had more paralysis but it improved somewhat to where he is now. They have found a rehab facility that treated GB patients such as him with an extensive rehab program. They do not accept his insurance & they are trying to raise $10,000 to get him in the facility. This guy is in his mid 40\"s maybe, so very sad. I do hope they can raise the money. One of my old bosses was friends with his dad. My boss hired this kid one summer to run office errands. Here is someone with the possible shot at a cure & once again insurance is an obstacle, it blows my mind.\nI have had my port since 05. I was getting an IV medication every 4 weeks for treatment of crohns. I have always had terrible veins. They were so bad oncology had a lot of trouble. They called my dr & suggested I get a port put in. Made my life & treatment easier for 3 1/2 years. Sometimes it bothers me & I have lost quite a bit of weight & it really sticks out.\nNow soon you can move on to the next phase of finishing everything up relating to the breast cancer. Then, let the celebration begin!! Also, still praying for a nice SS check arriving in your checking acct. Its time for things to turn around for you.\nKeep me posted please.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

So sorry to read the appt with the PS did not turn out so well. \nWe are struggling with horrible heat & a drought on top of it. We need rain something terrible. My son heard on the weather we need 8 inches of rain to get us out of this drought. This was last week. The lakes are getting low, not to mention the grass fires. I just keep dragging the sprinklers out & watering to save the lawn.\nWill be looking for an update.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I would not have ever thought on that happening but it makes it so much easier for families that cannot be there for the big event. \nI think its good that you are posting about\n the GB. This is another event that happened with the breast cancer. Your entire story is a wealth of information for others to read. I know you have improved but you still have a lot of deficits from GB. We do not often realize how things we take for granted in our every day life, suddenly either not being able to do them at all or be very limited. I just hope that you can get the gel & it helps with your hands. I can't fathom what you have on your plate. The guy's name is Brian Strein on FB. I have not checked lately to see how close they are to the goal. I just get disgusted that he has a chance of getting better & insurance issues are standing in his way. I will not get on my soapbox about\n insurance & healthcare. Yes, you are correct at how the GB struck Brian. \nMy situation is what it is. I have learned to deal with what I can & leave the rest in his hands. My turning point was watching so many life & death situations with my brother over the years. Even his drs would shake their head in amazement. It has taken me lots of years to to understand that I cannot control everything, lol. \nHang in there things will change....\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Linda, I think with PTSD there can be all sorts of triggers for people that suffer with it. Just from what you saw about\n the airplane situation, I have to agree with you. Personally, I think it was stupid & the show must be hard up to get people on it with real problems & issues!! I have been on flights where we were delayed to either get to the gate or take off. No one went on tv & complained about\n it either, lol. Was I happy, no, but it is just one of those things that can happen.\nWhat an experience for your friend. Is she still doing ok? I think it would be a little frightening to have something like that happen & have no answers as to why. Thank goodness you were there with her.\nMy friend is struggling somewhat with the IV chemo. She gets chemo crash & says she tells herself for every rough day the next day may be better. She has lost her hair again, so she wears hats. She lives down at the lake & it is a tiny town. She is organizing a cancer support group down there. Something like that will be a blessing for many & word will get out too. Her & the husband ended up adopting a little boy, I think he is 10 now. It is a very long story, something to do with some friend of her daughter. The mother was busted for drugs & was sent to the pen for a long time. Her daughter committed suicide (long history of mental problems) & this little boy came into their life shortly after that happened. He has given them a new purpose in life. Keep in mind they are in their 70's. In a way, I feel this little boy has probably extended their lives, between keeping up with his sports & their health issues they stay busy. She went on a field trip to the Austin for the day last month. She said yesterday her legs are still giving her fits from all of the walking. She amazes me.\nOur weather is typical for this time of year. We are warm for good now, the weather man said we could put our jackets away for the next 6 months, lol. I have been planting some flowers in pots & still have a couple of more pots to make. I have some pots to sit by the pool. I sit out back every morning & have my coffee. I love to watch & hear the birds. My son finally saw a pair of black & yellow birds that has shown up. He looked them up & they appear to be Baltimore Orioles & they are common here. I had no idea. \nPlease keep writing your experiences here. I do not feel they are OT, they are very much a result of the cancer dx. No, you are not a mess, lol. You have had some extremely traumatic things happen. \nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I know you are feeling lower than a snakes belly at this point, understandably so. You have & are experiencing what I call the domino effect. \nI can give you some insight about\n staph infections. Yes, they are very serious & can be difficult to treat. We carry staph in our bodies, it's in out noses believe it or not. Staph often will hit a weakened part of the body. \nA friend of our had a knee replacement about\n 10 years ago maybe longer. This past spring that knee suddenly swelled up & became red. Staph had hit her knee. They had to go in & remove the knee replacement & put a spacer in. They treated her with massive antibiotics. For 12 weeks she had to keep her leg straight & was pretty much bed ridden. about\n 8 weeks ago, the drs gave clearance for a new knee to be put in. She was under the care of an infectious disease dr for the staph. If you are not seeing one, get one ASAP.\nMy husband, 20 years ago took a radiator cap off my daughters car & was burned on his stomach. about\n 6 weeks later his knee swelled up & was huge. We were on our way home from vacation & had to stop at an ER so they could drain fluid off. Got him to ER at home, he had staph infection in the knee & it was eating up the cartilage in his knee at a fast rate. They had to do surgery on his knee. Again, an infectious disease dr was brought in to handle it. He was under his care a long time. He did get rid of the staph.\nI have had staph & also got MRSA in the past 5 years. I got rid of them with a lot of antibiotics. These are your success stories kiddo.\nI know you are not in a good space right now, but please come here & write to get things off of your mind. Do not ever worry about\n what someone else may or may not read. This is your story & journey. I wish there is more I could do at this point for you. Sending many healing thoughts & prayers your way.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I needed to read something uplifting & your post gave me that, so thank you!!\nMy question now is, what is the next step? I am guessing maybe the drs will wait a bit before going any further? I don't know, this is why I am asking.\nWe went all summer with no rain. In the past month we have had quite a bit of much needed rain. The past 4 days has been rain & very dreary looking outside.

You have been rowing the boat alone for so many years no wonder you are stressed to the max. Then to be told you have breast cancer, wow. \nSomething I will pass on to you about\n neuropathy. I read in many forums here & in the Prostate Cancer forum there is a long time member over there named Pratoman that posted something you ahould check out. Please look for the post called something about\n QOL & being a musician, by username Union98. Pratoman posted about\n a family member with cancer & on chemo & what her oncologist recommended to help ward off the neuropathy. That forum is a very busy one, so if it is not on the first page look on page 2 or 3. I immediately thought on you. If you have trouble finding it let me know. I tried to copy & paste it here but it just did not work out for me, lol. When I finish with this post I will go & look at the original poster's username & add it to this post.\nAny idea from the atty as to when your husband may get a hearing date?

      "Content": " Like you, I did not cook Christmas dinner. We went to my son's & his girlfriends house so the kids could \nopen their presents & had a late lunch. We had a honey ham too, lol. Everyone brought dishes, my contribution was a fruit salad, lol. We did have a great day with the kids, the boys are 11 & nearly 4. The kids just make the day. The 11 yr old is our only grandchild, now with his girlfriend we have a new one in the family. I did cook all of Thanksgiving dinner which I had not done in years & spent 3 days in bed, it was too much. I will not do that again.\nMy husband has a long standing circulation problem in his leg from blood clots. The first one was a very large one in the main vein. It took the surgeon's partner filling in one day to pick up on the symptoms my husband was having. The surgeon kept blowing him off. He spent over 30 days in the hospital. It was a nightmare.\nThe leg was so bad that he eventually had to retire after 38 yrs at his job. After retiring the dr said file for SSD. He had a few minor things show up on his heart but cardiologist said don't worry about\n it. SSD sent him to one of their drs over his leg & the dr paid little attn to the leg & out right said your heart is a big problem & you need to see the best cardiologist you can. He did get awarded his SSD without any problem. His pcp sent him to his cardiologist & he ended up having a pacemaker put in. \nHe has had one vein procedure done which did not work. We are waiting now for his cardiologist to schedule another vein procedure that he does. He says he does them different & it should help the blood flow in his leg. Between blood flow issues & diabetes he has been doomed to these nonstop ulcers for years. \nAnother issue is his blood pressure is running super low. He has so many things going on that literally wipe out his energy. He will be 72 next month & he tries so hard especially since the weight loss to be more active. He has different hobby interests but it zaps what energy he has. I am constantly checking on him in the garage to make sure he is ok. He has fallen several times & I get nervous. It is like we get a little help with one issue & another crops up.\nI don't know if you have kept a diary or not of your husbands daily issues, now would be a good time to start one. This too can be used at his hearing. \nA very Happy New Year to you & your family!!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Morning E, yes back in the day I was much younger & all I wanted to do was keep working. My dr that was giving me the steroids, I first knew him on a professional level. My boss knew how I was struggling & suggested going to him for a consult. I told him upfront I have to keep working, staying home is not an option, plus I loved working in the legal field. I had a great boss & made decent money. I worked a lot of long hours, lol. It was not the typical 9-5 job, not by a stretch, lol. We really did not have the access or knowledge available back then either. I ended up crashing after all the years of being on it, ended up flat on my back in the hospital for a week. My wonderful old gp hit the ceiling when he found out how long I had been doing Decadron shots. His big concern was me having a stroke or heart attack, my BP was off the charts. He informed me what steroids did long term none of it good either. Of course now if you give me oral or IV steroids I go into congestive heart failure by day 3. He knew the dr very well, personally & professionally & with me sitting there he called him I cannot repeat what he said to him either, lol.\nI lost my dad unexpectedly 18 months prior to my mom passing. He had a quad bypass & replaced the aortic valve. He was 72 yrs old. When they did a procedure the morning of the surgery the dye used put him in kidney failure which we were aware of he had bad kidney issues.. He needed the surgery regardless. His hospital stay was a complete nightmare. My brother & I spent lots of time in the administrator's office trying to get him proper care. The head nurse of the cardiac floor could give medication at her discretion to the patients. They were giving him an anti-psychotic drug that made him just crazy. He was hallucinating really bad, so they decided he had dementia, was an alcoholic or a sundowner. He had not had anything to drink in over 25 years. You cannot imagine the rage in me, he was defenseless with these people. I did get that medication stopped. But a nurse did give it to him another time & I found out all he$$ broke loose once again. I saw lots of patients on that floor that had no clue where they were or how they got there. They eventually told me he needed to be put in a nursing home. That was not going to happen. I got busy & called a dr friend that I knew was friends with a head of a well know rehab hospital. He made a call & they sent a liaison to the hospital to evaluate him to see if he would be a candidate. They accepted him & I took him by car to the rehab hospital. After they did a complete physical on him & the drs all met the very first thing the head dr said was \"your father has been heavily over medicated\" & we have already started removing these medications except any meds related to his heart condition. In 7 days my dad was back & his mind was clear as a bell. Because of the kidney issues the rehab hospital did not have dialysis facilities so I took him out patient 3 days a week in the evening for this. His kidney dr said his labs were showing he had some kidney function returning so he stopped the dialysis & he had a massive heart attack the day before he was to be released to go home finally. As it turned out he only had 15% function, I do not understand why the dialysis was not done on a taper to see if the trend continued. He was doing the max allowed for dialysis. Losing both that close together just took a toll on me.\nI can relate to the kid problem. My daughter lost her way too & it took several years to get back on track. I feel blessed that she found her way, it could have been a disaster. She married a guy that had a 2 1/2 yr old girl. Eventually they went to court & won custody of her. My daughter was not able to have children & this little girl filled that void in many ways. She always told her SD, I am not your mom I want to be your friend, you have a mom. Their marriage lasted 15 yrs & she was the positive influence in her life & still is. They have a bond that is incredible, my daughter was & is the mom she never had. Now the girl is 21 & just clueless & so immature. She has been taking college classes since she was 17!! She is still doing basic classes & has no clue what she wants. It is so stressful. She has a BF & he has 2 grown kids & they are the very same way!! My daughter says mom that generation these kids are lost & they still expect the parents to support them. All 3 go to school to keep the money coming in from parents & grandparents. I think my daughter is right about\n that generation.\nYes, Lantus is so expensive. That is why my husband gets all of his medications through the VA. I do hope that either of the 2 sites can be of help. Sure saves me money on my BP meds monthly.\nMaybe you need to call your drs & speak to whoever is filling out your paperwork & get them up to speed & explain how these different dates are creating nothing but problems. As of now who is your main dr in charge of your care? If there is one, perhaps that is the one that needs to be doing your forms to eliminate all of chaos. \nI hope this finds you well. Today will be a good day for me, it is fairly warm out plus the sun is out. My kind of day, lol..\nTake care...\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

Make copies of everything too. This starts your paper trail. Can you afford to seek some counseling, even if it is once a month. Lets say you decide to speak with an atty about\n this, one of the first things you will be asked is, are you seeking treatment & what dr dx'd PTSD? In situations like this having a dx from a dr & seeking treatment is a big part of arriving at what is called damages.\nI would not hold my breath on being contacted by anyone over the questionnaire. This is why I urge you file a complaint against the hospital, that will get their attention. They need to be called on the carpet, as long as no one will speak up that type of treatment never stops. My dad was hospitalized for heart valve surgery, believe me, anything that could go wrong health wise did. The hospital admin found out very quickly that when I showed up in his office not to ignore me, I would not go away. The things that happened to him in that facility should not ever happen to any patient. I rained down all kinds of hell & grief on that place.\nI do hope you can get some kind of help, you need good rest & from what you are describing for sleep is not happening.

My understanding is there is certain criteria that must be met before insurance will cover the cost. \nThe big question is this, are you doing this for peace of mind? What IF the test came back that you have a greater potential of developing cancer, can you live with that? I would do some more deep soul searching before making a decision one way or the other. Above all, I would discuss this with my dr before doing anything.\nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

Their dr advised not to have extractions because of the chemo & healing problem. The dr said it was fine to have a temporary crown put on. So, perhaps this is something for you too. Maybe this can worked in with your treatments so there is no delay. So glad you found something to get a little relief with.\nAh the girlfriend is an excellent source for ideas for your son. I bet she will come up with some ideas for you. I am sure he will be surprised with whatever you decide on.\nWow, you are getting some hair back even with your chemo, how crazy is that, lol. I think its awesome. Yep, I am afraid I would be reaching up there & touching it too. My friends hair came back kind of curly after chemo. She had fairly straight hair to begin with, she ended up with body in her hair. \nWe finally had a little rain here it has been a dry winter for us. I am in north central Texas & we are having a lot of spring like temps which I love. My body just does not want to move well in cold temps. I have a pool & over the weekend I had to go buy shock for it as I was getting a little algae in it. I don't remember ever putting shock in this early but we have had a mild winter here. Trees are beginning to bud out & there is a big silver leaf maple in the yard behind mine. It makes a huge mess in my pool in the spring & fall. I work on it every day to keep it clean. Each year as I get older I find this task a little harder to do, lol. Speaking of cleaning the pool, I better get out there & get busy, lol.\nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Wow, I can so relate to the many things of diabetes with your husband. My husband is type II. At the time of his diagnosis his sugar was over 500 & the drs were just amazed that he had not gone into a coma. It took a long time to find an insulin that worked for him. They tried all of the main stream cheaper ones with no success. Finally, he was put on Lantus which helped but his numbers were still too high. He ended up in the hospital for something unrelated & they brought in a dr that is an internist, highly respected in a very large metroplex. The nurse told me they were bringing in who they considered the guru of diabetes & he was a tremendous help. As it turned out my husband's pcp passed away & the internist took over his care.\nMy husband had a gastric sleeve surgery done this past March. He has lost a lot weight & he is now down to just having to use Lantus. Now, he struggles with low sugar & bottoms out a lot. He cannot eat very much at a time so trying to regulate this has been something else. We were out running errands last week & stopped to eat lunch. I had to drive us home because his sugar was still low after eating & said everything looked really dim.\nHe has neuropathy really bad in his feet & hands. He has no feeling in his feet. When he puts on the brakes driving he has no idea how hard he is pushing on the pedal because he can't feel it. He drops everything he picks up. I find his medicine in the floor from one of the pills falling out of his hand & he doesn't realize it. He is on 1800mg of Gabapentin but says he is not sure it helps all that much. He drinks out of a Yeti cup all the time & was constantly dropping i,t full of a drink. Finally, a friend said they were making holders for the cups so we went & bought one. The worst thing for him is the constant diabetic ulcers he gets on his one leg. Sometimes it takes nearly a year to heal with wound care. The last one took 5 months to heal & three weeks later another ulcer to deal with, he can't get a break.\nWe have a very good friend that is struggling with diabetes. Hers drops seriously low at night in her sleep. They have had to take her to ER several times because it was so low. She says she wakes up drenched in sweat & she has bottomed out. She has a snack by her bed at night now.\nYou will make a good witness at your husband's hearing for SSD. You are allowed to testify about\n how it affects his every day living & ability to care for himself. I had no experience with diabetes until he was diagnosed. Like you what little I knew was what I saw on tv which is a farce for the ones that it affects in such a negative way. I am afraid I would have slapped the secretary for her comment, lol. I have little patience these days for ignorance. \nI am borderline & have been for several years. My daughter has managed to stay off of meds by diet. I am not as disciplined as she is, I like some sugar. The only problem I run into is if I am given oral or IV steroids it drives the sugar sky high & then they have to given me insulin. This has always happened in the hospital setting thank goodness.\nThe SSD system is something else to get through all of the hoops people have to jump through. By the time a person gets to a hearing stage they are already so poor & many have lost everything they own. I am not sure how people are to exist without any income for nearly 3 years, blows my mind.\nI hope in spite of everything you & your family had a good Christmas. Keep on fighting, you are doing an amazing job. Yes, I have had a good bit of exposure to breast cancer with family & several friends. In all honesty, all of them were numb with shock & disbelief at the beginning. My sister demanded to see her pathology report to make sure it was hers. \nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums\n ",

It's hideous & being highly supported by teaching hospitals.\nI said some prayers on the 13th & 14th. I definitely had you on my mind on the 14th. Needless to say I was happy to see your post.

We have already had a freeze & it wiped out my plants. The only plant that is never affected is my rosemary plant. That thing can survive anything, lol. It also happens to be my least favorite, so go figure on that one. \nAny plans for Thanksgiving? I know you are not up to cooking much, how about\n your son & husband, can they put something together? We are eating out again this year. We did this last year with the kids & I enjoyed it. My husband on the other hand is having a fit, lol. He thinks I should be standing in the kitchen for 2 days cooking for everyone. I long quit doing that, my ability to stand is about\n 20 minutes at a time. I am perfectly content going back to the place we went to last year. The food was great & I am real picky about\n where I eat out at.\nI can't believe the holidays are coming up so soon. My grandson will be out of school for 2 weeks. I told him the other day that we would pick a day & get the tree down & decorate it. It's a small tree, somewhere between a slim & pencil style.

My mom's skin on her back became kind of tough & leathery feeling after radiation.

I later learned that 2 of my inhalers used to treat COPD & a PPI I was on for years was the downfall to teeth problems. Last year one of my daughter's co-workers started having problems with his teeth. This guy goes to the dentist every 6 months & has perfect dental hygiene & started having problems. This year his dentist was stumped at what was going on, they sat down & went over his meds again, turned out he was on a PPI for GERD & the dentist said there is your problem. This guy is in his early 40's never had a cavity!! I a beginning to think I need to reserve a motel room by the dentist office. In the past 2 weeks I have been out there 7 times!!

I went from sleeping at night to not!! I would stay awake all night & prowl the house like a cat. I had to be very quiet because I didn't want to keep the husband awake. I did not sleep during the day either, never have been a day time sleeper. If I was lucky I would sleep 2-3 hours at in the wee hours, it was just nuts. Once in a great while I might sleep 4 hours. However, my body became so use to it I am guessing. Years before all of this started my pcp gave me a script\n for 7 sleeping pills. He said turn the clock around so you cannot see the time & I did. Last summer a friend of mine said after 15 years of taking sleeping pills her dr cut her off. I cannot imagine taking them that long. The 7 days I took them I had the worst hangover & fog from them. Anyway, her niece suggested she try Tylenol PM without the Tylenol in it & it worked for her. So, I bought some with the idea if it worked for her, there was hope for me, lol. I took it for 10 days & got my clock turned around. Once again, I sleep like a normal person, lol.\nOh goodness, you are absolutely right about\n how eyelashes protect our eyes. I would not have even thought about\n it until you brought it up. Does sunglasses help you any when outside? Still have hair growing on your legs, wow. I would have thought no hair there either. Mine is patchy on my legs but still have to use my electric razor, lol.\nBefore I forget, I discovered another website that offers discounts like GoodRx. It is called BlinkHealth.com. Has the same concept as GoodRx. On both of these sites you type in the name of the medication, dosage & if its pills the amount & it gives you the discount price. I am going to see if Blink gives better discounts. I cannot tell you how much money we save by doing this. Both of them are accepted by the major pharmacies. As I said before, my husband gets his meds through the VA, but once in a while he will get a script\n for something short term.\nI hope you had a good visit with your son last weekend. Of course my 2 kids are adults & I am lucky that we live close to each other. My daughter comes over on the weekend & visits or we go running around. I see my son 2 days a week when he drops my grandson off. I take him to school for him 2 days a week & meet him at the bus stop 5 days a week. I can't imagine not having them close it would be very hard for us if we didn't.\nI have not been on the computer for any length of time lately. I have got to find myself something different for my laptop. I have it on the kitchen table & am finding I am sitting too low & its putting a strain on my neck & shoulders. I was dx'd with osteoporosis of the spine in my early 50's induced by steroids. I was on them for 3 1/2 yrs constantly plus a lot of oral steroids for a long time & little did I know that was not good at all. I just knew it kept my pain level down well enough for me to continue to work for that time. I went from being 5 \"2\" to 4 \"10\"!! I have to blame myself for not having my priorities right & not questioning the the dr & doing my own homework.\nI was talking to my sister last weekend & her 74 yr old neighbor was just dx'd with breast cancer. Her dr recommended a lumpectomy, chemo & radiation. She instead opted for a mastectomy & I understand why. At her age she is not interested with the potential side effects of chemo. She is a widow & lives alone & just does not want to deal with it. I do not blame her, at her age with little help because she lives alone. She does have an older sister who lives nearby & they are quite active together. They hop in her car & take off traveling, lol. Looking at things from her perspective I understand her side of things. Our mom was dx'd with advanced terminal lung cancer at the age of 72. She lived in a small town & medical care was the pits. Good drs didn't ever come there to practice. Most of them were fresh out of medical school with a huge debt to pay for schooling. They would offer a contract if they stayed for so many yrs they would pay off the school loans. Once they met the terms of the contract they were gone. I obtained a copy of her records to bring with us here. While going through her records I found a chest xray from the year before that had suspicious findings & her dr never addressed those findings. It just made me sick. My mom had a very sharp mind but according to her medical records you would have thought differently. Mom was offered chemo & radiation. She declined the chemo & said I have been given 12 months to live with or without chemo. There is no way I will do chemo & be sick with a short amount of time to live. She did some radiation that shrunk the tumor enough so she could sit in a chair or be propped up in bed without a lot of pain. Knowing chemo would not change her outcome I said mom it is your decision, I will support whatever choice you make. Honestly, I am glad she didn't do chemo, her quality of life would have been affected a great deal. She lost a dear friend to lung cancer that went the chemo route. He was in & out of the hospital a lot & very ill from the chemo. Mom made it 11 months, we made the most of our time together those 11 months. I got to know my mom on a totally different level & very thankful she agreed to come here for treatment. \nRadiation does cause some fatigue at first. Mom handled it like a trooper. The first treatment she was scared but after she saw what was involved she did fine. The guys over in the PC forum that have radiation speak of having some fatigue for a bit.\nI hope this finds you doing good. I do enjoy reading your posts & always look forward to them. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums\n ",

First off, I am sending you a big ole hug & as many positive vibes I can muster up this morning. \nNow you have had another surgery, the light is dimly lit at the end of the tunnel for the final surgeries. Try with your might to remember this. You have been moving at a snails pace in the tunnel. Just too many complications caused road blocks.\nI am going to make a suggestion about\n your counselor that has been hit & miss. Please consider seeing a female instead of a male. I know first hand about\n discussing things that we really would rather not. It was easier for me to back burner some things than actually deal with them. At the same time you need to be able to connect with the person. The psychologist that I saw was a lady & I saw her weekly. Each week it got easier for me to go see her. In fact over time I looked forward to my weekly visit simply because I always felt better after my appt. I can assure you, I would not have been able to have done this with a male. So please think about\n this. You need help & it needs to be consistent help, not this hit or miss you are getting with this guy. I am going to be calling her office & see if she takes Medicare. Back when I saw her I had private insurance. This has been on my mind about\n your situation, I do worry about\n you & care. We may have never met, but I consider you a friend & someone I care about\n. \nI hope you will stay with your painting, some distraction is better than none. As for posting only when there is something positive to say. All I can say is it's a good thing we don't have a rule on that here or I would have been banned a long time ago, lol. Venting is good for the soul, so have at it. My mother would always say, there is more room out,than there is in, she was right about\n that.\nI am concerned & thinking about\n you.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

He would holler & carry on until we let him out. He always stayed very close to the house. I had a retired school teacher that lwas a neighbor. She had a Siamese that took off one morning & the cat showed back up several years later!!\nOh, I am so glad you enrolled in the class. Hopefully you will learn some new makeup tiips. It will also get you our of the house for a bit rather than just going for treatment.\nIs this a medical oncologist telling you to take OTC stuff? I do not for a moment believe that is right to tell you take it when you have already been doing that. I am afraid I would call the office & ask to speak to the nurse & let her know OTC stuff is not working & you need some help. She can talk to the dr & you will have to pick the script\n up at the office, it cannot be called in. This is one time you will have to advocate for yourself.\nI don't know what has happened this morning here at the forum but for some reason as I sit here typing your post back in November came up instead of the recent one. Anyway, I was reading again what your son said about\n the hair loss. All I can say is his comments to you were absolutely wonderful.

      "Content": " Linda, I am so, so glad that I misinterpreted your thread. I truly thought you were taking a break here. Now you have a new PS that does sound promising. The thought of more surgery is daunting no less, but seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. \nI think it would be great to start back in racquetball or whatever activity you want to. Kudos to your dr for taking point on this! Perhaps this would help relieve some of your stress. You know, I am going to throw this out here. Can you do a google search for an individual (female) hypnotist for relaxation in your area? It may be something to try. Nancy was the best thing since sliced bread for me, she was wonderful. Believe me, lol, I was extremely skeptical going in. I know people claim that the group thing works, well, not for me, just my personal thoughts. The idea of sitting in a room with a group of people, no way. Nancy had a room in her home that was used strictly for this. I can still see the room to this day. It was the most soothing & relaxing place.\nOur temperature has dropped, but we have gone from no rain to monsoon like rain. My son heard on the weather this past week that from Feb/Aug we had a little over 2 inches of rain. Not getting the usual spring rain caused a drought. However, the month of September we had almost 13 inches!! The days on not having sunshine was no fun. We have more rain predicted for the weekend. I am so tired of it & tired of being stuck inside. I need sunshine to recharge my batteries, lol. \nI need to get busy around here. So much to do, I have been pretty slack all week, now it's time to pay the fiddler, lol.

I keep that an off topic, lol. \nI want to mention something to you that I keep forgetting. Most people with private insurance have high copays on their meds. On your meds always go to the mfg website & look for coupons that offer discounts. These can be used with your insurance. Another source is a place called GoodRx.com. Check it out as well. I use GoodRx a lot. An example, my husband was seen in ER & the dr rx'd a script\n for antibiotics, 14 pills $92. By going to GoodRx & printed out a coupon we paid $22 & some change!! Since we do not have private insurance any longer we always use GoodRx. My husband is fortunate that he can use the VA for his every day meds. His insulins are just so expensive. \nI need to run for now, I have to meet my grandson at his bus stop. Have a terrific weekend!!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

Fortunately, she straightened up but it was one of the most difficult times in my life. My biggest fear was her getting killed or OD. She held a full time job during all of this, unbelievable as it sounds. Now, many of those kids are either dead, prison, not many got clean & are still doing it. Yes, I know every feeling you described. She now says how did you survive me.\nShe got married to a guy & they were divorced after 15 years. He had a little girl 2 1/2 yrs old when they met. I later learned things were really bad between them, she stayed because of this little girl. The mom has bad mental issues & they took her to court & got custody. It took nearly 2 years. My daughter was not able to get pg. Over this 15 year span the bond between her & this girl is like mother/daughter. This just happened on its own. Now this girl is 23 years old. No drug problem, thank God but she got to experience what it is like raising a kid, lol. She says mom she will never grown up, lol. They have remained very close even with the divorce. We just love her thats all we can do. She comes around all of us like before. Her dad remarried & new wife hates us all, but dad is happy the relationship remained with my daughter. He has no clue what to do with a girl & never did.\nThe weather has been cooler here & my body is not very happy. I got a flu shot Friday & by evening I had an extremely sore arm. That night my husband kept bumping it & waking me up. I did not feel too good yesterday & slept for quite a bit. I took an Advil & went to bed. Today seems ok. \nI am so glad that you are doing better. I am so happy that you are documenting your journey here. I have not checked to see how many views you have this far. The last time I looked it was over 11,000 people reading your story. I know somewhere you helped many people a long the way. I do hope you will take advantage of everything you can that is offered free. That is fabulous your insurance will pay for a wig yearly. The good ones are super expensive but worth the money. I am sure that yours lasted much longer because like you said you did not wear it every day. That makes a big difference.\nI know you don't like being shut in but you simply cannot afford to get sick. Unfortunately, people will go out sick & never consider they are spreading germs. Warm climate breeds germs is what my mother use to say, lol. This is why I do my shopping online to avoid sick people. I ran by Walmart to get coffee & filters the other day, people & kids coughing & hacking. All I could think was oh hell, get me out of here. I drink the EmergencyC stuff daily. My grandson & his mom do so too. \nI have to get busy today & get some things done. For the past 6 months I have been battling having dentures made. They have made 2 pair to date. I have a small mouth & the trays they use to make impressions are too big for my mouth. They small is too big. I picked up new ones Thursday. I am so upset, they are loose. I know dentures do not replace normal teeth. I need to be able to chew, I am tired of swallowing food whole & choking. I have lost so much weight, I can't afford to lose any more. I keep spending money on jeans because of the weight loss, its crazy. Even my drs keep commenting on the weight loss. This has done such a mental thing to me, now force myself to eat something. My husband is not happy because my appetite is not good. I was so upset Thursday when the new set was so loose. Adhesive will not hold them in place but 2 hours then they are flopping again. I had to leave the other day, I felt that terror coming up the back of my throat. It was that scream that was trying to form. Paid way too much money for these dentures to fit like this. \nPlease stay well, you have already hit too many speed bumps!!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

Did the dr say if he would call you over the phone with the results or come in for an appt? Since its been this long I would at least call the office & ask them what is going on. It could be this just fell through the cracks.\nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

You need it for sure.\nOh, I do know people really get tired quick of hearing about\n any type of illness, lol. I keep that an off topic, lol. \nI want to mention something to you that I keep forgetting. Most people with private insurance have high copays on their meds. On your meds always go to the mfg website & look for coupons that offer discounts. These can be used with your insurance. Another source is a place called GoodRx.com. Check it out as well. I use GoodRx a lot. An example, my husband was seen in ER & the dr rx'd a script\n for antibiotics, 14 pills $92. By going to GoodRx & printed out a coupon we paid $22 & some change!! Since we do not have private insurance any longer we always use GoodRx. My husband is fortunate that he can use the VA for his every day meds. His insulins are just so expensive. \nI need to run for now, I have to meet my grandson at his bus stop. Have a terrific weekend!!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

My husband is doing better since he was put on Meloxicam, an anti-inflammatory rx'd for arthritis. He needs to be up moving around a lot more than he is, but we know how tht often goes with husbands.\nMy son remarried on the 26th of January. The wedding took place in Fredericksburg, its south of here. It was great, they rented a B&B for the weekend with some other couples. The place has a screened in room which was where the ceremony took place. His old neighbor & friend married them, it was awesome. Nothing fancy, laid back & very fitting for them. I love going to that part of Texas. So many vineyards & wineries, something most do not associate with Texas. It is very much a tourist area. We had heaters to help stay warm, lol. \nI am not on FaceBook much, but I will send you a friend request. I go there when one of my kids tell me to go look at pictures of something, lol. I am so happy to see you returning to things that you once had pleasure with. \nHow are you coming along with the healing from the last surgery? I am off to the pharmacy to get a script\n filled.

      "Content": " Linda, so good to read that you are moving forward, surgery on the 14th if I remember correctly. I will continue to pray this all goes as plan. Most of all, keep your positive thought process in the forefront. Don't get sucked down the dark hole, you will persevere as you have done all along. You have an incredible amount of strength without any doubt. We often have no idea how strong we are until we are out to the test.Try to remember this, fear can cause reality to become cloudy. \nI am happy that you are back to exercising. I know this is something you did before, I am in agreement with the dr that said start doing as many things you did before. Making the effort is what counts most of all. \nOh yes, the good old flu season is back again! Keeping yourself safe is a must. I always get the flu shot every year. I know there is so much controversy over it not helping the strains that often show up. Regardless, I have COPD, the flu could be extremely serious for me according to my drs. Knowing this, I will not risk it. I am having terrible sinus issues, this rain has our mold count off the charts & mountain cedar is really high. I have been dealing with a slight sinus infection for 2 months. Until I have it in check, I will hold off on the flu shot. \nOh gal, the rain the past 2 months has been insane. September & October we set new records, I heard on the news last week, we had over 40 inches of rain in 2 months. Currently, we are on day 3 or 4 of sunny skies. Our temps are lower, so things are not drying out fast. My yard is still extremely wet, most of my flowers are done from too much water. I have mold on the zinnias in a flower bed. I hope next week it is dry so my lawn guy can clean up a couple of flower beds & go over the yard. I have some things for him to cut back & to make it look a little tidy, lol. This morning it's sunny, a little cool & very windy! Hopefully the wind will help dry things out a little. We have a chance of rain tonight sadly.\nMy laptop took a nose dive which I knew was coming. It slowed to a crawl & trying to get into HW was a huge problem. I took it in last week & they replaced my hard drive. I do not use my phone for HW, even though, it is now phone friendly. I can read on it because the print is larger, but I am not comfortable trying to post with it. I have an IPad & it's ok in a pinch. I am just a creature of habit, lol. I like having a bigger screen.\nI plan to run a couple of quick errands this afternoon while there is sunshine! I am thinking about\n making chicken & dumplings today, so I will need to get some chicken tenders. A friend gave me a recipe for chicken & dumplings & it calls for chicken tenders. Much easier to cook them rather than breasts or a whole chicken. \nSending many positive vibes to you!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

The pain you described with your back sounds painful. I can see with your descript\nion of the tightness, it makes a lot of sense. Is this pain getting better?\nMy plans to get my tree up flopped, my grandson & I just never had the time needed to get my tree up.My husband is dealing with bursitis of the hip. He has had an injection done as an out-patient at the hospital. It lasted 2 days & came right back. He see's the ortho this afternoon to see what is next. His xrays showed a good deal of arthritis plus a spur. A hip replacement was briefly discussed, but because of underlying health issues, he is not a very good candidate for a replacement. Not sure what is next. It's very doubtful I will get a tree up since the husband is not feeling all that great. \nWhat are your plans for Christmas, is your other son coming home? We will go to our son's on Christmas Day for a late lunch & let the kids \nopen presents. With kids involved, it's much easier to go to them & spend the day. I gave up hosting the holidays years ago, it became too much for me. The kids wanted to take over this & I was more than willing to hand over the reins. \nOur crazy Tx weather is continuing. We are expecting a potential for a wet snow late Thursday! Rain turning to snow is a real possibility. Our temps has been in the 60's during the day, so at least we will not have to deal with slick roads.

But with that said, she also did not have GB going on either. The men in the PC forum say they get a little fatigued with radiation but not something long lasting. Chemo was harder than radiation for them. Do you see your dr any time soon that has been treating the GB? What about\n asking someone where you are taking radiation at, I think you should ask them about\n all of this. \nGlad to read that your your wig situation is taken care of. One more thing out of the way. You really are stronger than what you give credit for. You have had many hurdles & the GB has been a real kick in the teeth.

Keep checking the bank acct too. Finally, you can take a decent sigh of relief. I do know in some instances that people collect more per month on SSD than regular social security retirement, which can be a plus too. Not sure when his Medicare will kick in. It kicks in 2 yrs from the date of disability that SSA gives. Sometimes SSD gives their own date of disability, so look for the date they say became disabled. He will get back pay from the date of disability. They will withhold x amount for atty fees from the check. But, the atty will have to file a fee petition to prove up his time spent on the file too. SSD allows only so much time for each thing the atty does on the file, such as making phone calls, visits with the client, reviewing the file & ect.. This is what we had to do when I worked, I do not know if it has changed, I really kind of doubt it.\nWhew, I am excited that you are going to get to move forward with the treatment & now this SSD award.

However, those in the path of it, its beyond devastating. \nYou know what you are doing I think is beneficial for you. When you start getting disgusted because your body isn't cooperating, remind yourself what your body has gone through the past 4 months. Keep at it & pat yourself on the back for staying with it you will make progress. I will share this with you. When I got sick & had to quit working I was devastated. My health was in the crapper & I fell into a dark place. My dr insisted I get with a psychologist & he put me on an antidepressant. The psychologist was fantastic. She asked what I did all day, I said nothing I shower & put clean pajamas on every day. I didn't wear street clothes except to go to the drs... I cried all the time had huge pity parties. My full time job became seeing 5 specialists. She said you need to get back into your normal daily routine as close to it that you can. So instead of pj's I got dressed. It took time but I managed to put together a routine. We both know when you work all of your life you have a routine. We are routine people. So, knowing this much about\n you, keep up your morning routine & anything from precancer days.\nI am still at the lake place.i came down Friday & the kids all came down for the long weekend.

A friend of mine handled one for a lady & won. I am sorry I cannot remember the specifics of her case, its just been too long. I am so happy that you are checking into this.\nI am guessing that you see a neurologist for the GB. I would call the neuro's office & ask if the PS has contacted the dr about\n doing the final surgery. Someone in that office can look in your chart & tell you. All they have to do is look in the computer. Next, I would send a letter to the PS that you have been calling her office, no date still & that you are beginning to feel that you have been abandoned & are extremely concerned with little communication from her office. I would also point out the time frame since she said she needed to check with the drs. But, most of all, explain that you need this surgery done before the end of the year because of you have a high deductible yearly. I would ask the PS to call you. Does this PS have a nurse in her office? Perhaps this will get her attention, as phone calls are not yielding you any answers. NO, I do not believe this is an insurance issue, they would have told you immediately if that was an issue. PS, are good about\n notifying a patient when there is an insurance issue. \nI agree bringing in another PS is not a good idea at this point. I encourage you to call the neuro & send the PS a letter.

I understand that she is going to be contacting other drs, however, one thing I do know, if a dr is in his office he doesn't put off a call from a peer. Wow, from your descript\nion of the scarring, it does sound like she is excellent.\nAs for Cobra insurance, yes it is very expensive. Once you are finished with all of your care perhaps then you can look at other options. Just allow yourself time to carefully check out all your options. Will your husband have a long wait before he is entitled to Medicare? I know its 24 months from the date of the disability. Insurance is such a sore spot with me. When I look at what we pay yearly for all of the insurance we have to have, it is our largest expense!! We pay insurance for a home in town & a small lake place. I told my husband the other day, hell we are going to the poor house because of insurance. It is disgusting. \nTexas heat has been doing a number on me.

      "Content": " I do believe you are right about\n Cobra, its a month to month thing. When you are ready to switch from COBRA to something in the market place, do not let the COBRA coverage lapse before getting the other. You may be required to show proof that you had what they call \"credible coverage\" to qualify. They may no longer require this, I am not sure. I was able to go online to my insurance & print this letter off. I had to do this with my supplemental policy to Medicare. \nFor several years even though Medicare was my primary insurance, we kept me covered under husband's employer insurance after he retired. Mainly, because of the script\n card & at the time I was on lots & lots of expensive medication. All of that was good until my monthly premium went from $620 a month to $1,220 a month. Yep, you read that right. They doubled the monthly cost, they wanted me off their books.\nWhen I got coverage for my supplemental to Medicare, I do pay more because I am not 65 yet. I bought a policy through AARP, they pick up the other 20% Medicare does not pay. We pay $16 a year to be an AARP member. With both of us having health issues, I wanted something that paid the best. My husband is over 65 so he has no deductibles at all. His supplemental picks those up, a perk for being 65 on the plan he is on. I have read here at HW that some members used a broker. I will tell you the supplemental plans to Medicare vary in cost depending on the state & coverage selected.\nNot sure if I asked before, is your husband a veteran? If he is & if his insulin or any medications he is on is sky high a month, he should check with them to see what his meds would cost a month. In my husband's case he was on 2 insulin's & they cost $1,500 a month. It did not take long for him to hit the donut hole & we simply could not afford it. He went out to the local VA here & they did a physical & he took all of his medicine bottles with him. He gets all of his meds from the VA. If he gets a new script\n for something long term he takes it the dr there. Anyway, sorry for being long winded, but this may be an option for hubby with meds.\nI hope your next post will be including a surgery date!!!\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Good morning E. I have been wondering about\n you, lol. I have been absent a lot from here. We went on vacation for a few days last week with 3 other couples. We rented a 4 bedroom houseboat & had such a great time. We are very partial to Lake Ouachita in Arkansas. Have spent several vacations there over the years. My son & his gf hosted a backyard concert at my house last night. Had quite a turnout close to 50 people here. I have been busy getting ready for this. This morning I am so tired. My son is coming over later to put plants & everything back in its place. My husband just asked me if I would go to the lake house with him & come back tomorrow. I had to decline, I need a day of just rest. If I go there I will work & not get any rest. \nI am very glad to read that you are staying with your pre-cancer warm up routine. It's amazing how our normal routine goes out the window when a crisis hits. I have a daily routine here & if I don't stay with it things go downhill. I had a daily routine all of my adult life. Adjusting to my grandson going back to school was not easy for me. I still meet him at his bus certain days but it's not the same.\nI have to disagree with you about\n feeling vain & shallow over the hair loss. The reason I say that is for many people, male & female that is kind of like a signature for them. People are either born with beautiful hair or they aren't,lol. Hair is something I notice on people especially the ones with beautiful hair. One of our close friends has beautiful silver white hair & a matching goatee. He orders his shampoo & conditioner from a place & has for years. He says the product he uses keeps the yellow out. His hair & goatee are just striking when you see him. Many of the men in the PC forum have struggled with hair loss from chemo too. Forgive me, I hope you understand what I am trying to say, I am really tired this morning. I agree with you on not wearing the wig a lot & allowing your scalp & hair to breathe. Do you remember back in the early 70's wiglets when were the rage? You may be too young. Women with shorter hair wore them to have their hair up in what was called basket weave curls. I was one of them, lol. It was an up do style. Well, let me tell you, from having the sides of my hair pulled back I had the beginning of a receding hair line, it was pretty thin along with the rest of my hair. On top my hair was not getting to breathe like normal from the wiglet! \nOh I think having a pity party is a must at times. I brought this up with my psychologist & she said it was fine as long as I did not linger there for any length of time. I still have them from time to time. Good for the soul. \nWhile I am not much of a tv fan, I overdosed down at the lake one night. I found a show that had 5 seasons & I went through several seasons one night, until 2:00am! My husband was shocked. He laughed & said that must have been some show to have kept your attention that long. That was a marathon for me. \nE, I have debated about\n bringing this up, however, I will just put it out here. I have thought long & hard about\n it. I think you should consider seeing an atty about\n a Wrongful Termination case. You can get a free consult with one. You followed all of the procedures of the company. Please consider this. \nMy son just got here so I need to get busy. Catch up with you soon. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I cooked for 2 days, had to take food to my daughters because I did not have room in my refrigerator & it was a true hassle cooking for 12 people. I spent 3 days in bed & was not worth it. If I was younger & in better health sure I would have cooked. But those days are over. \nHang in there before long you will have all of this in your rear view mirror. I am glad though that your dr is taking precautions.\nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " E, I really do empathize with you over this PS not returning calls, that is not a good sign to me. While she may have the best set of credentials to her credit, there is no excuse for her not returning any of your calls. I mean no excuse. If this is how she handles all of her patients & something tells me yes, perhaps it is time to switch. I think you have an excellent idea of calling the dr that referred you to her. I am quite sure he knows of more than one great PS. Rather than trying to speak with the dr directly, what about\n asking to talk to his nurse? Or what about\n scheduling a short appt with him to discuss this? Your phone calls have not been about\n piddly little concerns, this is major stuff. I am sure she is busy, but being too busy to address something like this, I say move forward with someone new.\nOk, once again, brain fart when it comes to the legal stuff. I know EEOC checks for what is called discrimination with an employer, such as age, race & religion & ect. I don't think your situation falls in that category under Wrongful Termination. I suggest getting online & look for an atty that does labor law, make a phone call or two to get an idea which direction you may possibly go in. It would take a just a few minutes to do this. I had to stop working in 04, it certainly shows what I have forgotten too. \nMy sister in Tampa had only debris & some branches that fell on her roof. She was very fortunate. She was quite scared so we pretty much texted throughout the night. Between my son & I we kept her occupied as much as we could. She is 75 & lives alone so it was tough for her. We kept reminding her to keep her phone charged, her power was going on on & off. Very thankful she is ok. \nKeep me posted on this PS thing. I would be willing to bet the surgeon can help you get another excellent PS. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums\n ",

Also, you will have to continue to provide the LTD people with notes stating you are disabled too. You don't want to ever forget to provide them with updates either. Once those bums stop benefits because of not having that \"disabled status\" getting it resumed again is nearly impossible. They have incredible stall tactics.\nMy neighbor was an RN, she became disabled & was put on LTD. Her policy required that if she was off more than 6 months she had to file for SSD. They offered any assistance she needed to apply. She was awarded benefits & received them until she turned 65, along with her SSD check. When she turned 65 LTD stopped, her SSD check was increased to make up the difference.\nUnum, which is one of the largest providers for LTD, was sued quite a few years ago. They were denying benefits with proper medical documentation from members, kept telling the people we didn't get it or we need more information, a new rep was now handling the claim it was unbelievable what they did to people for years. It came out that the reps were told by their superiors you deny & stall, they got nailed dead to rights when that came out.\nIf memory serves me right, lol, I binged on a show called Iron Fist or Iron Hand. It was totally not something I would ever watch as a weekly series. But, it sure got my interest, lol. I also use to watch a show called Person of Interest, it was a weird one too, lol. By the time I started watching it, it was into several seasons. I found it on Netflix one weekend at the lake & started at the very beginning & understood the show a little better. So, now you know my two out of the ordinary shows I binged on lol.\nTake care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums\n ",

      "Content": " E, I have never done chemo, but sometimes the brain fog is out there, lol. An example, & please correct me. Not long ago, it seems like you signed a post & stated your name is Linda? Did I dream this or what? Regardless, I tried going back & looking & found nothing, ha, ha.\nYou are so close to winding down this chapter of your life. Its been such a long journey. However, you have prevailed & found an inner strength in yourself that you did not know existed. My mom had radiation & the skin on her back looked sunburn & leathery. Thats the best way I can describe it. Like you, I am not sure if the skin will change back. I wonder if some of your scar cream would help, just a thought.\nI am impressed that your husband has lost weight. That is great. I am sure your son is also pleased with this too. I am leaning towards your son went through something that made him question his life in general. Going off the grid as he did he proved so many things to himself. I would like to think one of the most important lesson he learned is being self reliant. You have to admit his life style, just everything changed like flipping a light switch. It sounds like he came out a much stronger person. You would be amazed at the ones out there in this generation that do not have a clue about\n life & cannot handle becoming adults. I have seen this first hand, up front close & personal. They just can't handle life. My daughter tells them, going to school & working is called life. Learn how to support yourself & be independent. She tells her ex husband's daughter, if you are not going to attend school you need to work a full time job & quit living off of relatives (we call her the trust fund kid). Too much money has been wasted on her going to college, she gets dropped for not attending classes. My daughter says its a generation of lost kids. My daughter's BF, has 2 grown kids that are the very same way. The money that has been spent & wasted because they can't handle it, are you kidding me. So many opportunities thrown away. I will get off my soap box, lol.\nThe food thing with my dad & that hospital was minor compared to the atrocities that happened during his stay. Fell out of a wheelchair & laid his head \nopen, needed stitches, should have never been left unattended, was tethered to a bed, managed somehow to get loose & fell out of bed not once but twice. Transferred him to a rehab unit on a Friday. Rehab called me & said he does not meet our requirements for rehab, we are not equipped to handle a patient like him you must get him transferred back into the regular part of the hospital. Ever attempt something like that at 5:00 Gave him an anti-psychotic drug that made him psychotic & nuts. He was hallucinating like someone that was not with the program at all. They had the frigging nerve to ask if he was alcoholic because he was acting so crazy. The man had not had alcohol in over 20 yrs. The heavy sedation & over medicating left to the nurse's discretion was the final straw. I managed to get him in a rehab hospital. After their review I met with the head dr & the first words out of his mouth was \"your father has been heavily over medicated\" & we are in the process of removing those medications. In less than a week his mind returned just as sharp as it was before surgery. One thing I noticed on his floor, lots of older patients & no matter what time of day or night these people were knocked out. They slept through their meals & many were too weak to eat. Those darn nurses knocked them out so they didn't have to deal with them. Like your situation so much more involved. Now this was at one of large leading hospitals!! This should never happen to anyone. You have no idea the hell I raised with that place & his drs. Never let something like this slide. \nWe had to replace the AC at the lake cabin. Should have done it first instead wasting all those service calls, lol. Had 2 different people come out & give 2 different stories on what the problem was, both were wrong. I do hope yours is fixed now. Our weather is nuts right now. Tuesday was warm, by late night cold, sleeting, a couple of tornadoes all in 24 hours. We have had rain & flash floods for several days & its icing over at night. A lot of people west of us lost power because of the tree limbs breaking under the weight of the ice. We only had some ice on bridges & overpasses. Crazy Tx weather, changes in a minute!! We are on our 5th day of rain, suppose to get a short break on Sunday. My yard is like a swamp, its awful. I am ready for warm weather.\nTime for me to get busy around here, lol.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Linda, unfortunately, what happened to you is truly a common practice in the medical community. This is something that has gone on for decades. We can be a patient in the one of best hospitals in the state, but get on one of those floors such as the one you were on the ballgame changes completely. The nursing staff is just pathetic. Many of them have not an ounce of empathy or respect for their patient. They act like we are intruding on their time, when it's their freaking job they are being paid to do.\nI have been in many different hospitals unfortunately in my city. Out of 8 different ones, I received excellent care with one!! I was inpatient in 2016. The 4th day the dr in front of the nurse said I want PT or the nurses to get her up walking in the hall several times a day. I was considered a fall risk so had to have someone with me. I was gotten up one time only by the nurse. When I asked when I would be walked again, he said we are short handed it is not going to happen. I told the dr the next day, you release me today, I was informed they are short handed & walking me is not going to happen. I got released. So, it does not matter what the drs order.\nIn 2013, the dr in charge of my care which was a hospitalist we have to deal with now these days. She was absolutely the worst dr I have ever seen in my life. Keep in mind when I was admitted through ER, it was discovered I had thrown a blood clot that hit my left lung, I have COPD & am on oxygen, I had a mild heart attack & was unresponsive. My family was told if I did not wake up soon I would not make it & to call any out of town family. There was also something about\n a chemical problem with my brain. When she found out about\n my implanted pain pump she went completely off of her rocker. She called my PM dr who hung up on her. My dr said she was crazy. She put in my medical records that I had accidentally overdosed!! You need oral medication to do that, a patient cannot do anything with an implanted pain pump!! My heart dr & pulmonary dr listened to this nut. After I woke up several days later, she informed me the pain pump needed to be taken out that I did not need it, lol. I let her have her rant, I calmly looked her in the eye & said you are fired, do not ever stick a foot in my doorway again. She went out & told the nurses. They had to scramble & find another dr to take over. All of this is in my medical records. My first visit to the cardiologist & lung dr, they were absolutely shocked to see me when they walked into the room. They admitted that they thought based on what she wrote in my records that I was someone that abused pain medications, basically sat around doing nothing all day but taking pain meds knocking myself out. They both asked me how did you get here today, I said I drove my car here, just like I always do. We sat & talked about\n what my normal day is like. I got an apology from both of these drs & their attitudes towards me changed greatly. To this day, I get angry over this. Crap like this & what you experienced should never happen to a patient.\nI had a neighbor that was an RN at one of the big hospitals. She was over the orthopedic floor, in the administrative duty. Every day she received a call from the administrator asking her what patients could be released to go home. Her job was to review the charts & then convince the dr the patient was ready to be released. The fewer days each patient was in, the bigger his yearly bonus was for keeping hospital charges down. He would then call her later in the day to see how many patients got released. This is something the average patient has no idea about\n. The hospitals tells patients its your insurance. \nI just truly wait until I am on my last leg before I will agree to go to a hospital. Every time I have gone it turns into a fiasco that should not be happening. But, I no longer sit & keep my mouth shut, I speak up for myself. I have done with both of my parents. Its pathetic.\nI need to get busy around here for now. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

I am way past due for my cut too. I look like a shaggy dog, its awful. I usually go every 5 weeks but had conflict with time. The lady that does my hair just turned 69 & she works 3 days a week & stays very busy those 3 days. She is such a gem, she has a couple of clients that she goes to their home & goes their hair. They are unable to come to the shop. She takes great pleasure in doing something to make them feel better.\nEven though we have never met I feel I know you to an extent. I can tell in your posts when you are really struggling. Yes, you are right we always believe surgery is suppose to be a good thing for us. I don't know if you have considered this or not. However, perhaps with the pending surgery maybe see your dr & ask for something for the anxiety until after surgery at least. That way when it starts rearing its ugly head you can have something mild on hand to knock it back.\nYou know my mom had one an aortic aneurysm. All they did was monitor hers to make sure it was not getting bigger. My understanding is they prefer to monitor the situation. One of my husband's 77 yr old buddy's has had one for years & they do the same with him. \nWe went to the lake over Memorial Weekend. My brood all showed up lol. We had a good time. It was just hot so I didn't make it out in the boat with all of them. My heat intolerance just seems to be something else to deal with. My grandson just loves it down there because it's something different to do. I imagine he will spend a good bit of time there over the summer.

      "Content": " FearBug, what a mess!! Let me run something by you about\n \"stiff person syndrome\". I read about\n it quickly this morning at the Mayo Clinic's website. I always look things up there because the info is reliable. There is so much garbage on the net. This condition has NOTHING to do with abuse!! I have no idea who told your mother this or perhaps your mother assumed it. They think it is an autoimmune disease of some type & it affects the central nervous system. It is still not clear what causes it as there are many unknowns about\n it. What I can tell you is there is treatment available for it!! There seems to be a lot of misinformation going on with your sister & even your mother. I checked some other sites & they all same pretty much the same thing.\nThis tumor bleed is something I am not familiar with or even heard of. I am clueless on that one. What I will tell you is this, there are many kinds of breast cancer. Just as there is different treatments available for the type. You have been given no reliable information about\n your mom's cancer. Your mother is being too vague with everything. Stage 4 cancer means the cancer has spread to other tissue & organs. From what you are describing about\n your mom, I going to guess the answer is no. This is a guess, in fact she wasn't sure if it was stage 3. Let me point this out to you. Since your mom is your sister's caregiver, I would think your mom would do whatever it takes to get herself healthy in order to care for your sister. I don't think you have considered this at all. You have been too upset over this entire situation to consider everything. I feel like your mom will do whatever it takes to keep herself healthy so she can continue to care for your sister. It is a sick game they are playing with you because they know you are upset & can do nothing to get information. Your mother is playing right along with your sister in my opinion. I don't mean to be rude FearBug, but I honestly believe you are being played on every level by both of them. I am not saying your mother does not have cancer, but it may not be as bad as your mind is telling you is my point. My thinking is if your mother's cancer was that advanced & she was doing nothing, her drs could possibly dismiss her from their care because she is not being compliant & it would be too much of a risk & liability to keep her as a patient. It's a sick game. I am short on time this morning but later today I am going to post a website for you to read about\n breast cancer. It is devoted to breast cancer & I think you will gain useful information there. \nMy email is listed here, you can click the envelope & it will show my email address. If you prefer to email me that is fine. Just put in the heading its FearBug from Healing Well, otherwise I would delete it. I am more concerned about\n you than anyone to be honest. \nMore later...\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Good morning E. First off, please, please do not let even a smidgen of guilt creep in over the hair loss. This very thing affects many, many people that have gone through this. I think I mentioned previously about\n members in the PC forum that always sported beards & mustaches & once they started chemo they lost all of their body hair. Yes, it disturbs them too, its not a vanity thing as far as I see it. I have seen people that lost their hair after developing sepsis. Has any of your drs tried you on the prescript\nion medication to help with this? For the life of me, the name of the product escapes my brain this morning.\nI am very happy that you are staying on top of President of that hospital. I know the hell I went through with my dad when he had heart surgery. He was inpatient much longer than usual for the surgery. An example, after surgery when he was allowed to eat some food, the people that delvers the food trays wrote on the paper on the wall that he ate 100% of his meal, several times. He was not touching the food, none. He had few teeth & couldn't chew anything, meaning he needed soft food. He was not capable of picking his own food & I was not allowed either. Third time that happened I lit into his cardiologist about\n this happening. He was shocked & went up to that nurses desk, I heard him all the way back to my dad's room. He ordered nutritional shakes 3 times a day. But believe me, that incident was nothing compared to the negligence of that hospital. I mean absolutely nothing. \nYes, this is your story of your journey & I am so happy that you chose Healing Well to write it too. I just checked, you have had over 25,000 views of your journey & I honestly believe you have helped another person or persons by writing it.\nHas your son gone back off the grid? How is your husband doing with the diet situation? I know your son has the very best interests at heart wanting to help his dad. You know, I would have the very same feelings you have about\n your son choosing to live a completely different style. More & more people seem to be doing this. I have often wondered what triggered them to change their way of life. I know its no consolation but at least you got to see him over the holiday. He is much stronger than you realized, as mom's we see our kids differently than anyone else in the world. Never give up the hope of him returning to main stream living, he may get fed up one day with living off the grid.\nIt has been a very long hard road to get where you are today. If you are done with fill ups, how often will you need to see the drs? You are hanging in there like a trooper. \nI am doing so-so. These cold front are just sending my pain levels into a tailspin. In January I caught the bad stomach virus, was in bed 5 days. Ended up in ER the first day. I woke up at 5:00am throwing up, the dry heaves would not stop. At 2:30 off to ER for IV meds. I ran a fever for 3 days. As soon as the Tylenol wore off it kept coming back. I have not been feeling well the past few months & just could not put a finger on what was going on. Yesterday at my PM dr appt they took my BP, 172/102!! A little later they took it again & it was 152/102. That is way too high. In Jan. it was up but nothing like that. Back in the summer I dropped one of my BP meds, it was dropping me too low. Dr was ok dropping that one, I was on 3 at the time. Anyway, I have an appt with my cardiologist in March. ER said to follow up with my PCP, no way am I going there, their office is full of people with the flu. There was some changes on the EKG done in ER & my PCP would say go see your cardiologist anyway.\nPlease keep me posted on things. Take care.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

The one appt I do hope you will make is with the counselor you have been avoiding for a few weeks. I think it is a critical appt with your pending surgery. When I got this overwhelmed before I made two lists. One top priority & the other not. I ticked things off as I went along. It may sound a bit silly, but it helps. \nBack in the 80's I had a hysterectomy. The surgery went fine, but apparently I got very sick right afterwards & do not remember it. I called my sister & told her something was wrong & I was really sick. She came to the hospital immediately. I do not remember calling her. I woke up lucid on the 3rd day not feeling well. There was a general surgeon that was brought in talking to me & they were considering taking me back to surgery to figure out what was wrong. They ended up putting in an NG tube & just monitored things. They finally dx'd it as ileitis. All I know is I was sick. My 5 day stay turned into a 10 day stay. The next time I needed surgery, I was scared. I had been to this hypnotist a few times before, she did a lot of this for stress. Don't you know 2 days before surgery I went & saw her. Sounds crazy I know. I did not know I could ever be as relaxed as what Nancy could make me feel. Several of the big insurance places here use to hire her to come in & do stress relief for their employees. It was fantastic. I wish I had a Nancy I could send your way. \nBeing able to help out with my grandson has been wonderful for me. He has only been kept by family all of his life. It has always been a grandparent or his aunt. Both parents can go to work every day & not worry about\n whether he is being cared for or not. We have a good time together & he is so much company for us. He is very outgoing. My neighbors around here always talk about\n how friendly he is & he talks to them. He will see my one neighbor outside & run over to say hi & to just talk. She said its so refreshing to see a kid his age actually talk to people. He is not perfect by any means, lol. All in all he is a good kid. \nJust remember, take things a day at a time. Sometimes, we have to do it by the moment too. Yes, I have no doubt you & I would make great friends if we lived close!! Although I only know you as an online person, I feel I know you.\nKeep me posted.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",

      "Content": " Hi FearBug, so sorry to read about\n your mom. I am sure you are terrified, hearing the word cancer knocks the wind out of anyone. It sounds like your mom is having a lumpectomy & will be taking an oral chemo medication. Keep in mind women beat breast cancer because of modern medicine. I am not going to address what stage she has simply because you don't know either. It sounds like your mom doesn't really know. Without a biopsy report in hand no one knows. \nAs far as your sister is concerned that is completely out of your control. In all honesty, the less said to your mother about\n your sister the better. Your mom has enough to deal with right now, if you give her any grief over your sister, it is not going to help your mom at all. All you can do is ask your mom what you can do to help her, not your sister, just your mom. It sounds like your mother made her mind up years ago that she would take care of your sister. That is a responsibility she took on herself for whatever reason. I don't understand what you said is wrong with your sister. Your mom will be somewhat limited after surgery for awhile but it may help take the cancer thing off of her mind at the same time. Do you understand what I am trying to say? You just need to tread lightly & not upset your mom. I do get what you are saying about\n your sister though. \nIf you cannot afford to take on your sister & kids which is a major ordeal, don't stress over it. It is not fair in my opinion to add that responsibility to you or your boyfriend. Who knows now that this has happened with your mom, a lot of things may change with your sister. I suggest keeping yourself healthy as possible so you can help your mom in whatever way you can.\nTake care & keep us posted.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums\n ",

When my first mammo came back, I had to have an ultrasound done, along with another mammo with magnification views. I was scared to death. As it turned out the spots were calcifications. I had mammos every 6 months for 2 years. Is there a history of breast cancer in your family? More often that not, when they see something like this, the ultrasound comes back not cancer. We have had other members come through here like you, something showing differently, it was benign. In the meantime, try to calm yourself down. Your littles ones will pick up on their mom being upset & it will affect them.\nKeep us posted.\nSusie\nModerator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums ",
