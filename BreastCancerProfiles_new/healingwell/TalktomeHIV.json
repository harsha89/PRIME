    "Content": " If its appearance has changed over time, and it's grown, it definitely can't hurt to get it checked out. I would caution you about\n trying to figure odds on whether or not it's cancerous though, since there's not much anyone who is not a doctor that's done a physical exam can give you in the way of accurate feedback, and speculation is apt to only bring you more anxiety, and I'd hate to think it might scare you away from testing.\nIf you have difficulties connecting to health care, try contacting a local community health center for information. They generally can help you hook up to medical services at a reduced cost, or offered on a sliding scale. Local cancer advocacy organizations may be able to help too. Find them in your phone book, 411, or by doing a search on one of the web phone book sites.\nHope everything turns out ok for you! ",
