      "Content": " Gail, Joyce and Lauri,\nThank you for the encouragement. I think this has been the longest day of my life. I still just feel numb and torn. There are just no words.\nYou asked about\n my friend. She had her surgery (lumpectomy) last Friday and is waiting for lab results. She is sheduled to begin radiation. I think she is doing ok, as well as anyone can do under the circumstances I suppose. It's not easy for her. I talked to her this morning and she said she just goes one day at a time.\nAs for me, I'm 53 and live in Texas. I am a massage therapist and have a small day spa. I'm married and have 3 grown sons and one daughter-in-law. I have two beautiful young granddaughters, too. My husband and I have recently joined a new church that is very loving and caring. I also have brothers, sisters, and some wonderful friends. I am very blessed.\nI have a doctors appt. on Monday. I don't even know what to ask. The doctor said this morning that they have caught it early she thinks. She also said that it doesn't make a difference mammogram or lumpectomy and that she usually recommends the lumpectomy followed by radiation. At least I think that is what she said, I'm not sure now. It seems like she said that the results of the nodes determines treatment too. My anut died from BC. I always said if I got it I would just have them both taken off. Now I don't know. I just don't know. \nWell, it's late and I'm going to taken a vicodin and hope I am able to get some sleep. I tried earlier but my mind is just so busy.\nGood night my new friends. God's peace.\nCharlene ",
