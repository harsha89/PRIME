      "Content": " Hi. I was wondering if anyone is taking Herceptin every three weeks instead of every week. I am deathly afraid of iv's and having them once a week is causing me to have nightmares!!! I am such a baby about\n iv's. The unfortunate part was that I asked my doctor about\n herceptin before I took my port out and he said that it wasn't for me. Now three weeks later and my port surgically removed...I am now taking it. ",

I am using the biggest vein in my arm right now until it gets tired and then we will figure something out.

I am currently taking herceptin and I swell a lot but the heart test keeps coming up okay. I also feel tired, but I don't know if I have lingering effects from chemo or if it is herceptin. Anyone else have any of these little side effects? ",
