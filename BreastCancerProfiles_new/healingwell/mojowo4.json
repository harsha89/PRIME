      "Content": " I am usually on the CD site but just the other day found a lump in my left breast.  Doctor got my right in and says it feels like a glandular hardening.  I am on prednisone for my CD and that my possibly be causing it.  I am schedueld for a mammo and u/s on the 27th to find out more specifics.  I have bc in my family although it is in my grandparents generation.  I am pretty scared that this will turn up bad as I already have tons of other health issues with Crohns Disease and Primary Sclerossing Cholangitis, arthritis (caused by CD) and I am only 31!  I also have a 5 year old daughter that has already endured so much of my poor health.  I know it is a waiting game but how do you cope with the wait and see anxiety? \nDx 2003 but probably had it 10 years prior\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Well I got the mammo done, all the techs were reluctant to actually do it because of my age (31) but after the u/s showed nothing after 2 people looked at it they decided to go ahead with the mammo. It also showed NOTHING. The lump is there but does not show on anything. They said not to worry, it was nothing but to call if any thing changed. Feel MUCH better now. Thanks for listening!\nDx CD 2003 but probably had it 10 years prior\n \n \n \n ",
