      "Content": " Hi, my name is Teri and I'm the cardio and asthma mod. Laure', I saw your post and I just wanted to mention that I'm glad you're seeing a cardio \nDr. :)\nSometimes arrhythmia's are benign like the PVC's, but if you are already on a med. for them (a beta blocker?), then it's likely more then a PVC?! I also am diabetic and so was my Mom, who recently passed away. She was 76 and had Breast Cancer.\nLots of things can cause fatigue-that's for sure! So it's great that you are getting this all checked out.\nHugs, Teri :)\nPS I hope it was okay, that I poked my head in here?!\n \n \n \n \n ",
