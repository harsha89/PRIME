    "Content": " It is common to have what they call adenomas. These are benign (not cancer). However they can be hard and they can grow. It is a good thing that you are getting it removed. I am surprised that your doctor didnt do an uls to se if it was cystic before trying to perform an fna. You shouldnt have had to go throught that. \nNever heard of the sedation, but they know what they do. They do it all the time. This will begin and it will end. You will heal and you will live life anew.\nplease keep us up on how you are doing. We will be thinking of you.\nHanging in there like a monkey on a vine, knowing that through this journey; there is something positive to find. ",
