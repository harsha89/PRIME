      "Content": " Well, I finally got into a surgeon's office on Friday - out of network ($300). All I have is fibrocystic breasts. She said that it tends to affect women in their 40s (That's me!!) Finally, the worrying and nightmare is over!! I was told to take 800 mg. of vitamin E everyday and to see her in 5 months.\nThanks again for all of your help!! ",

      "Content": " Well, here's my update on my insurance/breast surgeon nightmare. I put my husband on it and he was able to get me an appointment this Friday with a Dr. Patricia Joseph who was recommended by my primary care physician and my gynecologist. It is out of network, but I just can't wait any longer. I have another appointment with an Aetna surgeon in Belleville on Monday (in case I need a second opinion). Dr. Huston's office couldn't see me until the middle of June. My general practitioner recommended that I move forward with an MRI, but the MRI facility is now questioning it. They want me to wait until June 12th because of when my last period was. Aetna said that it was bogus. Now the MRI place is saying that I should have another mammogram first. They make it really easy for us don't they? If anyone has any medical/insurance insights on all this, I would appreciate it. ",

      "Content": " About a month ago I found a lump in my breast. I couldn't get an appointment with my gynecologist, so I made one with my GP. The GP sent me to have a sonogram which I scheduled a week later. They found nothing on my sonogram and I had already had a clear mammogram in January that showed nothing. I went back to my GP for a recheck (a week later) and she recommended that I see a breast surgeon. The lump has disappeared, but I still feel sore and \"noduly\" in the area. I have an Aetna PPO and they have only three surgeons listed in my area. The closest one can't see me until June 7th!! For the other two - one is in Manhattan and the other is near Newark. They can't see me until May 25th. Most of the surgeons that my GP recommended don't take any insurance.\nI'm scared to wait so long and am frustrated. If anyone has gone through this, what would you recommend and what factors should I consider? I live in Bergen County, NJ. ",

      "Content": " Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. Just knowing that there are other women out there to give me some insight and their experiences really helps. I will try Dr. Huston's office on Monday and hope that she can see me before June 7th. At least I can get closer to ending the mystery and worrying.\nYou all are great!!! ",
