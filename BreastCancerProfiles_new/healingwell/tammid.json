      "Content": " Thank you Talia and Crampygrammy for your thoughts and prayers!! I have decent good news :) \nI saw the surgeon Wed. and he is very optimistic. He says the spot is only 2x3x4 millimeters big (or SMALL in this case!!) He thinks I'm a little silly saying I can feel it but whatever. \n \nI go in for a core biopsy on Tuesday and we will go from there. I joked with the nurse that the biopsy may remove the whole thing cuz its so small. The doc never mentioned doing the MRI. \nGrammy, my advise to you right now is to just go to your appointments like everything is good and not worry. After my first day or 2 of worrying, I realized that worrying won't change the outcome. And now I have an optimistic look on it. \"We be just checkin on things\" \n \nAnyone know how long it will take to get the results of the biopsy?\nBlessings to All ",

      "Content": " So I turned 40, and I felt an odd lump on my right breast. So I scheduled a mammogram. I was then called back for another mammogram and an ultrasound. They said the mammogram looked ok, but there was a spot on the ultrasound. I'm now scheduled to see a surgeon on Wed. and then get an MRI. \nDoes this seem odd? To see a surgeon first? \nI'm trying not to completely freak out, but that's not going so well... \n ",
