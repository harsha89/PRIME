    "Content": " There are many alternatives to get your sick body well.  I would look into a doctor detoxification program to eliminate toxins, xenoestrogens, and just to clean out.  Also boost your immune system with IV vitamin C or high dose lipospheric vitamin C, use a infrared sauna and sweat the toxins out.  One new nutrient in promise with BC is sulforophane.  \n ",
