    "Content": " When will the pain go away? Even if I am off it, I have pain.\nI was on Femara and was reading your post. I have bad bone, muscle, and nerve pain - I have been off of it for a year and still have the pain. In fact the pain got worse for me during the year that I got off of it. \nDid it getter for you after a year of NOT using it? Did you do anything special?\nHow long did you take it for?\nYour help is appreciated. ",
