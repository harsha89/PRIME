      "Content": " Advice please on how to get through the first few days and weeks with grace, dignity and some reassurance that maybe things will be ok???....someday....\nHad an ultrasound follow up after mammogram showed calcifications and the doctors saw 2 masses, possibly one swollen lymph node. My thoughts run from \"this can't be happening/real\" to \"I'll never see my 2 1/2 year old grow up or he'll never know the beautiful, healthy active mommy he once had\" to yes, \"I'm going to kill myself if the diagnosis gets too bad\"...I don't think I can take the disruption to my son and husbands and parents lives. I'm sure I'll feel differently in a few days...but also just wanting to rush things and get this boob off my chest before it kills me!!!! \n ",

      "Content": " Early this coming week. The chief radiologist and surgeon I met with already scheduled me for a CT, MRI and bone scan, plastic surgery consult on Monday. They must be pretty sure - and I did beg them to please help me hit the ground running. I know the hospital system is excellent (Cleve Clinic) so I'm confident it is what it is. The surgeon has done work to remove cysts on my mom for years and she seems like the female version of Gregory House (not to take things lightly by comparing a TV show). She has her degrees from MIT, Columbia and one of the nurses told me she is like a concert level pianist. She was nothing like the radiologist/ultrasound doctors who were kind of young, \ncookie cutter, talked way too much. I meet with the doctor on Thurs to go over all the tests results am just praying it hasn't gone any farther. I don't know how to handle any more bad news...this is so out of the blue as I felt I was/am in very good health.\n \n ",

      "Content": " Denean, Ohio, bad mammogram, worse ultsrasound yesterday. Calcifications in 3 spots, 2 masses 1 cm and 2.6 cm....seems to be contained in left breast but possible lymph node involvement. Biopsy tomorrow. Have a super hubby beautiful 2 1/2 yr old...so if this if from pregnancy, can't take it back. The first few days are HELL. Walking around in a panic stricken daze. Not sure how I'll ever get my feet under me. Oh and Ulcerative Colitis diagnosis Sept '92 but that has been well managed for the most part. Not looking forward to drugs that make me nauseated/hurt my delicate colon. :( ",
