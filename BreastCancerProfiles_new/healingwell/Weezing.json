    "Content": " Hi everyone, Just found this site and wondered if any one could answer this question . I had BC in 2012 , complete mastectomy right side. No cancer in lymph nodes. Had no other treatment.\n Last month Oct. 2014 , on CT scan a nodule 1.4 concern for malignancy was found in my right Upper lung. I'm awaiting biopsy results which will be on the 7th- Nov. I have had 2 different opinions. Onc. thinks its new ,but my BC surgeon thinks it's recurrence . I've been trying to research both, but I can't figure out about\n mets . Is it operable if not what options are there ? Thanks ",
