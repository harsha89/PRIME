      "Content": " So I had my mammogram today at 7:15. Really nice tech worked with me. Did the standard 4 films, then came back to do another of my left and another of the area on my right where the lump is. She said the Radiologist was not in yet, so I should call later in the day to see if they had read my films yet. She also said I probably would need to have an ultrasound. So does that mean she saw something on my films?\n ",

      "Content": " Thank you all so much for the prayers and positive thoughts! Your insights have been invaluable. In fact, I called the surgeon today and set my appointment. They said it would take 2 weeks to get the mammo results. That didn't sound right so I called the Xray dept who said it takes 2 days. I called the surgeon back and had them schedule my appt for 1 week after my mammo instead of 2. Now I need to call my PCP on Monday (was closed today) to verify just what that surgeon will be doing....Have a great weekend, ya'll! ",
