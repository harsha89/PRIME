    "Content": " I'm looking for some people that have had experiences with second opinions in the past to provide some insight on a project I'm working on.\nI am an MBA students at UCLA Anderson School of Management and my final thesis project has me working with a large hospital system that is looking to develop an online patient-to-doctor second opinion program. They would like to develop a very patient-focused program, so I am reaching out to you to see if you can help shed some light on what such a program should look like, based on your experiences.\nThe survey linked below will take about\n 5 minutes of your time and ask questions about\n your experiences with second opinions, for yourself or a family member. Even if you haven't sought a second opinion in the past, you can still contribute as this survey will take you down a different line of questioning.\nThis survey will be completely anonymous. And I respect your privacy, so feel free to skip any questions you feel are too personal. \nhttp://ucla.qualtrics.com/SE/?Sid=SV_24cHzeaRFD8gOHz\nThank you in advance for your assistance. I greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide.\n- David - UCLA Anderson Class of 2014 ",
