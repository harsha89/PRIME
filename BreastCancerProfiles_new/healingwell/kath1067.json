    "Content": " I was diagnosed with a radial scar back in December after finding what felt like a huge lump in my right breast. I had the initial biopsy done which came back negative for carcinoma, but confirmed the radial scar. I had my excisional surgery yesterday. I wish there was more on this subject but I guess because it is rare finding information is like finding a needle in a hay stack. I am 43 years old, pre-menopause. I am pretty tender at the incision and the percocet just helps me sleep for a few hours...does not do anything for the pain. My surgeon told me there is a 30% chance that they will find cancer when they biopsy the entire mass. I have my follow up next week...I sure hope they call me earlier when they find out the results either way...I just want to prepare myself for the next step if need be. ",
