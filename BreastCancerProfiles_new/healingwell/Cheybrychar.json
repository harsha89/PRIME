    "Content": " I was diagnosed with DCIS in February 2015, had a lumpectomy without nodes being removed in March, and completed radiation treatment on May 2015. A while after everything was done I started feeling better. Now I noticed I have swelling in my armpit and am experiencing pain in my breast again. I saw the doctor and was told she felt no new lumps. She felt that it may be the nerve endings coming back to life. She put me on Vitamin E and Trental. I have only been taking it a week but am seeing no improvement. Has anyone else experienced this and what were you told? Any help with this is much appreciated. ",
