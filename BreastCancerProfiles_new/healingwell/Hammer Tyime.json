      "Content": " Thanks for everyones thoughts and concerns. I set up an appointment to once again see the breast surgon. I am just so horrified of any type of surgery. And yes its proablly not anything to be of real concern about\n, but I cant help but worrying. Exspecially since the lump is imoblile unlike a fibroadenoma. I know the chances are slim to none but after doing some research of my own it sounds more like a Phyllodes tumor. I guess theres really only one way to find out.\nThanks again. ",
