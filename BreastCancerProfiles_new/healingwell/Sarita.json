      "Content": " Hey everyone!  I'm coming over from the GI forums and had a question or two for the members of this forum; thank you in advance for helping me out.  I'm 99% sure this is nothing but had a fleeting concern or two; I am 27 years old, have been on the NuvaRing for about\n four years now, the pill before that for a couple of years.  My breasts have always been sort of lumpy, but normal-shaped.  about\n two weeks ago I saw a very noticeable dent in the skin of my left breast.  I thought perhaps it was menstrual-cycle related and then after my period noticed it was still there.  My doctor saw it right and scheduled an ultrasound, which I had done today.  \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks again, Lori.  You have some sound advice; I'm not too worried about\n this, especially given my age and lack of any significant family history, but I might get it checked while my insurance is fairly decent.  My PCP was a mentor for me when I was trying to get into medical school (I'm starting this summer) so he is always really great about\n giving me an objective opinion and explaining the pros/cons of tests or treatments.  I know all of this will make me a better doctor, for sure!  Thanks again for your help, it's invaluable.

      "Content": " You guys have been really great, I second the notion for everyone.  I'll probably call my PCP sometime soon to ask for the referral to the breast specialist.  As long as I have decent insurance and before I start med school it will be nice to get it taken care of.  Thanks again!
