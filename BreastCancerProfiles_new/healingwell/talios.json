    "Content": " I have been reading many forums on this topic, but did not really find an answer. I was diagnosed in March, lumpectomy in May, radiation followed. Unable to take tamoxifen, too many side effects. I finished radiation in August and I have unbearable itching and pain. The pores on my breast are still black. I had another mammo in September and it was clear, so nit a fear of reoccurring at this time. This just makes daily life difficult. Any suggestions? Aloe, cortisone, creams and ointments I have tried do nothing. It almost feels like mastitis, but no fever or other signs of infection. My drs do not seem concerned. So as far as my physical health goes, I'm fine. The itching and pain is going to put me in the nut house. I also apologize for any typos, I am posting from my phone. I thank you in advance for any help. ",
