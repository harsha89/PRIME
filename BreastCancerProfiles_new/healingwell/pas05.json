    "Content": " Hi Friends, I don't know how many of you remember Janice.  She went by jebarnhart on iVillage and JanWa here.  Unfortunately our dear Janice passed away on June 24, 2005. I had the pleasure of getting to know Janice when I traveled to Seattle once a month in 2000.  She and her friend Lois would meet me for dinner after my visit at U of Wash for my Vaccine Clinical Trial.  She was a wonderful tour guide (Poulsbo is gorgeous) and hostess when my daughter and I were there for an extended stay.  She and her 2 beautiful girls made us feel at home and welcomed us into their home.  She was a great scrapbooker and awesome game player (she was a crossword addict like me). I lost touch with her these past few years, but thought of her often and will cherish her memory.  I pray for her husband and two girls..... Here is a link to the Poulsbo paper....(you may need to register first) http://www.kitsapsun.com/bsun/lo_tributes/article/0,2403,BSUN_19087_3886877,00.html Sadly, Patty ",
