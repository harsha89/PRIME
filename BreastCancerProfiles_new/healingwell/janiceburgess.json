    "Content": " Hello anyone out there I just had a double mastectomy on April the 12th and my doctor started me on 20 mg of Tamoxifen. I don't have to do chemo or radiation lucky, but she says I'll be on this for 5 yrs. Is it normal to have sore underarms? Â Is it from the medicine? I really don't have any outside friends anymore I have been home since my surgery leading a kind of solitary life. ",
