      "Content": " Hi folks,\nThis survey has been approved by the Admin.\nMy name is Tony Crispino and I am a 7 year survivor of advanced prostate cancer. I am also a long standing HealingWell member and former moderator. After my diagnosis I started running support groups and moderating here in the prostate cancer forum and in the last couple years I am a patient advocate working for ASCO ~ The American Society of Clinical Oncology and SWOG ~ Southwest Oncology Group which is a co-op that consists of 22 major cancer centers across the US. What we do is clinical trials. We are one of the five Co-ops in the US designated by the National Cancer Institute to do these unbiased, and independent clinical trials. I have been asked by the group to circulate this survey in an attempt to help us understand better ways of accruing patients into legit clinical trials. There is no place to enter your name or personal information, and you can answer any or all of the questions. In addition, this survey is targeted at ALL cancer survivors no matter the disease origin, and no previous trial experience is necessary.\nThank you in advance and please help us out. Here is the survey:\nTony Crispino\nAdvanced Prostate Cancer Survivor\nPatient Advocate and Support Group Leader\nNot a medical professional!!! ",
