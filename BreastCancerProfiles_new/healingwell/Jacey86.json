      "Content": " Dear Sunny -\nIf I were you, I'd definitely have the surgical biopsy! Would you rather have peace of mind or wondering, especially being at high risk like you are. Finding BC in the early stages is so critical and treatable!\nI had a surgical biopsy and it was a very simple process. It was outpatient surgery. That saved my life possibly. It's what detected my Breast Cancer!\nOf COURSE, it all sounds so scary and you wonder why you have to go through it. I truly thought mine was going to end up just being a big inconvenience. \nI had my appt/consult with surgeon on a Thurs (I believe) and was scheduled for surgery the following Tues. They don't like you to wait and not because of emergency but because of anxiety I think. \"Get it over with\" was a good mentality to have. \nGood Luck to you. Please keep us updated! ",

      "Content": " Betsy, I am so sorry that I am just now getting back to you! Wondering how your biopsy went or if you posted it somewhere else?\nTo answer your questions - \nI had immediate resconstruction of silicone implants. I did not have the tissue expanders. \nI went to one of the top oncologists in our area and found that I do not need to take Tamoxefen nor do I need chemo or radiation. Some do depending on what type of cancer, whether it has spread to lymph nodes etc.\nNo mammograms and that's why I chose the bi-lateral. Otherwise I would have been in there every 6 months checking the other one. My first 6 month visit is coming up soon. My surgeon said either he or someone (this will be my gynocologist) needs to do a good physical exam, feeling into collar bone and chest area.\nThey don't like to leave those abnormal cells in there regardless of what stage they're in now. My radiologist explained that there is A, B and C. -\nA is abnormal, B is benign and C is cancerous. For everything but B, they like to do something.\nOf course, everyone has their own and sometimes very different opinion. :)\nThinking of you! ",

I always say it's better to know what you're dealing with.\nI don't think regular mammograms 'help' microcalfications. They need to be looked at.

A \"mass\" can mean lots of things, so the ultrasound will really help them figure out what it is. If you need a biopsy, even if it were to be a surgical excision, you'll get through it! \nI do know that Dr.'s don't delay on any sort of abnormal things found in the breast. When I found a lump, they wanted me in the next day and THAT scared me. BUT, that's what they do. \nThere are several distinctions they look for in an ultrasound/sonogram. I wish I could remember them all (your radiologist will be able to tell you), one is if sound waves can penetrate the mass/lump. \nTurned out my lump was benign, unfortunately at the same time they found a few different areas of microcalcifications (which turned out to be cancerous). So for me, my lump was my friend cause it got me the attention I needed. \nAmazing how we DO get through these things. Not knowing is much much harder than knowing what you're dealing with. We as women, are pretty strong! \nPlease post after your follow up and let us know how things went.\nYou'll be in my thoughts and prayers!\nJacey ",
