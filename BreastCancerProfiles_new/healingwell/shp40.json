      "Content": " Hello - \nI am new to this site and forum. I am encouraged by the amount of discussion here! \nJust a few days ago I was told I have a complex cyst in my left breast. My physician and the Breast Center recommended a biopsy even though it appears to be \"low suspicion\". I then looked up the general cost of a biopsy and was floored - $1,000 to $5,000. Is this accurate? On the new health plan, our insurance has changed dramatically and everything this year, for the first $4,500 has to come out of our pockets before insurance kicks in. This would be a huge hardship for our family.\nWould you ladies recommend getting the biopsy anyway? What have the costs been for you (if that's too personal of a question please tell me).\nI am going to call the insurance company Monday to get more information and I have a call in to the Breast Center to see if they can give me a ball park figure on the cost.\nThoughts? I would appreciate any wisdom you have to offer.\nThank you,\nSusan ",
