    "Content": " Hello everybody, I usually post in the Chron's forum.  My husband's sister is 38 years old and was diagnosed with breast cancer 4 months ago.  She had a lumpectomy and removal of the lymphnodes (sp?).  Biopsies came back showing Grade 3 cancer with 4 of her lymphnodes affected as well.  She already had 6 chemotherapy sessions and she has 3 more to go, afterwards she will have radiotherapy.  She lives in the UK and I'm sure she is being very well cared of.  Now, I not only know, but I strongly believe, that breast cancer is considered a chronic disease these days, and certainly not a death sentence.  \n \n \n ",
