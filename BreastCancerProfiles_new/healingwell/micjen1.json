    "Content": " Hello, I am micjen1,\nI have had complications from breast reconstruction, now the insurance company is not willing to help me fix my chest. I have a hole in my left chest area that is \nopen and drains, It is ugly. I have contacted a health care advocate in my state. This agency was not helpful at all. I now need an attorney to help get this situation taken care of. I have read Janet's law to the advocate and the insurance co. They ignored me. So please if anybody could refer me to an attorney that does not want 15,000 dollars up front to help me. If I had that kind of money, I would have just paid to have it repaired myself. Please Help, any information is welcome, Thank you, micjen1. ",
