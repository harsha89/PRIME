      "Content": " Thanks Bev i appreciate your time and input, n no i havn't gone to gyn only my pcp. Actually, i had one primary tell everything was fine and then i changed dr's, and the second one was so concerned. She sent me to a surgeon that did the skin punch biopsy. I go Monday morning to another surgeon that is supposed to be a 'breast specialest' The name of the place is Paragon Breast Care. So, yes im hoping for a better answer. Roni ",
