      "Content": " On October 18, 2011, I had a biopsy on both breast and both came back benign. However, it has been four weeks and I now noticed either it is a lump or scar tissue on my left breast. On Monday my breast was sore and the lump was more fuller, now today Friday, my breast is not as sore and the area that look swollen or scar tissue has developed has decreased in size but it is still there. I called my surgeon and they want me to come back in on Monday. I asked if I could remove the steri stripes that I have had since the surgery(which was four weeks ago) and they said I could and they told me they didn't know why they did not schedule me sooner but for me to come in Monday 11/14/11 and we will look at things. \nNow for the past two weeks I did have sharp pinching and itching on both breast and the nipples felt funny. I don't know what that was but it has since stopped and during that time I had no scar tissue, so hopefully that is all that is wrong. I will post what my doctor says....I keeping positive thoughts and will let you know my results....... ",
