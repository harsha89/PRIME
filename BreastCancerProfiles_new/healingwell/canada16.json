      "Content": " Went for my 3rd Mammogram this morning and 3 hours later got a call back to come in tomorrow. I'm 50 and prob haven't had one in 5 - 6 years (should be keeping up on it however, wasn't sure why my dr. was trying to push me in right in at 40 when I was still bf my baby and there is no history). So tomorrow have to have right breast redone with a diagnostic mammogram and and u/s. A bit nervous. This forum is helping to relieve some fear. I have gained a bit more weight since my last one so hoping it's just something to do with that. Thank you for the posts on here. ",

      "Content": " Well, everything turned out to be fine for now. I think the biggest problem was this clinic didn't get the results of my last two mammograms so had nothing to compare it to. They do want me to return in 6 months just to double check the R. Breast with a mammogram and ultrasound again. By then they should also have my first two results. Glad to have that test done! ",
