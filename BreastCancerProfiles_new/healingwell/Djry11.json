      "Content": " Thanks! I had an MRI, but they scheduled one without contrast. Grrr. The test was pretty much pointless. They didn't see anything. No duh!\nThey said they aren't doing anything else. Just wait and watch. It's been there for months.... What do they think is going to happen? Don't think much will change.\nThey said maybe it's bone inflammation?! Doesn't make sense. \nTrying to get a second opinion at another breast center. ",

      "Content": " So I had a breast MRI scheduled for yesterday and got a call in the morning that another doctor had cancelled the MRI for me because it was not necessary. My pcp ordered the test because she felt that it WAS necessary. I'm not sure how they can do that. So now my pcp is sending me for a regular chest MRI, not a breast one, since they aren't cooperating. I feel like I'm pulling a tooth, to simply get further evaluation for a very obvious lump. My dad's side had breast cancer. ",

Got sent to have an ultrasound that didn't show anything, at all. Everyone in the room felt it easily but couldn't see it in imaging. Doc said she didn't know what it was but could be a injury to my rib. It doesn't hurt though?!?! She didn't suggest anything else and now I'm more confused than before. ",
