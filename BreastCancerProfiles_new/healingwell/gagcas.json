    "Content": " hello everyone. i am new here and petrified. i received a call last Friday that my mother was diagnosed with stage 2 HER2NEU + breast carcinoma. she is 58. she is in the process of getting genetically tested for the mutated gene over that weekend i also found out that not only does she have it...my grandmother(her mother) who passed away 3 years ago had breast cancer(although thats not what killed her. her health was bad)...as well as my grandmothers 3 sisters and a daughter each from those three sisters. after this current revelation..i immediately called my OBGYN and told him the update info i found out. he pulled me in immediately monday afternoon for my first mammo. i was already schedule to have it done in may when i turned 40 he just pulled me in sooner. had mammo on monday, got a call wednesday that they wanted as sono of my right side. i got for that tomorrow. i am petrified. now with all the history i have from same side of family line...and now a call back for a sono you can imagine where my thoughts are going. i called the OB to see what the reason was behind the sono and they said they didnt even have my mammo results yet so im assuming its the radiologists that want to second look? if something had shown up on the mammo they would have pulled me in sooner for the sono right. not have me go 4 days after my mammo??? and why just ONE side and not both if they wanted a baseline? i am 39 and seriously upset that my family kept this info from us all this time because \"they didnt want to worry us?\" my sono is at 9 tomorrow morning ",
