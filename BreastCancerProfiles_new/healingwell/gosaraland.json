    "Content": " I just lost my beautiful 38 year old daughter to breast cancer that was preventable.  When she was 25 and about\n to get married, she told me she went for a checkup (her first) to get birth control pills.  Her doctor would not prescribe birth control but instead referred her to a surgeon.  Seems she had a breast lump from about\n age 16 and it had grown to golf ball size.  She never told her father and me back when she was 16 because she knew that we would make her go and have it checked.  She was very modest and avoided doctors.  Anyway, the surgeon thought that it was just a cyst but recommended that she have it removed because it could turn into cancer.  She chose not to follow his advice.  about\n 9 years later, guess what?  Cancer! Doctor's thought that it was confined to the breast since it showed no signs of being in the nodes.  They didn't do a PET scan at that time but I don't know why.  She chose to have a lumpectomy but her doctor wanted her to have a mastectomy with radiation and chemo...she didn't do that.  I believe that at that time the cancer had already spread because just a few months later it had matasticized to her bones and it was really bad.  The cancer was being fed by her hormones so all there was left to do then was to hold it off for awhile with Tamoxaphen and others drugs.  Wish I had some way to reach High School and college students about\n not procrastinating when there is a lump.  She was a beautiful young woman with two small children and a husband.  ",
