      "Content": " I all, I am new to the board. Might be a little long, so thanks in advance for reading and sharing any feedback.  I have a very good friend that told me she has breast cancer.  She lives in another state, and told me about\n the treatment she was going thru, she would sound so bad after having these treatments.  But something does seem right to me.  She had treatments for about\n 4 months, IV treatments, then she quit them for about\n 6 months. She is now in the same town I'm in Houston, TX, and said she is now getting treatment at MD Anderson, even though she really hasn't any test done there before hand.  The other day , her first time there, she called and told me they were giving her a \"cocktail\" since it had been a while since she any treatment.  She sounded really sick when she called again.  But she showed up to work hours later after she had it.  I hate to sound like i don't believe her, but I just confused on how you can go without treatment and then start up again at a new hospital that hasn't even checked you out.  Are you active after you have one of these cocktails?  Thru all this treatment, i have seen her, she hasn't lost any hair, and doesn't look like your \"stereotypical\" cancer patient, no weight loss or sickly looking.  Do I listen to my little voice to tell me that something else is going on, or is that i just don't come to the reality that she really has breast cancer?  Any input would be greatly appriciated.

      "Content": " Hey guys, thanks so much for your input. I will take up some of your suggestions as far as asking alot more questions. Thinking about\n it, last year she told me she was in stage three and receiving aggressive chemo, IV type. But just last week, she said it was only stage one? I am going to find out what kind of meds they have her on after she recieve's one of these treatments. I'm just really concerened for her, and wondering what is really going on. She drives herself to these treatments, and drives back afterwards, I have offered to drive, but am told now, she's know how busy I am. I've told her I don't mind taking off to help a friend. I will keep you updated, and thanks again to everyone one of you for the replies and advice!! ",
