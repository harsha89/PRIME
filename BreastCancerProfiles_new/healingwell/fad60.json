    "Content": " I am new to this site and the forum, but would like to touch base with others that are further along in their treatment regime than I am. I was diagnosed with Grade 1, Stage 2 ILC, 1.2cm, estrogen + only on Feb. 3rd. I had a lumpectomy done on Feb. 10th, with a clear sentinel node and began CMF chemo treatments in March based on my Oncotype score of 25. I am receiving IV treatments every 3 weeks for a total of 8 treatments. I just had my 5th treatment today - yipee - so just 3 more to go. Then I will be doing radiation, and Tamoxifin. I have found the CMF treatments to be very doable with really just one down, blah day 2 days after. I appreciate the span of 3 weeks, because I have many days in between where I feel perfectly normal. The side effects seem minimal and yes, my hair sheds a disturbing amount, but the loss is only noticeable to me. ",
