    "Content": " I had a mammogram on Friday, I got called back Monday morning. They wanted me to make an appointment for a mammogram and ultrasound. I go Thursday. \nIs this anything to worry about\n? All they said was it was for my left breast.\nI'm just a little freaked out. I'm the same age my Mom was when she was diagnosed. ",
