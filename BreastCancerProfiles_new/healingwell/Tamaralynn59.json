With my lump, when I had my first mamo after the doc examined the lump, the lady that did my mammo told me if my lump hurt, which it did, it probably wasn't cancer. Well, she was wrong. It was cancer. You can't really go by any set rule, anything is possible. I hope you the best, but like everyone says, just because you are diagnosed with bc isn't the end of the world. It is treatable. Hang in there.\n ",

I'm fairly new to this. I just had surgery three weeks ago. A lumpectomy and two lymph nodes removed. They got all the cancer, I do have to go thru chemo, but my prognosis is good. So even if it is malignant, it's not the end of the world. Waiting is the hardest part, but it gets easier once you know, even if it is bad. Then you at least know what you are dealing with and things will start happening and they will take care of the problem and you'll be on your way to being cancer free!!! Hugs and prayers\n ",

My doc gave me ambien just yesterday to help me sleep. I'm glad to hear it works. I tried Benadryl and it worked just the opposite on me. I guess it's the unknown side effects that is really worrying me. I'm expecting the worse as i always do. I hope mine is easy too. I do know I'm not taking care of myself like i should, as far as rest and eating right, i have to start doing that to keep up my strength. Also, my surgeon doc is sending me to physical therapy for my arm. I haven't been using it like i should because it hurts, darn it! but i have to start getting more use out of it or it won't be good. I\"ve been babying it too much, I still don't have much range of motion but it's getting better. You guys are such a big help to me, I really appreciate you. I'll talk to you later.
