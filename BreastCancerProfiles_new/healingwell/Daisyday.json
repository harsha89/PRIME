      "Content": " Hello, thanks for replying. \nI have spoken to my doctor and she said it won't be anything to do with my pcos as my hormone levels are all normal. \nI have my appointment for the hospital breast clinic on Monday. I just can't believe I didn't know the lump was even there. Since the doctor pointed it out to me it's really obvious. ",

      "Content": " Hi guys,\nI'm very new here and not even sure if this is where I belong. I just wanted a bit of advise and info I guess. \nI went to see my doc last week as my left nipple has been leaking for a while now. I just put it down to hormones as I have PCOS. \nThe doc examined me and said that the tissue in my left felt different to the right and that she could also feel a hard area in the left too. I haddnt even thought to examine myself. So she decided to refer me to the hospital and do a blood test to check my hormones. \nI got a call yesterday to say my hormones are all normal and I have an appointment a week on monday.\nI did post this already but I want to ask if anyone else has experienced nipple discharge and found a lump and what the outcome was. I don't have any pain or itchiness or anything. \nThanks ",
