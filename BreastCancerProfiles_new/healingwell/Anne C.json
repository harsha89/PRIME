      "Content": " Thank you for replying Alcie and Bev! \nI did get lorazepam for anxiety, Alcie. It helps when I can't sleep. : ) \nWhat is metastatic disease as apposed to mets, Bev? I sorta thought it was the same thing. And why do Drs track them if it might not mean anything?\nDo the numbers themselves mean something or just the going up and/or down?\nAlso, I have realized that no matter what happens that Jesus is still with me and I don't have to fret over everything! \nSo I'm trying to rest in Him and stay at peace, as much as possible. Some days are better than others.\n(BTW.....I found out that I will have another grandchild born in Sept.....my oldest son's first child. I will then have 3 grandchildren and 2 step-grandchildren. That's exciting!)\nThanks! ",

      "Content": " Thank you for all the info! I'll try to find my Dr reports and see the exact wording of the diagnosis. \nI know that I had some tumors in nodes and the wording of results, and others, on those led me to believe they expected that other cells had traveled but they were hiding or in remission. \nAnd ....even though I was first diagnosed in Feb or Mar 2005, I still go in for Dr checks every 6 months and this year for labs every 6-8 weeks. Now every 4 weeks.\nYou are right, I think I should go ahead with the scans.\nThank you again, Bev! ",

All the other might be true but they can not be sure without a pathology report. I'm so sorry that they scared you like that! It seems unprofessional to me. ",

I said check again in 4 weeks and also wanted an appt for a screening mamo for the breast I have left. \nShould also just start the scans? \nI've been having anxiety attacks for months now.
