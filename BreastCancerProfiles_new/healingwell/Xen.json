      "Content": " Alcie, all: the Femara pills are 2.5 mg, but the minimum recommended dose for cancer is 0.5 mg, and the minimum \"clinically significant\" dose for total estrogen suppression is 0.1 mg. You can quarter the tabs easily with a pill-splitter to get 0.625 mg for an economical way to reduce dose and still be a good cancer dose. The difference between 0.5-0.6 mg and 2.5 mg is a few weeks more in life expectancy. If you're having difficulty affording the pills, a reduced dose is a country mile better than no pills. Letrozole dissolves in ethyl alcohol, so if you want an even lower dose you can completely crush a tablet in a small amount of alcohol, add water (or use more alcohol) to get to 25 ml so you have an easy-to-measure dose unit for 0.1 mg dose (if you use a 25 ml bottle with one crushed tab, then a 1 mg eyedropper gives you a 0.1 mg dose of the liquified crushed tablet). Shake well before every dropperful. you'll see little bits of coating that don't dissolve that tell you if you shook well. One 30-tab bottle will last 5 months at 0.5 mg. Check the Femara site prescribing information for dosage and side effects at 0.5 mg, it's listed. \nHope this helps! ",

      "Content": " (sigh) if only there was real health care reform....\nAn \"approved\" dose is anything your doctor wants to write on a prescript\nion. The Femara dose for breast cancer is set at 0.5 and 2.5 mg in the manufacturer prescribing information because 0.5 eliminates estrogen to an undetectable level. 2.5 mg was chosen as the dose that maximizes life expectancy. If a couple of extra months of crippled existence is not a priority to you, the 0.5 mg dose gives almost identical side effects and clinical results. 0.1 mg is a dose that fully suppresses estrogen, there's a statistically improved result of total estrogen suppression at 0.5 mg. To say it another way, at 0.1 mg there's a chance of some uncontrolled estrogen leaking through your hands, breasts etc, so I'd guess that this is what improves the side effects but also reduces your life expectancy a little bit as compared to 0.5 or 2.5 mg. (if there's any oncology specialists reading this, please chime in). IMHO if you can tolerate 0.1 mg, it's a world better than doing without the med because you can't tolerate the side effects.\nCompounding cost $15 a month to mix it in a refrigerated oil- it's affordable.

      "Content": " Alcie and all: I notice that nightshades (tomato, potato, peppers, eggplant, cayenne, paprika, tabasco) trigger severe arthritis symptoms with the femara, they make the symptoms much worse. There's a theory that nightshades interfere with calcium absorption, they contain a substance that moves calcium out of bone and into soft tissue. If you eat a lot of these vegetables, you might want to try a nightshade-free diet for a few weeks and see if it helps. ",

      "Content": " Alcie and thread, the lowest dose for Femara in the prescribing information is much lower, it's 4 percent of the pill or 0.01 mg. A pharmacy needs a compounding prescript\nion from a doc to make this dose in a liquid, they need 1-3 pills from your Femara bottle for a 1-3 month supply, and a couple of hours to compound it. It's not expensive. My side effects are much improved at this dose. It's not as effective for BC longevity as the 2.5 mg or 0.5 mg dose, but point out to your doc that it's better than not taking it at all. It'll work for estrogen suppression at even lower doses than 0.01 mg. Sad that there's no research on this subject, since 50% of aromatase inhibitor users get bone or tendon issues, and a lot of them stop the meds because of the toxic side effects. ",

      "Content": " Hi Alcie. ( Disclosure: I am not a doctor, do not give medical information, etc, etc, etc, check with your doctor or pharmacist for all medical and pharmaceutical information, blah blah blah.) \n All doctors can prescribe what is called \"off-label\" prescript\nions for nonstandard dosages or uses of medications. Some docs are restricted from doing this if they work for a HMO or clinic with rules against it for legal reasons. Off-label prescript\nions moves some liability from the pharmaceutical company to the doctor or HMO if something goes very wrong, but it's perfectly legal and quite common. \n The simplest way to do this is to contact your old doc by phone and see if he is willing to phone the compounding prescript\nion to a compounding pharmacy near your house. You don't need an office visit for this. Most pharmacies don't compound medications, so you'll need to search your area for one that specializes in compounding. The pharmacy can help the doc with the compounding instructions if he's never done it. It'll specify something like Femara, 0.01 mg, capsule or liquid, once daily, 50 (or 75) days. And you'll need to supply the pharmacy with 2-3 of your prescript\nion Letrozole 2.5 mg tabs. I recommend liquid because you can adjust the dose to find the max dose you can tolerate without crippling your body. Tell him to look at the Femara prescribing information and he'll find that 0.01 mg is an FDA approved dose for full estrogen suppression. \nHope this helps! ",
