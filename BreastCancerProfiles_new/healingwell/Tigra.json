    "Content": " Hi guys. I had two previous lumps one in each breast, both were fibroadenoma and both removed a few years back.\nFound a new lump couple of month back, over the left breast so GP referred me back to the clinic.\nLast week they did mammogram and ultrasound guided core biopsys X 3. It's about\n 1.5 cm and actually attached to the muscle between the collar bone and Brest. Results will take a week and obviously I'm a bit freaking out, was not painful not moving either unless muscle moves.\nAnybody have any idea having it attached to the muscle is less or more chances for malignancy?\nDx: Glomerulonephritis, CKD 3, GERD, Nutcracker oesophagus, Systemic Lupus (dx May 2011), Lupus nephritis\nSurgical: Two kidney surgeries with partial nephrectomy, cholecystectomy, multiple puppiloma/fibroma -ectomies \nMeds: Plaquenil 600mg/day, Methotrexate 20 Mg, Prednisolone 5 mg/day,, Folinic Acid, Ixprim, Tritace, Lasix, Beta blocker, Cymbalta ",
