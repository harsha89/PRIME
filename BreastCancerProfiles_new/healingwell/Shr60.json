    "Content": " Hi. I have just registered as a member and am new to the forum situation but have seen the posts between ctlyn and barkboys and wondered how ctlyn got on with her mammogram and other tests on 10 August? I hope all was well? I am going through similar pains etc at the moment and am waiting for an MRI and bone scan. I know in my heart of hearts that there is nothing wrong but have reached the stage where I need all the tests to be clear so that the problem can be dealt with as the pain and associated symptoms are not going away. The specialist I saw said that sometimes it can be a side effect of the radiotherapy but I have been fine for two years so why now? ",
