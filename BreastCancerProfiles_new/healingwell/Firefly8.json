    "Content": " Hello Everyone,\nI have had abnormal mammograms in 2017 (these were my first, I was 43 years old). I became very ill in 2018 and unable to go to my repeat Mammo/US in 2018. Per my neurologist, my autoimmune system is overactive due to autoimmune disease or an underlying cancer. I was diagnosed with \"ataxia\" which is balance problems, with the underlying cause TBD. I had terrible shooting/sharp pains in my right breast a few days ago.... I have had it before. Has anyone had balance issues/breast pain/etc? I have a history of thyroid cancer, Hashimoto's and mixed connective disease.\nHere's my last u/s from 2017. I'm rated a bi-rads 3. \nRIGHT US BREAST DIAGNOSTIC LMTD RIGHT\nHISTORY:\nPatient is 43 years old and is seen for follow-up of a prior finding. The patient has a history of thyroid cancer at age 34. The patient has no family history of breast cancer.\nSTUDIES COMPARED:\nThe present examination has been compared to a prior imaging study performed at Central DuPage Hospital on 06/09/2017.\nULTRASOUND FINDINGS:\nReal-time ultrasound scanning was performed in the area of interest.\nFinding 1: Follow-up examination was performed for the mass in the right breast, 11 o'clock seen on 06/09/2017. On the present examination, there is an oval solid mass with circumscribed margins measuring 21 x 11 x 15 mm in the posterior region of the \nright breast at 11 o'clock located 5 cm from the nipple. Internal echotexture is hypoechoic. Finding remains unchanged from the prior study.\nFinding 2: Follow-up examination was performed for the mass in the right breast, 2 o'clock seen on 06/09/2017. On the present examination, there is a gently lobulated horizontal solid mass with circumscribed margins measuring 23 x 8 x 20 mm in the \nposterior region of the right breast at 2 o'clock located 5 cm from the nipple. Internal echotexture is hypoechoic. Finding remains unchanged from the prior study.\nFinding 3: Follow-up examination was performed for the masses in the right breast, subareolar region seen on 06/09/2017. On the present examination, there are multiple similar oval solid masses with circumscribed margins in the right breast which appear\noverall unchanged from the prior study.\nAt 10:00, 7 cm from the nipple, measuring 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm in size.\nAt 11:00, 5 cm from the nipple measuring 0.5 x 0.2 x 0.5 cm in size.\nAt 11:00, 4 cm from the nipple measuring 0.8 x 0.2 x 0.8 cm in size.\nAt 11:00, 8 cm from the nipple measuring 1.0 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm in size.\nIn the 9:00 subareolar \nlocation, measuring 1.7 x 0.3 x 1.3 cm in size.\nAt 1:00, 4 cm from the nipple measuring 0.7 x 0.4 x 0.6 cm in size.\nThere are benign cysts seen at 3:00, 9:00 and in the subareolar region also.\nIMPRESSION:\nMultiple solid masses in the right breast as described above are unchanged and probably benign. A bilateral diagnostic mammogram and a unilateral ultrasound of the right breast in 6 months is recommended to assess continued stability.\nBI-RADS Category 3:\nProbably Benign Finding(s)\nThe patient was informed of the findings and recommendations. The result letter will be mailed at a later time. Patient information has been entered into a reminder system with a target due date for the next exam.\nPlease note all Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging results are subject to interpretation according to your specific medical history and condition. The results in this report should be reviewed with your ordering or primary care physician as appropriate. ",
