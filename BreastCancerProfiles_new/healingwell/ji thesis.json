    "Content": " Hi everyone! I'm not sure if this type of thing is allowed on here but I thought it would be a really good place to start. My name is Ji, I am currently conducting research for my senior design thesis and am in need of a bit of help. I have chosen to my base thesis on ways to improve mammograms or other breast care procedures. I would really love to receive input from women who have been through these experiences first hand, rather than reading about\n it in paraphrased books and articles. Please take the time to fill out this quick survey then share to as many of your sisters, aunts, moms, grandmamas, counsins and friends as you can.\nIf there's anything in there you think I should change, please let me know! I'm only in the gathering stages of research so I know there's plenty of things I don't fully understand quite yet. \nThank you so much for your time, hope to hear from you all!\nHi ji, HW requires permission from our admin for surveys and studies so I removed your link. If you email him and ask for that Ok we would be able to help you. Thanks for considering HW and look forward to helping you.\n ",
