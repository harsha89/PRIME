      "Content": " Hi All\nHappy to have found you and appreciate all you have shared within the site. I am a 43 yr old Mom of 3 at high risk (Mother, Aunt, Cousin) for Breast Cancer. Screened closely since my early thirties (found multiple fibroidanomas over the years).. Late April found microcalicifications after routine mammogram.. had stereotactic biopsy which revealed (ALH) atypical lobular hyperplasia. \nWent to meet with surgeon today and was told we cannot proceed with MRI or surgery because my breast is one giant hematoma. She thinks they hit a vessel during biopsy (was a lot of bleeding after) She told me not to be concerned, that it is not cancer (I understand that) and we have to wait at least 2 months until the breast is healed.. I am so unhappy about\n the waiting. Just want this out and fast.\nMy biggest worry is that changes could be happening .. is this a realistic concern ?\nI was being screened every 6 months until last year.. she said Id been stable so long we could start doing every year instead. At that same visit I asked her opinion of taking estrogen to help with my migraines (so sick 1x a month) my gynecologist had been recommending for years but the thought of taking estrogen scared the hell out of me for fear of cancer.. my breast doctor said at a low dose nothing to worry about\n. So I started taking topical estrogen after that visit.. fast forward 1 year later.. Im freaking out.\nIs it normal to have such a hematoma after biopsy ? Is there anything I can do to speed the healing ? \nThank you in advance for your help .. deeply appreciated !\nHeather ",
