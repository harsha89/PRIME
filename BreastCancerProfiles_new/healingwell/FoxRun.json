As you can see from my bio(below), I have had experience with it in my treatment for prostate cancer, but that was because it was recommended by the Brachy ONCO doing my treatment. Anyway, I would also appreciate any information as well.\n \n ",

However, when she visited her oncologist she was pretty well in shock after receiving the news about\n her aggressive treatments for the next 5 years. I don't have all the details yet but I did hear some references to memory Cancer, H 2 protien , lobes , ducts and herceptin. \nCan anyone share similar experiences or point me in the right direction for some background information?
