      "Content": " Thanks for getting back to me. Unfortunately I have tried Arimedix and it actually was worse. The joint pain was extreme. I was on that for 6 months. I guess all these meds. are accumulative (like the chemo!) I guess I'll just wait until next month when I go to the Dr.\nThanks again.\nLinda ",
