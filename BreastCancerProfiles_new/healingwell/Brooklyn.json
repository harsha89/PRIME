      "Content": " Hello. I want to know something about\n port erosion. I didn't see a regular cancer site, so I decided to post my question here. My husband had Stage 3 colon cancer and was having pain on the side where the port was put in even though he hadn't had chemo treatments in about\n a year and a half. We just had it taken out last week and the doctor said it had eroded. Is that why he was hurting so much and feeling so bad? Has anyone else heard of this? Thank you. ",
