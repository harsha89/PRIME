      "Content": " Thank you all for you comments I had a diagnostic mammogram and a sonogram yesterday 08/27/14 the radiologist seems to think that it is just a cluster of cysts however he said he would do a biopsy if it would make me feel better instead of just coming back in 6 months for a follow up mammogram....I chose the biopsy I told him unless he could tell me with 100% for sure I would feel better if he would just do the biopsy to be sure...he said no problem so now I am waiting for my doctors office to get the cert...will know more after the biopsy...thank you all again I will continue to keep positive thoughts for all of us and prayers...good luck ",
