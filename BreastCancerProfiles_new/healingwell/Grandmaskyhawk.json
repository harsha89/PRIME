      "Content": " I got a mammogram and then was told I needed a recheck but could not get in for three weeks. I have had several rechecks but they have always been real quick. After 2 1/2 hours of mammograms and sonagram and the technicians asking the doctor questions, I was pretty sure it was cancer and now I am really mad that it took so long. I do think I will survive and am ready for the fight but this staph infection is kicking my behind. ",
