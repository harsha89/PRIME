Her name is Heidi! We have been friends most of our lives, so the thought of anything being seriously wrong with her is sad to me. But, I am not going to worry or let it bring me down for 2 reasons. One, there may not be anything to worry about\n. 2, if there is something God forbid wrong, I wanna be strong for her sake.\nThis board is making me stronger! The words I get with each reply make this feel a little easier. I get hope that possibly nothing is wrong. \nThank you everyone, and right now especially you BEV for helping me through this. I will keep you updated as things happen, and I may have more questions throughout the week, if she comes up with anything. I come here when she comes up with new questions or information! ",

I know this isn't happening directly to me, but it is still hurting and it's hard too. Am I being selfish? I hope not.\nHer pain is nearly excruitiating. It is super sore. And it is very uncomofotable. I check on her daily. I like to get updates of how she is doing. Aleve is tending to help some. Don't know if that makes her prognosis any better. \nAt any rate, I can't wait to get her to the doctor and to find out once and for all what the heck is going on in there.\nThank you to everyone who has answered, and to anyone who may give answers from here on out.\nTammy ",
