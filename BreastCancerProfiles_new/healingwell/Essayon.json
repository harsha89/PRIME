    "Content": " I realize this may be old read to some but for me it's upfront and worrisome.  I come to this forum with some experience.  I took my Mom to treatment for months leading to a radical mastectomy and chemo.   My wife, of 18 years, has had already one biopsy.   She heads to her immediate call back on the 31 st to the latter; mammogram, then U/S, then biopsy, so my question.  Are today's procedures more aggressive to ensure no issues versus genuine concern?   Appreciate the time and your comments.       ",
