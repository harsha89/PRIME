    "Content": " I've never heard of mammograms affecting fertility, although I agree; ask your Dr. I also wanted to let you know about\n another option in breast screening: Breast Thermography. It uses an infrared camera to take pictures of the breast tissue to determine areas of abnormal heat. Most breast cancer starts to form up to 10 years before a mass can be detected with traditional technology, and thermography can signal an advance warning. Many women are then able to make health or lifestyle changes that can redirect their breast health over time. Be sure to find a Board Certified Thermography Center to make sure that all the protocols of the scan are followed closely. \nTake care,\nRenuby ",
