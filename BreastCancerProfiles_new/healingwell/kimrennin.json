    "Content": " Cancer is a disease characterized by the uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to spread, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue through invasion, or by implantation into distant sites by metastasis (where cancer cells are transported through the bloodstream or lymphatic system).There are many risk factors for breast cancer i.e age, personal history, family history, certain breast changes, gene changes, menstrual cycle. Breast cancer having some stages in its spreading i.e- Stage 0 is characterised by non-invasive breast cancer. Stage 2(early stage)This stage describes invasive breast cancer The tumor measures up to two centimeters, and No lymph nodes are involved. In Stage3(early stage invasive)The tumor measures at least 2 cm, but not more than five cm.In stage 3 and 4 it can spread through lungs and brain as well ,so as soon as possible its necessary to treat the lump or tumour of breast cancer by Hormonal therapy, Chemotherapy or radiation therapy.HERCEPTIN, TYKERB, and AVASTIN drugs are available now a days for chemptherapy.
