      "Content": " I have already done the tamoxifen for the five years and still not close to menaupause. You can only take the other hormonal treatments post menaupause. So taking out my other ovary would put me into menaupause. Your body still makes some estrogen even without your ovaries, just not as much which is why they want all the post mp surviors to take the arimidex or femera. My side effects to the tamoxifen weren't too bad except for the mood swings and depression which I ended up going on an anti depressant for a while.\nEvery option has its pros and cons and I am just trying to weigh out my options. Thanks yo (senseless) ",
