    "Content": " Good luck to you. I really don't know how reliable/dependable they are, but when I had some breast pain early last year, the dr ordered a breast sonogram/ultrasound. Because I was only 31, and had never had anything like this done before, they decided to do a mammogram as well. I'm not sure what the ultrasound showed, but I would have to assume? that it verified the area of tissue they found in one of my breasts, during the mammogram. I went back in 6 months later, and did not have another ultrasound- only a mam.. This apparently verified that I just have lumpy breasts. LOL (already knew that anyway).\n \n ",
