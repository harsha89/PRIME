(Been there, done that, at the age of 33)\nIf you truly feel a lump, please consider finding a surgeon that will remove it . That is the ONLY sure way to know. \nMy tumor did not show up on my mammogram , also my OB/GYN did not feel it either. I KNEW that there was something different there and was persistent in having it removed. I made an appointment with a surgeon and had it biopsied. That was a smart move on my part, I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1985 and also had a recurrence two years after that in the sternum area. I feel so blessed to still be here and able to tell my story to help others. The most important thing that I can tell you is.............listen to your gut instinct. It will never fail you.\nBest of luck to you. Keep us informed, WE CARE!\nDebbie\n^j^ ^j^ ^j^\nPS.

He recommended taking Vitamin B6 and doing some hand exercises. Amazingly they did the trick. I still have some slight symptoms occasionally, but try to do the excercises and start taking the Vitamin B6 when it gets to bothering me and it really does help. My daughter was complaining a couple months ago of having symptoms of CTS and I told her about\n the B6 and exercises. She immediately went out and bought some B6 and by the end of a couple weeks she was feeling much much better even WITHOUT the exercises!!! It is worth a try if you are having any CT symptoms. Hope that this information helps those of you that are being bothered with CTS. \nHugs to all.\nDeb\n^j^ ^j^ ^j^\n \n \n ",

He knows that I collect angels .....how sweet, huh? Grandkids, aren't they great? Gotta love em.\nBev, the hot pink suede tool belt sounds so sexy. (LOL, I am getting a visual now! LOL) Joyce, so sorry to hear that you broke your foot, OUCH! That sounds so painful. Take care my friend! MK, your new house sounds wonderful. Enjoy every minute there and make many memories. (I was visualizing you cooking and baking in that huge kitchen......ahhhh, I am envious) Cathi, give that little kitten a nice pat from me, ok? She sounds so cute. Cindy, I was blessed with a new grandchild in July so this Christmas was extra special for us also. God Bless those little ones.\nI thought of all of my dear breast friends while celebrating Christmas day and hoped that all was well with each and every one of you and that you could enjoy the holiday to the fullest.\nHope all have a most prosperous and healthy NEW YEAR!\nSending hugs to all,\nDebbie\n^j^ ^j^ ^j^ \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Yes Gail, it was me. It has been alittle over 2 years since I had the surgery. I have to say that it took longer to recoup than I thought it would. Eventually things were better and I do feel like it was worth going thru. I am not saying however, that it worked miracles for me but I am without that constant pain that I was having before the surgery. Now, it just seems like the weather gets it kicked up and if I overdo, then I pay for it. However, if I behave myself and don't over work those back muscles things run pretty smoothly. I know what you mean about\n being scared............I was petrified to have it done. I did my homework though, and found a respected surgeon that has been around A LONG TIME! I still can't believe that they released me the day AFTER my surgery to ride home (which takes an hour from the hospital). \nI was off work for 3 months afterward...........but was happy for that because my daughter had my youngest grandchild during that time and I was able to spend some quality time with the both of them.............AHHHHHHH, what memories!\nI will say a prayer for you to find the right answer to your back problems. Make sure that you get a REALLY good surgeon and don't be afraid to ask him to give you names of patients that he has helped.\nHugs and Love,\nDebbie\n^j^ ^j^ ^j^\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " OK,\nYou gals are going to think I am totally NUTS............but.........has anyone ever read the column in the paper that Dr. Peter Gott writes? He is a syndicated columnist. He claims that putting a bar of soap (yes, you heard me right) between your sheets at the bottom of your bed, will keep you from getting leg cramps. This has actually helped lots of people...........no explanation as to WHY it works, just that it does for some people and not for others. Guess you just have to be crazy (or desperate) enough to give it a try and see if it works!\nSure hope that this helps some of you lovely ladies.ARTICLE \nFROM THE PEOPLE'S CORNER by Dr. Peter Gott MD\nDear Dr. Gott: This is in response to your asking for more results from putting a bar of soap under the bed sheets to stop leg cramps. I had been bothered with severe leg and feet cramps disrupting my sleep throughout the night. I was ready to try anything-so as silly as it sounded-when I read about\n the bar of soap in one of your columns, I tried it. It worked great! No cramps for a long time, then out of nowhere they came back, and I thought, OK, I knew that was too good to be true. But upon further investigation-I discovered that my bar of soap had fallen out from under the sheets and was on the floor. I immediately replaced it back under the sheets and have not been bothered with another cramp since. I am very careful to make sure it stays there, especially after changing the sheets. Like you and some of your readers, I can find no explanation for the wonderful results the soap bar gives. However, I am very curious as to why Dial or Dove soap bars cannot be used. Do you know why?\nDear Reader: Since the original publication of this novel approach to leg cramps, many readers have written me, indicating that they were relieved by Dial soap, but not with Dove. I have no explanation for this phenomenon. But, to be candidly frank, I have no idea about\n why the \"soap under the bottom sheet\" therapy may , in a high percentage of cases (judging from my mail), be successful in preventing nocturnal leg cramps. I have had several theories advanced, however. My favorite is that leg cramps are relieved by moving the legs and walking, so soap under the sheet leads to excercise because the soap is slippery and people have to move their legs at night to overcome this. I don't buy this conclusion but am keeping my skeptical eyes \nopen for the ANSWER.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Donna,\nI am the one that MK was referring to above. I was diagnosed at the age of 33 (20 years ago)- diagnosed on March 28th of 1985. My tumor was around 1 centimeter, no lymph nodes were involved at the time. At the time of my diagnosis they did not feel that I needed chemo or radiation (remember, this was 20 yrs ago) - just a modified radical mastectomy. Well, about\n a year and a half after that I started having problems with aches and pain in my upper back. For months I went from doctor to doctor trying to get an answer to my symptoms. I was treated for everything from arthritis to pulled muscles, and this went on for about\n 9 months. I finally decided to go to the Cleveland Clinic with my xrays (which were taken locally) and get another opinion. (by this time I had a pretty good sized lump on my sternum and could hardly click on my own seat belt in the car or get up from the couch by myself) The doctor I went to took one look at those xrays and asked me \"if ANYONE had read these in my hometown\". By the sound of his voice I knew that he HAD seen SOMETHING in those xrays that the local doctors had overlooked all of those months. He told me that I needed a biopsy and needed one soon. I had the biopsy and found out that I had a recurrence in my sternum.(this was now Dec. of 1988). (explaining the pain in my back, it was referring from the front of my body to my back) . I was then given 6 months of chemo and 33 treatments of radiation.\nIt has now been over 17 years since that diagnosis and I am going strong and living life feeling so blessed to have been given these extra years of life, knowing what it feels like to see both of my daughters married and being a grandma of 3.(something I am so very thankful and grateful for). I feel that there is some reason that the good Lord has kept me here on this earth..........if for nothing else, but to give others like you a reason to give it \"ALL YOU GOT\" to fight this disease. \nKeep a positive attitude and you are going to beat this thing for the second time sweetie. If you have any questions feel free to ask, you have found a wonderful place to come and get the kind of support that you need during this hard time for you.\nHugs and HANG IN THERE!!!!!!!!!!!!! \nDebbie (from OHIO)\n^j^ ^j^ ^j^\n \n \n ",

I myself had breast cancer in 1985 (at the age of 33), I had a modified radical and was told that my lymph nodes were clean too so I wasn't given radiation or chemo. Two years later I had a recurrence in my sternum. My radiologist told me that HAD I had some radiation done to that area with my original DX that I probably would have not gotten the recurrence in that area. I guess that I am just paranoid about no rads or chemo and just surgery because of my own history. But I think that we should do everything we can to prevent \"it\" from coming back again. \nHopefully I do not scare anyone that reads this.

It won't be long now.......just look how far you have come already. \nMaybe you will feel like asking the onc. on Monday. Give yourself a break from all of this over the weekend and just enjoy being with family.\nHugs and Love,\nDebbie\n^j^ ^j^\n \n \n ",

You asked about problems with radiation. 20 years ago I had a mastectomy, no rads-no chemo....and two years later had a recurrence in my sternum. At that time I had 6 months of chemo and 33 treatments of rads, the worst thing that happened with my rads was I have a scar where they did burn me. By hey, if that is the worst thing to have happened and I am still here after 18 years.........then what the heck for a little burn mark. Actually, it is just some red scarring.......not the normal look of a \"burn\" where the skin is all wrinkled and swollen. If I had to do it again, I would do it in a heartbeat because I feel that it gave me the opportunity to see my 2 daughters raised and graduate, marry and have children. I have been blessed.\nBest of luck to you.......I will be watching the board to see how your MRI turned out.\nSending hugs to help get you thru the coming days,\nDebbie\n^j^ ^j^ ^j^ \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Dear Luci,\nSorry to hear that the cystoscopy was uncomfortable for you. (and I had told you it wouldn't be that bad, SORRY) Actually, maybe it has something to do with the doctor who performs the procedure. Like I said, my urologist was so great about trying to talk and keep my mind off of it and put me at ease. \nI was curious as to what medication your doctor has ordered for you. I have taken a maintenance antibiotic now for a few years and I was just to him the other day and he wants me to continue with it (not sure when and IF I will ever be able to be off of it either) . I am taking 1 tablet of Methenamine Mandelate every day along with a vitamin C tablet. Have to take the vitamin C because there is something in the Methenamine that breaks down the vitamin C in your body. \nI think I would consider finding another urologist in NV, since this sounds like it is going to be an ongoing thing for you. Especially since you do not have a whole lot of faith in the one that you have been seeing. It might ease your mind at any rate, as with BC, half the battle is having faith in your doctor. \nHugs,\nDebbie\n \n \n ",

I took CMF, not sure what you will be taking, but could the doctor maybe be wrong with this? You might just be one of the lucky ones too! HMMMMMM, but after all of the straight hair turning to curly stories, maybe I am the unlucky one that I DID NOT lose my hair. I have had thin stick straight hair all of my life. I think I could take a cruise on the money I have invested in perms throughout my lifetime! \nBest of luck to you....the gals previously have given you some great advice. \nHugs,\nDebbie\n^j^ ^j^\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " This board never ceases to amaze me. I also, find out things by coming here that I wouldn't know otherwise.\nLuci, I too have had bladder problems for probably 5 years. I have taken a maintenance antibiotic for years because of some blood in the urine that they can't really explain why I am having. I had the cystoscopy and it really wasn't that bad, and believe me........I WAS SCARED TOO DEATH to have it done.   My urologist was so nice and kept talking to me during the procedure. Actually, was kind of interesting to see what the inside of my bladder looked like. He had the screen positioned so that I could view it too. There was the usual CT scans of the bladder and kidneys to rule out stones or anything else.  There has never been any mention of chemo (i took cytoxan too) maybe being the culprit after all of these years, but now I am really wondering about it.\nThanks girls, for being so information. \nLuci, good luck to you on Feb.1. You will do just fine.\nHugs,\nDeb \n \n \n ",
