She was dia. in Dec of 2002 the week of Christmas and they gave her 7-9 months ..Well, she beat those odds..\nOn 7-29-2007 at 11:08 pm the angels came to take her home.. She too wears Pink Wings .I dont know anything about\n the diease except it is very painful .. Our Connie was a fighter ...It finally got the best of her she fought for almost 5 yrs.\nMy hugs go to each and everyone of you who are having to deal with this ungratful monster that is in your body and I prayer with all my heart that you all survive so you may live a life without the pain and you have happiness.\n sincerely Angel ",

      "Content": " Thank You MK and Eveie\nI will keep you all in my prayers/thoughts.\nMy husband and I live almost 3 hours from Connie so it was hard to be a support to her. It really didnt help that we were not told how bad it really was.So the impact of this hit hard. Please if you have this Cancer or any other kind be honest with your loved ones and let them know the seriousness of it . Do everything you can to prepared them for what may be.As I have been finding out there is more research and new drugs coming out all the time and hopefully this Monster called \"Cancer\" will meet it's match and there will be an end real soon.\nBest Wishes to all of you.
