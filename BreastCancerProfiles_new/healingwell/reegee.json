      "Content": " I had a double mastectomy and reconstruction. The reconstruction went bad and I needed a tram on one side with a small implant and the other side just an implant. If I could do it all again I would chose a tram for each side but the reconstruction does not look the way I thought, I didnt expect to still see the scars but they are both across the breasts and it bothers me. I dont show them to my own husband. But I had radiation and I have implants so Id look around and I look at it this way at least I dont have to stuff a bra or hide my chest. It looks like I have something good but when I look at them I want to cry,..\nGood luck to all ",

      "Content": " I have cancer in my sternum also in my ribs and bones. I have it in my both hips 2 places in the back I have a rod in my left leg due to a fractured femur due to the cancer, and the cancer is below my left knee. Also I got this bone cancer from breast cancer that I got in 2004 now its 2008 and Im battling this all over again and its worse. Im in constant pain. And its severe. If I run out of pain meds , I have convulsions all night from withdrawel and it gets so bad I bought my pain meds out of pocket costing me 320 dollars. I go to chemo every week Im starting to lose my hair again its patchy and thin. Im only 40 with 3 kids and 3 dogs and a husband and Im so sick of being this way. I lay in bed all day and just hope to get through the day. Its not really living.\nI had a double mastectomy with reconstruction, I also have a stent in my chest from all the veins collapsing from radiation. Ive had tons of radiation. Its over now but Im sure not forever. I will have chemo until the end of the year and I hate it but my last petscan said I was in remission. I want to stop the chemo but the dr said I need it until Dec or Jan and then he will take me off and scan me again to see if Im still in remission. Im so scared I want this to be over so badly. I cant take the chemo. I hate it so much. So now all i can concentrate on is staying pain free.. thats the hardest thing for me to deal with I dont have a backup of meds to have the extra so my fear of running out is so bad I cannot run out. Oh well Im sure some people are going through the same thing I just wondered what other people do to remain pain free..Good luck to everyone ",
