    "Content": " I went in for a 2nd mammogram yesterday and an ultrasound. Everything was fine, it was just something with the compression of the breast tissue that looked different from last year. I'm 46 and have been getting mammograms since age 40 but this was my first call back. I was fortunate enough to have been able to get my appointment within a week of the phone call but it was still 5 days of stress and worry. I think it is impossible not to worry and imagine the worst. I still feel stressed from worrying so much. It did help me to read everyone's stories, so I just thought I'd post another positive report for a call back. ",
