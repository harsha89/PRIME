    "Content": " Hi guys! \nMy name is Lucy Lai and I'm a high school senior. I'm conducting a study on stress and coping in people with chronic disease. The interest in this topic stemmed from the fact that I live with systemic lupus erythematosus. Since my illness has had such a big impact on my life, I developed a research plan to survey others with chronic illness to measure their levels of stress due to disease and determine if there was any trend in coping. Your input will help me compile information on the lifestyles of those who suffer from chronic disease. If at any time, you wish to stop taking the survey, you may do so. No names or personal information are recorded and all data will be available only me and will be destroyed at the end of the study. This survey takes approximately 7-10 minutes to complete.\nPlease see the link to the survey!\nhttps://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HdOc41uH9RgRBaj38Fe7K6nmuhumzMr0n1eCrqq2fM0/viewform\nThanks so much for your help! It means the world to me \n-Lucy\ndiagnosed at 16...\nI have received permission from Peter Waite, the moderator, to post this! ",
