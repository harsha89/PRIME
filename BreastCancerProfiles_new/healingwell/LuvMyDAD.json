I swear I have experienced first hand malpractice and I learned from everything in my experience that you have to be your own advocate because no one cares about\n you more then YOU. Seek answers. If you have a lump/lymph node make sure you figure out what it is, even go to a hometown breast surgeon who can give you more personalized care (sometimes the reputable places are just factories and only concern themselves with very rare cases to advance their research)...\nTry not to worry abotu the radiation I got hung up on that stuff too months ago, but there is nothing you can do... all you can do to try to offset it to some degree is eat well, limit alcohol and try to exercise.

      "Content": " Good Morning Everyone,\n4 months ago I had an ultrasound on a lump which turned out to be a fibroidadenoma. First ever ultrasound on my breast I am 34 years old. I had to go for a follow up to make sure it didn't grow, I made the appointment before the 6 month mark just to relieve my anxiety about\n the whole thing. The ultrasound tech but the probe only on the spot near the fibroiadenoma and although that lump remained the same, I had another growth a 1.2cm nodule. Long story short after sleepless nights and reading up all about\n breast cancer and pregnancy (I am 21 weeks pregnant) I had a biopsy and thankgod it was benign but the diagnosis was PASH.\nI am so scared, I know its benign but everything I read online says it should be removed and I got the old follow up in 6 months. Also what scares me too is that she literally put the probe on a PART OF MY BREAST and found this then imagine what she would have found had she scanned my entire breast. I begged the surgeon to write me a script\n for a bilateral breast ultrasound but she said she doesnt want to \nopen a can of worms?? and its not for screening! I don't know what to do now and I cant find anything to relieve my anxiety, thoughts? ",

The doctor told me to come back in 6 months for a follow up ultrasound just to determine stability. I am 5 months pregnant now and I went back today (4 months later) for the follow up ultrasound and the doctor told me that the tiny fibroid has not changed in size but that my breast has changed so much (its like a new breast) and I have clusters of masses that he can't tell if its hormonal from the pregnancy or something else so he wants to do another biopsy of the entire area. I am really worried this could be BC. Could it be possible in 4 months that cancer can proliferate like this?\nAlso I have had three doctors check my breasts every single month during pregnancy and no one found anything particularly worrisome in my breast.

I went to a breast surgeon (hoping to get it biopsied) she agreed to do it for me, and then (after the second sonographer found it on imaging) the breast surgeon with her own machine could not find it. I am now scheduled to have an ultrasound guided biopsy done by a radiologist (I guess he is the most skilled to find the lump), so hopefully I will get this sorted out. ",
