    "Content": " As with many others who list here, I got called back for a diagnostic mammogram. Of course, the receptionist who called could not tell me anything (which royally ticks me off); I had to get the report from my PCP. The report said \"An asymmetry found on right breast on MLO view only. There is no evidence of malignancy in the left breast.\"\nI got the call back on May 6 with an appointment on May 19 and have been Googling this and finding mixed messages. Plus, since they noted that there was no malignancy on the left breast does that mean that there was one on the right? If yes, why would they make me wait so long.\nHas any one had a similar report? It's been such a long wait and has affected me so bad.\nthank you. ",
