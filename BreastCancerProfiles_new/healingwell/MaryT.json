    "Content": " Thank you. thank you. thank you dear friends for all your prayers  and and many cards,,,,,,, They have helped me get to where I am today. After 69 days in the hospital they certainly helped. Right now I am at a rehab facility learning to walk and take care of myself all over again.                   There is a computer here for patients to use so I will be able to check in once awhile. I hope every thing is going well with you, my dear friends...............Love&hugs, MaryT                                            ",
