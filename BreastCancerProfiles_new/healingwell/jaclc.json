      "Content": " tigerfan, how are you? I hope all benign and you are well.\nWith my clustered microcalcifications, I removed all the calcification area (all the few dots) usingreotactic vacuum-assisted percutaneous breast biopsy with the Mammotome device as recommended. Histology of the mommotomy cores was reported low grade nuclear grade, micropapillary and cribiform carcinoma in situ..\nHi, \nBecause of my family history of breast cancer on my father's side. 2 aunties (father's sisters) and 3 cousins (children of other sisters) and because I have very lumpy breast, I have mammograms done every 18months - 2 years since 1 was 41 years old. I am now 48.\nI had nipple discharge in May 2005. Operation was done in June 2005 in Singapore to remove the benign intraductal papilloma of 6mm. \nUltrasound was reocommended as follow-up in 6 months but I decided to have it done in October 2005.Ultrasound showed a lesion of 6mm by 5mm. Mammogram showed nothing.My this doctor (in Malaysia) and his radiologist believed that this is the same lesion found earlier on.Intepreted to be benign. Follow-up ultrasound and mammogram in )October 2005 found lesion of now 4mm by 6mm to be stable. I went for ultrasound again in february 2006. The lesion has disappeared,where the region is a few microcalcifications noted and architectural distorion. I was recommended to do a biopsy on that left upper quadrant of my left breast.\nI then had a mammotome biopsy done by another breast surgeon in Singapore in May 2006.I was diagnosed with DCIS on my left breast, upper left outer quadrant. Was recommended to do 6 weeks of radiation followed by 5 years of tamoxifen. As I have read on all the side effects of the drug and since am a born worrier esp. with my string of family history, I decided to have a mastectomy done I had the left mastectomy with two sentinel nodes removed same month in Australia. \nMy doctor ran into my hospital room with the histology report the next day and said I made the right decision to remove my left breast. Report shows that there were 3 lesions on all four quadrants of my left breast. Not seen on ultrasound nor mammogram. One lesion in the inner upper quadrant, one lower outer quadrant and the third lesion in the lower inner quadrant. The first lesion was 10x20x50mm@nd lesion measures 15x10x10mm. The 3rd lesion in the lower inner quadrant measures 15x14x10mm. DCIS lies over 10mm from all resection margins.DCIS's nuclear grade intermediate, architecture cribiform and comedo necrosis present.No evidence of metastatic malignancy in the two lymph nodes.\nBoth progesterone and estrogen receptor at 90% strong.\nI went back to remove my right breast in June 2007. Dread those mammograms and ultrasounds!! Didn't want to worry anymore. Histology report on the right breast is lobular hyperplasia, columnar cell change and focal sclerosing adenosis. Benign tissues.\nIt is almost a year now. I have been on holistic nutrition and I feel healthier than ever. I am now with breast cancer support group in my region, I am most happy to be of help to others.\n ",

      "Content": " \nThat was about\n same as mine. Did they just remove the calcifications? Did you have a course of radiation? With mine, I was recommended to remove the area followed by 6 wks of radiation. I opted for mastectomy and the pathology report of the breast removed that there were actually 3 lesions over 4 quadrants of my breast that was not seen on mammogram nor ultrasound. \nClose monitoring as they always tell us. I wish you well and happiness. ",
