    "Content": " I was diagnosed with a radial scar at 31 years old, had a lumpectomy. Went for my 6 month check up in July and my tests came out clean, but my doctor sat down with my husband and I and said that I have very fibrotic(sorry on spelling) breast tissue, and with menses early and some other risk factors. My aunt just got done with dealing with breast cancer stage 1. She feels I should have a bilat mastectomy. At first I was shocked, but at the time I was thinking if my breast tissue/cells are changing already, and I'm the type of person that dwells on something till I've done it or it consumes me. I'm going to have it done. I did get the whopping $3000 testing done and I was negative;) I have to say I am a double A cup and my lumpectomy threw my nipple has left me with a very deformed breast- half is prob gone already and I'm self conscious about\n it. I don't know if I'm okay with having surgery for fear of breast cancer or self conscious issue or both. I'm mourning breast feeding, feeling in my breasts, change.... I'm scheduled in 3 weeks to have it done and wondering if anyone on here has heard of this. I did get a second opinion and the doctor said basically the same recommendation. I would love to hear thoughts, anyone that has gone threw a preventative mastectomy, or anything anyone knows about\n radial scars. I know there rare, so I feel that shouldn't we be worried? Thanks so much!!! ",
