      "Content": " Hi,\nI finished my cancer treatment in May of 2006. I began taking Arimidex in June. At first I was fine. My energy was good and I felt like me! After about\n a month, I noticed some neck and back pain. I also feel tired and a little depressed. I have always been very active and am having trouble running and workingout. Is there someting I can take to combat these side effects or another drug I could opt for? Neannie \n ",
