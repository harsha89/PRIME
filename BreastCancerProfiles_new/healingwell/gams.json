      "Content": " We just found out about\n three weeks ago my wife hase IDC right breast,and they just found more abnormal tissue on the second Mri biopsy left breast non-invasive, so they want to do another, I know they want to give the surgon the best information possible but it seems they should have taken the biopsy then ,were waiting to hear if she has to do another ,that will be 3 in 3 weeks, kind of hard on us, I hope insurance is ok with this.We are in the waiting period till we see surgon and oncologist for a plan of attack.I am a PC cancer surviver and I know how much this forum helped me thru mine.My wife just isn't in to the tech age as I am so here I am asking for support for my parter for 42 years. It is so good to see how supportive the whole Sally Jobe centers have been with us thru this up till now! When I found out I had PC 3 YEARS AGO i had to find forums like this on my own for support ,the urology center I was going to offered very little . I'm not complaining just really glad BC has so much support because I fell the next year or so we will need it. Thanks in advance!\nGams ",
