    "Content": " I know you are worried but at your age there are so many things going on in your body. You are still growing, still changing. All the hormones are trying to get things under control and this will go on for a few more years. I am not a doctor either but I definitely agree with Merrida. There are so many things going on in your body and sometimes they don't seem normal but it usually works out okay in the end. Of course if this is causing you to have anxiety or miss school etc. then I would get checked out for your own piece of mind. I really don't think you have anything to worry about\n though. ",
