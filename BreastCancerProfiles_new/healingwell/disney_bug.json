    "Content": " hi my mum (66) has just been diagnosed with a medullary grade 3 , apparently 6mm.She has had the lump removed and was told non malignant and lymps are clear.She had to see the professor yesterday(11.11.11) and might need chemo and radiation.It is quite confusing being told it is clear and small but agressive. Any advice? ",
