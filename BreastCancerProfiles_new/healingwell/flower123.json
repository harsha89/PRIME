      "Content": " Hi hon. I would tell your doctor everything you have said here. Doctors are here for us to talk to, and they should listen, and address all (not some) of your concerns. You should feel satisfied that all of your questions were appropriately addressed when you leave the office. If you're not comfortable with your doctor, you can always get a second opinion. \nI think that it's great though that there was nothing that was suspicious for malignancy on your mammogram. That's wonderful! Please though--tell your doctor about\n the lump on your collarbone. It's better to have peace of mind, than to stress and worry. ",
