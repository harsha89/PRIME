    "Content": " I had a callback from my recent mammogram too. I have always had dense breast tissue and cysts so I usually end up having an ultrasound and all is well. I just went for the callback u/s today and the radiologist explained that cysts show up as white spots on a mammogram and so they have to check them out and see if they are cysts or solid tumors. That made me feel better. As long as I have cystic breasts, I will probably get callbacks. They're scary though. ",
