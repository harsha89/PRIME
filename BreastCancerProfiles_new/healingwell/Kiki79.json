      "Content": " I am new to this forum. I am a little concerned about\n my symptoms. I have been experiencing a burning sensation on the side and outer upper area of my breast. It is tender and a shooting pain near my nipple. It burns when I touch my breast. If my breast are not burning if I palplate my breast they start to burn. My breast in not red unless I touch it. It has been this way since Dec. 25 of 2016. It start with burning on the side of breast than the upper outer. It literally fills like fire. I also have started to fill burning from my right breast the same way but only the upper outer part of my breast. I have a small firm lump near the are wear the burning sensation is and I have a medium size moveable lump until that arm. My right breast just started to have a burning sensation 3 days ago. No fun. I am scheduled to get a diagnostic mammogram in 2 weeks. I don't know what to think. I would appreciate any input. Thanks.\n ",

The lump I have is very small so it's a chance that it may be something else. The burning sensation is the most bothersome. I also have a shooting pain at times. I praying that your staph infection clears up soon and never reruns again. God bless you. ",

      "Content": " Thanks for the reply. I had a mammogram and ultrasound. The mammogram tech and ultrasound tech could feel the lump but couldn't detect it. My report stated that I had scattered fibrograndular tissue. I have an appointment on 2/10 for breast exam and to discuss the results. I started a new pain pill that help with the burning sensation. Still uncomfortable when palpated. The lump is underneath the breast tissue. ",
