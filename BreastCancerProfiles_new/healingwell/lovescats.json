    "Content": " In the last month I have also been diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. I WILL NOT GIVE UP!!!!! My first sign was actually in my back, a week later the mass. I have a dear friend who has been fighting this for 15 years and I plan on doing the same thing. I know it will be rough but my life is worth it. Good luck to all of us. With the love of the Lord, my family and friends I will fight this and continue to live. I hate what I am doing to my husband of 26 years. This is tearing him up. ",
