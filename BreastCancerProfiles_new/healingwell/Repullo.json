      "Content": " Hello! I am new to this site. I need some help. I got some red spots on my arm with lymphedema and I don't know how it started. Saw my primary doctor yesterday and requested some lab work done. Also saw my oncologist and requested an ultrasound done on the arm. The red spots started about\n 5 days ago and it is spreading up to my armpit. And it looks like measles to me. I will be traveling to Alaska on the 21st and I want to know if this is a big problem. Was diagnosed with cancer in 2007, went through mastectomy, chemo, radiation and a year on Herceptin. Three years later, in April of 2010, cancer came back and metastasized to liver and lungs. Was in chemo for one year, and last April. CT scan of pelvis, chest and abdomen showed no tumor. So doctor stop chemo treatment and now on Herceptin for maintenance. ",

      "Content": " The red spots slowly disappeared and as of today, my arm is back to normal. My lab work showed no infection and I haven't gotten the result yet for my ultrasound which was just done this afternoon. I am thinking whether my applying lotion on the\narm with a little pressure did it. The thing is my arm was not warm with the red spots. The ultrasound was requested to rule out blood clot. Will keep you posted once I get the result. \nThanks, Bev ",
