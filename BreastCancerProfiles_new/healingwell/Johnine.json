    "Content": " Hi I also have red spots and redness all over my lymphoedema arm. Going to GP tonight. This has been a regular occurrence since April last year. This time is the worst it has been and my arm is painful too (at the elbow). I can't lift anything and tried to vacuum but it's too sore. I'm going to a dermatologist next week. ",
