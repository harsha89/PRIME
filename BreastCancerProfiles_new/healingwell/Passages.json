      "Content": " Posting on this site too. Just had a friend starting Taxol and is already getting side effects of aching. In other suggestions welcome.\nHas anyone done this - taking Claritan before chemo and/or Neulasta - heard about\n it, tried it, know anything about\n it...?\nWe received this information from a nurse who had been battling breast cancer, than later from one of my husband's chemo nurses near the end of his Taxotere infusions. Also came up with another breast cancer fighter at a talk at the Wellness Center; however, the chemo nurse talking had not heard of it. He has been using it with the Jevtana (Cabazitaxel). His flu like aches have been diminished greatly to near zero.\nSome of you well connected to experts might know more, but it's more in the palliative care area; which technically what all this journey is for us now.\nHusband dx 49 PSA 4 full prostectemy, 1996\n5+ years later radiation,\nStudy promenade PSA rise.\n 7+ years later started Lupron\n9/12 pathological arm break, bone metastasis, tumors. Study For Custersen. Control on Taxotere 9 treatments until 4/12 PSA 5.2. \nZytiga -no se but PSA up to 57 - 5/12 to 7/12\nJevtana 8/12 now 3 treatments PSA 42. Se minimal fatigue, chemo brain.
