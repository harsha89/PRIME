    "Content": " Ok...not really freaking out yet, but kinda sorta am. I had my mammogram done a couple of weeks ago. I got a letter in the mail stating I needed further testing. I called my physicians office to schedule the \"further testing\". I had to ask what was found on the mammogram report. The nurse indicated that they found a 'nodule' in my upper right breast. I then had to ask how big it was. (she wasn't giv'in up much information freely) She indicated it was 6mm and my physician would like another mammogram to see more views of that area. Ok...I then started to get upset. I had seen 2 previous OB-GYN docs that when I told them I was having right breast pain and could feel a lump...they blew me off and said it was probably a cyst. The pain/lump doesn't come and go with cycles because I have had a hysterectomy. So now this third doctor is wanting further testing? Because now I am at the age (40) that I am more prone to having breast cancer? Don't get me wrong...I am happy that she is investigating this more and is listening to me. But I won't relax until I have had a biopsy done...am I wrong to push for this? I don't have any family history because I am adapoted...I just want to be sure.\n \n ",
