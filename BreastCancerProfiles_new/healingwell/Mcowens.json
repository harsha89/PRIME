    "Content": " I'm not sure I'm doing this right, but I too have questions about\n whether the side effects from tamoxifen are worth it.\nDiagnosed with IDC stage I. No nodes. Feel truly blessed to have caught it so early. For me, breast cancer was never an \"if\", but a when. I was raised on cautionary tales of our family of women; many of whom have died of breast cancer.I have been pretty diligent and when I felt pain and a lump I knew it was my turn. And I've received so much advice and wisdom from my family of survivors...incredibly lucky.\nThankfully I needed no chemo or radiation. I elected to have a double mastectomy on 9/24/12 and have been very pleased. I work in health care and was committed to the most aggressive treatment with the least impact to my life. The double mastectomy with simultaneous reconstruction represented a two week recovery and I was off and running. I was fortunate to qualify for nipple and skin sparing mastectomies, so after just one reconstructive procedure, the girls look pretty good. Never expected to have this good of a result.\nNow, tamoxifen. I am a professional woman, a mothet and a wife of a gym owner. I have to get up every day and perform, deliver and produce. I love my job and I want to contribute to the success of my company and my team. I find myself after 6 months on tamoxifen wanting to sleep the day away. I cant remember what Im suppose to accomplish and i feel like I'm failing. The 20 Lb weight gain is a constant source of shame. And the constipation is hideous. Strangely enough, the hot flashes are constant, but those I can deal with! A good Spanish fan and layers work just fine. I tried to discuss this with my oncologist and she prescribes \"weight watchers\" and laxatives. And an antidepressant. \nSisters, we need to find a better way to deal with this. I dont know what it is, but we have to figure it out. My oncotype DX score was a 13% chance of recurrence without tamoxifen and an 8% chance with. I am willing to fight the symptoms for a 5% better chance of meeting my grandchildren and keeping my husband company in our old age. ",
