    "Content": " I strongly urge you to see your doctor. That's the only way to know for sure. Do you still go for follow ups with your breast surgeon? I'm two years NED and I just saw my breast surgeon on Monday for a lump that turned out to be scar tissue + a little fluid buildup. I had a feeling that was what it was, even though I haven't had that lump before a few months ago, but I went to see her because I knew she could tell me. She could feel it, and she did a quick ultrasound to be sure, and my concerns were alleviated.\nDo yourself a favor. See the expert and get those questions answered. ",
