      "Content": " Hello, trying to see if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms. about\n a month ago, I started having infrequent slight burning sensations in my right breast. The best way I can describe it is like the milk letdown reflex when breastfeeding. I called and scheduled my yearly mammogram for soonest available and it was normal. So ignored it, it got worse and more frequent, now it is a hot painful flooding feeling like a hot faucet is running inside my breast almost constantly. Doctor visit last week, she thought it was either imaginary, hormonal or nerve related but no follow ups done due to normal mammogram. It is driving me crazy! No noticeable swelling or redness and it feels cool to the touch. I do have what looks like goose flesh/bumps when I get cold but it is constant on that breast. Just weird, and kind of worried. Only other weird thing is my appetite is completely gone and have to force myself to eat anything at all. Could stand to lose a few so that's not concerning to me but thought it worth a mention! ",
