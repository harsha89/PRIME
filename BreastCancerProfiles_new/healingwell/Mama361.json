    "Content": " Hello,\nWell this is my first time on here, but i seriously need advice. For the past few years i have struggled with right breast pain and at times mainly a burning sensation. The pain usually is the right breast area and sometimes up and around the shoulder. Now I do have a lump on my right breast that was diagnosed as a fibrocystic cyst. My doctor suggests to lay off the coffee, tea, and chocolate, even though my mother of 48 at the time, was dx with breast cancer and underwent a left mastectomy, he felt no cause for concern. There has been a few times I have had a pain in my nipple and when i went to touch it i felt a small pimple like lump that was very painful. My first reaction was to squeeze, and when i did i felt a pop and blood with pus secreted out. I have mentioned this as well but he said if it happened again let him know. I cant ger over what i feel and am very worried. I am 27 and my doctor says I am too young to wory a\nbout this..any suggestions?.. ",
