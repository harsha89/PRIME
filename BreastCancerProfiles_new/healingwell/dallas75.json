      "Content": " Hi there. I am 36 yrs old. I had a core biopsy this morning on two palpable lumps that could be seen on mammo and ultrasound. One is 2cm and the other is 5mm. the radiologist said he is worried. My question is...how many times are the results benign when the radiologist is 'worried'? ",

      "Content": " Thanks for your reply. I should have the results this friday or monday. I was really scared but these forums are great...gaining knowledge is easing my mind. These two lumps are close together and close to the surface at 3 o'clock. They are firm but movable...and painful...also a 'dent' in the skin above them. I have prepared for the worst and researched lots. So many brave women on this forum...if i get bad news i will take what i have learned on here and be as tough as i can. ",
