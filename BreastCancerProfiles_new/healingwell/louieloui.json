It's how I found a pea-sized lump that actually led to the doctor finding a grape-sized lump. So far tests have come back as benign however I am still debating on removing it. \nDeb posted some great info. You get all kinds of lumps and bumps especially around your period. It can make it harder to know what's \"okay\" and what's \"not\" so anytime you feel a lump that does not go away after your cycle ends (if it's around that time) or w/in a certain # of days, I would have the doc feel it just to be sure. Of course, if you're not comfortable waiting and your gut says \"get it checked out now\" then do that.\nFBD can be uncomfortable and difficult so just stay on top of things.\n~Laura~ ",

It's such a personal thing and I think that so long as you do what feels right to you, that's all that matters. I have no idea how I will handle it if it comes back as positive. Probably not that shocked, really. For so long I have figured that I will get cancer one day in some form. At least if it comes back positive for the gene I'll (hopefully) have more diligent testing.

Well, 2 1/2 hrs. went by, it was after 5 p.m., and I thought 1.) the results weren't ready yet and I'd have to wait another day, or 2.) it was bad news and the doctor would have to tell me. So when I got a call from my doctor I prepared myself for the worst...however it was benign! Just a fibroadenoma. The radiologist felt he got a very good sample representation, too. My doc said she'd re-u/s me in 4 mos. to see if it has changed at all. I am soooo relieved!! \nI want to thank you all again for your support and patience! I will continue to check in every now and then to see how you are all doing. My thoughts and prayers are w/you guys. ((Big Hugs))\n~Laura~ ",

However, I finally put two and two together tonight (the extreme fatigue, sore breasts, grumpiness). So that makes me wonder if that's why I had a lot of cysts in my breasts at today's u/s. It just seems like the radiologist, who did my last u/s, would've pointed out any other cysts had she seen them. Instead she took pics of the one that looked \"noteworthy\" and seemed content w/that.\nThe doc I saw today had a plaque on the wall that had to do w/breast surgery. However, I looked up his credentials through the clinics website and it didn't mention anything about breast cancer/surgery, so hard to say. He did know my family history (including my maternal grandfather who passed from colon cancer). \nAs for a breast cancer center, none that I know of. Is there a list somewhere? My family doc is the one that ordered the mammo (that the rad cancelled) and the u/s, then sent me to the surgeon, so she's up to date w/the situation.\nI guess I was just ready for the aspiration and a more definitive answer than \"looks benign to me.\" I'm sure it's nothing more than a cyst, I just want to know.

See below:\nMy aunt told me not to wait the 6 mos. and/or to get a second opinion. She was diagnosed at 35. Her doctor felt the lump during a routine exam--she didn't know it was there. He ordered a mammo and u/s. Everyone thought it was \"just a cyst.\" She, being neurotic (her words, not mine) literally went across the street and had a biopsy done after she had been told to \"wait 6 mos. and we'll re-check you.\" Even the doc doing her biopsy said, \"It's too gritty to be cancer.\" Well, guess what...it was metastatic cancer. She had a double mastectomy and (thankfully) it had not yet spread to her lymph nodes. She did not have to undergo chemo or radiation, but was put on Tamoxifen for 5 yrs. Knock on wood, she's been clean for 5 yrs. since (total of 10 yrs.). \nMy grandma had Lymphoma...not breast cancer. But regardless, my aunt did and it's in my family tree now. My aunt was upset that the doctor hadn't gone ahead w/the biopsy anyways. \nI have a call into my family doctor to let her know what happened yesterday and also to tell her that they thought my aunt had a cyst as well. My aunt strongly believes that had she not been pushy, the cancer would've spread to her lymph nodes and beyond (though not sure where it metastized the first time--I didn't think to ask her). I'm glad I talked to her--I am fired up now! lol ",

Then I explained how I was PMS'ing and her mood changed. lol We agreed that it was quite possible the extra cysts were due to hormones. I told her to change my family history for my grandma and then explained what happened to my aunt (her words...\"oooh...not good.\"). Both of us thought that re-u/s'ing me sooner than later was best for everyone's peace of mind. She said 1-2 mos. I said 1-2 wks. :o) Doc said that was reasonable. I told her that if the large cyst is still there at the next u/s, I want it biopsied just to have a definitive answer. She seemed cool w/that. My spirits are much lighter now! I can wait 2 wks., but I'm not waiting 6 mos. \nTavish, I wondered that too (about the metastatic and what my aunt said). She did mention she had a hysterectomy (which I didn't know about) so maybe that's where it showed up at?? I know they left 1 ovary w/her. Next time I talk to her I'll find out as I'd like to know too, as I'm sure my doctor would as well. Does seem strange that the lymph nodes weren't affected, though. I talked to my dad (he's a nurse, though not dealing w/cancer) and he said that while it's good my grandma didn't have BC, the lymphoma isn't so hot either.
