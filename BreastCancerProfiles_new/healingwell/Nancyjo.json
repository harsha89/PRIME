I want to thank you and would love to keep in touch with everyone and be part of the PCE. I do believe I did see a couple of pink feathers floating around in the operating room. Thank you all again Hugs Nancyjo ",

      "Content": " thanks ladies, just wondering... \nWhen you have a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery do they do it all at once, same day etc. ? Still trying to make up my mind on mas or lumpectomy. Guess we need to see what shows up on the Pet Scan on Thursday. Do many ladies have problems with the radiation treatment? Yesterday someone told me that there sister had radiation and it damaged her lung, and she wish she would have had the mastectomy. So here I am and my dear reliable site and asking my new friends.... Thanks again to all of you for your wonderful support, I can't tell you have glad I am that I found you. Hugs Nancyjo ",
