      "Content": " I'm scheduled for surgery on the 4th I was scheduled for the 14th but it was cancelled because of not being off my medications long enough and the doctor going on vacation. I just saw him yesterday and he said within 48 hrs it should be well on it's way to healing and I could shower and go swimming if I want. It's the guided wire that has to be done first that has me worried not the surgery itself. I expect to go back to work the next day. Other than that I'm as blind as you are with what to expect. Best of luck to you and try not to worry. \nGail ",

      "Content": " Hi Tina, I see you answered my post on update of surgical biopsy so you see how far something can go and it still turns out to be nothing. When I had my first mammogram at your age (I'm 55)  a very small spot showed up, one to small to even biopsy. I was called back for more views and told to go back in 6 mos. Fourteen years later that spot is still there.  It's good to know your radiologist is on the ball and picked up something that might have gone unnoticed by another. With the new digital mammograms they pick up everything and that's a good thing. Please try to calm down and remember most things turn out to benign or disappear. I found out today that's very common.  Also, my DIL does mammograms and 20 might be done in one day with 3/4's turning out to be call backs. Out of all those 1 or 2 might  be problem. It all depends on whose reading your slides. She works with one radiologist whose so unsure of himself he calls back just about\n everyone so another radiologist can take a look. Please let us know how it turns out for you.            ",

      "Content": " I am scheduled for a surgical biopsy on July 14th and don't know what to expect. Seems like everyone I know that has had a problem had the needle aspiration. I was told it would bleed to much so I have to have surgery.  Is there much pain afterword? Can you wear a bra or is there a certain kind/type I should wear? How many days off from work would I need? I was told I could go back the next day but I sure don't want to go back braless. I feel like I pulled the short end of the straw since I don't know anyone that has had this done so I don't know what to expect. On July 23rd my husband is having the seeds done for prostate cancer we found out he had last month. When it rains it pours around here. Thank you for your help ladies. ",
