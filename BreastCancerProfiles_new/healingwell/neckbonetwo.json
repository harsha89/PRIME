    "Content": " I discovered a lump in my breast in February. I went to the doctor. Upon examining it and performing an ultrasound in her office she said that she felt that it was a cyst. She also said that she would not be able to drain the cyst. At that time the cyst was only painful at times. Therefore, I decided to leave the cyst alone and wait and see. Well, the cyst has grown much larger (double in size / to about\n 3 inches wide) and is much more painful. Upon having my mammogram and ultrasound the radiologist concluded that it is not a simple cyst. She also mentioned that there were echos there. I am scheduled to have the mass removed August 8th. \nI would appreciate any information that anyone can share on the subject matter. I am trying to stay as positive and optimistic as possible. But it's hard especially when the initial diagnosis was incorrect. ",
