    "Content": " Hello, I'm new to the forum....well I woke up this morning and for the first time ever I felt pain in my left breast, which prompted me to do a breast exam and I immediately noticed a difference. I felt a large mass and in the middle of the large mass is a smaller lump - neither of which will move. I've had a mammogram before and they would always come back with a mass on the right side - negative though. But, this is frightening - even though cancer doesn't run in my family. So, I am about\n to send my MD a message through the portal so that she can get me an appointment to have an X-ray STAT. I have so many emotions going through me right now that I feel like I'm losing it. When I felt it - I told my husband...and he very matter-of-factly said just go to the doctor and find out - you don't know...that doesn't help what I'm feeling and thinking. ",
