      "Content": " Thanks for the replies. I guess I should just count my blessings huh. \nWell I had the port removed yesterday. They once again had trouble accessing it, and had to use fluroscope to get it accessed. Once they got in, he said there was too much scar tissue, causing it to be hard to access and get blood return. The procedure was aweful b/c of having to cut through all the scar tissue and I was wide awake the whole time. \nThey say it shouldn't hurt at all, but I was in so much pain I had to take off work. He made the incision about\n 1/2 inch longer, and its all jaged and ugly. At least I won't have to worry about\n it anymore after I heal.\nI wish you all the best.\nAng\nDX-Migraines:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
