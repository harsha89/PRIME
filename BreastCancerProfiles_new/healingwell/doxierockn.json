    "Content": " \n  ok, first time to use any forum.  so bear with me. lol   I have had a ongoing breast cyst since 2004 that has continued to grow.  I have a maternal history of breast cancer in the family- work in the medical field, and try to stay on top of this issue.  Each year after ultrasound I have been told it is a simple cyst-follow up in one year.  Each time I questioned- even though it is growing- no need to worry?  and was told not unless something else came up.  \n \n ",
