    "Content": " mmckay......I had the same diagnosis as you this time last year. Terrified me! The dr can not really tell you today what treatments you will need. They can only tell you what treatments you may need. They have to do the lumpectomy and then run test on the tissues removed. They also need to check the lymphnodes. What I was told was that the results of all of these test are what determine the treatments. I was stage 1, cancer contained to the breast, no nodes affected. The test that they performed on the lump showed an estrogen fed cancer, not very aggressive. These reults removed chemo from the table and I only need radiation. But again, this was not able to be determined until after my surgery. I am now on tamoxifen for 5 years. I wish you well. Ask many questions, if possible have someone with you for all of this to absorb what you are not able to retain. Your surgery, physically, will be ok. Really, it is not a bad recovery. It is the before, the after, the waiting that mentally drains us. Again, I wish you well. ",
