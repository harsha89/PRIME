    "Content": " My sister just passed of breast cancer. She was cured almost 6 years ago and this past March they found it in her lungs and told her it was breast cancer cells. Next 2 months went by and she didn't feel well and begged the doctor for a petscan. It showed 7 large tumors in her brain and numerous small ones. she went through all her 14 radiations and was finished on Thursday. On friday she felt great. Saturday (I let her move in with me.) I couldn't wake her long enough for her to get up. On sunday she started called her husband george washington so I called an ambulance. she had a urinary tract infection that went through the blood into her brain. 1 week in the hospital and 18 days in hospice where she died peacefully. My baby sister. I love her and miss her so much. We were together everyday.\nJazzie ",
