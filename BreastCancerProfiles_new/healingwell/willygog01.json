    "Content": " Hi Lucky girl, just signed up on to this website a few mins ago. Yours is the first post I have read on here. \nGood luck with your treatment and hope you recover very quickly. Good user name for you. I went to doctors yesterday afternoon with a lump in my right breast, which doctor says is attached to my breast bone and waiting for appointment to come back in next two weeks at the hospital to investigate it. Will stay on top of your threads and once again good luck to you. \nLiz ",
