      "Content": " Bev, good to \"see\" you. Been a few years. Sorry to hear about\n your DH. Hope he does better each day. \nI am fine....NED for 11+years. Fibromyalgia does its everlasting best to run my life. But am actually doing better than have done since dx. For that I am grateful. I credit that to neurofeedback, which retaught my brain how to relax. \nWe have 5 grandchildren, youngest of 3.5 months old. So fun to have baby around again. We go to Yuma Az every winter...love that heat in Jan through March. We stay same place every year and in our motorhome. Have made lots of new relationships. When I get a chance, I will look through archives and see who all is around. Saw Gail(postal2)...but we've not met.\nLove and hugs to all Marge ",

      "Content": " MK, I am SO sorry for all the losses and hurt you have had to endure in last few years. Carolyn sounds like such a fighter. Your belated service for Chuck sounds beautiful. What a wonderful way to celebrate his life. We should all be so lucky. I, too, remember Cherilynn and all their trips. Her husband gave me a bad time in St. Louis because the NE cornhuskers got whipped by Oklahoma the Sat. we were there. I keep a group picture from St Louis on my craft desk. Like Bev said, too many from that group are gone. And I doubt that I know how many. Sometimes I feel guilty because I'm still NED. \nI had forgotten about\n all the health problems Bev's husband has.\nHugs and smiles to you, MK\nMarge ",
