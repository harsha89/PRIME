Try not be be worried and be glad that the Doctor is not ignoring any possibilities.

They removed the polyp but margins are still pre-cancerous. He will have a follow up colonoscopy in May. If the area has changed then he will need to have surgery to completely remove the section. \nMy Mothers bout with B/C has resolved and she is feeling well. \nMy daughter is facing a possible dx of MS. She has been ill for a few months and we couldn't get anything dx'd. We finally found a Doctor that listened to her. He order a MRI of her brain because of suspected MS and they found 5 white spots and he has had to refer her to a neurologist. She is afraid, of course, but hanging in there. MY DH and I and other family are trying to keep her strong and patient. I started posting on the MS board and they are just as supportive as all of you have been during my time with B/C. I really love all of you my friends. \nI know the Lord doesn't give us more than we can handle. I am counting on that as I really feel defeated at times. \nLove you and here's a big ((((((((((((((((((((((((((((HUG)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))) FOR ALL OF YOU,\nCandy\n \n ",

Getting her to go outside is a real trip.  She is a 45 pound mutt that is so dainty about\n getting her paws wet.  So......I have to pick her up and practically throw her outside.  She looks at me like \n crazy.  My DGD turned \"7\" today and was glad to be off school and home with Mom and little sister and eventually Daddy.  My DH went to work (he was suppose to fly to Chicago) and see if there was anyway he could resurrect a cancelled flight. Well, he couldn't and I am overjoyed that he cannot sprout wings and fly on his own!!!  He told everyone to go home from work.  Some did and some didn't.  He didn't until the freezing rain had been falling for about\n an hour.  He said getting home was a piece of cake!! (Of course the roads were pretty empty of traffic. But.....they did leave all the insane people on the streets. Yikes!!!)\n \n \n \n \n ",

Do not be afraid to ask the doc questions, as many as you need to. A tape recorder and a supporter with you is an excellent idea as Lori and others told you. My DH went with me and we used the tape recorder that my DD gave me. The doctor was very \nopen to letting me record the visit and he gave me as much time as I needed to ask questions. I had a long list of them after I did as much research as I could before meeting him again. Remember you are your best supporter-Knowledge is power!!!\nPlease stay with us and keep us updated. Blessings to you and your family,\nCandy\n \n ",

Thankfully that has subsided and I am now in a hurry to make appointments next month for mammo and surgeon visit that will be a month late. Talk about\n extremes. \nQuit picking!!!!! Some of my family pick at everything and sometimes it just makes it worse!! I get so aggravated with them. Not that I am perfect, as I would have pulled the silly drains myself if the doc hadn't agreed to do it a little sooner than appropriate. \nI hope you enjoy your Thanksgiving company.

Mammo with ultrasound then needle aspiration and then finally the lumpectomy that made everything certain. I am not sure how size fits in as I know mine was not large, but had been very fast growing due to the type of cancer. I had a phyllodes tumor. They should know the type after the lumpectomy path report returns. Some people only have a lumpectomy but I know that the size of the tumor may dictate if a lumpectomy will take a large portion of the breast. That may not be recommended for you. My type of cancer dictated a simple mastectomy. Each of us is different. Make sure to research, ask as many questions as you can of all medical personnel you come in contact with and if you have someone that is or will be supporting you and be with you DO. Ask for copies of your path reports. They are yours and you should have them. Ask the Doctor to explain the report completly. Take a tape recorder with you to tape your conversations. Be proactive. This is your fight. Fight hard and remember the more you know the more calm and active you will be in your treatment and healing.\nStick with us. We are here 24/7 and someone on the board will be able to help you. We want to help. The women here are the best.

I love taking care of her (and now her little sister) and the timing was great. She was walking and could pretty much ambulate on her own.\nDeb has a wonderful idea and I hope you call a lymphodema therapist. Everyone is different in what their particular treatment is needed or what we are cautioned against. But.....so are the doctors different and there are some very definite treatments and cautions for certain situations. It amazes me how different medical care can be from patient to patient, to geographical area, specialists, hospitals etc. The list can go on and on. During my journey through BC I find myself going directly to the specialist. The one that handles a particular concern 24/7. Hope you make the call. Good Luck in going back to work. \nThoughts and hugs are with you,\nCandy \n \n ",

      "Content": " Teresa: I had nipple reconstruction just last March 4th.  Just to prepare you, the first look see was shocking.  My DH and I both thought we would toss the old cookies.  It is very large and swollen.  It may have a large black scab on the end that will make you think you are looking at dead tissue.  But, be patient, it does reduce in size and the scab does fall off and the end of the nipple looks textured just like a normal nipple.  I had skin graph and I will not have a tatoo.  It took about a month and a half before I could stop dressing the site.  Also, use Vit. E liquid around the site to keep the skin soft.  It didn't hurt as I was under because they had to replace the first permanent implant at the same time.  The nipple always is protruding, as of course the normal breast does not. It also hasn't settled yet and both nipples are lopsided and not the same size.  I am not sure if that will change. Right now the P/S is telling me that it is as good as it will get.  He has discharged me and I will not have to see him for a year or two.  They only had so much tissue to work with, but I do fill a bra cup, sort of, and I do have cleavage again.  They always say that hindsight is 20/20, so I will say that I would not have the nipple reconstruction done.   BUT, that is me.  At this point in the journey I would not choose reconstruction at all.  I wanted to be able to look at myself and not see CANCER, but the reconstruction did not accomplish that for me.  I know I had CANCER and that knowledge will never go away.  I will always look different.  The old breasts are gone or changed and nothing will every bring that back.  But, it doesn't matter, it is not important, I am alive. It is different for each and every one of us.  You will make the right decision for YOU.

Coming over the crest right after the start line you could see thousands of people, filling an entire downtown street for as far as the eye could see.   The Columbus Dispatch said there were 26,000+ people in the race.   Big people, little people, young people, old people, thin people, chubby people...and people of all nationalities and color. Dogs, strollers, wheelchairs, walkers and canes. Bands, balloons, onlookers and cheerleaders along the side of the road are sprinkled all through the walk.       Big steps, little steps, fast pace, snail pace, a little rain and sometimes more rain\u2026did not impede any in the race.   Smiling faces, laughing, people walking and dancing as they passed by one of the bands.   You could see the traditional white shirts of the race and many creative, colorful shirts from various organizational sponsors.   One that caught my eye was a brown shirt, with pink silhouettes pf people walking in the shape of the \u201cPink Ribbon\u201d for breast cancer\u2026it was very cool.   One the back of the shirts was a sheet of paper with our race numbers safety pinned as our ticket to run.   Another sheet also pinned was pink\u2026on these sheets of paper were the names in memory of people who have lost the battle with breast cancer and passed, and also names for celebration of those who are fighting the battle now or who are survivors. Some included pictures.   One company: Too, Inc. had an 8 x 11 pink page full of names.     As you walked behind someone, and as you read their \u2018sheets\u201d,   you got a small glimpse of pain, sorrow, joy and victory.    Some had several names on their sheets in memory of Grandma and Mom, and celebration of aunts, sisters, and daughters\u2026..Several generations of the same family.   I counted the names on the sheet of one woman; there were 6 in one family crossing over four generations.   I cried when I saw that one.     There was another prominent color of shirts\u2026they were a light pink.   As you looked over the crowd you saw hundreds of them.   The women wearing them are the ones fighting the battle and the survivors of this insidious disease.   Many of them also wore pink hats.   I will tell you; this disease has no shame, is not picky and strikes women of all ages and color.   I saw one fairly elderly woman, walking with the help of a friend\u2026.one breast clearly gone.   Another, very young woman waling with her husband and small child, hair gone, covered by a pink hat.   Another, whose hair was gone, had a young adolescent son, whose head was shaved, holding his mother\u2019s hand, unashamedly for the entire race.   I cried when I saw all of them.   There were many, many, just like these\u2026and you had a sense of oneness, camaraderie, and victory.   These women were the ones laughing, smiling, waving, dancing, and encouraging others to press on.     There were some on podiums with microphones and as you walked by you could hear parts of their stories and the thankfulness they felt for all of us who were participating in the race.   Their faces beaming with joy and hope.   This disease may invade, maim and sometimes kill the body, but it was clear by these brave women and their family and friends, that it will not destroy the soul, spirit or the fight.      On my back was a pink slip of celebration of my sister Candy, who is a survivor. (She was in the 1 mile fun race with her grandchildren and family.)   I could have added several friends that have lost the battle.    On the back of Sam Williams shirt, was a memory of her Mom, who she lost in high school after a 4 ½ year battle with the disease.   We walked with one in a pink shirt, a survivor\u2026and all of her adult children.   She told me part of her story as we walked.   It is the same story my sister shares with others.   It is a story of hope, solidarity and victory.     It is an experience I will never forget, and it will not stop this year.   I will walk every year as long as God gives me the ability to do so. I will encourage everyone I know to do the same.   Crystal     Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart, and the pleasantness of one's friend springs from his earnest counsel. Proverbs 27:9 ",

He advised that it would take about 6 months before it was completely healed. I also had to have the permanent implant exhanged and that needs to settle down some too. All in all it was a very easy procedure all by itself. I did have a problem with being put under though. Too many liquids were given during surgery and I suffered some mild congestive heart failure and had to stay in the hospital 2.5 days more than planned. It was suppose to be an in and out, but my lungs didn't want to cooperate. But that is all behind me now and I am doing fine. You would do great. But take your time making the decision. There is no hurry. Sorry about your scare and so sorry about your DH's reaction. He is a dear man and loves you very much. My heart hurts for the men when they feel helpless. Tell him my DH and I can't wait to see some more roundhouses with you both.

Oh, thanks for the pink feather!!!  It actually floated towards me when I opened the envelope.  From its constraints, to me with the help God's breath.  So just to catch up with all of you, I say Hello, tell you that my 5yr old DGD is without a doubt the sweetest little girl I know, tell you that my 6 month old DGD is to impatient to learn to crawl and just rolls everywhere, and let you know that my DH and I just celebrated out 35 wedding anniversary.  Who would have thought?  I see my P/S tomorrow, my nipple reconstruction is not healing well, and I am a little concerned but glad I am seeing him.  I know I worry too much and he will set me at ease.  But if some of you would like to be with me, I would be very grateful.

      "Content": " Well, for goodness sake!!!! When the choice was given to me during reconstruction decision time all the facts were given to me. Never once did I read where there was any type of guarantee about life of an implant. There has never been any proof that silicone leakage caused all the immune deficiency diseases that women thought they caused. Saline and silicone implants can break at any time. Most last for many years, and because of studies being done the manufacturing of implants, especially silicone, has been better and quality standards have been raised. Right now I have a silicone implant and I am enrolled in a study through Mentor. That is the only way someone can have silicone, through breast reconstruction and study committment. I feel confident that I made a good choice and I will constantly be monitored for several years because of the implant. My p/s is confident of the implants, the manufacturer and feels that silicone was the best decision in my type of reconstruction. Too bad the FDA hasn't demanded the long time studies be done for all the drugs and medical treatments they approved and now have to demand be taken from the market. Many more people have been hurt and have suffered because of these less studied treatments. OK, I am off my soapbox now. I just want to say to all of you that are considering reconstruction to listen to your doctor and make informed choices.

LOL, I love pj days.  Our plans are to watch several episodes of the third season of 24.  Love that show.  As always thank you all and know that you are in my thoughts and prayers daily.

Yesterday after the 48 hours from surgery when I could shower was my first glance at surgery results.  Yikes!!  I thought DH and I were going to toss our cookies.  The stiching had come undone and this dying piece of skin was black and had a open slit that was seeping blood.  The doctors office just called and told me that on Thursday during my follow-up appt. that I would probably be surprised at what the doc tells me.!!!?????  Not sure what that means.  So ladies, not that bad, but I do not want to \"go under\" again for a long time if ever.

As far as your Mother goes, unfortunately she needs help. Mine does and I need to ask my sisters to help more often. One sister does and one sister has decided she can stay on the edge of it all. I was talking to my priest the other day about my Mom concern and he lovingly told me to share with them more often. So I realize I cannot do it all and I am trying to share responsibilities with the \"sisters\". I have a lot of my own issues and trying to better my health. It is OK to just concentrate on yourself. Get all things in order and start feeling better. You can only continue to help others if you are helping yourself. It is not selfish, it is reality.

So thankful that all of your scans are clear.  I will pray that your barrel fills again (yours too Jo-Ann).  They are not so empty as you feel right now.  Otherwise you would not be able to be in the board.  Much love and many hugs to you, Candy Many Blessings for the New Year     Life may not be the party  we hoped for, but while we are here we might as well dance.       ",

We are suppose to continue through tomorrow afternoon with a total of about 10 inches depending on whom you listen. Some say we could have a total of 20 inches. What will be will be!!! And of course the snowblower wouldn't start, so my DD and I shoveled the driveway and walk about a 1/2 hr ago and you cannot even tell we did it. My DH will have to redo it this evening, if he wants. I'm done, my knees are yelling at me and I still have baking, wrapping, and finishing work on homemade gifts. I hope it clears up enough to be able to go to Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. First Christmas with our new little girl. Both the girls are making it so much fun. Prayers being said for the board for blessings to us all during the holidays and the new year.

I am B-9 chanting and will be through Monday.  I will be there in spirit holding the hand Gail doesn't have a hold of.  I will pray for you asking for peace and strength.  Like Gail inferred KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.  The knowledge is right there, start with the nurse.  It will help erase your fears.  Truly it will. I know where I stand with my B/C, but my diabetes is another issue all on its own.  I know that the diabetes will probably take me faster than the breast cancer and the doc gives me lots of time if I keep my sugar levels down, so remember we all have many things going on in our bodies, not just the beast and we all eventually come to grips with all the juggling we must do.  You are already on the right juggling path.  Hang in there.

Just be sure to ask questions and record answers.  Research as much as you can.  Knowledge is power.   You are in control.  I will pray for good decisions and good results.

The more you know about B/C, treatments, and surgery as it pertains to YOU the less fear you will have. I personally know this is true. There are several types of B/C and the process is different with all of them, but one thing is for sure we all come out the other end of it and we have survived. I only had a simple mast. choice. I had my right breast removed and had reconstruction started at the same time. That was in August of 2003. The reconstruction is not finished but next spring I should be done. It isn't perfect, but the decision was a good one for me. Another thought: for me the diagnosis of cancer actually turned into a blessing. It brought my family, friends and new friends together to help me fight this. It brought me closer to my faith. Prayer for me was soothing and calming. Do not ever hold things in. Share your fears, thoughts and joys with others when you can and let them share theirs. And, of course, we are always here. You can say things to us that you cannot to others that are close to you. We will hold your hand, wait with you, pray with and for you and we have a wealth of knowledge here in these lovely women that guide you. Hang in there.

Buy her a little trinket, send her cards and the best of all let her know you love her and do not be afraid to talk with her about her feelings and fears, and joys, as you share all those things with her. Be normal Amy is still the same person. I always used to say that I was not \"C\" for cancer but \"C\" for Candy. Also you could share this board with her.
