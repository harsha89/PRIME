      "Content": " Hi! I read posts on here from time to time because my mother is being treated for breast cancer right now. I just wanted to say that I had a similar scare this past January...right at the same time my mom was diagnosed! Plus I just had gotten finished with surgery for my UC. I went for a biopsy with a breast specialist and it turned out to be a calcification with normal cells. I know what you mean about\n the waiting...it's awful...but most likely you will have nothing to worry about\n. \nBest wishes!\nMarianne\nDX UC - in 2005 when I was 37\nTried every drug-even Remicade-nothing worked\nStep 1: J-pouch surgery (Laparoscopic restorative proctocolectomy w/ temporary diverting loop ileostomy)6-25-10\nStep 2: Take down surgery (Ileostomy reversal)10/8/10\nVery pleased with my results ",
