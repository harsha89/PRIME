    "Content": " Hi TuckeredToo,\nI was just diagnosed with the renal version of nutcracker syndrome. I would be interested in comparing notes with you. What, if any, treatment are you getting for it? Was the blood thinner related to the nutcracker? I am not taking any drugs right now as I tend to react poorly to nearly everything. I have bouts of unexplained tachycardia that may or may not be related, but they seem consistent with autonomic dysfunction. ",
