    "Content": " I am 14 days away from finishing the Tamoxifen and have just one question for everyone who has been here:\nDo you loose the weight when you stop taking the Tamoxifen?\nI have gained a total of 50 pounds through my 5 year, 7 month ordeal - picked up 20 from Chemo within the 1st 2 months - without eating and then another 30 more slowly along the way. I have tried dieting, working out, went so far as to try boot camp - considering how I trip over my own feet now - this was a mistake. Please tell me the doctor is telling the truth and I should drop 15 pounds rather quickly.\nThanks\nJoann ",
