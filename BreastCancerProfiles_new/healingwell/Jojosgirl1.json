    "Content": " I been reading the posts and found members to be compassionate & very helpful. \nMy mom is a post menopause breast cancer survivor. Early detection gave her the fortunate position to have mastectomy with no chemo or radiation. No lymph nodes were affected. She did take tamoxifen for five years. \nI am 50 yrs old with history of pretty much normal mammo results. Dense breasts. I recently lost 115 lbs after gastric bypass surgery. Most recent digital mammo on 10/19 showed cluster of microcalcifications. I was called back for additional images including magnified views done 10/21. Radiologist recommended stereotactic biopsy and scheduled immediately had it on 10/22. Bi-RADS 4B. I have appt with gyn next week 10/28 to get biopsy results. \nThe wait is pretty much unbearable. I'm short tempered & I find I cannot focus on anything. \nI may be jumping the gun but does anyone know if I might be able to have bilateral mastectomy even if this may only effect my right breast?
