There are several hormonal therapies available, my onc told me that if femara should quit working for me (knock on wood, I've been doing wonderfully on femara for almost 3 years now!) we would most likely try the other hormonal therapy options before thinking about\n doing chemotherapy again (lung, bone mets here). I try not to think of the 'what ifs' for now, just very thankful for wonderful drugs like femara. Good luck to sis! ",

Not sure what caused the aches and pains to begin with but they're gone now and don't know why. Hopefully the aches and pains will just eventually go away for your sister. Femara is a wonderful drug, it really does work well. ",

If they can't directly help, they can put you in touch with CancerCare or some other organization who may be able to help you out with some of your treatment bills. Ask for legal assistance too if necessary, they are there to help. Please make a few phone calls or speak with a social worker and see if you can get some assistance. I think too that you might want to explain your situation to your onc, doctors really don't know what goes on with their patients' billing, I would sure think and hope he would be understanding, I know my onc would be. Another thought, if you are getting chemo at your onc's office, it might be better to get it at a hospital or cancer center instead, they are usually more professional and better able to deal with these types of billing issues. Take a deep breath, get a good night's sleep and keep fighting, it's stupid, aggravating, insulting, stressful bs, but it's necessary sometimes unfortunately. Good luck!\n ",

It lasts a little while, maybe about\n a month per hair, it's a continual battle. I usually dab with alcohol after to help prevent redness. Never tried electrolysis, it apparently works on my friends who have but I notice it seems to cause little acne like scars, nothing aweful, but noticeable in the sunlight. It can be a little expensive, too bad we can't a prescript\nion from our oncs and have our insurance cover it, this problem is often a result of our meds. Hair removing creams from the drugstore never work and seem to always cause rashes. When I do shave in between plucking, I have learned to go for the big buck razors with a moisture strip, never use a store brand razor, no disposables and never a single blade. Good luck, I'd love to hear from others of better solutions!   ",

You can probably have it removed when you're done with a/c if you choose, even if you're scheduled for a different chemo like taxol next, most other chemos don't usually cause the leaking damage that a/c can cause, check with your onc. Drink lots of water and start taking your antinausea meds right away after infusion whether you think you need to or not, you don't want to wait and see if you get nauseaus or not, it's much easier to prevent the nausea than try to control it once it starts. The hair loss was the worst side effect for me, other than that I honestly breezed through it, everyone's different. Good luck! ",

The one thing that can help is a good nights sleep on a comfortable bed by yourself, no husbands, boyfriends, friends, family, dogs or cats. It's worth it to invest in a feather bed cover, memory foam or egg carton pad or something like that with your favorite pillows. An electric blanket in the winter may help too. The aches and pains were worse for me for about\n the first 6 months after I started femara, every day was a vicodin day, it's gotten better but has not gone away and doubt it ever will.

      "Content": " Hi Jen\nYes, the lupron needle is big but just don't look at it and imagine it's small, one of those mind game tricks we have to play, it helps. In my personal experience with lupron, the needle pinch really all depends on how talented the needle giver is, with a talented needle giver I promise you'll barely even know you were poked, with a less talented needle giver you may feel the pinch a bit more. If you go to a cancer center with many nurses, seek out the best needle giver, it'll make a huge difference. Lupron kind of has a texture like metamucil or some other powdery drink like that and needs to be kept being stirred up as the needle is given, that's why it may feel like the nurse is digging around a bit when the needle is inserted. But as I mentioned, with a talented needle giver, you'll barely even feel it if you even feel it at all. ",

I then took my cat to the vet, he just wasn't himself, very lethargic and feverish, sure enough he was diagnosed with Lyme disease and is taking the same kind of antibiotics that I am taking! Taking antibiotics asap after a tick bite can rid your chances of getting the disease, if not treated or dx'd, it can be a nasty disease that can get worse in time. I'd absolutely mention your tick bite to your onc, get an rx for antibiotics, better safe than sorry I think. Deer ticks are very tiny and black, and easier to yank off the skin than a dog tick for example. Good luck and let us know how you make out! ",

Many people who have Lyme are co-infected, so it is important to be tested.' With my cat being tested, I learned 'bartonella' is aka 'cat scratch fever', I guess ticks can transmit that too.
