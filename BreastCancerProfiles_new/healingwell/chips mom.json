      "Content": " Yes that would be very helpful if we could discuss these things via email.  I'm not sure how to respond directly to your message.  I'm new to this forum.  Tried clicking on the small envelope, but it didn't do anything.  Sounds like you've got some good pain management control.  I wear an ace bandage wrapped tightly around my chest at all times.  That seems to help the pain.  I'd like to hear about\n your prosthetic bra too.  It sounds like a compression one might help me as well.  ",

      "Content": " \n  Now that Julie has mentioned this compression bra does anyone else out there use one for post mastectomy pain?  I didn't have reconstructive surgery but still wrap an ace around my chest daily as it seems to help the pain.  I actually can't go for long without being wrapped up.  Meaning I can't sleep at night without an ace on and can only go minutes out of the shower without putting it on.  I was wondering if the compression bra for a flatsie like me might be similar to the ace bandage that is a pain to wrap around every day.  ",

      "Content": " \n  I was wondering if anyone has heard of this syndrome? I had a bilateral mastectomy in March 2008 with no reconstruction.  I've had constant pain ever since.  It feels like someone is reaching through my back with their fists pulling as hard as they can on my chest skin.  I had no idea it would be hurting this much.  I've tried acupuncture and massage with no relief.  The prosthetic bra is painful to wear too.  I guess I had no idea this was coming.  They did manage pain control the first week very well.  You are kind of in shock.  Boy is this pain depressing.  Not sure it will ever go away after twenty months.  The only thing that gives me moderate relief is white flower oil.  ",
