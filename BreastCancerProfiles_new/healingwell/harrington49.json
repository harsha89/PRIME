      "Content": " Hi DSB\nI can imagine how worried and concerned you must be right now, I think I would probably be thinking along the same lines if I also had family history like you do. But I think you will have a tough time finding a surgeon who will do a double mastectomy, I could be wrong of course but I think it is a big ask.\nThe only thing you can do is plead your case to the surgeon and see what he says, I think you should be guided by his advice. I hope whichever way it turns out, that you are happy and well at the end result. I wish you all the luck in the world and that God will look after you and guide you during this most testing and worrying time for you.\nGod bless.\n ",

I recently had terrible pain in my right breast on and off for about\n 3 weeks and I had an ultrasound and it was clear, nothing to worry about\n. I was concerned because I have already had a mastectory on my left side so you can imagine how relieved I was when I got the results of the ultrasound. So I am urging you to go and have it checked out. \nGood luck I hope you get the same result I did.\n ",

Good on you for being fanatical (although I don't think you are), where your health is concerned, if you're not fanatical about\n it then no-one else is either.\nPersonally, I was one of the lucky ones who did not need radiation or chemo afterwards as my cancer had not travelled but the lump had been in my breast for 6 years so I was told, however they did take my lymph nodes under the arm but like I said I am one of the more lucky ones and I thank God everyday for that. On Thursday this week, I am going for my 10 year examination - I can hardly believe it has been that long as I still remember the day the doctor found it.\nI hope you stay well Alcie and keep being fanatical.\nKind regards\nJocelyn\n ",

In 2000 I had a lump, had the biopsy and it was cancerous, I had a left mammogram but did not need to have radiation or chemo because they had got all of the residual cancer and also took the lymph nodes under the arm. The surgeon told me the lump had been there for 6 years but luckily for me it had not travelled. I have not had any further problems and have just reached my 10 year anniversay.\nI wish your mother all the best and I agree with her not to make her mind up yet and don't be bullied into it.

I know it is very concerning and worrying to be sent to the surgeon but it doesn't mean the worst. He will explain what they have found in laymans terms so you understand, and ask him as many questions as you can. It is a good idea to write down some questions before you go because when you get in there, if you are anything like me you will forget everything that was in your head.\nTry not to worry too much, my thoughts and prayers are with you. After the surgeon's visit make sure you post to let us know how you got on. I'll be thinking of you. \n ",
