      "Content": " Hi Newbie,\n Well, I just had implants inserted one week ago today and the breast with a cyst (had an ultrasound which confirmed it was benign) has been giving me fits. That breast was really swollen and still hurts. The other breast is just fine. I had dual plane surgery where half the implant is above the muscle and the other below the muscle. My PS never mentioned removing the cyst, which at this point seems like it would have been a 'great' idea. I will not be able to live with this pain much longer. Have a call into PS to see what his experience has been with cysts. Just hoping that the chocolate I've been consuming is the culprit. If not, will give it another week to subside and then maybe have the cyst aspirated. Giving up chocolate, which is my only vice, will not be taken lightly.\n Also, when I exercise my arms I usually get pain in the breast with the cyst. I am laying off any exercise for a month due to the implant surgery but am not looking forward to 10X the pain upon resuming my workouts. Will keep you posted on what my PS says. ",

      "Content": " I am so happy to hear you had it aspirated. I am wondering if mine was so small that they didn't think it needed doing.?? I had the ultrasound a week prior to the surgery. However, then I did start to satiate myself with dark chocolate and some caffeine. Since I am 62, the fibroids haven't been much of an issue as in years past and especially before menopause.\nMy PS said to take it easy on the left breast while doing massage and that 'there is always one breast that is more painful'. I see him again in two weeks. \nThank you so much for your input re: we are not alone... Best of luck to you! ",
