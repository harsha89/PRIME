      "Content": " I am going tovthe Breasted center on Monday and I am very nervous. The first thing they are going to do is acultrasound. A year ago my left nipple became inverted but mammogram. Was fine. Now this year my left nipple is inverted both are fully inverted and I tried to get them out but no luck. I just had another mammogram. May 16 th again results were normal. Then when I seen my Doctor I asked her should the mammon be normal if both my nipples are inverted? The reason I had the mammon was because theywere inverted. She said no itcshouldn't have been and blurted out you might have cancer. She was real upset because so many test results at this perticular hospital have been wrong for about\n two years now. I am trying to stay positive but both my grandmothers lost both their breasts to cancer. My question is has anyone had this problem? And whatceere the reason for it? Thanks for listening. I am 51 years old and I am very scared.\nBIPOLAR II\nANXETY\nINSOMNIA\nCOPD\nOSTEOPEROSIS\nDISK DISEASE\nKIENBOCK'S DISEASE ",
