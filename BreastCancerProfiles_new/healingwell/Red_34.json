      "Content": " I have fibrocystic breasts and I have already had one large one aspirated. I went in for a mammogram and an ultrasound and found out that my breasts are riddled with cysts. I have done some research on the internet about\n this and I found out that no these cysts do not turn cancerous however if in the event you develop a cancerous lump, it can be harder to find with self examination and mammograms. Ultrasounds can determine if the lump is solid or fluid filled such as a cyst. According to what I have read online is that if you have a family history of breast cancer that you may need to go in for more frequent testing. Since cysts are fluid filled, they should move easily under your fingers. If the lump is more solid then that can indicate something else that should be addressed by your doctor.\nMy cyst literally developed within 3 days. It went from pea size to a golf ball size in that time. Blood in the cyst material can be a sign of infection as long as the pathologist didn't find any cancerous cells or precancerous cells. My cysts usually resolve on their own and I've only had the one aspiration. One thing that really helps is heat and caffeine avoidance.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello ladies  \n   I usually hang out in the Ulcerative Colitis forum but I have a question and I sincerely hope you don't mind if I ask it here?  I wasn't too sure where else to post this (if anywhere).  I don't have breast cancer though I did have quite the scare about\n a month ago when I found a lump in my right breast.  I went to the doctor and she said that the lump was just a cyst, drained it, send it out to the lab and everything came out benign.  I then had a mammogram and ultrasound and found that my breasts were riddled with cysts which I heard is not so uncommon as I first thought.  But it does explain why my breasts are so tender half the time and especially around my time of month.  So my question is, if any knows, is there a bra out there that is \"easier\" on the breast?  I find that by the end of the day my breasts ache something fierce and I think it has something to do with my bra.  Right now I have a no wire bra so are wired bras better?  I'm not very large chested so it's not like I need major support.  Thank you for any answers!  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thank you for the replies :) Yes actually I do drink caffeine......gotta have that morning coffee! But that's about\n it. I usually have about\n 4 cups in the morning and drink water for rest of the day. I don't consume much sugar either; would that have an effect on breast cysts as well as caffeine? Of course I have the occasional sweet but not too much. The one cyst that brought me to the docs in the first place went from nothing to golf ball size in a month, the doc drained it but unfortunately it's coming back. And it sends sharp shooting pains all over the breast. I may have to go see her again but I've been sort of putting it off because I am sooooooo sick of seeing the doc! lol\nThanks for the tip about\n the sports bra. I usually avoided them because like I said, I'm not very big breasted and it seems that the sports bra \"squish\" me down to nothing! Vanity issue I guess but I may have to break down and get one. A double mastectomy huh? Wow they really must've been hurting her! Pretty drastic but I guess if your in pain all the time, then it seems reasonable.\nThanks again :)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
