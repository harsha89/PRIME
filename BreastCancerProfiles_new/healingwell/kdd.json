    "Content": " I had reconstruction done 3 months ago, PS tells me it could be up to 18 months before breast has healed and shrinks. At present, my original breast is a B cup and reconstructed side is D cup, PS says it will reduce in size when fat absorbs. Also still getting pulls and tightness from tummy especially where new belly button is. What experiences has other ladies had after this type of reconstruction, do I just have to be patient. ",
