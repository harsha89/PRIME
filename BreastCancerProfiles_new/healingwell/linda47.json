      "Content": " Hello Chantry (what a wonderful name!)\nFrom all the research I did on this, there are really only 4 surgeries;you fall under one of the four. With the surgery I am having, a bi-lateral mastectomy, they must expand the skin so there is room for an implant. Because they are taking the whole breast, there is not enough skin left otherwise. They might have been able to do the 'tummytuck' procedure, if I had not just lost 26 pounds. Also if I was only having one breast removed.\nSo look into the options, talk to the doctor - he will probably have a surgery he prefers or recommends.\nGood luck - we all need it!\nLinda ",

      "Content": " Thanks Deb.\nYou made me giggle...I appreciate that~\nAnd I WILL be 'ittless'!!! I love it! Can I market that????\nLet me see - lost my uterus, was an 'it'; lost my boobs, was 'ittless'!!!\n(I hope no one on here takes that the wrong way; just trying to get through with humor.)\nI am 'pre-cancerous'...doing this to prevent anything. Apparently I am high risk and have too many iffy lumps. Am in too much pain all the time and have been for too many years. Just take the darn things! I don't need them anymore!\nThanks for the advice about\n bf. Hope he sticks around! He's a keeper. I do have a good support system in my friends and I know they would help me out in a minute; just have trouble taking the help. I would like to do what I can myself; hence the questions on what would make things easier. ",

      "Content": " Thanks everyone, for the input. It's exactly what I am looking for. Keep them coming. Frayda, glad you are ok...I figure I will go to a C cup, but only because that's what I am now. \nErin - thanks for the hints...about\n the bra...guess you have to wait for a while to see what size you are, or do sports bras come size-less??\nI think what will be hard for me is to re-learn how to sleep. Generally, if I am not in EXACTLY the right position (mostly on tummy with one knee up), I DON'T sleep, no matter what. Guess that will have to change! ",

      "Content": " Appreciate the input Frayda. How are things going for you now? Everything back to normal? Tell me you're one of the success stories! My girlfriend had this same surgery that I am having; she had to go back into surgery a week after the mastectomy to have the tissue expander re-adjusted. Then six months in an expander 'poked' through the skin, so she was in the hospital to have that repaired...where she picked up an infection that had them removing the whole breast AGAIN. Sent her home for 6 months to heal before putting the expander in again. Now she is 'equal' and will go in in February to have the implants put in. No wonder I'm frightened and concerned. I just hope I have better luck than she does! That, or I hope my doctor has a great night sleep and is in a great mood when he does me!! ",
