    "Content": " Hi.\nI am coming here from the hepatitis forum. I am a caregiver to my mom who had a transplant a few months ago. This week, during her 4 month post op following up, a CT chest scan showed \"A symmetric density in the retroareolar region of the left breast [a breast malignancy needs to be excluded-recommend workup].\"\nNot sure what to think about\n this? She just had her yearly diagnostic mammogram and breast ultrasound 1 month ago. The mammogram was fine and her left breast u/s shows \"a stable 1cm nodule in the retroareolar left breast since 2008\", which we have known about\n. Could something of changed in the last month???\nI am really surprised that the chest CT picked up something on the breast, especially since my mom has had many Chest CT scans since 2008 and other than the breast mammogram and breast u/s, the prior chest CT scans never mentioned it...is that common??? My mom has had that retroareolar nodule since 2008 and its been stable since. Should I still take her to a breast doctor to just confirm??? ",
