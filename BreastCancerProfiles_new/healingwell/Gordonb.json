      "Content": " Hi Tavish, I really hope I'm not intruding but I am going to be circling the Earth in my sailboat on a crusade against cancer. I will be flying 2 banners; one is a tribute to those we lost to cancer and the other is a salute to those we didn't. I have been organizing this since I was diagnosed with cancer while building my boat. Anyone who would like to add a person to either list is most welcome to do so, since I am new to this forum I'd need to make sure it's ok begore I post the web site or my email. If this is OK with the moderator(s) I will be happy to do so. Cancer has been kicking people around long enough and I am instigating a crusade to get up and do some kicking back. By the way, on this trip around the world I will be guiding a fleet of boats carrying survivors and it is going to be a world class event. ",
