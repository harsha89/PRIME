    "Content": " Hi Nivenn\nI am 32 years old and will be having double mastectomy due to this problem. I have had to have 6 fibrocystic tumors ranging from the size of a golf ball to the size of a thumb removed from my breasts over the last five years. I am tired of the pain and the worry and both my Primary Care Doc and my Surgeon have recommened the procedure. I saw your post above and I was wondering if you went through the surgery as well. I'm pretty scared of the surgery so any words of advice, wisdom, encouragement, etc. would we welcomed and greatly appreciated.\nThanks,\nBrandy ",
