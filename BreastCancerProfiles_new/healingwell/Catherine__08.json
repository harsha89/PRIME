    "Content": " A couple of nights ago, my mum who has breast cancer wasnt to well at all, so at 2 in the mornin i rushed her to A&E where we sat paitently waiting for at least 2 hours which doesnt bother us as its what to expect, but what really got on my nerves was a young man screaming racist comments to asian doctors, spittin on the floor, ad shouting at the nurses to hurry up because he was \"ill\" before all this i heard him bragging about\n how he had been to thialand with all the women and he had become ill and caught something because he hadnt had his jab.\nIt really annoys me how people like this can sit and complain when reallys theres nothing all wrong with him. \n \n ",
