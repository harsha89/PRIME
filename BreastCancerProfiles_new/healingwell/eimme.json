    "Content": " I have a huge hematoma after biopsy.  My right breast is 5-6X bigger than the left one.  Is purple/back all over my arm pit, under my breast on my rib cage and over to the left breast.  Hard as a rock. Sharp shooting pains in my breast and down my right arm.  Keeping ice on it 24/7.  Surgeon says he cannot cut before hematoma goes away.  I read about\n women taking months to get these things resolved.  That's time my tumor has to replicate cancer cells to send out to the rest of my body.  My tumor was slightly bigger than 2.5cm  when diagnosed.  I am scared.  It's like I am doing nothing to fight the cancer right now.  I still have to have th left side biopsied.  They said doing both sides at the same time would be \"too much\".  I am scared I'll get another hematoma.  My labs said I have some kind of clotting disorder and I'm supposed to see a heme MD in August.  The biopsy is next week.  I asked for a psych consult to get medication to peel me off the ceiling  (I do read Barbara Johnson's spatula ministries books).  Can you tell I'm losing it?  I am tired of carrying my breast in my hand.  Can someone tell me this, too, shall pass.  Any remedies besides ice?\n ",
