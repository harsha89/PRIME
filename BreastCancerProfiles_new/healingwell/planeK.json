      "Content": " Mike, \nI just started signing on to this website again, after only being a \"reader\" some time back. \nI was given a report of Invasive Lobular Carcinoma in May of 2012. I've learned a LOT about\n Lobular (vs. ductal) carcinomas. They often do NOT show up on mammographies; with or without dense breasts. Even when I went in for a diagnostic mammogram, the cells did not show up. The doctor used a sonogram to get a biopsy. \nLobular is irregularly shaped, often slow growing, and very unpredictable. It has a greater chance of showing up in the other breast once it's shown up in one. And lobular historically does not really respond as well to chemotherapy as it does Aromitase inhibitors. \nMy current understanding is that Femara might be a better option for your wife than Tamoxifen (if she is already menopausal). \nDid your wife follow through with the BRCA testing? \nI enjoyed the \"my old ones tried to kill me\" -- thanks for sharing. \nI totally agree with the DIEP flap also -- by now she is probably well on her way to recovery. \nWishing you both all the best!! \n--kc ",
