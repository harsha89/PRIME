      "Content": " Hi! Since my last posting, I had the breast biopsy (1.4 centimeter tumor) and it came back HER2 negative, which they say is a good thing.  I started on FEMERA on the 18th of September.  So far the only side effect is constant hot flashes, to cold flashes to normal...over and over again, all day and all night.  I go back on the 15th of October for another cat scan.  I am going to go to another doctor at a different facility for second opinion.  Also, I will have first accupunture next week.  I am glad that there are other people out there....any advice on the FEMERA hot flashes?  And anybody else out there that has had success with accupunture? thanks.
