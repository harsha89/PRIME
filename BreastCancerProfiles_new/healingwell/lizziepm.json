      "Content": " I went to see my doctor today for my annual physical and she had the report from the hospital.  The radiologist wants a cone lateral view and an ultrasound only because he saw what looked like a shadow.  However, both my doctor and I in reading the letter seemed assured that it might be just the way the compression may have been done since the radiologist is feeling the same way.  I guess it is a precaution just to be sure.  I feel a bit better about\n it but I probably won't relax until I get the results that everything is okay.  \n ",

      "Content": " First of all, let me introduce myself.  This is the first time I have posted.  A little history -- since about\n the age of 40, I have gone for mammograms.  I have had cysts and dense breast tissue so having mammograms has been pretty routine for me for the last 15 years or so.  One time, the radiologist did ask for more views but everything turned out okay.  The last few years I have gone to the Ontario Breast Screening Clinic for women over 50.  I like going there because of the atmosphere and the nurses have been very helpful and supportive.  In October 2009, I went for my usual screening and at the time, they sent a letter saying to come back in a year.  When I called, they said there were some changes but to come back in a year.  Last May2010, I went to the doctor as I was experiencing some strange sensations in my breast.  I convinced her to send me for another mammogram, this time, she sent me to the local hospital.  Everything came back normal and the sensations had also stopped.  \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thank you for responding.  It is Monday and Friday still seems far away.  What is not helping is that I got an email from a dear friend who is undergoing an MRI today and surgery either tomorrow or Wednesday.  It seems that she has had a lump that came up from an injury in the fall -- she had a mammogram done in December and at the time, it was normal.  However, the lump did not go away and she went to see her doctor.  A biopsy was done and it is an aggressive carcinoma.  So here's hoping that all will turn out for her.  \n ",
