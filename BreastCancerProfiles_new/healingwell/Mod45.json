      "Content": " This was the report information we had during the follow up Appt. with the 2nd Mammogram and Ultrasound:\nReport EXAM: ULTRASOUND LEFT BREAST \nUltrasound imaging left breast shows 4 x 6 mm complex hypoechoic nodule corresponding to patient's mammographic abnormality. As discussed with the patient this nodule is indeterminate in its appearance. Recommend consideration for biopsy.\n1. A 4 x 6 mm complex nodule central left breast corresponding to\nmammographic abnormality. Recommend consideration for biopsy. \nTH \nASR \n***** Final ***** \nAfter the biopsy today we had great news, the Radiologist said he got all clear liquid which was great to see and after doing the follow up tests the nodule was gone from all scans and this would now be considered a Cyst. They will still send in for a report but he can't imagine this coming back as anything bad. So much relief! \nThank you for checking on this! ",

      "Content": " My mom went for her yearly Mammogram last week and came back with a dense area and they wanted her to follow up with another Mammogram of that \nlocation and an ultrasound. The follow up Mammogram today still showed the spot and believed it was a cyst and during the Ultrasound he said he it doesn't have characteristics of anything bad looking but also doesn't have characteristics of something just being benign, it's basically stuck in the middle. So they ordered a biopsy and suppose to meet with the Dr. tomorrow to schedule it with the surgeon and determine what type of biopsy should be done. They said the surgeon will also look at the images and films to help determine if he thinks its anything more worrisome.\nIt's very nerve racking and I feel so horrible for my mom and I just wanted to know if anyone else had this type of experience or if its common for a Ultrasound not to be able to tell if it's a Cyst or not. From things I've read is an Ultrasound is what's used to pick up a Solid or a Liquid filled mass but this came out undetermined.\nAny advise is appreciated.\n ",

      "Content": " My mom met with the Surgeon today and he thinks it could be a Fibroid, he doesn't think its anything but to be safe he's gonna do a needle ultrasound biopsy on Thursday. It's the size of a pea and he's unable to even feel it. He hopes they will be able to hit it to take the sample, if not they will have to try a wire biopsy to help guide the needle. Results are usually 2-3 days they said, I hope they are able to get it the first time to avoid longer wait times. \nThanks for your response. ",
