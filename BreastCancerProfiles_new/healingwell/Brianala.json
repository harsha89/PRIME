    "Content": " From March - June of this year I was fighting what my doctor diagnosed as a staph infection in my lymph nodes in my armpits and groin (no testing or samples taken though). After three different courses of antibiotics (allergic to the first, second didn't work, third finally did) it finally cleared up. \nI had my first mammogram while I was going through this, and got called back for an ultrasound. I got a call with the results and they said they found several benign cysts on either side. I'm waiting to get a consult with a surgeon, and I've been told it's likely they will want to drain them. \nI'm curious if anyone else here has dealt with both cysts and a lymph node infection? Could they be related? I'm definitely going to bring it up at the consult, but I was curious if there was any relationship, or if it's just a weird coincidence. \nThanks!\nBriana ",
