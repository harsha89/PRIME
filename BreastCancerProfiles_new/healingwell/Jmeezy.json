It is very painful to the touch and even when it's not being touched also when I felt around, I felt a small little hard ball in between the big tender spot it is mobile but right now but hurts to bad to touch, it feels like I have a huge bruise inside my whole boob, it also kinda of feels swollen due to the tenderness, in my left boob I felt nothing, not sure what I should do?
