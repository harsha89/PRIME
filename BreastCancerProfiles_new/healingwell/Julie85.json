    "Content": " I am 47 years old and went in for my annual mammogram last week (this was the first digital one I have had). Yesterday I got a call from my OB that there was a \"shadow\" on the mammogram and that I needed to go in a second time. He told me not to worry because I have dense breasts and with the digital mammograms they are seeing alot of callbacks. It's so easy not to worry but I do. I can't get in for another week and I am really sick to my stomach. My aunt died of breast cancer about\n 22 years ago and I remember what she went through like it was yesterday. I know that technology has progressed significantly, but I am very nervous. My youngest is 17 and I am scared, even though I shouldn't jump to conclusions. Any comments are welcome. ",
