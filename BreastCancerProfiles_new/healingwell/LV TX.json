      "Content": " Thank you all for your responses...She is to see her oncologist next week and so hopefully more information will be forth coming. I definitely appreciate the answers so far. I do know that she had a bone density test which I believe was necessary in fine tuning the upcoming treatments she will under go. Since our last converstation, she is leaning towards reducing the size of the tumor and then having the lumpectomy...all of course depending on all the other factors.\nRegardless of what type of cancer you have...it is a waiting game...wait for this test result, then wait for that test result. I am use to it...but poor sis, this is just driving her crazy right now.\nThanks again to all...will update as I get more info.\nLes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Another Update...Gave my sis a few days to recover so I waited until this weekend to call her. She is doing absolutely fantastic. She said she kept waiting for the pain to come and it never did. She was getting a little sick with the pain meds she was given so she stopped them and was just taking Tylenol as a regimen to keep the pain away. She is extremely happy that all of her fears are gone now. She has two drains and one of them is no longer draining and she is going to have them removed on Wednesday and will get the path report on the lymph node that was removed.\nAs she said...Fear of the unknown was her biggest fear. Now if she has to face any followup she is going forth with a positive attitude and no fear.\nKuddos to all you ladies out there that have to endure this...remain strong and positive.\nLes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " One more update....biopsy came back CLEAN!!!...WOOHOO She is absolutely elated. The tumor size was 3 cm but all margins were inked and clear. The two sentinel nodes were completely clear of cancer. She is one lucky lady. Her cancer was deemed contained and removed completely. She will have hormone therapy for a while, but that is to only kill off any cells that might have remained during the surgery. Not a big deal and she will handle that just fine.\nNow for the reconstruction which mostly likely will take a few months as the chest muscles are stretched before the final implant is done.\nI will sign off here and give a very BIG thank you to all of you for your kind support and words of wisdom. \nI will return to my own battle with cancer now.\nLes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Okay here is the update. She has a 2cm tumor in the ductal? area. Treatment selected was a mastectomy with reconstructive surgery at the same time. Basically the way she explained to me, is that the preliminary test indicate no involvement in the lymph nodes and was given a Stage II due to the size of the tumor. They will test for lymph nodes at the beginning of the surgery and if positive will switch to a radical procedure. However if negative as expected then they will perform the mastectomy and reconstruction. Then she will follow-up with hormone therapy, although I don't know for how long. She said this is considered a day surgery and will be released the same day. Not so sure I would want her to go home the same day because too often patients are rushed out of the hospital too soon in my opinion.\nAnyway, this sounds like she is on a path that should have a good outcome and can be cured given her stage and type of treatment. I feel very good inside and much relieved. I know she isn't out of the woods so to speak...but certainly not deep into the woods either.\nThanks to all for listening. This is going to be a very special Thanksgiving this year for my mother...both her children have cancer and are expected to be cured all in the same year. That is something to be truly thankful for.\nLes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Another update. I spoke to her the other night (we live in different states) and she is outright scared to death. Not so much from the cancer or surgery, but more of the after effects...which I can understand. Her biggest fear is not being able to care for herself immediately after the surgery...like not being able to dress herself, wash her hair, won't be able to drive her car..she is left handed and this is her left breast so trying to use her right hand just to eat and cook etc. She lives alone with her grown son. She doesn't want to be a burden and I know that feeling as well. And to make it even worse on her is the thought of the hormone treatments for the next five years. Menopause was extremely hard on her..emotionally and physically.\nQuestions:\nWhat and how was the recovery for those in similar situations as hers? \nWhat is the best way to lift her spirits in light of what she is facing right now? Remember we are long distant from each other. \nI want to be able to be her cheerleader and greatest fan through this and somethings I can say been there and done that...but my cancer is different than hers.\nAgain I truly appreciate all the responses I have received and I know that all of you have felt the same as my sister at some point during your journey as well.\nLes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi all once again. Just an update. My sister had her surgery on Nov 4 and everything came out very good. She had the mastectomy and the sentinel lymph node appeared to be clean. We are waiting on the final path report next week but the surgeon said it had all the appearance of being clean and free of cancer. The optimism is guarded as we all know that microscopically it could show something different. But an experienced surgeon wouldn't make that kind of remark without some basis from experience. She is in great spirits and said she slept last night for the first time in a long time all the way through the night. I know from my own experience that trying to sleep at night was impossible with all that goes through your mind thinking about\n cancer so that was a very good sign that she is emotionally winding down from all this.\nShe will be dealing with the drains for a few more days and then the next couple of months with the reconstruction. Hopefully any followup treatment will be minimum for her from this point on.\nThanks a bunch to all of you here at HealingWell. Great site and great people here.\nLes\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
