      "Content": " I was diagnosed in September 2007. I had a mastectomy and a tissue expander was placed in my chest. A week after surgery, I learned that I did not have clean margins and radiation was recommended. In addition, I had one positive lymph node out of the four removed. During chemotherapy, my tissue expander has been fully inflated. I am almost done with chemo and will start radiation in June. My doctors plan to deflate my tissue expander for radiation (so that they can radiate the lymph nodes in the center of my chest) and then re-inflate it after radiation. They will then do reconstruction surgery and use some tissue from my back or stomach along with a small implant. I understand that this has rarely been done, so am looking for someone who may have experienced this. ",

      "Content": " My plastic surgeon, who other doctors tell me is one of the best in town, says he can do this procedure. Unfortunately, he has never done it before. I'm trying to find someone who has been through this to understand what to expect. So far, I haven't found anybody in my town (Houston), so thought I would try reaching out through this forum.\nMary HS ",
