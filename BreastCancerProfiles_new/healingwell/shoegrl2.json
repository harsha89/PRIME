    "Content": " Cathi,\n I am from another forum (another disease) but your headline caught my eye today. So, with respect, I would like to send my sympathies.\n Two weeks ago today we had to put our 2 yr old cat, Buckles, to sleep. He suffered from an intercranial disorder (possibly a tumor or genetic neurological disorder). I still miss him so much, especially at night, but find comfort in knowing that we gave him the best possible home and the most love that any kitty could have ever wanted. I know he is in a better place and is no longer tortured by a devastating illness, and the same goes for your Cody. If someone had told me 2 years ago that I could have that cute little kitty, but he would only live for 2 short years, I wouldn't have changed a thing. In a way, I know that we enrich their lives too. You are in my thoughts and prayers.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
