    "Content": " Hi there, \nI'm new to this forum/ site and really need some assurance or experience re breast cancer. \nI've had an itchy left breast (on the inside, so I can't really scratch it) for about\n 7 weeks now. Its occasionally painful and almost always tender too. Sometimes the itch stretches into my armpit. \nI have seen two doctors and a breast surgeon, and have had an ultrasound done so far. Was prescribed antibiotics which didn't help. Ultrasound was clear apart from one enlarged lymphnode - so I went to see the surgeon who inspected my breasts and said the lymphnode was gone (the other 2 docs prior to this could feel it). The breast surgeon thinks it's my nerves or hormones causing the itch / pain, since I've had a baby 13 months ago, and am still breastfeeding and haven't had my period. He consulted a radiographer about\n referring me to mri for reassurance but was told it couldn't be done because of breastfeeding. He was very calm and told me that these days ultrasounds are very effective and accurate, especially for young people (I'm 31). I asked him about\n Inflammatory breast cancer (my biggest fear), but he said I needed some breast swelling or at least some presentation on skin to get biopsy done.\nNow, I know this all sounds sensible and positive but my fear and anxiety doesn't think so!! And the itch/ tenderness/ occasional pain is still there . I have scheduled another appointment with the breast surgeon in a week for a check up, I just really am after some reassurance or similar experiences, since my anxiety about\n having breast cancer doesn't let me enjoy anything, and its really hard looking after my 3 children when I'm anxious all the time.\nSorry this is such a long post but just wanted to get it off my chest, I seem so stressed otherwise. \nP.S. I'm still breastfeeding my 13 month old about\n 6 times in 24 hrs, and recently discovered she leaves quite deep upper teeth marks on my left breast. Could this possibly cause some discomfort in breast?\nI also was carrying her around all the time on my left side, I stopped when the itch and tenderness appeared though.\nMany thanks in advance for reading this and your support!
