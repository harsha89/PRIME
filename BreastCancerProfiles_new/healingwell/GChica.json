      "Content": " I am excited that I found this blog. I read all the comments and stories and I can see that we are facing this challenge but not alone. I have been taking tamoxifen for the past 4 years. I have experienced many of the side effects (weight gain, hair thinning, leg/foot cramps, mood swing, hot flashes, water retention, coughing, etc). I have done everything not to let these symptoms to discourage me. I feel that as long my doctor and the mammography confirm that I am cancer free, I will take these symptoms any day. However, for the past few months, I began to experience some blood spotting. The Obgyn did a biopsy but thank god it was negative. But the past three weeks, I have been spotting more. Does that mean that I need to have another biopsy to make sure all is okay? I want to be positive but once I see blood it does not give me a good feeling? I started taking tamoxifen after found some atypical cells which were removed on both breast. Any thoughts will be greatly appreciated. GChica ",
