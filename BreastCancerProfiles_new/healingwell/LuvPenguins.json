      "Content": " I am 43 and have a strong history of breast cancer in my family.  I had my yearly mammo done on Sept. 11th and received a \"call back\" letter in the mail on Saturday, the 15th.  Needless to say, I'm worried.  I know the odds are in my favor of having bc, and I know that early detection is great but it doesn't take the worry away.  I guess the next step is another mammo.  I'm waiting for my doc to call with my next appointment.  I just want to know what is going on in my body and take care of it.  The not knowing is awful!  This seems like a great site for support and comfort.  \n ",

      "Content": " Thank you Eve and FK for your reply.  It is some comfort knowing that there are caring people out there.  My next apt. is Sept. 28th and they are going to do a spot compression and ultrasound.  My doctor told me they found a dense mass on my right breast and a spot below my left nipple.  I do self exams and don't feel a thing.  My worries have subsided some and whatever this is, I will hit it straight on.  Thanks again for your replies and comments.  They are greatly appreciated.  \n \n ",
