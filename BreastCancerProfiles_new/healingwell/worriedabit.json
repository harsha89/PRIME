      "Content": " Once again, thank you so very much for the support. It is very scary to say the least! I was called to come in last night, but this was in regards to very bad ECG and high cholestorol. I'll tell you, things sure can get messed up pretty quickly! LOL! Anyways, I have my next appointment with my doctor next Friday, as the results should be in from the hospital by then. We'll see what happens from there I guess. The last time I had an ultrasound done as well, but the tissue was too dense and didn't show anything. This may be this case this time as well, but from what little the tech would tell me, she could see something, measured the mass, and then proceeded to the nodes as well. The tech also thought I was still too young for the mammogram. At this point I would have preferred to go see the surgeon and just schedule to have it removed instead of wasting time with all this back and forth. Unfortunately my surgeon no longer handles breast surgeries, so I guess I have to go through all these preliminaries all over again. Right now I'll just take it one step at a time. It's funny though, I really don't want anything to show up on the tests, yet at the same time I just want to be proven right that there is in fact something there! The last time I went through this, I was treated as though I were crazy and that there was nothing there! I think I want someone to prove me wrong, and not that I have to prove myself right!!!! Once again though, thank you very much for the support, as even though family seems to mean well, it's really hard to understand what someone is going through unless you've been there yourself. Bless you for your kind words!\nJune\nJune\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks MK, it's funny in a way cause my husband also says that the warranty expires when you hit forty, but I guess being born a premmie, everything else comes early too!!!! I'm thirty eight but am starting to feel alot older lately!!! Anyways, I was really concerned about\n your daughter, and am hoping that all goes well for you and all your family. My heart goes out to you all!!! June\nJune\n ",

      "Content": " Thank you for the response MK. I went to the doctor on Tuesday, had a full blood and heart workout, then had a mam and ultrasound on Wednesday. I just got a call back from my doctor to go back in to \"discuss\" my results from the lab. I wanted to wait for my mam and ultrasound results before going back in, but he insisted I have to go in today. I guess you could say I'm getting pretty nervous now. Because the previous lump was pre-cancerious, and a family history that has the remaining family on a \"cancer watch\", I'm feeling really worried.\nJune\n ",
