      "Content": " Hi, Today I got diagnosed stage IV breast cancer.  I was diagnosed with cancer on Feb. 4.  I had a CT Scan and a bone scan.  The bone scan was fine, the CT scan showed three small spots on the liver. My doctor said it was nothing to worry about\n, but we will get a PET Scan anyway.  ",
