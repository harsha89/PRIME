      "Content": " Thank you so much MK and Bev. Hearing the 80% statistic definitely lifts my spirits. I have one more question. I was told to get a biopsy but now my insurance is sending me to a surgeon. Should I ask him if they are going to take it out anyway and if so to skip the biopsy and just do the surgery? I don't know why I would do both if they could just study the whole thing. Do you recommend lumpectomys? ",

      "Content": " Not very good. tear tear. I had a little needle biopsy done (not the big needle) because he said I need to have a lumpectomy either way. He did the mini-biopsy today to see if any cancer cells were present. If any are present then we'll need to talk about\n a lumpectomy vs masectomy with treatments. I'll find out on Friday and schedule the surgery for sometime next week. But sadly, the doctor said it really doesn't look or feel good. I have a 50/50 shot of it being cancer. I am really not ok today. I just got married in March, I felt as if this were finally the start of my perfect life. This is a huge blow to take. Thank God though I have the most amazing family one could ask for and my husband is absolutely wonderful. Poor thing... this is going to kill him. Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Do you know people who had breast cancer at a young age and still lived to be 80 cancer free? I just can't picture it. I feel like breast cancer is the beginning of the slippery slope of a cancer-filled life. Also, we wanted to start having kids in about\n a year or 2. How will all of this affect that? Will it still be possible? I am heartbroken. ",

      "Content": " Hello again,\n Unfortunately my little mini-biopsy came back with atypical cells which they were unable to decipher as being cancerous or not. My surgery is on Tuesday morning for a lumpectomy. The surgeon said he will test the lump on the spot for cancer cells and it is positive he will take out more of the breast tissues and test the lymphnodes. Back in the dark until Tuesday... Thank you so much for the prayers and care. I really do appreciate every comment.\nMegan ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone,\n I am new to this site and let me just tell you that reading some of your posts has already put me a bit at ease. I am only 23 years old and am so scared for what I am about\n to go through. I found a lump in my right breast about\n 3 weeks ago, had it checked and had an ultrasound. Well, the ultrasound came out \"suspicious\" (a very scary word) and I now need a biopsy to determine what the mass is. I go in Wednesday morning for another \"consultation\" with a breast surgeon. The doctor said the \"Primary considerations or possible rule out diagnosis are the following, granulomatous mastitis, other granulomatous processes, fibrous mastopathy and carcinoma of the breast which all have a similar sonographic appearance.\" Can anyone shed any light on these different things? I've tried googling them but it's still a bunch of doctor jargon. I am absolutely terrified of the worst case scenario. I've never heard of anyone needing a biopsy and not having it be cancer. Does anyone have any good news? Also, if the breast is somewhat sore where the lump is, does that hint toward one of the conditions mentioned? \nI'd appreciate any input. Thank you so much. ",

There's always hope for the positive (or negative if we're talking cancer talk) :) Tomorrow morning is my meeting with the surgeon. I will definitely let you know how it goes and I'm sure I will have more questions. Thank you again!\nPS- I am doing a needle biopsy (I think) not a surgical one... does that make a difference to your previous response about\n whether to take it out and/or do the biopsy? ",
