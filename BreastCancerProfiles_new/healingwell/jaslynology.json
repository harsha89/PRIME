      "Content": " \nHEY JOEY!\nhaha. Sorry. I'm just excited when I saw that you're from Singapore. :P Cause I am too!\nWell, I'm usually on Anxiety and Panic Disorder. But today, I thought I'll just look at this part of HW. (: Anyway, maybe I'll just tell you a bit about\n me. Haha, some random person who popped out from nowhere. :P\nI'm actually 15 years' old. I'm very interested in Biomedical Science, so I read a bit about\n some human anatomy. My ambition is to be a gastroenterologist or cardiologist. (: I found this site because I was extremely stressed during the period from end May to end October. Recently, somehow, I found back my optimism and stuff, saved some friendship that I lost during the period of time when I was stressed, etc. :D\nSince I read about\n human anatomy and sometimes diseases, I may just be curious. Looking at the symptoms of different diseases may make me think that I may have contracted that disease, etc. And now, I'm thinking about\n breast cancer. :O All right, I know some people say, \"you're so young, you won't have breast cancer!\". Well, I know that that's not really true. There ARE possibilities, right?\nAnyway, of course, I learn to do the self-examination thing and tried it. I admit that at this time, I still don't know if 'that' is a lump or it's normal. Haha. So, sometimes, I'll be thinking that I felt a lump, then ending up scaring myself with it. =X\nNow, maybe I'll like to ask some questions. (: Note, I'm just curious, all right? (: The nipples felt odd recently, like it's bruised or something. =X Then, I've been having this for the past years, I think. Sometimes, my breast skin itches, then it'll turn a little reddish, like the 'pinkish-red' colour you get when you scratch slightly on your skin due to irritation. Yup. Just like to ask if these are common and has nothing to do with breast cancer.\nMy apologies about\n the poor descript\nion. =X\nlots of love,\njaslyn.
