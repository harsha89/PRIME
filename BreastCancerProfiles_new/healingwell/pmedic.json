      "Content": " Hi all. I normally post on the crohns forum but I am scheduled for a prophylactic double mastectomy due to severe fibrocystic breast disease. I have hundreds of cysts in each breast combined with extremely dense breast tissue. My mammograms and ultrasounds always list as multiple masses believed to be cysts which always worried me. I have had plenty of aspirations of cysts over the years and recently had a core biopsy on an area that was also just a cyst. My mother died of breast cancer and since I never knew my grandmother or her medical history, I don't know who else in my family may have had breast cancer also. \nTo be honest, I am tired of the constant worry about\n if or when they will find something that is not a cyst. \nI am going with a nipple/skin saving double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I have large breasts now but want to go small. I am 50 and would love not to always have to wear a bra! \nI am concerned about\n pain and not being able to pick myself up out of a bathtub. I am very independent and don't want to have to rely on my hubby to help me do everything. How long will it be before I should be able to function on my own? ",
