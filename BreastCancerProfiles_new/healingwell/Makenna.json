      "Content": " So, I had my diagnostic mammo today. They did two sets of pictures and then brought me back for an ultrasound. They found a fluid filled cyst on the right. After much searching they couldn't find anything with the US on the left even though the pictures on mammo were convincing. They said they want me to come back for an MRI to be sure. I'm still concerned and am glad for extra testing. Maybe it will put my mind at ease! ",

      "Content": " Hi all. I guess a need some reassurance. I'm terribly worried that I got a call back after a routine screening mammo for asymmetry in both breasts. I think in my head if it was one area of asymmetry I wouldn't be as worried. But since they saw something on both sides it makes me think it could be something real. And of course now that I know these results I'm getting all kinds of weird sensations in my breasts. Makes me worried, actually terrified. I go back for a second mammo on Tuesday and the waiting is excruciating! Thoughts? I would appreciate any input! ",
