      "Content": " Did they do a biospy as well? If not, that could be the next step. You should ask your doctor to explain the results to you and ask if a biospy is needed. In my case - I am now 43, was diagnosed last june, I had a mammograph and a biospy right after. A week later I had an MRI and CT scan (and more).\nGood luck!\nSheila ",

      "Content": " I'm afraid I can't help you with interpreting the medical report. But one thing I can suggest is that you ask for an MRI or CT scan as soon as possible, since these scans are more precise. \nGood luck and don't worry too much. Exams, scans amd biopsies are tough because you have to wait for the results. Keep us posted!\nSheila\n ",
