      "Content": " I'm in the same boat right now.  I'm at the end of my 5 years on tomaxifen.  My labs say I'm NOT in menopause.  So, theyhave recommended I take zoledex shots monthly to put me in menopause.  After 3 shots I am suppose to start the letrozole.  I could not tell where I was.  I had only 2 periods during and after chemo.   I'm contemplating just doing the ovary removal because I have no idea how long it would be for me to reach natural menopause.  (I could be taking this shot for many years)  So far I have had 3 shots.  I had a bleed after the 1st one so, now my ob/gyn wants to do an endometrial biopsy since that was unusual. All of the sudden my teeth are becoming a problem.  Something about resorption. Decaying from the outside-in.  I spent 4 1/2 hours at the endodontist and oncologist on Friday.  More time than at the doctor's office I work at. \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " \n  Annette, congratulations on the 5 year mark ! We are on the same schedule.  I got to start tamoxifen with my first chemo treatment (the trial) so, I'm at the 5 year point on that now.  Lab tests show I am not menopausal yet to start letrozole.  So, we are trying to figure that part out.\n ",

      "Content": " I was so excited and still am about my 5 year anniversary.  I even went ahead and schedule surgery to reduce and lift the non-cancer breast to become somewhat even.  Had my visit with oncologist yesterday and was so ready to move on to next step.  Problem is my blood test show I am not in menopause which you need to be to take the letrozole. They are recommending I take due to the nature of the orginal cancer.  Evidently I'm looking at either taking monthly lupron shots until natural menopause or surgically removing ovaries.  I thought for sure I had been thrown into menopause.  No periods, changing skin, hot flashes and night sweats (early on in treatment which led to zoloft) vaginal dryness, saggy non-radiated boob.  And no memory !\n \n \n \n \n ",
