    "Content": " Hello everyone,\nI am new to this forum. But i thought it would be nice to share my experiences with someone before life takes me on a roller coaster ride. I recently noticed a ropy lump in my left breast during my cycle, which disappeared immediately after my cycle was over, but I got alarmed and immediately scheduled a mammogram,When i reached there i said yes for a 3D mammogram not knowing much about\n the pros and cons.And lo and behold, i was called for a diagnostic mammogram and then an ultrasound. I was told I have cluster of microcalcifications in my left breast that were punctuate,amorphous and indeterminate and a 1.5 cm non shadowing mass on my right breast. I was referred to a surgeon and it was a younger guy who said you need a core needle biopsy for the mass on the right and a stereotactic biopsy for the microcalcifications.My world is currently tone apart.I feel i should not have done a 3 D mammogram as so many abnormalities that sometime go away on their own are now clear and I have to undergo a biopsy in each of my breasts and a third mammogram after the biopsy. Please let me know what to do.I am scared to death\nThanks.Please help me. ",
