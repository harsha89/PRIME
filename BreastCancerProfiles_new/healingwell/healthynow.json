      "Content": " Thank you for your reply Sheri.\nI found the bloody nipple discharge Saturday morning, and emailed my doctor the same day. \nI had a reply from the doc Monday morning with an appointment Tuesday afternoon. At that appointment my gyn referred me to a surgeon for consultation and got me scheduled for an expanded mammogram and ultrasound.\nI had the specialized mammogram and ultrasound on Thursday and also met with the radiologist. My mammograms are normal and unchanged over several years. The ultrasound did reveal something \"not right\" with one of the milk ducts. The radiologist also told me that unilateral, spontaneous bleeding is never normal. He scheduled me for a needle biopsy.\nThe needle biopsy was done that same day. Painless and easy. It did leave some very ugly bruising.\nThe surgery consultation was postponed pending the biopsy results.\nLater Thursday afternoon, I had the surgery department call me. The consultation is now scheduled for Friday (the 13th). Biopsy results should be ready by then too.\nSo now I wait.\nEmma ",

      "Content": " Got the call from the breast care coordinator. Biopsy results are BENIGN. So relieved and thankful.\nI still have the surgery consultation on Friday, as the duct will still most likely need to be removed. ",

      "Content": " I usually post on another forum, but find a need to post here...\nOn Saturday I noticed bloody discharge from my right nipple. I have an email in to my doctor, but in the meanwhile am looking for information.\nI am 54 and I have a family history of breast cancer (Mom, Grandma, and cousin). My last mammogram was 7 months ago and it was fine. I have no lumps that I can feel. It is not a constant discharge, I see spots of blood in my bra and on my night gown.\nAny information will be most appreciated.\nThanks,\nEmma ",
