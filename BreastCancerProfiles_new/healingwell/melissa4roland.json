    "Content": " Hi everyone.\n I guess I'll start by telling you my story. In July of 2013, myself and my amazing wife became deathly ill. After 4 days of no sleep and vomiting white, foamy mucus, we decided to go to the Dr. After a round of antibiotics, nothidr changed and now we can't hold down water. As a matter of fact, water actually turned out to be the problem. Apparently, our well was found with high levels of arsenic. Long story short, Shan got better and I did not. The second round of antibiotics is used to treat exposure to anthrax. Whatever, it worked. From September to November, I had several days where my stomach felt like it would explode. The cramps would last so long and feel so deep that my blood pressure would rise. I even had to go on medication for that. Dr said it's a pain pressure and my body was basically going through hell. Each emergency room I went to, and that was 7, gave me another shot of morphine to get my blood pressure down, and tell me I have a cyst. When I finally got in to an obgyn, I had to have a full hysterectomy. Now please understand, I'm only 37. So January of 2015, I delivered a very unhealthy 11lb uterus. For any of you who don't know, the average uterus weighs 2 pounds. Mine was covered with 1 five lb tumor and 18 smaller ones. All benign, thank you Lord. However, during 6 week check up, I found a rather hard lump in my right breast. I had my Dr check it at the appointment, she says it doesn't feel like a cyst, better have it checked. A few days later, I'm getting my first mammogram and ultra sound. I was terrified. Cancer of all types runs deep in my family. I've lost every single relative on my dad's side, including my dad to cancer. The tech could tell I was nervous as she's probably seen a million times but she's seemed extremely gentle to me. I didn't feel like another number, you know? Afterwards, this lady comes in, tells me she's the radiologist, hugs me and tells me I'm cancer free. I was so ecstatic, I cried right there. 3 days later, I get a letter telling me that 5 sets of clusters were found in the top, bottom, both sides and middle of the right breast. Recheck in 6 months. I felt betrayed by the radiologist. Like I was not quite lied to but not told the whole truth. I didn't make my 6 month, life got hectic but I did get in there by 10 months. I figured it wasn't doing anything anyway because no one seems that concerned about\n it. A lot of weird things began happening in that 10 months. For instance, on an incidental find, I was told I have a small polyp on the inside of my arterial renal artery. Watch it every 3 months. Check. Began noticing about\n 4 months ago, I couldn't walk across the room and back without being breathless. My muscles in my legs turn to pudding when I get this way and I fall. My lymph nodes in my armpits are swollen. Have been for 6 months. Also, my groin lymph nodes are swollen and have been for 3 months. Got second scan done, same clusters, same spots, not doing anything but hanging out and this time said that it was a fluid filled cyst that's so hard in there. I asked about\n the lymph nodes, she basically ignored me. No one in the medical field seems all that concerned about\n me, I have no medical insurance right now which I'm sure is a lot of it, but still, I had to look up what a cluster even was on Google. Shouldn't the Dr have explained all of this? Sorry so long but I'm just getting fed up. ",
