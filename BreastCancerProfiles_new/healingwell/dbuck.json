    "Content": " I had my first mammogram in 13 years (I am 41).  I saw bits of the images and noticed they took extra pictures of my left breast.  I saw something that looked like a starburst on the last image, but hey I don't know what to look for.  My husband was concerned the technician told me it was possible that they may do an MRI because of family history.  They get results back but will not say anything because they want to compare the results from 13 years ago but they cannot find them it was a different state.",
