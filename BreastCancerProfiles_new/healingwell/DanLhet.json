      "Content": " My wife has been diagnosed after the biopsy with Inflammatory Breast Cancer, they say its very aggressive. Initially I thought the dr said Inflammatory Skin Cancer, we have been referred to an Oncologist set for this coming Monday Jan 7th. \nShe tested Estrogen Positive and Progesterone Positive and has scores of HER2/NEU 2+. \nI am a complete moron about\n all this. Do not know what to expect other than what I've read here and in Google searches. They did a needle and Punch type biopsy. ",
