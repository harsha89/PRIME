      "Content": " Four years ago when I was pregnant with my youngest, they found a lump in my right breast. They did an ultrasound on my breast and found that it was a liquid cyst. They decided to do a biopsy just in case (breast cancer runs in my family). They did the biopsy and it came back b9. \nNow a little over four years later, I have been having pains in my breast. At first the pains were only if touched (we thought I was pregnant) it was tender to the touch and it was leaking a clear to milky liquid. As the time went along the pain kept getting more intense so much that it feels like someone just punched my breast and it hurts all the time. It hurts to wear a bra, hurts if I move my arm to much and makes my breast move, it even hurts to walk because of the bounce. I wear very good supportive sports bras because that is what my gyno told me to do.\nI went back to my doctor and they decided to do another ultrasound to check on the lump, as it turns out the lump is no longer a liquid but is now solid. They decided to do a lumpectomy on it, while at the surgeon he discovered that there are more lumps that are being hidden by the ultrasound. They are not very big, the biggest being about\n 1.5 cm. He believes they are all clustered together, but will not be sure until he \nopens me up.\nPlease let me know if anyone has had anything similar and the results of what happened, I would greatly like to know.\nThank you all in advance.
