    "Content": " Hi. was diagnosed just recently.\nStarting my Chemo treatment tomorrow. My physician wants me to take Taxol.\nI have chatted with another doctor who said that Taxotere is also a common drug to be used. I went back to my doctor and she was very unhappy with the fact I talked to other doctors. But on the other hand - she told me that both drugs are fine and its a \"trial and error\" process where we need to find to which drug my tumors reacts better.\nBy the way - I didn't pay anything to the other doctor... I am on this app called \n for cancer patients. which is pretty cool.\nAnyhow - I don't like the fact that its a \"trial and error\"... but seems like in many other cases its how things are. Starting with Chemo X... not responding ? OK. Lets go to Chemo Y... but time is the one resource I assume I don't have enough of...\nHow do you make a decision here ? How can I be sure my physician is doing the extra mile for me and not just following the protocol ?\nThank you all.\nEmma\n ",
