      "Content": " about\n Four months ago I found a lump in my left breast, towards the cleavage of my breast. At the time it did not hurt and there were no present swollen lymph nodes. My physician ordered a mammogram with an ultrasound. Two weeks later I went in for my appointment for the mammo/ultrasound. In those two weeks I had developed swollen lymph nodes up the side of my left breast and into my armpit. They did both tests and confirmed the swollen lymph nodes. I met with the radiologist right away who said my tumor, not a cyst which is what I expected it to be, showed characteristics of a Fibroid Adenoma and that the lymph nodes were probably just coincidental. I returned to my physician and she recommended I see a surgeon. The surgeon said he would rather I get a biopsy because they couldn't tell me 100% that it was not cancer. So I went for the biopsy 5 days ago. It was an ultrasound guided needle biopsy. Other then them having difficulty getting my breast numb I felt the procedure was easy and went fast. They placed a titanium marker. Since the biopsy I am experiencing burning and sharp pains in my left breast. I did not have any pains before at all. I was feeling the lymph nodes for any further change the other night and it sent a shooting pain across my breast and into the tumor. It hurt really bad. I don't have a fever and the breast is bruised so I can't see redness. It doesn't hurt to the touch. It just burns inside. I have also had pain down my left arm and into my fingertips along with constant tingling in my fingertips. My follow-up with the surgeon is in 2 days. I'm worried. Any suggestions? I will be happy if it's not cancer but if not then what???\n \n ",

      "Content": " I just had an ultrasound guided biopsy done. I too was anxious. I had my surgeon call me in some xanax. It worked wonders. The procedure itself is extremely easy. They did have difficulty getting my breast numb so I received a lot of injections. That was the worst part though. I didn't find laying there uncomfortable at all. As a matter of fact I had a warm blanket and a really soft pillow. It was very comfortable. The radiologist walked me through everything he was doing and because of my position I couldn't see anything. I didn't even feel tugging or anything. Probably because I was a little loopy from the meds. Just make sure you have a driver if you choose to take something to relax you. It was also nice because then I just slept off the xanax for the rest of the day until the next morning...Goodluck! ",
