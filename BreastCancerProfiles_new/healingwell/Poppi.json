      "Content": " Hi, may name is Poppi I've been on Tamoxifen for 4 years and didn't kow it could cause weight gain, which I have done. It's been very frustrating since I have no appetite. I can't exercise at this point because of other medical problems. I thought the weight was coming on due to the meds I take for bipolar disorder. Maybe its just a double whammy, or everything rolled into one, like the roll around my belly.\nI recently had a hysterectomy and was hoping that not having ovaries I would not have to take Tamoxifen anymore, but they say I should stay the course.\nPoppi ",
