      "Content": " At the beginning of the month I felt a lump on my right breast. I went to the doctor and had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound set up. I'm only 29, but given my family history, (maternal grandmother and great greatgrandmother both passed away in their early 40s from breast cancer, my mother has colon cancer and two of her sisters have breast cancer before 40) the radiologist decided to check both breasts. The lump I felt turned out to be nothing. It didn't show in a mammogram or ultrasound, but the left breast showed a lump deeper in, with a whole bunch of microcalcifications surrounding it. Now I have the biopsy scheduled for next week and I'm feeling quite anxious.",

      "Content": " My doctor's office call all over the place to get me into a place that wasn't going to dismiss me because of my age (29). They took my concerns seriously afther the first place that I was scheduled to go to was just going to do an ultrasound on the right where I found the lump. I'm glad I got to where I am at now because they decided to do a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound on both breasts and the right lump was not of concern, but what they found on the left was of great concern and I am having a biopsy next week. Practically every woman on my mother's side has dealt with breast cancer and my grandmother and great grandmother passed away before 45 from breast cancer. You need to keep pressing the issue if it is something that you feel needs to be looked at. I'm so thankful to be in a place that looks at the full picture and not just my age. ",

      "Content": " I got the results from the biopsy today. Ductal Carcinoma In Situ. Fortunately caught early enough, but given family history and personal health history we're going to take a bit of an aggressive approach. Thursday I meet with the \"team\" to plan out the treatment. \nEveryone at the breast center along with me are quite surprised at the results. We were all pretty certain it was going to come up normal, but I'm so glad they were attentive and never dismissed me for my age.\nAt least for now I have my son to keep my mind preoccupied as we get ready for Chanukah.
