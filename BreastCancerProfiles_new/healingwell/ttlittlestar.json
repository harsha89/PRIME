      "Content": " Boy can I relate. Had a questionable mammogram about\n 3 years or more ago. Then a suspicious ultrasound. It was my first one and I am am almost 50. I had a lot a questions about\n the biopsy and the fear I have of needles. And questions about\n some of the things I have heard about\n the procedure in general. The doctor ended up on the phone with me to answer my questions. At one point she told me the needle was no bigger than the needle used to draw blood and I was being ridiculous. And besides, she said they give you a needle to numb the area. She had be crying the way she talked to me. Hello? I am afraid of needles and now I find out I get more than one and that is a comfort how? So I ended up skipping the biopsy and asked for an MRI. The doctor made me feel so bad I never went back again. And haven't had a mammo since. ",

      "Content": " I too lost one of my best friends to breast cancer. Her words in the hospital when the DR told her she had weeks left at best are forever burned into my memory. \"but I am only 34...\" I am so sorry for your loss. This disease robs too many people of their lives. There is a grief support section in the bcsupport.org site for those who have lost someone to breast cancer. (((((((((hugs)))))))))))) ",

      "Content": " \nYou do not understand. As a young child, I needed some teeth extracted. They couldn't find a vein. And the more they tried, the harder it was for me to keep still. So they asked my mom to leave the room. And they tied my arms  to the chair. And they were not gentle about\n it. I woke up with bruised arms from the amount of times they tried to get the needle to work.  You do not understand the level of fear that can leave you with. Irrational to most but very real to me. The first poster's story about\n the woman who lunged off the table--when you are scared enough, your ability to reason isn't there. I went hysterical when I miscarried and they were about\n to scrape the remains of my unborn child out of me. They sedated me. I totally knew what was going on, but could no longer react. Could not speak, could not cry, could not tell them when something hurt. It was like being tied to the chair all over again. Totally helpless and totally aware. Passed out holding my daughter when she received her first vaccination.  Pass out if my dog gets a shot. You need someone to calm your fears, not to escalate them or make fun of them or to tell you not to be afraid. Cause you are afraid.  When people belittle you for your fear, it escalates the fear and you just avoid the situation. The breast dr made me feel like crap.  There were many reasons I was leary of a biopsy. Seeding of the needle track is a major concern of mine. First the dr told me there was nothing to worry about\n. Cancer does not seed from a biopsy. Then she told me the needle track is removed if the lump was indeed cancerous as an extra precaution to keep the cancer from spreading through the track. Huh? A little contradiction there.  And instead of doing anything to comfort my fears, she belittled me for them. Just as you did.  So I opted for a thermogram and the MRI. And to adopt the healtiest lifestyle I can so if cancer is in my future, perhaps I can delay it a bit. And if chemo is in my future, insulin potentiation therapy would be my first choice. Plus I have seen more than my share of routine tests and procedures and treatments gone bad. To name just a few--My grandmother had a test to see if the arteries  in her neck were clogged. She spent the rest of her life in bed as a result of the stoke from the test. My aunt had dye injected to check the functioning of her heart. It loosened a clot and she ended up in a nursing home partially parayzed. The inactivity coupled with her diabetes led to an amputaion of both legs over time. Friend went to get his wisdom teeth out. Needle damaged a nerve and he ended up with partial paralysis of one side of his face. Friends dad had cancer. Easily operable with an excellent prognosis. Gave him chemo to shrink the tumor before surgery was planned to preserve bladder function becasue of where the tumor was located. Chemo caused a blockage from the constipation and his intestine perforated and he died. Another friend had breast cancer. Caught very very early thanks to her yearly mamogram. Did a lumpectomy and they gave her a choice of having chemo as a precaution.  She felt the benefits of chemo outweighed the risks. She ended up with Chemo-Induced Thrombocyt\nopenia. After the initial treatments failed, she had a bone marrow transplant. It was ultimately not successful.   An uncle threw up a lot from his treatment. Inhaled the vomit. Died from aspiration pnuemonia. Best friend died just 2 years ago of breast cancer in her early 30's. I took her to chemo. I went to Dr appointments with her. Was  there when she was told she had weeks left at best. Stayed with her in the hospital. And held her hand as she was dying. And even that is not enough to overcome my fear. At a guess, my fears will not make any logical sense to you, but they are real to me. \n ",

      "Content": " I really know what that all feels like. You know yourself. And they won't listen to what you know about\n yourself. And the reality is everyone I know who has had a biopsy has said it is painful. Some said manageable pain, and others were in tears and it shook them up for days. I always like to know the truth about\n what to expect. \n Here is an article that talks about\n using an MRI to distinguish between non cancerous and cancerous legions. http://www.webmd.com/breast-cancer/guide/breast-cancer-mri\nThere are many such articles on the internet. The article also says the use of an MRI can cut out the amount of biopsies being performed. For many reasons, I did not want a biopsy. And the MRI showed my little growths were not cancerous. It is hard to explain, but something in my head was screaming at me that biopsies are right for most, but very wrong for me. Every inch of my being screamed do not do this. And it is not liked I ignored the lumps, I just searched for and used alternative means other than a biopsy to check them out further. ",

      "Content": " It always amazes me how dr's do not listen. I tell them I pass out with needles. They won't let me sit down for a tetanus shot. I pass out from a standing position. Told the pediatrician I pass out from needles. He said I was not getting the needle so nothing to worry about\n. Passed out with my infant daughter in my arms. Had to get an mri with contrast. Told them I pass out from needles. Passed out during the test and they start running all kinds of tests to see what made me pass out. Lots of $$$ later, they told me I seem to have a fear of needles. Some people have a different sensation of pain. A former neighbor had to have an emergency c-section. They asked her if she felt anything when they touched her stomach. She said she could feel the touch. They told her she was numb, and she was just feeling pressure. Then they made the incision and she was not numb. It doesn't seem like it should be such a big deal to just put you out for the procedure. If the dr really cared, he would do what is right for you so you can either put this all to rest or decide how best to fight. (((((((((((((((((hugs))))))))))))))))))))) ",
