    "Content": " Hi folks I am new to this forum and I want to say thank you for making feel comfortable with myself.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in  10/08. After a Pet scan in May, I was told that a breast cancer lesion was in my lung. It went from 15mm to 10mm at the time of the biopsy.  My doctor said that it has shrunk and she would keep me on Tamoxifen.  I am grateful for her.  My last doctor did not put me on Tamoxifen after chemo and radiation and the cancer came back.  My new doctor started me immediately on Tamoxifen and is working hard to keep me alive.\n ",
