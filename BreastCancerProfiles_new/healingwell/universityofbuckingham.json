    "Content": " I am a student at the University of Buckingham conducting research on the relationship between coping strategies and personality in those recently diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer and awaiting surgery. \nIt is hoped that the results from this study, if successful, may improve support for patients at this stressful time as well as better informing healthcare professionals about\n how individuals may use different coping strategies and to provide support that works best for them. \nThis study has ethical approval from the School of Science and Medicine Ethical Committee at The University of Buckingham. \nIt will take around 10 minutes of your time. So if you have recently received a diagnosis of either breast or prostate cancer please take the time to complete this research study.\nFurthermore if you are able to share this on other sites, perhaps facebook. It would be greatly appreciated.\nI received permission from admin Peter Waite to post this in the forums.\n ",
