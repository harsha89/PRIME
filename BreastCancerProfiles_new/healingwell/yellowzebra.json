      "Content": " I am 51 years old and I had a mammogram on Monday and received a call back that afternoon - I was asked to come back next week to have a mammo and ultrasound. They found a mass on my left breast and slight breast density change. I called my doctor's office and the nurse told me that the report said something about\n calcifications and asymetrical density. She said the report indicated most likely a cyst. I am very scared. Anyone experience anything like this? My mom and two aunts had breast cancer. Thanks. ",
