    "Content": " I am twenty-three years old, found a lump in the upper right quadrant of my right breast slightly lateral to the nipple. Saw the doctor today and he is very hopeful that it isn't cancer, but two of my family members have had it and died. He called for a sonogram, and after reading a little bit more about this procedure I am curious as to the accuracy of \"false-positives\". Please respond with any help.... Thanks....\nIt is all the young can do for the old, to shock them and keep them up to date.\"  -George Bernard Shaw\n ",
