      "Content": " Hi Mary and Bev, \nJust went for the ultrasound. Similar results as the previous ultrasound session (apparently the one I just had is higher-end; but still dont know what is the diff), they still see a cyst/lump/bubble on my right breast. Left breast seem clear.\nI will only know what it means on 17/10/07. I will keep you guys updated still. By the way, I'm from Singapore, a very small dot on the map. \nThanks for your replies, it means alot to me. \nRegards,\nJoeyx ",

      "Content": " Hi Jazz, \ni do agree with MK...\nI am glad that my 2nd doc is more responsive (he was fast in replying my email before I even booked him for an appointment), more caring, more willing to listen and assured me and advice me to a certain extent compared to my 1st doc I had in another hospital. I am glad I seeked a 2nd doc and now even with the 2nd ultrasound in 6 months time, I felt emotionally better after visiting my 2nd doc as compared with my 1st doc. My 2nd doc (he is called Dr. Hong Ga Sze, based in Singapore) even told me that my insurance company should not reject me on my 'critical illness' coverage based on the earlier medical report - he felt the move was ridiculous and he did tell me to get my insurance company to write to him, so he can write a better medical report, which will at least have the underwriters of teh insurance company to reconsider my application. \nJust based on my personal experience and on a side note - do buy insurance early for yourself and for your loved ones as early as possible. My family was quite poor back then (I'm not complaining, I'm indeed very grateful of how my parents have brought me up), and after paying my degree's school fees, I finally can buy some insurance at this age of 26. Of cos, teh older you are, the higher the fees I will have to pay. \nAnyway, keep me posted yeah and I promised to keep mine posted.\nTake care everyone! ",

      "Content": " Hey jazzy, \nhere is my medical report from the 1st hospital I went to. I didnt get the 2nd one from the 2nd doc (to show my insurance) cos teh 2nd doc wants my insurance company to write a formal letter to him (hope what he said to me is consistent in his writings). \nAnyway, here is my medical report from the 1st hopsital's ultrasound report:\n\"Both ultasound of the breasts were performed. Both breast tissue shows raised and heterogenous fibroglandular echotexture, with fat globules interspersed amongst the dense fibroglandular tissues. There are two hypoechioc leisons with circumscribed margins seen in the (R) breast at 12 o'clock position, which are subcentimeter in size. These 2 hypoechoic lesions do not show significant posterior acoustic shadowing, internal vasularity or surrounding architectural distortion. They are likely to be begnin such as fibroadenomata. However, due to lack of previous comparison study, close interval follow-up is recommended to access for stability.\"\nJoeyx ",

      "Content": " Hello!\nThks to Mary, Bev, Kathy & Gail and those who have been reading and following this.\nI have got my results. Well, at least for now I will read as good news.\nThe doc says it SEEM harmless. I still have a 5mm of lump visble in my right breast, which explains why when I did my Self breast examination, I can't feel it. In the medical report, it says that it is LIKELY to be begnin, but due to no available comparision can be made, she recommend me to do self examination monthly and also come back 6 months from now to re-check it. I did ask her how can she determine bu looking at the scan that the lump seem harmless. Her reply was that usually a lump should be odd shaped and jagged, unlike my oval-shaped lump. Hmmmm, is it true?\nWell, I can't get any confirmed answer in the doc's words nor in the medical report that I am ok.\nAny advice on what I should do now or do I just wait for the 2nd ultrasound in April 2008? Also, how does a doc determine it is truly a begnin and yet not cancerous because she claimed that no technology can 100% determine that. She did say that if I want, I can operate to get it out but there is no guarantee it will not grow back. Also, how to get the begnin out? Do they slice \nopen a small section of the breast to remove it and then sew it back? Sorryif I ask too many questions, or any good site I can gather these info?\nAnyway you guys are REALLY great and thanks for 'listening' and thks for the great support. Will still visit the site here. \nRegards,\nJoeyx ",

Also, medical report was not given to me automatically until i asked for it cos my insurance company needs it. Yeah, I will ask another doctor's opinion abt it with the medical report. I will let you guys know cos I am going to ask my insurance company if they have a list of breast specialist I can go to. The doctor I had was based in a hospital and not a clinic. \nAlso, i read biopsy is something like poking a needle to the breast. Is it instantly taken out or how is it like? Is it very painful? I mean I don mind the pain if need to, but maybe an idea of it will set my expectation. I will also check on the cost of doing an biopsy. \nLet me go get this information ready and I will update you guys. ",
