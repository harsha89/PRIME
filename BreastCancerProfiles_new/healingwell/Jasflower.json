      "Content": " I am very persistent... I've have a MRI with contrast Then had another one 6 months later... then had two ultra sound and diagnostic mammo and they can't find it.. going to see a breast specialist this week my gut is telling me that there is cancer the symptoms are to great! Severe pain to were I want to go to the er! The nipple is and areola very painful then sometimes itchy! What else can the specialists do. I'm really considering removing my left breast I can't take the pain.. in 2014 I had breast implants removed due to rupture I had them since I was 31 and never replaced them. Anyway my symptoms tell me it's Paget's disease or inflammatory I really hope the dr does a biopsy the last diagnostic mammo and ultra sound was in late July and my pain has gotten worse since then ",

      "Content": " No sign of breast cancer but there was a finding on the left Breast that is probably benign but they want to see me in six months to make sure nothing changes.. I'm wondering why not remove what they found? The reason I went to get an mri is because my left breast always hurts me ",
