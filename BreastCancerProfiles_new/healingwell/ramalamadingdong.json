      "Content": " Hi.  I had my 1st ever mammogram on Saturday (I turned 40 recently).  I found out yesterday that the mammogram is considered \"incomplete\" and they need more pics and possibly an ultrasound for my left breast.  They said not to panic (I have an anxiety disorder so there's no chance that I'm not panicking).  My f/u scan is tomorrow morning -- which is good that they gave me the 1st available even though I had 4-6weeks to reschedule.\n \n ",
