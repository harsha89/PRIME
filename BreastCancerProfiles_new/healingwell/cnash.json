      "Content": " Thank you!! It's just so hard not to think the worse. I think it bothers me that I can tell something is different with my left breast and noticed \"something\" about\n it even before the mammo, but I don't know what that something is. It for sure is the bigger of the two, but nothing way out there. ",

      "Content": " Hello!  I'm very very scared.  I received an abnormal mammo letter in the mail.  I called my doctor and was told that both breasts were heterogeneous (which I guess is very dense) and that the left breast was asymmetrically dense.  I have a follow up mammo and ultrasound tomorrow.  I do not have any pain in my left breast, but when I lay on my stomach I almost feel that the left breast is \"different\"...not pain, but different.  I'm 45 years old.  My last mammo was in 2011.  I have two children that are 17 and 6.  I'm so scared and can't think of anything else.  Has anyone else had this.  ",
