    "Content": " I'd been putting off my first mammogram (I'm 44) but finally went in a few weeks ago. Radiology called me back and wants me to return for an ultrasound due to a \"4 cm mass\" in my right breast. Immediately I felt the breast and sure enough, there is a good-size lump there, the size of a large grape or a medium sized walnut. The first ultrasound appointment I could get will be almost a month from the mammogram.\n ",
