    "Content": " I am 27 and I found a small lump in my right breast about\n 2 weeks ago. I waited to see if it went away but instead it got bigger and I found a second small lump on same side. I went to the Emergency Clinic to have it checked out. The doctor just felt the lumps and said it's a large and small cyst. He referred me to have a Needle Aspiration because the large one is painful. He made it sound like not a worry but recommended a mammogram also. My FNA is scheduled in two days. Is a mammogram harmful because of my age 27? And should I be concerned? I have no known history of breast cancer in my family but my mother had cervical cancer at age 22, and my father has Stage 3 Cancer in his liver and stomach right now. I have no one to talk to about\n this anxiety of whats wrong? Any input is much appreciated. Should I worry? Do I trust the results? ",
