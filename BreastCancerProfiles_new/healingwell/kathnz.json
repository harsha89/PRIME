This is the only way to be sure that any abnormality is cancer or not. I had a core biopsy which is done under local and is quite bearable the surgeon uses ultrasound to guide the needle to the tumor and a piece is punched out of the core and sent away to be checked - I find that the worst part is waiting for the histology result to come back. My understanding is that microcalcifications can be a precurser to cancer but are not necessarily so. \nBest of luck\nKath from Down Under ",

You see, that little metal box  Holds more than odds & end  Inside those small compartments  Rest so many of my FRIENDS.  I know so much about them  By the kindness that they give And this little scrap of metal  Takes me in to where they live. By faith is how I know them  Much the same as you  We share in what life brings us   And from that our friendship grew.  Please, take an extra minute   From your duties up above   To bless those in my address book That's filled with so much love!   Wherever else this prayer may reach   To each and every friend,  bless each e-mail Inbox  And the person who hits Send.  When you update your heavenly list  On your own CD-Rom  Remember each who've said this prayer   Sent up to God.Com.                                     Amen ",

Thanks to modern meds most of us manage just fine - all the others on the board will echo this. watch for consipation & try to prevent this - I hope you like prunes & raisins which worked a treat for me - and just be prepared for cravings for different food - just like when you were pregnant! Some foods/drinks that you really love may temporarily taste horrible - but that passes quite quickly.\nHowever, I am sure you will feel better after you have heard the chemo oncologist talk about why chemo is needed in your particular case. You might like to ask his/her opinion of your survival chances with or without chemo. In my case, to get the \"numbers to stack up\" it was a no contest - Chemo was a must! (if I wanted to be here to see my dgd 21st that is).\nthat said, it is drastic treatment and everyone has a slightly different reaction. Others have said that how you feel after the first treatment mirrors what will happen subsequently - I certainly found that was true.\nBTW I found that although the hair loss was scary, the reality was that it didn't matter at all! I now sport a completely different hair style which everyone admires and I know I wouldn't have been brave enough to do this if it hadn't been for chemo making me lose the hair in the first place!\nWe will all hold your hand while you go through this\nL & H\nKath\nfrom down under ",

But it is really important to get that range of movement back so look on the positioning as additional physical therapy - that might help you put up with it.\nYou eventually get very used to the correct positioning and the actual radiation is over very quickly. Just be sure to do all the skin care suggested - I was given a bg pot of special moisteriser (sp!) BTW you might like to programme a holiday at the end of all the radiation - you can be quite burnt at the end of it all and something to look forward to is also good - I worked all the time thru radiotherapy, but was a mess at the end - my boss made me take a few days off before my programmed holiday.\nI'll be with you (as will all the others!)\nCheers from down under\nKath ",

      "Content": " Tam,\nJust a note from \"down under\" re the arm exercises. It's really important to get as much movement back as possible in the first month after surgery. Yes, it hurts - like H*LL, but there is basically only a small window of opportunity to get the movement back before the scar tissue really starts getting involved.\nBTW regarding chemo - most get through it reasonably o.k. the anti nausea drugs are miraculous. - I did though I must admit I had to force myself to go the last time!\nBest wishes for your journey - we are all with you\nL & H\nKath ",

This is a journey none of us wanted to make but there are blessings along the way. Believe me.. learning what true love really is - not to mention the marriage vows of in sickness & in health..... but I won't go on. I was and am still blessed with a hubby who has truly walked the path with me and it has brought us even closer together. We have been sweethearts since I was 15 yrs old BTW I LOL about the cat!\nLots of luv fm down under (NZ)\nKath ",
