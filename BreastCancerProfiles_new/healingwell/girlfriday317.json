    "Content": " I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate tissue expanders in January 2013.  I had NO idea how bad the pain would be and I am a surgeon.  I still cannot lie flat and have to sleep sitting up.  When I lie flat, it feels as though Buffy pounded a stake through my chest and out to the other side where it is bolted to an iron cage which surrounds my ribs under my skin.  The WORST problem though was the feeling that my nipples were clamped by jumper cables and a constant current was passing through me.  The added tough was the sensation of acid across my entire chest from my first rib down to my eighth rib.\n \n ",
