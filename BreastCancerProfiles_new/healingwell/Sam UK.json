    "Content": " Hi all,\n(Peter has approved this post by email)\nI am currently looking to talk to people who have at some point during cancer treatment decided to decline some form of conventional treatment. \nI am currently a completing my Masters in Psychology at the University of East London (UEL) in the UK and I am conducting qualitative research (skype interviews) on this topic and ideally wish to speak to women who have had cancer.\nThe research has received ethics approval from UEL.\nThe purpose of the study is to simply understand each individuals experience and any psychological impacts (either positive or negative) they had in going through this decision making process. I will not be judging or drawing conclusions about\n the decisions themselves.\nParticipants may have only declined some of the conventional treatment, recommenced it at some point or discontinued it completely.\n I also understand this is a difficult and sensitive topic for many people to talk about\n so the interviews will be conducted with that in mind and participants will be able to withdraw at any point prior to the interview. \nInterviews will be 60 min in length, however, all the report of findings will only include anonymous information to protect privacy.\nCurrently I have two remaining places available to interview so if you wish to share your story it would be great to hear from you.\nMy hope in undertaking this work is to better understand these experiences so that mainstream psychology practitioners are able to gain a better understanding of what support is required or could be of benefit to people in similar situations in the future.\nIf you are interested please feel free to email my university student account at u1253567@uel.ac.uk or sam_eddy@hotmail.com\nThanks for reading.\nSam Eddy ",
