    "Content": " I have never been on this section of the forum before but does anyone know for a fact, or a medical opinion on whether or not wearing a bra to bed can increase ones chances to get breast cancer? Is that a rumor? My fiance' insists on wearing one to bed fearing that they will somehow sag as they get older and personally it scares me that she continues to wear it to sleep.\nThanks,\nCutter ",
