    "Content": " I hope and pray that you do not have IBC. My 33 year old daughter has it and hers is very painful. It has spread to her bones and even some spots in her liver. They have her on 600mg's of morphine a day, plus break thru morphine every 4 hours. So once again I pray that you do not have IBC and if you do that they have caught it in time, and it has not spread.\n \n ",
