      "Content": " Thanks ladies. MK if only 2 family members have had cancer that is enough of a genetic link to warrent consideration of genetic testing. Just in case you have ever thought of it.\nMany decide not to test, I have interviewed numerous individuals who have decided that testing would not help and may in fact confuse family issues for them.\nMany decide to test if they have children that may be affected.\nI had a 2 family link, had cancer at 35 and tested gene negative. \nThanks again for letting me post here. We will let you know when the book comes out!\nHugs, Kim\n \n ",
