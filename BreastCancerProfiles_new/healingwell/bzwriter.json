    "Content": " Rumseytime- Have you had the core biopsy? Please post your results and let everyone know how you are and if you are OK. When I first started reading posts, I was surprised to find a thread spanning 7 years. I'm sure more experienced posters or moderators will comment. I found this forum in an anxiety-ridden search for help/calming of fears after receiving a call back request today (Mammogram yesterday ). I was not totally surprised because the mammogram technician had such an odd response to my initial digital image and asked me after one view if there was a number the doctor could reach me at in the next day or two if anything suspicious showed up. She was so professional otherwise, but her body language and obvious reaction started my fear yesterday. I go back in 4 days, but hate to wait. I guess 4 days is pretty lucky compared to some peoples' experiences. The posts on here are so helpful and reassuring. And I'm not new to this, I have \"fibrous\" and \"cyst-y\" breasts (and every other part) -even had a needle aspiration 8 years ago, but that doesn't make this any less stressful. ",
