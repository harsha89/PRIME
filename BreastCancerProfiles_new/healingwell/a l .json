      "Content": " Yes, Alcie, that is an idea that we are trying to investigate! I think she is pretty reluctant to \"burden\" friends and relatives with her true feelings- so perhaps those who have \"walked the same road\" would be very comforting to her! (We are also looking into a therapist that has experience dealing with cancer patients.) Hopefully we will make some progress with this in the next few weeks or so (right now she is dealing with a leak from her Ommaya reservoir- they tried stitching it today and hopefully that will hold- if not, she has to go in for more surgery to have it replaced.... wish she could just catch a break for once!!)\nAnd thanks, thinkpos, for the hug and your thoughts! My sister has been home since mid-November- we did Thanksgiving at her house and everyone brought a dish- it just seemed a little overwhelming to her- perhaps she just needs to gain a little more strength before we do something like that again... (we have been trying to space out the company since then so that things remain somewhat calm...) ",

      "Content": " Hello-\nI recently posted about\n my sister's breast cancer metastasis to her brain and spinal fluids. She had an Ommaya reservoir inserted and has had radiation treatment plus chemo through the reservoir. Her symptoms indicate that the treatment might not be working and she is scheduled for scans this week. \nMy question is: her oncologist has said that there is only one type of chemo that they can use for her for the treatment of her brain and spinal fluid mets- but in doing some online research, I have seen several drug names mentioned.\nHas anyone had any experience with this? Should she choose to go for another opinion, can anyone recommend a hospital in the Philadelphia area?\nThank you so much!!!! ",
