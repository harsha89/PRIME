      "Content": " mercyme:\nYou can have a mammogram with implants. The technologist will do extra views to ensure the implant does not rupture with compression. The usual 2 views on each breast will be done with the implant in place with NO compression. Then, the implant will be pushed back and the breast tissue will be compressed and imaged. The same 2 views per breast will be taken in this manner - and then you're finished. There is a slight chance that the implant may rupture, but I have been doing mammograms for 9 years and have never heard of one rupturing from a mammogram. \nIf you are still unsomfortable about\n a mammogram, breast MRI would be an option but you would have to check to see if insurance would cover it. MRI is pretty expensive. \nHope this helps. No matter what your choice, you must have your yearly screening. Take care!\ngamon8\n ",
