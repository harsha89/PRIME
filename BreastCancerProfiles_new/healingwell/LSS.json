      "Content": " To Teddie2,\nInsist that your onc explain ALL to you until you are satisfied that you inderstand. That's their job. My understanding is that we have several estrogen types floating around so the drugs try to wipe out all of them. Dr. Susan Love has a great book out that is so helpful for all of us. Highly suggest everyone get it.\nLss ",

      "Content": " \nHi Alcie,\nI was on Arimidex for 3 weeks when the joint pain started. Took one month off and had no differnce. I think it takes months for the effects of this awful drug to get out of our systems. I have since switched to femara and have had same issues and needed to surgeries to fix carpal tunnel and trigger finger problems and looking on another surgery asap. I think for some women it attacks our connective tissues though it feels like joints. \nI read that some women have a cessation of symptoms after a while. i sure hope so.\nGood Luck ",
