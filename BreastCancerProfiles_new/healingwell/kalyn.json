If anyone has pain on the back of their arms from lymph node removal, there are patches made of lidocaine that work wonders! ",

      "Content": " Along with all of the other users, I have never heard of post-mastectomy pain syndrome.  I thought I was going absolutely crazy because I was told by my doctor that I shouldn't be in pain after years of excrutiating pain.  In addition, my sister is a PA and she, too, told me that I shouldn't be in pain.  In fact, she flew me up to where she is to have a \"great\" plastic surgeon reoperate on me (and I listened to her).  In addition, my breast surgeon (original) is a complete liar.  I underwent the biopsy and it was positive for breast cancer.  My surgeon immediately recommended a bilateral mastectomy and I listened.  (I never went for a second opinion, which I greatly regret).  After surgery, I asked my surgeon for the pathology report and she said she didn't yet have it.  I waited until the follow up appointment and she claimed she still didn't have it, which caused me to wonder why she wasn't giving it to me.  After much hounding, she finally relented and turned it over to me.  I couldn't believe what I was reading.  The report stated that there was NO cancer in the tissue removed (both of my breasts).  I was devastated and heartbroken that I went through an unnecessary bilateral mastectomy.  I did retrieve the original biopsy (the actual tissue cells) and had it tested and it was positive for breast cancer.  By the way, I noticed on this post that it seems that small breasted women are experiencing more pain (or are posting more about\n it).  What is your experience?  small breasted or large breasted in those having serious pain?
