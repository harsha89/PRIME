    "Content": " I just came over from the Prostate Cancer board where there are several threads running about\n a new development in the treatment of advanced disease..I believe hormone therapy is also used in the treatment of breast cancer, the patients ovaries are surgically removed to deprive the cancer of estrogen, correct?\nWith prostate cancer, it has been recently discovered that in men who have been treated with androgen deprivation therapy. (ADT) which lowers their testosterone to castrate levels, when that treatment begins to fail, the cancer learns how to progress without testosterone, they are injected with a double dose of testosterone. This apparently shocks the the now altered cancer cells, they can't cope with the sudden, massive increase of \"T\" and they destroy themselves trying to reproduce..The treatment is called \"BAT\", bipolar androgen therapy..\nI wonder if there is a similar effect possible with breast cancer? These researchers must talk to each other, right? ",
