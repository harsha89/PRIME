    "Content": " My name is Linda, 55 and I live in Hollywood, FL. In the past 14 months I have had two Mastectomies, two unsuccessful expander implants, two Latissimus Dorsi Flap reconstructions and five months of Chemotherapy. What a journey it has been.\nI am very blessed to be married to a wonderful man, Larry. \nWords that I like:hope, love, courage, committment, spirit, friends, family, faith, dreams.\nWhat a grand thing, to be loved! What a grander thing still, to love!\n(Victor Hugo)\nwebsite: Living With Cancer\n \n \n ",
