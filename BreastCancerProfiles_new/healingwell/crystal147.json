    "Content": " I have a left breast that is so tender to touch, burning sensation and sharp pains now and again.  I cant really feel anything, but I am not on a medical aid, so was wondering if someone has had this before and whether it could be breast cancer.  The burning keeps going the whole day and when I hug someone its tender.  Anyone with these symptoms?  ",
