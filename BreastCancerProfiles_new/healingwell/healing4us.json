      "Content": " I had a biopsy done yesterday and I was so extremely nervous. It was not as bad and in fact not even bad at all. I have had extensive chest wall surgery so I have more pain and tenderness than most. Mine was also deep into the breast and close to the chest wall but not one issue. I am pretty sore today but IBU has helped me a lot. They were so kind and compasionate and helped me a ton. I know how scary it is and I am here to say the biopsy is pretty easy stuff. Good luck I hope it goes good for you. ",

      "Content": " Ok biopsy is done. If it comes back benine then she recommends that I go in every 6 months to have an ultrasound and keep an eye on the other 3 we didn't biopsy. I found out last night we have a massive amount of cancer in our family and my mom just lost a cousin to cancer last week. They don't see this massive amounts of family cancer very often so they have offered some genetic research and consultation but then they said we would wait until the biopsy comes back tomorrow. I am hopefully that it isn't benine. ",

      "Content": " Ok I know everything will be fine and I'm sure they will call with good news today however I am so anxious.  AHHHH I can't wait for all of this to be over.  I can finally talk with friends and family and tell them what happened and that all is well.  I have convinced my self that everything will be ok I do get a little bit of anxiety as my thoughts lead negative at times but then I correct myself and say all will be ok.  I found out that every single person men and women on my moms side have had some form of cancer.  Crazy!  My mom's cousin just died last week from breast cancer.  From here on out I will more proactive and I am going to make a difference for people and families going through this.  I am determined to start a non profit organization to help these people and give them the quality of life that they deserve.  We need to do more to support our neighbors, family, friends or just people we don't know.  Everyone needs our support and we get so wrapped up in our own lives and don't realize the pain that is in our world.  An earthquake happens and we jump to support because we are willing to support people.  Well these families need a voice someone that will reach out and get them the support they need.  There is enough money in america to reach out during these difficult times and it is time I do something instead of sitting in my bubble.  I am so grateful this happened to me and I feel so luck that the wippers un covered my eyes.  ",

      "Content": " Thank you I appreciated. I feel like it isn't real sometimes but here is the latest. I'm in a bit of a fog I guess but will stay strong. Today they talked me into a mamogram and one breast came back the one is questioned she said had some thickining in it so then we were on to the ultrasound. They found 4 masses one bigger than the other 3 and they are going to biopsy the bigger one tomorrow morning at 10:30. He feels it will give them the answers they need and doing all 4 would be to painfull as I had my previous surgery. He said that sometimes an injury can mimic cancer on an ultra sound. It was a 4 hour apt and the doctor came and looked through the ultra sound pictures and talked to me at the same time. It was a little shocking when a doctor I didn't know came into the room. I have a lot of different feelings but I am confident that no matter the outcome I will overcome this obstacle and I just need to feel blessed that I am young and they will have caught it early. I have overcome so many obstacles and this I will also overcome. ",
