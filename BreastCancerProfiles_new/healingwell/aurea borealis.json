    "Content": " Hello, \nthis is my first post. I hope that you can help me and that I can help you with your problems in return. \nI have a breast lump, and I first felt it over 2 years ago. It is over one cm long. Under my nipple area, and if I squeeze the breast, I can see it.\nIt is rather hard, and has not grown much in size since I first felt it. I am 25.\nI am afraid that it might be cancer. Yet I cannot go to the Gyn. I have never been there. Whenever I try to go to one, I panic and leave. The older I get the harder it becomes, because clearly it is rather disgusting that I've never been to one. \nWhat can I do? ",
