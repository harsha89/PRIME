      "Content": " Just have to vent before I break down and ball in front of my kids. I am still in the \"wait\" mode as far as when my surgery is. Waiting to hear from insurance and I see plastic surgeon on Monday. Cant decide on whether to do just the lumpectomy that my surgeon says would \"probably\" be ok or the mast that my onc recommends. Can't decide which form of reconstruction yet. Pretty much have read everything to read on each but wow what alot of info. Trying so hard to keep things \"normal\" here and trying to prepare my house for while i am out of commission. With 4 kids at home its rough. My 18 yr old will talk about it but she's a typical teenager and justs hopes this wont interfere with her life. I don't mean that in a bad way, its just that I was a teen when my mother was sick and I understand what she feels. My 12 yr old wont even talk to me about it. My 10 yr old is just scared and is acting out. My 5 yr old doesn't even know i am sick but i can tell he knows something is different because he's been so cuddly lately. My husband is great but bless his heart, he wont read any info I have and is so sure that this will be fine. I hope for that too but poor thing, he didn't even realize that mastectomy meant taking the entire breast until last night. I was dx on Dec.7. He thought somehow they would save the exterior of mine and my nipple and just put something underneath it. Well, thanks for letting me vent. You ladies are the only ones who know what i am feeling and I could sure use a hug.\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks so much for your support. Right now, I am just trying to keep things as normal as possible and trying to stay busy. I have given my kids (according to their age), bits of information just to let them know something. I was 12 when my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I know that kids pick up on things and leaving them in the dark is not fair. I will not use the word cancer until it is diagnosed as such. My way of coping is I am preparing myself for the worst and hoping for the best. My husband is wonderfully supportive (although in a little denial) and I have alot of family but sometimes you can't vent what you are really feeling. They don't want to hear that my gut instinct says I have cancer. I know that attitude is half the battle and I have alot to fight for. Thanks again for your words of encouragement........................Sherry ",

I'm sure stress is the cause but i know the importance of eating especially now but with no appetite and the thought of food makes me nauseas. I have lost 14 pounds and today the lightheadedness and weakness set in . A friend of mine sells this product from Lifesource call Body Balance. It is a liquid whole food supplement. (checked with drs. completely safe). So I tried that and was able to get up and do a few things. I think I am trying to be so strong and upbeat for my family that I am not paying attention to the terror going on inside me. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

January 19 I will have a bilateral mast with lap dorsi flap and tissue expanders. I know I will be somewhat uncomfortable for a while but just having the \"plan\" gives me something to prepare for. They tell me this is an overnight stay. I have good feelings about that and bad. The good is I won't be away from my kids to long and the bad is I might not be away quite long enough lol. I don't mean that the way it sounds but I have a tendency to overdo and cater to those around me. Anyway thanks again and I will keep you posted.\n \n ",
