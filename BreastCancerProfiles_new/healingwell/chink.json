    "Content": " Sherrie.... I had a call back also from my mammogram since I went to a different place 2 years ago they didn't have any pictures to compare to the one's I just took 2wks ago. So I go in for my second mammogram and ultrasound the technician did show me a small spot on my right front of breast when they took the pictures and the lab technician looked at them the technician came back and said she wanted me to have a ultrasound because the spot didn't break up. They said it may be just a cyst or tissue sitting there it could be something that been there along time they just wanted to be sure so I'm waiting on a phone call back from my dr. I'm very nerves sad heart racing I hope my results come back fine. This site did make feel better ",
