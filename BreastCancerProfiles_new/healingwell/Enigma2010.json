      "Content": " hello to all of you ladies,\ni am hoping some of you will read and reply. I am worried,scared and need some reassurance that everything will be ok. A month ago i had my screening mammogram and 2 days later i got the call from my doc that i need to go back for more pics.She said that my left breast looks slightly different than the right she said ,,asymmetry.She told me not to worry 9 out of 10 is nothing and she gets quite a lot of those . I got a letter as well that states that there are findings that requires more pictures and such findings are benign. Any similar experiences? Need to mention that they schedule me 1 month later for follow-up.I am thinking if it was life threatening they wouldn't waited 1 month? Please help and share w me your experiences \n Thanks in advance ladies.I am not myself need good vibes\n ",
