      "Content": " Hey, Im a male 19 years old and i dont feel any pain in my right breast. I've got small lump and its streching for about\n 5-6 years. I've never been to a doctor, till last week and they told me that thats just normal for teenagers. I dont know but i think something is wrong... Sometimes my back hurts but i guess thats becouse i play guitar in a band and have gigs that sometimes last for hours. What should i do? Please help me i so depressed :/ Can be possible to have breast cancer at that age? And if I really had breast cancer would I die after 6 years?\nThank you! ",
