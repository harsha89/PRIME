    "Content": " I am glad to see this study listed on this board.  I have volunteered and been accepted but truthfully, I was a little leary and wanted to make sure it was a legitimate (sp) study.  I was given other websites to check out to confirm its legitimacy like emsi.net.com and niehs (National Institute of Environmental Health Scientist).  So far, it seems to check out.  I learned about\n it in our local newspaper about\n a week ago.  I am happy to be a part of the study.  I hope with all my heart it can help in some way and that we can someday conquer breast cancer even before it starts.
