I am 43 and have had many mammograms and on last week i was told that I had Microcalcifactions in my left breast and now i am being scheduled for a biospy. The nurse told me that they are in a clustered form. Some one please help me also because my mother had breast cancer and now i am really afraid. JMC do the biospy because that is the only way to find out. We are here to encourage each other ",

      "Content": " Hi Melissa\nI am sorry for all the trials that u are faced with. I am 43 and I have had knee surgery, hysterectomy, and stents put in for clogged arteries. Two weeks ago I was told that I had a cluster of microclacifactions in my left breast and i am scheduled for a biopsy on the 27th of this month. My mother have had the same things in early years and now she is 71. I said that to say this, we must stay encouraged inspite of all the trials. We can do all do all things thru Christ which strengthens us and he will not put no more on us than we can bear. It seems like a struggle right now but we must just hold on because trouble don't last always. We are here to encourage each other and keep one another lifted up in prayer.\nGod will fix it because I believe he will. I am also just waiting but i will not get stressed about\n the situation. Your trouble with your husband will work itself out because he will reap what he sowed.\nChone ",
