      "Content": " Update:\nI went back to see my doctor. I now have an appointment for another ultrasound the beginning of November.\nI asked for copies of the reports. There are a couple of things that I'm not understanding. I thought this would be the best place to find the answers.\nIt seems that I have a few scattered cysts in the left breast that are about\n 5 mm in size. In my right breast there is a \"small hypoechoic nodule\". They suspect this is a complex cyst, however a small solid nodule could not be excluded. What does this mean???\nBever\n ",
