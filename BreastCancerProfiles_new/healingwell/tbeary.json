      "Content": " Good morning all. As I have previously posted, I will be seeing the oncol this week and had a quest re chemo. While I realize that everyone's trmt may be different, it seems most of you rec'd a/c x4 and then taxol x4. My question is...how many actual trmts are there? Does it mean that there are 4 of each every 2-3 wks or 4 of one 1st every 2-3 wks then 4 of the other for an additional 2 wks.......am I making sense...I hope so. Seems maybe the actual chemo part may last 2-4 mos? \n \n ",

Follow-up meds for side effects? Sorry for all the questions, but I'm sure you know the anxiety of anticipated trmt probable worse than actual trmt itself..\nHope you are doing well.\nJudie ",
