    "Content": " Yesterday I noticed an extremely sharp/burning pain in my left breast ONLY when I did something drastic. I hopped down from a chair and when I hit the ground my left breast had a horrible pain that radiated from the left side (stayed concentrated). I did a self exam with no lumps, redness, swelling, etc. The pain subsided and didn't hurt again until I ran from my car to my home in the rain. The \"bouncing/jarring\" effect caused the same pain. This morning I did it \"on purpose\" with the same results. Within 15 minutes or so the pain subsides with only a lingering burning sensation for an additional 15 minutes. Has anyone experienced this? I had my mammo in September with no issues. Thank you. ",
