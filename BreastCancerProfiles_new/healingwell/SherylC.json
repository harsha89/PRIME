    "Content": " I had one yesterday. In fact, I had one in each breast. It's way over-hyped. Like you, I was scared, and I have a terrible fear of needles. But the staff couldn't have been nicer. The bed wasn't one I would want to sleep on all night, but it wasn't bad. The paddles did hold my breasts, but not too tight. They put a warm blanked over me, and told me what they were doing as they went along, so no surprises. The numbing shot was a piece of cake. Felt a twinge, but no sharp jab. Expected it to go into full-blown pain as they pushed the medicine in, but didn't happen. No real pain. I would go for this over having blood drawn any day, and I've have some good phlebotomists. They had to biopsy three spots on one breast, but arranged the shots so that after the first one I really didn't feel the second or third. They said I would feel some pulling during the actualy procedure. I did, but no pain at all. They rubbed my back, kept me warm, spoke gently to me. Doctor was the right amount of upbeat without being flippant or maddenly cheerful. Felt a bit light headed when I got up, so they had me sit on the table and offered me tea, water, juice or coffee. After I was dressed, they walked me out to the waiting room. Could not have had a kinder group of people around me.\nI do have to say that, because I was so panicked before the procedure - days before it - my doctor prescribed a mild sedative. It was for panic attacks. (Was able to take one the morning of the procedure, too.) It kept the creepy crawlies away, allowed me to sleep at night, and made it possible for me to face the day without being so freaked out I wanted to run away. It did mean, though, that I had a relative take me to the waiting area and pick me up afterward, as it made me feel like I had just a bit of a buzz on. I didn't want to risk driving. Imaging hurting someone else because you were anxious.\nAltogether easy experience. Haven't gotten the results yet, but the procedures was nothing to worry about\n. Take a deep breath and relax. ",
