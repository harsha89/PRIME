      "Content": " Hello everyone. It's been a while since I've posted, but I do lurk occasionally. I have had my right implant for 10 years (though it's been replaced once actually). It was actually replaced 5 years ago when I had my left implant put in. The right one has always been fine. The left one has never been really acceptable. It now seems to be getting worse. It is saline, and it is changing shape, though the surgeon does not feel it is leaking.  I am using a new plastic surgeon who feels that the only way I will get a result that will be cosmetically acceptable is with silicone. I was all ready to go for it--surgery is set for June 2. Now I am having second thoughts. Apparently the skin on the left side is so thin, that is why there is severe rippling and the implant actually shows through. He says he can't correct it 100% with silicone, but it will be a much better result. I really am at a point where I can't even where a V neck top without the rippling showing. I believe it may be better with a new saline implant for a while, but the silicone is probably going to look better. With all the publicity lately, even though they have now been approved, I am really skeptical.  Any words of wisdom?  Thanks. Rozanne\n ",
