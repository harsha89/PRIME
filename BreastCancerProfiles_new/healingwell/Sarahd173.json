      "Content": " Recently my roommate had a mammography and results came back wacky.  They did another mammography and then sent her to a specialist who then told her that she had calcium deposits or what looks like calcium deposits in her breast.  so they are sending her for a biopsy and those results determine if they are cancer or not and then regardless they will have to remove them.  \n \n ",

      "Content": " I am 25 years old.  I recently gone to my physician for my annual pap.  She performed the usual breast exam and discovered a cyst.  She told me that my breasts were from fiberous, if you will, bumpy i guess.  She told me to watch that bump and see if there were any changes.  Now I'm in limbo, I feel it, but do i worry?  I am 25, I know no doctor in there right mind would give me a mammogram, but what are my next steps?  My grandmother on my fathers side had breast cancer so how much am I at risk?  \n \n ",
