      "Content": " I am 4 weeks post bi-lateral mastectomy. Because surgeon said I was \n\"chubbie\" (179 lbs) I now have rolls of skin under both armpits which\nare extremely uncomfortable and cannot get used to. As to the bi-lateral\nmastectomy, it feels like my chest is being crushed. I previously had 2 breast\nsurgs with same surgeon in Dec. 2010 and radiation which obviously did not\nwork necessitating surgery of 4 weeks ago. Does anyone have any \nsuggestions or have had this similar experience. This is driving me crazy.\nGot back in touch with surgeon's office and they said to put heating pad\non chest. Thank you. Bouvier PS Of course I have the expected nerve\npain which is minor considering what is going on. ",

      "Content": " Hi Bev, Thank you for your quick reply and your knowledge.\nThankfully, I do not need chemo. I will consider the plastic surgeon\nidea for the future. Did not know about\n possibility of adhesons -no\none told me about\n that - especially my surgeon. Thank you for\nyour help. It is greatly appreciated. Hugs to you. Bouvier\nPS Decided not to go with reconstruction as I have had 4 major\nsurgs and radiation treatments within the last 18 months and\nreconstruction was the last thing I wanted after going through\nbi-lateral mastectomy. Just wanted it done with. But I do think\nthe idea of plastic surgeon to get rid of the \"rolls\" under the \narms in the future is a good one/cannot wear a bra with\nprosthesis at this point (have to wait 6 wks post surg. anyway\nto even shop) - could only wear a chami with prosthesis.\nThanks again for caring. You know, that digging in/crushing\nfeeling/I wonder if that could be the adhesons/will get back\nin touch with original surgeon. Thanks again. ",
