    "Content": " Hi There, Seven years ago I found a lump in my right arm, and was seen by a breast surgeon. It turns out it was a fibroedemna and was taken out.\n The other day I was doing a self breast exam and where the scar is , that is near the armpit, I thought I felt a lump. It feels hard and moveable. Went to my general doctor and he said he did not feel anything and sent me for an ultrasound, and the technician did not feel or see any lump. My period started five days ago, and my right breast is swelling, and extremely tender.Normally, I have swollen and tender breasts before my period, and when it starts it subsides, but it feels pretty swollen and heavy. I had a baby on March 22nd. I mainly feed her formula and still breastfeed. I still feel the lump. The technician was saying maybe it is scar tissue.\nIf it was, wouldn't this show up on the ultrasound? \nIt is possible the ultrasound could miss a lump?\n Is scar tissue supposed to be still there after 7 tears?\n How does one distinguish between scar tissue and lump because they feel the same to me. I know the evidence points to no lump but I just feel something is not right. \nwhat do you suggest I do? ",
