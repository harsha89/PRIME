      "Content": " I thought you said it so well, Joyce. I would only add that we need to stay in touch with those people who are important in our lives on a regular basis, cancer or no cancer. I had a wonderful friend named Susan (not the one we all know from the boards) who went to college with me -- the second time around. After 2 years together at a community college, she continued her education in St. Cloud while I went to the U of MN in Minneapolis. We stayed in touch from time to time, but our lives and careers got busy. She and her husband came to Sarah's wedding in Feb. 2001. That was the last time I saw her. As the months passed, I kept thinking that I needed to call her and meet for lunch so we could catch up. But, I kept putting it off and putting it off. Before I knew it, her DD called to tell me that Susan had had a fatal stroke. At 53, my dear sweet friend was gone, and I can't ever call her up for lunch. I guess what I want people to realize is that at any time any of us or those we care about\n could be gone. Don't wait to renew connections, restore friendships, reinforce relationships. Time is so precsious and so short. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

Had an MRI and EMG and will follow up with neurologist in a couple of weeks. They tested blood sugar and A1c was 5.8, so it is not diabetes. Neurologist is thinking pinched nerves, spinal stenosis or??? We shall see. Hopefully there will be something that can be done. We cruised Alaska last year, through the Panama Canal this past March and would like to do another one while we are able. Grandchildren are fine. Melanie is in kindergarten this year and Luke turned 3 in March. DD is working hard on toilet training. DH enjoying retirement.

Of course, that meant I was no longer the CL there or on the new board (it already had CLs). My MN ladies are very unhappy and refuse to move to the new board. One of the gals set up a board for us on Yahoo, so we will see how that works. Anyway, I took the opportunity to step down from the BC board, as well. I sent a message to the CM Friday evening, and today I see I have been removed from the BC board. No acknowledgement from IV, no thanks for many years of volunteer service -- nothing. Is anyone surprised?

And, arthritis in my back is painful, too. My mother just had carpal tunnel surgery for pain and numbness in her hand. One done, one to go. Otherwise, she and I are both fine. Latest visit to me PCP showed slightly elevated blood sugar (103 fasting), so we will keep our eyes on that. I celebrated 13 years since diagnosis of breast cancer this week. Still cancer free. Annual mammogram scheduled for next week. I did spend five days in the hospital the end of January with acute diverticulitis. Thought I had a persistent case of flu, but it was much more serious than that. Feeling fine now and colonoscopy this month showed only lots of diverticulae -- no polyps, no sign of cancer. Yea!!!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

He has been running my mother's neighborhood since early last spring. No one has reported him missing and the police cannot get hold of him. Mother \nopened the service door to her garage and we put a rug, some old blankets and a fiber filled pad down on the floor. He spends the night in the garage. I brought over an unused heated water dish and bought dog food for the poor guy. With lots of patience we've got him coming when called and he will take a dog treat from your hand. He finally let us pet him, but is really frightened. Someone really did a number on him. Hopefully, another month or two and we will have him settled in the house. We shall see.\n \n \n \n ",

Your doctor is being proactive and precautionary. Both are great reactions and you should be glad about\n that. Comparing current mammogram to previous ones is the first step in determining what this might be. If your doctor is still suspecious, an ultrasound may be ordered or a biopsy done. You (and your doctor) need to know if there is anything in the area of those calcifications that should not be there. Don't panic.

I got very tired during the six weeks of treatments (the fatigue creeps up on you). But, I managed to work full-time. We scaled back on meals a lot relying on the grocery store deli, fast food or meals out. I napped after work and after dinner. I was not as fortunate as Lori with my skin. The last two weeks the skin on the underside of my breast broke down and peeled. The radiation center gave me good stuff to treat it with, though. I healed quickly as soon as treatments ended. Good luck with your surgery. We will be here for advice and comfort in the days and weeks ahead. Looking at what you have already survived, I know you can do this.

I have heard others recommend the \"fanny pack\" approach, and it sounds like a workable solution. I do remember you from the iVillage board (where I still post), and am glad to see you here. Sorry about\n your aunt. Hope she does well with surgery and treatment. Others who have had mastectomies seem to have not had much pain, so let's hope your aunt tolerates the surgery well. Of course, everyone has a different tolerance for pain. Congratulations on the pending birth of the baby girl. You must be so excited. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

Sarah, Jason and the grandchildren are coming from Indiana. Grandson Luke will be baptized on Sunday, July 2, at the same church were his mom was baptized in 1974 when we lived in Ohio. DH's parents belonged to the church, so it was a convenient place to have her christened since the family could all get there. Same goes with Luke. My mother and Jason's parents will come down, as they always do, for the holiday weekend. We have a 103-year-old christening gown that Luke will wear. He and Melanie are the fifth generation to wear the gown for thei baptism. DH's sister and her hubby will stand in for the godparents who are in New Jersey (godmother) and on a ship somewhere at sea (godfather). This will be kind of nice since SIL and her husband were Sarah's godparents.\nWe will have a little \nopen house lunch after church on Sunday (food is ordered from the grocery store deli), then celebrate Melanie's 3rd birthday (a month early) on Monday with a family and friends pot luck supper on Tuesday. Then everyone goes out on the curb in front of the house to watch fireworks shot off two blocks away. Awesome seats. It is going to be a busy few days. Hope I survive.\nGlad to know that your tests and scans have been normal. I head in to see a pcp on July 13 for routine exam and mammogram. Other than horrid arthritis in my knees and hips, everything seems to be fine. You have a great weekend. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

My skin took it pretty hard, however I got through all the treatments without stopping. Like Lori said, aloe vera gel is good for the skin. Cordaid and Aquaphor also helpped when my skin broke down and peeled. I also found my skin got very sensative -- and has remained so over all the years. I got a soft cotton bra with no underwire from Target to wear during radiation. At home, I shed the bra and just wore a t-shirt to give my skin some relief. Since I did not have chemo, I cannot compare the two experiences, but radiation is doable, too. Good luck. It will be over before you know it. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

You did not mention husband or SO, but if there is someone in your life please try to convince that person to go with you to doctor's appointments. It always helps to have another set of ears listening to what you are being told. If that is not possible get a small tape recorder to take along to take the conversation. That way you can listen to it again and again until you understand what your are being told.\nThere are 2.5 centimeters to an inch, so that gives you some idea of the size of your tumor. I did not do chemo, but we have many gals here who did. I am sure they will share their experiiences with you. I had conventional radiation treatments -- daily for 6 1/2 weeks. It was doable. I was working full time at that time and did all right. Got really tired, but got through it.\nI know you are probably still full of questions. Do not hesitaste to ask them You can find out more about\n all of us by reading the roll call post at the top of the board. Feel free to add your name to the list and share whatever information you are comfortable making public. Where are youe? We are all over the country.

There was a luminaria \"In honor of Healingwell sisters\" and another \"In memory of Breast Friends.\" I thought of all of you as I walked the quarter-mile track during the survivor's lap. The weather held for us despite a prediction of an inch of rain. The event raised more than $37,000 for the American Cancer Society. It was fun to see a friend whom I have not talked to in many years. She is a 7-year breast cancer survivor. She told me that she did the Komen 60 mile walk in the Twin Cities with her daughter and daughter in law.  The three of them raised $12,000. Every year I think that I will be able to do this event dry-eyed, but after 10 years, the tears still come as I listen to the speaker and walk among the luminarias. Now, if they could just find a cure so there will be no more need for walks like this.

I sent Quaker and email (they call them oat mails, cute huh?) and learned the cereal was availabe in limited markets under the name Mother's Own. To my surprise I found it on the shelf at my DD's supermarket in Noblesville, IN. Some products are just not carried in all parts of the country. DD cannot buy Old Dutch potato chips in Indiana and when we lived in Ohio, I could not get little macaroni rings. Used to import them everytime I came home to visit.\nDH has struggled to find regular Dentyne chewing gum. Seems the company has gone to selling new versions. But, he likes the same of things (guess I am glad about\n that,since I am one of the same old things in his life). I found \"Classic Dentyne\" in a gas station/convenience store in Pagosa Springs, Colo., last summer and bought the last five packages they had. Recently, he found his gum at a local drug store, that ironically caters to area seniors. He is a happy camper again. Lori, you might try contacting Playtex and Warners and see if the styles are carried anywhere. Perhaps one of the outlet mall shops. What an interesting topic.\nMaybe we need a list of what people are looking for and see if we have it in our market place. Hugs to all, Lauri\n \n \n ",

My lump was 6 mm, or about\n 1/4 of an inch. But, it was still cancer.\nCongratulations on the weight loss!! That is really wonderful!! Good for you!! The lump could have been there before, but there is no way to for sure, so do not try to second guess yourself on that one.\nKnow that your doctor is taking the appropriate steps ind determining what this lump is. Please know that 80 percent of breast lumps are NOT cancer. What you want is a biopsy to know what this is for certain. It sounds like that is the course you are on right now.\nYou have found a wonderful group of women who have been through it all. We are here to hold your hand and comfort your fears in the days and weeks ahead. You can come here anytime and know that there are women who really do understand what you are going through. Try to take a few deep breaths and know that you are not alone. Please keep us posted on what you find out. We really do care.

Another interesting thing to see in Little Rock is the National Park Service display across the street from Central High School. It is about\n the seven black students who desegregated the school 50 years ago.

So, now I have to schedule an annual visit to the oncologist and my \"60,000 mile check up\" will be complete. Saw new PCP this year (previous one is doing rounds at local hospital). New doc was pleasant, but not thorough enough for my liking. Have had my teeth cleaned and \"look, Ma, no cavities!\" Learned that my former dentist, whom I saw since I was 9, is doing very well in his battle with bone cancer. Stem cell treatment apparently worked. Had my eyes checked, and while vision is not as good as it was, I can get by with existing lense. HOWEVER, I have cataracts in both eyes. Surgery will improve vision, but I will still need glasses because of anstigmatism. <sigh> Another big decision to make. Sorry to ramble.

The important thing here is, I knew what was \"normal\" and realized when something changed. That is the key. The American Cancer Society has a breast form with lumps in it, so women can learn the techniques of a Breast Self Exam. And, like Jo-Ann said, there are shower cards available. Lori and Gail make an important point, the idea behind a BSE is to learn what is \"normal\" and recognize any change.

You and I have some commom medical problems: I also take synthroid (generic) for low thyroid, lipitor for cholesterol and HCTZ to get my blood pressure down a bit. I survived five years on tamoxifen after being dxed with bc. There is life after tamoxifen. Please keep us posted on what you find out. The gals here really care.

Early congatulations on that 40th wedding anniversary. DH and I will celebrate 40 years in June, so we are right behind you. I plan to be around to celebrate 50, and I hope you are too. Mia has given you a good rundown on the board. It won't take long before you become a breast cancer \"expert\" too. Just keep reading and asking questions. There are lots of good internet resources out there. And, my dear friends here have a wealth of knowledge. Don't hesitate to ask. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

I am hoping to postpone it for a while, but a friend of mine had hers done several years ago and is thrilled with the results. And she is several years younger than I am. So... I was most concerned about passing the eye exam to renew my drivers licence this summer, but the eye doctor assures me I should pass. If I don't he said he would sign off that I see well enough. We shall see what happens. It was funny how all my appointments sort of clustered around the same time of the year. DH wants me to get as much taken care of as possible before he turns 65 in October and goes on Medicare and a supplimental insurance. We are not sure what the company's retiriement plan will offer in the way of insurance for younger spouses. Whatever it is, it will probably cost more than we are paying now for less coverage. <sigh> Thanks for the support and good wishes. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

One of the most important things to do right now is remain calm in the midst of what feels like an earthquake. Know that there is nothing you can do to change whatever the outcome of the biopsy is. It is what it is. I had a very tiny lump only 6 mm in size. But, the surgeon took one look at the mammogram and said it had the classic cancer form -- spiculated, as MK said. And, he was right, it was cancer. Four years later I had a cluster of microcalcifications under my lumpectomy incision. This time a surgeon told me it was most likely a recurrance. Well, two biopsies later, no cancer was found. So, you just don't know without that biopsy and pathology report. You hang in there and try to take this just one day at a time. And, as MK is fond of saying, \"Don't worry until you know you have something to worry about!\" We are here for you no matter what the outcome of the biopsy, so know that you are not alone on this scary road.

Sometimes a surgeon can look at the form of a tumor on a mammogram and make an educated guess as to whether it is benign or not.

The surgeon I saw said it probably meant a recurrance of the breast cancer, but he needed a biopsy to be sure. Two biopsies later, there was still no new cancer. So, what they may be seeing is a cluster of calcifications, or maybe just single specks on the mammogram. One is suspicious the other is not. I hope you get some good answers to what is going on. MK has good suggestions. I know it is difficult not to be closer so you can go to the doctor with your mom. I hope someone is accompaning her on these visits. It is so helpful to have two sets of ears hearing what the doctos has to say. Best wishes, Lauri\n \n \n ",

In the meantime, we are mourning the Vikings loss, but it would have been embarrasing to have them move any further in the playoffs. Good grief, this has been an embarrassing year. We can only hope next season is better. DH and I may head for Hinkley on Thursday (if the weather is good) for a little fun at the casino. There were $10 coupons in our Sunday newspaper. With the coupon from my mother, that's $20 for a some fun. Maybe we'll get lucky. DH and I went to see Mama Mia! on stage downtown Minneapolis last week. I was delightful. A real happy evening. If you get a chance to see it, please do. You will leave smiling. I hope everyone is having a good week. The iV board is really quiet right now, too. Must be the time of the year.

We had another day of driving in the rain \n  , but today was dry. Snow on the ground in northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. But, I am listening to the havoc in other parts of the country and know that we are fortunate. We made an overnight stop in Iowa City last night about 4:45 p.m. and finished the drive home today. Nice to be sitting here with my laptop. Now, if DH and DS come home from the MN deer hunting adventure. DS bagged an 11-point buck before T'giving. He is pretty happy about that. Guess we will be eating a lot of venison again this winter. Hope everyone had a great holiday. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",

Everytime Peter goes down to the farm to hunt he takes a few minutes to visit her grave. My sister has lost three beloved golden retrievers, and grieved with each one. Somehow those four-footed critters have a special place in our hearts. So, I really know what sadness you are feeling. You should be so touched that Jordan shows such spirituality. What a good job you and Tony have done raising her. Time will ease you pain, but the memories will linger forever. Sad hugs, Lauri \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello,\n I am sure sorry that you are going through all of this right now. It sounds like you have a lot on your plate all at one time. I am really sorry about your grandfather's liver cancer. Grandparents are such special people in our lives. IMHO, I think it is important that he be told about his condition and given the treatment options. Control over treatment should be left in his hands. The decisions should be his. While I know it is terribly sad to think about losing him to cancer, you have been so fortunate to have this special person in your life for so long. At 94 he has certainly exceeded his life expectancy. I think maintaining comfort, dignity and control in the final months and years are important considerations for him and the family in dealing with the cancer.\nAlzheimer's is a terrible disease to cope with for family members, and it is so sad that your grandmother has it. Try to enjoy time together and savor the memories you have of her.\nIt sounds like your friend really does need some time away from her job to try to pull herself together. Perhaps she needs some professional help in dealing with her problems. Can you gently suggest she seek such help?\nLife can be awfully unfair when you have a lot of sadness to cope with all at one time. The important thing for you to do is take care of yourelf so you can be supportive of others who need you. Realize that there are somethings (like the problems of loved ones who are ill or friends in trouble) that are beyond your control. I don't know if any of this makes sense or helps, but know that this situation will not last indefinately. Hang in there. Better days are surely ahead. Hugs, Lauri\n \n \n ",
