Had scan biop and waited 2week only to come back in conclusive had a 2nd biop waited 2week.. Results were cancer I was just 50 at the time, and yes very scared , but on a posertive note I am now 60 and doing well... They found it early so please stay posertiv alway ... Things have come on brilliant in the last 20 years and getting better all the time treatment for breast cancer has improved so much... All ways best to get checked there is usually a 3month widow time wise... most times there is nothing to worry about\n keep well thinking of you all...best wishes to you all ",
