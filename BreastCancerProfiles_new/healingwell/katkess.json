    "Content": " I read your post with interest as I just recieved a phone call saying I needed to go in for a diagnostic mammogram after finding calcifications on my first one. I too am \"anxious\" as to what all this will mean and whether or not they could be cancerous. \nIt is hard not to worry isn't it? But trying to let go and give it up to God. Good luck with your procedure please let me know how you turn out. Will pray all goes well for you Carrie. ",
