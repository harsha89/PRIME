      "Content": " I am new here.  I was dx with atypical hyperplasia early stage 0 and grade 2 cancer of the ductal carcinoma.  I had a lumpectomy, and radiation.  My surgeon had me go to a oncologist to get on tamoxifin.  I tested positive for estrogen receptor.  The oncologist said I don't have to see him anymore because the meds he gave me will take care of everything.  I am still worried, do you think I should see another oncologist?
