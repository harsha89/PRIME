    "Content": " Hello, I've become aware that this information on this support group isn't private, and can be found easily by searching via \"Google\". Since I've just moved to a new community and I'm looking for a job after being out of work for a few years (including the cancer treatments) this isn't something I think will help me. Is there any way to delete my posts of this list for good? This is very important. I guess I'm an idiot for using my \"real name\" but thought this was important in the context of cancer and did not release the list was penetrable from the outside. Thank you. ",
