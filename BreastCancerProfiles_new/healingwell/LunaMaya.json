    "Content": " hello, popping in to say in 2001 at age 47 while in the bath I noticed my left nipple had a drop of clear fluid coming out. I immediately called for an appointment because I knew that was not normal outside of pregnancy, which was surgically impossible in my case. I realized I'd had minor one-sided breast pain for a few days similar to that which you get with menstruation, and had thought it strange in only one breast. These two things seemed ominous, so I immediately called for and got an appointment for the next day.\nOn physical exam the lump could be seen just under the skin by just looking at me before any imaging. Ultrasound and Mammogram were clear...but biopsy revealed it was cancerous. I was told it was not yet large enough to be seen on mammogram, so I was very lucky to have that little clear drop there at the time I happened to be bathing! I have no family history of breast cancer and was not great at self exam either.\nWith my presentation they give you a choice between mastectomy alone or lumpectomy plus radiation. I chose mastectomy and reconstruction. It was all quick and easier than I thought! \nI would not have accepted a wait of several weeks such as you are facing. In fact, I coerced the nurse who called to make my appointment to learn the result into just telling me, because I knew it was cancer. She confirmed it, stage 1.\nYour doc may feel the wait is ok based on your results so far. If you make it clear you are freaking over waiting that long, maybe they will give you an answer as soon as your test results are known. \nI feel for you, but am also posting my case to show how self exam can trump mammography! Even after my diagnosis another mammogram showed nada, zilch.\nI wish you both well!\n ",
