      "Content": " I just finished 7 weeks of radiation in March and started Tamoxifen 3 weeks ago. Unfortunately, I'm experiencing side effects: extremely dry eyes, hot flashes, hair loss, nausea which started a week or so after I started the Tamoxifen. I spoke to my oncologist and she didn't seem concerned because she said side effects were rare and referred me to my pri care dr. I saw my pri care dr today and walked away with a bag of meds: Omeprazole (nausea), Zoloft (hot flashes) and Restasis (dry eyes).\nMy question is this: Is anyone else experiencing these side effects and, if so, will they go away? I really hate to start new meds if I don't have to, but at this point, I'm wondering if the Tamoxifen is worth it. ",

      "Content": " I'll be an optimist and hope my hot flashes disappear too. It's a little embarrassing because my face and neck really start to perspire. I'm still way too young for menopause, so it's a bummer that I'm having these menopause-like symptoms so early.\nThere is a product called Lilash which is an eyelash growth stimulator that I've tried that really works. In the same product line is something called Librow which stimulates eyebrow growth. It's expensive, but there is a money back guarantee if you buy it off the official website. You can get it for cheaper off of ebay. Try a google search and see if it's something that may help you. ",

      "Content": " CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR 3-YEAR ANNIVERSARY! I can't wait til I get to that point.\nOMG... Thanks for the suggestion about\n gradually building up the dosage. I'm also on 20 mg per day, but my pharmacy only carries 10 mg so I take 2 per day. I'm excited to try it.\nI noticed nothing extreme at the beginning, but after 2 weeks the side effects kicked in. I had every side effect for the radiation too. Even very obscure ones like sore ribs and a cough (from radiation hitting the lungs). I'm not big on taking meds, but I think with the Tamoxifen, I don't have much choice if I want to avoid a recurrence.\nI'm experiencing some weight gain from the tamoxifen and I run 90 minutes per day and surf on the weekends. Unfortunately I think it's because of the constipation (sorry TMI). I look like I have a baby bump which is very bizarre because the rest of me is relatively thin (105 lbs). I just bought some herbal stuff (super colon cleanse), but I'm a little scared to take it as directed because I have to work (college professor) and it would be difficult to stop lecture to run to the restroom.\nIf you are a fan of Dr. Oz, you could try the green drink. It's good at ridding the body of toxins and since it's all veggies, it fills you up. It is 2 stalks of celery, couple of handfuls of spinach, 2 red delicious apples, 1 cucumber, slice of fresh ginger, lemon and lime juice blended together. I also add a scoop of protein powder and i call it a meal. My husband loves it! It could help with the weight loss.\nThanks so much for your kind words of encouragement. Your support and positive thoughts mean a lot to me. Sometimes I feel like I'm floundering because no one I know has been through this and it's hard to explain the mental and physical effects to family/friends/doctors. It's a huge comfort to know that there are new friends out there who are willing to share and to help. My prayers are with you too.\nHappy Anniversary. I can't wait til I can celebrate my 1 year in December. ",
