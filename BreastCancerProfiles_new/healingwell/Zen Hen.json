It is so nice just to write something and have someone that understands, listen. Every morning I say \"Today will be different\". Yet, here I sit. Doc on Wed. I know that there is not any magic; however, we keep moving forward one day at a time. Stay positive peeps! xoxo\nI wish you both better times and positive thoughts!\nwill check back in soon\nIT WILL GET BETTER!\nI'm no longer a spring chicken, I'm a seasoned (ZEN) hen!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nborn in the early 50's; I am mostly titanium at this point 60+ years later ~ ",

      "Content": " Hello to Linda and Susie! \nJust wanted to say I'm still reading. Just having some flares. Boo Hiss. Dear Linda, I just want you to know that venting is OKAY! The other day I deleted a post on a thread because after I read it, it just seemed so trivial and self-serving instead of being helpful to the poor person that was just asking for help. Now, I wish I would have kept the post and moved forward.\nPlease don't feel bad for expressing your feelings. From what I have read this forum represents a positive and informative discussion about\n the things that are impacting our lives. To have people that have your back is an awesome thing and I think you have found it here. In good times and bad, talking about\n it helps. We have all gone to our son's room. You are not alone! In the darkness, we will find the light!\nI'm no longer a spring chicken, I'm a seasoned (ZEN) hen!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nborn in the early 50's; I am mostly titanium at this point 60+ years later ~ ",

      "Content": " Hi Exqualis!\nI just read all 12 pages of your thread. I am so impressed by your fortitude and your desire to push ahead! And I am so thankful that I found your thread. I too live in FL and wow! it's hot, lol. I pray so much for you to keep pushing onward and look forward to reading more. \nI found you by following Susie as she is the moderator for the forum I read. Kudos to Susie for her added insight. \nYou are both amazing. Keep on trucking! None of us really knows what the future holds; however, positive thoughts and prayers can always help.
