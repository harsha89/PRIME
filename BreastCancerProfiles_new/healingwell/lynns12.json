    "Content": " One of my best friends just underwent a breast reconstruction procedure that takes tissue from the buttocks instead of the tummy, so she said it was great because she got a butt lift and breast reconstruction at the same time. The procedure is called a \n procedure if anyone is interested. It worked out really well for her...she looks and feels great and had a pretty quick recovery. I think there are many doctors out there performing this one. ",
