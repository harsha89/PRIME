      "Content": " I was told 18 years ago that I had microcalcifications in my right breast. After my regular mammogram 2 weeks ago, I was asked to come back in to have it repeated on the right side. 2 days after that I was told that I needed a needle biopsy. There is no mass, only increased clusters that are suspicious of cancer. The Birad rating is 4. First of all, I am scared of a needle biopsy. I am afraid that if the microcalcifications are malignant, the biopsy could cause the cancer to spread. Then comes my family history. My paternal grandmother died from breast cancer in her 60s. My maternal grandmother had a mastectomy at age 19. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer (microcalcifications) at age 49 (I am 59). What I want, and my husband totally agrees, is a mastectomy...preferably a double mastectomy. I can honestly say that even if a pathology report showed no malignancy after both breasts were removed, I would have absolutely NO regrets...only relief that no cancer had spread and relief that I wouldn't have to worry about\n breast cancer any more. My only concern is seeing my little granddaughters grow up and getting to enjoy old age with my husband. I am meeting with the surgeon on Monday and the biopsy is scheduled for Tuesday. I am prepared to tell the surgeon no and to get a second opinion. I want to find a doctor that will do the double mastectomy and will write it up to meet the requirements of my insurance. How difficult do you think that will be? Thank you.\n(Note: I skipped my mammogram last year - too busy. During the last year, I have had pain in the outer quadrant of my right breast.) ",

      "Content": " Thank you to Harrington49, Bev, and Georgia. I will be meeting with a surgeon tomorrow afternoon. An acquaintance gave me the name of a breast specialist at M.D. Anderson as well as the name of 2 plastic surgeons that do reconstructive breast surgery at M.D. Anderson. Then over the weekend, my daughter, a registered nurse, ran into a family friend at the lake. The friend is a physician at M.D. Anderson. My daughter asked the doctor what she thought about\n the names the acquaintance had given me. She told my daughter that the recommended doctors were so outstanding that she would send her own mother to them. That makes me feel good. In the meantime, I will go ahead and have the biopsy on Tuesday morning, and then if the results confirm cancer, I will call M. D. Anderson to see how soon I can get in. I'm not sure about\n the reconstructive surgery. I mean...why bother? Is there a medical reason to have reconstructive surgery? ",

      "Content": " Well, now I just have to wait a week for the results. They said I might hear as early as next Monday. I took Xanax 50 mg. (not sure of spelling) about\n 15 min. before they started. The doctor and the 2 techs were very supportive. There was a little delay while they tried to figure out if they could do the procedure without me being on antibiotics because I don't have a spleen, but the thought of rescheduling and wasting more time did not appeal to me, so I said lets just go for it. I had 3 biopsies done with 3 tissue samples for each. The first was extremely painful, but I never felt the rest of the procedure. The tech scolded me about\n skipping my mammogram for 2 years, 2008 and 2009, but as I explained to her I only skipped 2009, and that I felt it had been ok to do so because there were no concerns in 2008. Plus the govt. said last year that women only need mammograms every other year. She replied that women should ignore that recommendation because it was stupid and life threatening. The whole procedure took 2 and a half hours and then I went home wearing steri strips and an ace bandage with an ice pack. Now I just have to wait. For some reason, I am very calm now even though I know the results can be bad. Please keep me in your prayers. Thank you. ",
