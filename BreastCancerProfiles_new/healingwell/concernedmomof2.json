Today I will be busy, (found out about\n my thyroid being abnormal too) going to my general doctor for synthroid medications, I will ask her for xanax or valium. Life is a rollercoaster, one day your up and one day your down....but I am going to try to stay positive. If I do have breast cancer, the survival rate for early stage is over 95%, with many years to live. Grateful to have many supporters in this forum :)\nI post results after 2/10. ",

My Biopsy is for 2/6/13. No family history of cancer on my moms side, my dads aunt had it. I scheduled a second opionion on a mammo with another center, before I get biopsy done.  Am I being to overly cautious? , also hoping the second doctor will say something different.",
