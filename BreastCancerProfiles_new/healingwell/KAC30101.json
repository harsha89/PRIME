      "Content": " Thanks again for your response, Sandra. WOW... you have been through a lot. Many prayers and good wishes sent your way...... for continued good health!\nI got a letter from Wellstar yesterday stating \"Your recent diagnostic mammogram on the area of concern was determined to be \"probably benign (probably not cancer) and the Radiologist has recommended a follow up mammogram in 6 months\"\nWow.... that's comforting. Not. \nNot sure if I should follow up with my Doc and ask WTH?? \njust curious.... How would you proceed? ",

      "Content": " Hi Everyone.... I'm new here too. I had my annual mammo the beginning of August and got the 'all clear' from the imagining center that same day. Then yesterday...... I got a call back. I had my mammo this year at a new imaging center and apparently they were just able to 'compare' my previous images with the new one from this year. I'm kinda confused. Why would they call it negative....... then tell me there is a 3mm area of concern? I was going through menopause with my last mammo... and now am post by 18 months. I get my diagnostic mammo tomorrow. Just kinda un-nerved. :(\nI DO however, feel better after reading all the posts. ",

      "Content": " Sandra... thank you!\nMy Doc did suggest the BRCA testing and I am undecided as to whether to proceed with it. I have always been tested annually and last year was the first time I had skipped a year. I am still uncertain as to whether I will repeat the mammogram in 6 months, or ask for an ultrasound on the area. I am reluctant to have 2 mammograms within 6 months of eachother. There is so much conflicting reporting on the number of mammograms preformed and the consequence of the radiation. Personally, I think the ultrasound is more reliable in instances such as mine. But, as I said.... I am thankful we have the technology for preventive care. I plan on using it! :) ",

      "Content": " Yes... VERY sound advice!\nI worry... like most all women do.... that one day I might have to face this. I'm not that attached to my breasts that I wouldn't consider getting them both taken off if it gave me the chance to live worry-free, to a certain extent.\nI may have the testing as I grow older.............. and yes, I think I would be prepared to act on the results. My maternal Grandmother had breast cancer also.\nI am pretty diligent about\n self exams and I'm very familiar with the way my breasts feel. I also get my yearly mammo's, but I know that 'things' still happen.\nBeen pondering this since last week. A lot.\nDid you have reconstructive surgery? That has to be a VERY major surgery, I am assuming.\nI hate seeing any woman having to make these decisions. So difficult................................... ",

      "Content": " Thank you, Sandra!\nYou were absolutely correct! The abnormality turned out to be a small lymph node right next to my chest wall... which was not picked up on my previous images from the year before. They want me to come back in 6 months to check it to make sure it hasn't changed. It's frightening. Just sitting in the 'waiting' area... to see the Radiologist..... all the women with fear on their face. It made me sad. Fortunately.,.... the technology is wonderful and if we are diligent with self exams and our yearly mammograms... these things can be caught early. This lymph node was only 3 mm, so if it had been something... it would have been treatable.\nMy Sister (younger) has BC two years ago. She had not had a mammo for 8 years. Her tumor was 3.5 cm by the time she had her mammo. She is fine..... but it was a good lesson learned.\nThank you again for your response. I appreciated it. ",
