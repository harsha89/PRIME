      "Content": " \n  Thanks Judy for your feedback.  I'm meeting with the surgeon on wed. this week to go over everything.  I'm hoping it is not going to be too long of a process or too painful.  I'm sorry that you  had to go through all of that!  God Bless You and keep you well.  You'll be in my thoughts and prayers.\n ",
