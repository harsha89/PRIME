      "Content": " Hi Reddevil11,\nI know it's hard to do, but try to keep yourself busy with the positive aspects in your life: time with children, loved ones, your community and make time for yourself.\nWhile the time passes until you receive your mammogram and ultrasound, just remember... and this too will pass.\nAs others above mentioned, this may only be a cyst. At this point; waiting anxiety is doing more harm to you than perhaps what you're waiting to hear that may not be there.\nVirtual Hug sent to you. ",
