    "Content": " I had my annual mammo today and my left breast is filled with microcalcifications. I was an x-ray tech for 25 yrs and as soon as the film came up on the view box I knew what was going on.\nWhat upset me more than anything is that I was told it will be next week before I hear from anyone on what the next step, if any, is. That doesn't set well with me so I have been on the phone all afternoon trying to get things moving along.\nWhat is the best course of action an ultrasound or biopsy? \nThanks so much. ",
