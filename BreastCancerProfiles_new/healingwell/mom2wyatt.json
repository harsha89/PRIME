      "Content": " Hi girls. I made it to my doctor appointment. My doc didn't see any \"red flags\" with the lumps but he said the issues I've been having isn't normal so I am scheduled for a mammogram on Friday and leaving it to the radiologists discretion if he wants to do the ultrasound too. So, I feel ok - still not relieved since the lumps weren't my biggest concern - so now more waiting.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " I did explain everything to him.. i went back to my RE because he's awesome and knew he would follow through like i wanted. He was concerned and said what was happening wasn't normal but he didn't find any alarming lumps - but since everything else wasn't quite normal and that my breasts were so \"busy\" that he wanted to make sure there isn't something going on in there. \nThanks for being there in spirit. I don't have anyone to go with me, stinks.\nHugs,\nMichele ",

      "Content": " I sure hope you don't mind me coming here.. it being Saturday it's driving me crazy before I can talk to the doctor on Monday. Here is my deal. I've always had cystic breasts no matter what time of the month so always hard for me to distingish what kind of lumps and if they've been there or not. Well this is the new stuff happening.. I've noticed some breast changes... in my left breast, it's becoming increasingly painful in one spot up top, and the skin seems to be different now like softer or something there is lumps in there but don't know if they are new or not. My breast does seem to be bigger than normal and now the pain has turned into burning. \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
