      "Content": " I just got a call back regarding my annual mamogram yesterday. I was freaking out a bit and came online to calm my nerves. I felt that the changes from last year to this year must have to do with menopause\n because I haven't had a period in almost 2 years. I am 52. Just reading through this thread has made me feel better. I am going in today at 1:30. I am luck that I don't have to wait. That would make me nuts. ",

      "Content": " Everything turned out ok. I had to have 3 more pictures and then a sonogram due to dense breasts. The law in CT now requires insurance companies to pay for it so they did it. I guess I am good for another year. Thanks for your concern and for being here for those of us that need support!! ",
