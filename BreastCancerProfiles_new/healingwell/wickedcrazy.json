    "Content": " Hi, ok..first of all, breath.. If your radiology or primary doctor called to schedule for your appt to Ã¾he surgeon, it can go that quickly. They have times built in the schedule and often multiple surgeons so that you may get in quickly. I even recently called a neurosurgeon after a referral there to see how quickly I could be seen as a new patient. They saw me the next day! I was in shock/concern myself. I don't know anything about\n ultrasounds, but I do know about\n breast scares and it turned out to be nothing. You are headed in the right direction. A good doctor does care about\n his patients and will see you quickly, just because he knows how anxious the wait will make you. My thoughts and prayers are with you. Take care and do what you need to do. ((Hugs)) amy ",
