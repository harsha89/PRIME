    "Content": " I'd love to know if PT helps. A nurse had suggested that I have PT but I haven't made up my mind just yet. It's been almost nine months since I had a bilateral mastectomy. I thought the pain would be gone by this time but it hasn't happened. Pain meds haven't really helped and I don't want to keep taking them anyway. PT sounds like a good option, if it helps.\nThanks.
