WRONG........there are so many different kinds and stages.....The garden type is ductal, which makes up about 80% of all breast cancer.......I had lobular, which occurs in about 10%......then there are all other types.  I had my biopsy in February and they found some bad cells that were not cancer, but were going to turn into cancer and so I had a lumpectomy on March 9th.  Almost by accident they found the lubular cancer that was invasive (gone into the tissue).  Just last Wednesday I had another lumpectomy and a sentinal node biopy to check my lymph nodes.  They got all the cancer and the nodes were clear.  I was very lucky.  Today was the first day I have been out and am going to work tomorrow.  I am 58 and had a massive heart attack almost 10 years ago and have a stent.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks everyone for your support. I have stayed in all weekend until today......the first day of spring.....I went out to the grocery store and bought $138.00 worth of food, including 2 bottles of wine. I do remember my Surgeon saying that they all meet on Monday nights and go over all cases and he knew there would be one Doctor who would say I needed a mastectomy, but he did not think all others would agree. Little bits of our conversation are just now coming back to me. He did say something about putting blue die in regarding the lymph nodes. It that the sentinel node biopsy that Lori mentioned? I have been on the computer all weekend, reading about Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. Is this a common type? I was thinking my doctor said it was not. I really feel like I should do something, but I don't know what. I am just waiting.......but I don't know what I am waiting on. Can ya'll give me some ideas about what I should be doing? I had absolutely no trouble with the lumpectomy. I feel I could have gone back to work the next day, but had the surgery on Wednesday and went back to work on Monday. How long is the recovery for most?......Do I need someone to stay with me? Is there a place I can read about what really happens?....My Surgeon is with the Blumental Cancer Center in Charlotte and he is supposed to be one of the best. I can't remember if he said he would call me after their meeting tomorrow night or not. I think I heard the word cancer and went deaf!......Thanks everyone for listening to me ramble....... ",
