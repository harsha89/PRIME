    "Content": " Had 3d mammogram on the 5th. Got callback on the 9th. Went for follow up on the 12th. Has anyone who got callback after a 3d mammogram been diagnosed with benign findings? How accurate are the 3d mammograms? Very anxious. Just wish they would tell me what they saw and why they are looking.\n ",
