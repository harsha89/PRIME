    "Content": " I am 37 years old and have had 5 lumps removed from my left breast and axillary area over 3 and 5 years ago all benign,  I have been having breast pain in the left breast for over a month that is increasing in intensity gradually.  The pain is not in the area of the previous lumps.  I have had a complete hysterectomy in 06. When reading about\n IBC I decided to actually visually look at myself and was surprised to see how much larger my left breast is now as well as changes in the areola.  My left breast also feels very heavy. My aunt and grandmother died of breast cancer not sure if I should be worried. ",
