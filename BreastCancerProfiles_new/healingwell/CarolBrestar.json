      "Content": " Looking for help and answers regarding Tamoxifen!\n01/04/12 I was diag with IDC stage 3 in my right breast with 3 positive Axillary lymph nodes, went though 15 weeks of chemo, had both breast removed 06/21/12, did 30 treatments of radiation. In Oct I had a major energy increase, pain was lessening and I was starting to think a bit clearly. Then in 11/12 I started Tamoxifen! My live has been a living heXX ever since the Tamoxifen. I have body pain, low energy, tiered all the time, memories loss, lack of concentration, HOT flashes, some mood swings. We have yet to find a something to help with the pain! I do PT and yoga, hot baths and massages.\nWhat I am wondering is since both my breast are gone what is the purpose of taking Tamoxifen? I really am not a big fan of the status quoe or just because its been don't this way for years means it works for me. I have had darn near every side effect (well the not as common ones) I seem to get. Please for give the whining! I am just at my wits end as to what to do next! Any suggestions are WELCOMED!\nI guess I should add that I Am post menopausal and had a hysterectomy but left my ovaries.\nThank you for any and all insight! Yes I know that we cant offer Medical advise I'm just looking for suggestions and feedback.\nThank you all! \n ",
