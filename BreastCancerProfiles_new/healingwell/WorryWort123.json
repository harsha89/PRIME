      "Content": " I had a mammogram in early February and have had to wait a month for special views and an ultrasound.  The reason they gave me was a clarity issue and unclear image of breast.  They told me this was common as I had not had a previous mammogram for comparison.  I have been worried sick, can't sleep, thinking the worst.  Is this common or something to be concerned about\n. They also told me 80% of women referred for further testing end up being ok.  Also went on to say that only 1  out of 10 have cancer after further testing.\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks, it is easier said that done not to worry and constantly think about\n it.  The numbers that were given to me are from the Breast Screening Clinic and the technician that did the mammogram.  She told me it was a problem with clarity issue with mammogram and the fact that I had not had previous mammogram.  Worrying doesn't do any good but you always think the worst.
