    "Content": " Had my first mammogram at 45, found microcalcs in R breast. Did stereo biopsy, pathology was negative. 6 month followup clear, then yearly clear. This year, now age 50, showed new microcalcs, this time L breast. Branching of cells....Stereo biopsy again. They had trouble getting it as it was along chest wall. Pathology shows DCIS, but contained. Radiologists recommended surgery. Surgeon appt on Monday.\nDoesn't stereotactic biopsy usually take the microcalc out? What's left to surgically remove? I thought I'd just have to do radiation.\nNot sure how much weight to give my mothers breast cancer. She's stage IV, hers was lobular with a large tumor, stage IIIb when diagnosed 4 years ago ",
