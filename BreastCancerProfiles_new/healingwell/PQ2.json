      "Content": " Stage IV with lobular triple negative (ugh) but mets to vertebrae are described by onc as \"very very\" early. Taxol and Zometa to shrink, then surgery. Have tons of faith this is going to give me time -- doc says years, and I'm choosing to believe her. Have also learned to be very careful about\n what you read on the Internet. Survival rates are affected by speed of treatment, protocol, type and \nlocation of mets...have read a number of articles from major cancer centers pointing out how important it is to remember survival rates are averages and can be significantly higher based on certain criteria. Have learned enough to know I \"wish I had\" (whoever wished for something like this) estrogen positive but also onc says a new drug is coming out in a year for us tripl negative folks that shows enormous promise. Anyone out there with IV triple neg? ",

      "Content": " Love to hear those stories! And in fact I've heard more and more. Interesting that once you get into the real medical information (as opposed to the stuff written in short sentences) that there is a lot more about\n survival in Stage IV...the many factors that affect it. Never say \"just a stage II\" survivor. We all fight the fight, no matter the diagnosis and we all fight the fear, noÂ  matter the number. I've pretty much decided it's just a number, and I deal with each day as it comes. the chronic illness comparison is an excellent one and hey, I can live with that! ",
