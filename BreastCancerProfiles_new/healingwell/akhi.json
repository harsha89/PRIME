    "Content": " Hi ,\nMy mother 53 (perimenopausal) felt painful lump 2 weeks back. Mamo showed benign findings but after aspiration a residue is felt so the breast surgeon has asked for a follow up mamo after 15 days of anti biotics. Also the fluid was very thick but yellow and discarded. Is there a chance of Cancer even after a BIRAD-2 Mamo? ",
