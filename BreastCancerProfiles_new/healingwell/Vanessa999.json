    "Content": " Take a deep breath....calcifications are not uncommon. I am a breast cancer survivor and I know how scary all this is. Until you get the biopsy and know for sure if you are facing a problem, don't drive yourself crazy...stress is bad for your immune system. It sounds like you have had more than your share but be as positive as you can. There is an excellent cancer support site www.whatnext.com if you want additional information. I will be thinking good thoughts for you! ",
