    "Content": " Hi, I'm 36 years old and I've never really had any issues with my breasts before and unfortunately don't have any family history regarding breast cancer because I was adopted. I have been on hormone replacement therapy for six years after losing my ovaries to PCOS and I know that can increase your risk. Over the last while I have noticed some concerning changes to one of my breasts. The first is that it is quite painful, especially when squeezed closer towards the aereola and the nipple. I honestly have not been that great at doing self exams so I am not sure what I am feeling for when I am checking for lumps. There is a spot to behind my nipple and towards the armpit side of my breast that feels very hard and does not move when I press on it or squeeze it. It\u2019s about\n the size of a quarter. The pain is actually really intense when I squeeze it or push onit and sometime I experience a burning sensation in the tissue in that area.\nOther odd changes I have noticed are I keep getting red bumps around the bottom of my aereola that at first I thought were pimples but they can't be popped and they eventually turn a really deep purple color and they won't heal. I also have had my nipples pierced for about\n 7 years. The ring on the breast with the issues has been pushed out. It wasn't infected or oozing any liquids or anything it just got pushed out of the skin over the course of a couple on months. I thought that was very odd as my other one is fine. I can\u2019t think of any reason why this would happen\nAnyways, I'm really scared of doctors and I don't know if I'm being alarmist as I really don't know if what I'm feeling is actually a lump or if the symptoms I'm experiencing are actually symptoms of anything at all. So I thought I'd post here and see if I could get some feedback. Thanks in advance for your h ",
