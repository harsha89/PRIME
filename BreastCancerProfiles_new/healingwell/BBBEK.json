      "Content": " Am 6 1/2 year breast cancer survivor of cancer in my lumpectomy inright breast.  Had check up in October and all was clear.  Went to Dr. yesterday due to upper respiratory infection and she did not like the way I looked so did a complete physical.  Upon examining my left breast she detected a lump.  The look on her face when she found it scared me to death.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks so much for all of your support.  On Friday I went and had mamo done on both breasts.  Tech brought films to be read by radiologist immediately and came back and whisked me off to Ultrasound.  Of course I am fearing the worst.  No one would tell me anything.  They just told me I would be hearing from my doctor later in the day.  Of course this is at 9:00 on a Friday morning!  No call all weekend or on Monday.\n \n \n \n ",
