      "Content": " Hi I\u2019m Jenifer, I\u2019m 27 years old. Single mother of a 5-year-old boy. Recently I have exposed that both of my breasts leak... only when squeezed a clear fluid comes out\n But I have no pain in my breast; I do my works on routine ground. I have read lots of articles about\n it, so I know I really don\u2019t have to worry. My doctor said the same obsession... but it affects my ordinary life between me and my husband... always worry, and uncomfortable, \nhow to make it stop... I\u2019m not on any birth control\n--------------------------------\n ",
