    "Content": " I am Thirty years old. For about\n a month I have had some aches around my left breast. The pain will come and last for a few seconds and then go away. I have checked my breast and do not feel any lumps. The odd thing to is when I lay on my left side I feel air bubbles moving around under my breast. I had an EKG which ruled out heart issues. Anyone know what it could be? Thanks ",
