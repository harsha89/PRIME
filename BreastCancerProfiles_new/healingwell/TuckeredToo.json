      "Content": " Thanks...I have a clotting disorder and have had several Pulmonary Embolisms...I have to be on the Warafin for life and am only taken off it for the day of my surgery.  I was told that one of the major complications from reconstruction was bleeds, even for women that aren't on blood thinners.  Most research I have done shows I am not a candidate.  I ran into a woman today who is on Tamoxifen and says she doesn't feel so bad, so I guess I will give the Arimidex another thought.  This may sound wierd, but even though I know I have breast cancer, I have never felt like I have breast cancer.  I know taking the Arimidex and having my ovaries out is important, but I am kinda living my life and relatively \"unaffected\" by it all.  Is the risk of a reoccurrence that high?  My sister had her breast cancer at 32 and she is now 43 without any sign of a return.  Maybe I am not taking this as seriously as I should, but I feel fine.

      "Content": " There is no familial link between cervical and breast cancer.  Only between ovarian and uterine.  My younger sister had cervical cancer at 30 and my other sister had breast cancer at 32.  My mother passed away from ovarian cancer last month.  My risk is only affected by the ovarian and the breast.  I had a six month watch on my left breast and grew a 2 cm tumor in that period. It was not there at my last mammogram.  I had the ultrasound needle biopsy and found it to be a lot easier to tolerate than the wire needle (done while you are in the mammogram machine) or the stereotactic biopsy (done while you are lying on a table with your breast hanging through a hole,kinda like an oil change).  The best thing to do is get the biopsy done and find out what you are dealing with.  It is not easy to wait for news, as you know and cancer scares everyone once they have been affected by it.  I wish you well and will keep you in my prayers.
