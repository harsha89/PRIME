    "Content": " Hello everyone, I' am Harley 26's fifteen year old daughter. I' am proud to say that she is my mother and that she has fought tremendously hard to beat Crohns down. But it breaks my heart to know that she has another severe illness to fight off. I have seen her suffer my whole life it seems to me, and I DON'T want to see her suffer anymore! But I have to continue to remind myself that I have no control over it, only God does. I quote from Possitive's words, \"God will never put more on you than can be handled\". The both of us have expirienced that first hand, it may seem like there is so much coming down on you at once, but then there's always a solution that comes up somewhere when you least expect it. It discourages me when I see her so down and down-grading herself, about\n how she's going to lose her hair and she won't want to leave the house. Today, we went to the store to get a few things, and we looked at some hats....she went and tried one on and took one look at herself and sat down, crying a little. I couldn't do anything to get her attention to even look at me so I could tell her everything was going to be fine and she was worrying about\n things too soon. I tried to be goofy, yet all it seemed to do was irritate her. Yes, I know that it's the illness, moods, and medicines causing the majority of the stuff, I've heard that a million times. But I can't stand to see her put herself down, and I' am trying to give her all the support I can muster, but I apparrently don't have the mental abilities to see into her mind to find out what WILL work to calm her down. I thank all of you who responded to her and the ones who have yet to come. She needs all the support she can get from everyone and I appreitiate it so much. I love you all and may God be with you! ",
