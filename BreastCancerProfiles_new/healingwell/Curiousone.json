The removal went well the Dr. removed a mass the size of a kidney bean. After the surgery the Dr. said that she is 99.8% certain that it is not cancerous but she was still going to send it for testing. I can't tell you what a relief it was to hear that. Just thought I would update and thank you all again. ",
