    "Content": " I am 60. \nI have health insurance with $5,000 deductible - living off my savings. \nHad mammogram, then ultrasound, found .6 x .3 x .6cm - now they want to do fine needle aspiration. \nTold me it was thick fluid and if fine needle doesn't work then Core Aspiration. \nI can't talk to my doctor - long story - not a good doctor. \nThey told me just the fine needle aspiration alone is $4,600 (not counting Core aspiration, doctors, etc). \nMy question - do I really need to have an aspiration with it being so small? \nCan I wait until next mammogram (9 months) to see if any change? \nThank you for any assistance.
