      "Content": " Working the health field (mods pls read carefully) it is my medical opinion that many doctors tend to think light of things. You should of seen the battle I had with a doctor over my patient today! I have a patient who is having a severe side effect from a medication and I started to ween them off the medication. My patient has told doctor of all side effects, to where they can not even hold fluid down for two months to no avail. Hence why I started the weening process. He has remarkably improved, so it is the medication. The doctor had a fit, and I looked at him and said \"he has told you repeatedly, you chose to ignore. he is down to 70 lbs, from 150 lbs despite me adding ensure, and other liquid carbs.\" I won the battle, and got the med changed to a lesser potent thing. \nThe doctors don't want to alarm you, so they leave out information. I personally feel like kicking them back into med school, but that is me. I have a wonderful primary - who will take the time to listen as well as explain. Truthfully, there is risks with any medication (including local and general anestesia) - but its up to the body of how it is handled. Everyone reacts differently. My other half can take a benedryl and be knocked out like a sleeping baby. He can take a percocet (which was extremely a riot) after his surgery - and he acts high, bounces off walls, mixes sentences, changes thoughts and crashes. I had to convince him to lay down and close his eyes by saying I'd lay with him if he did what I said. Seriously, he was out by the time he hit the pillow. He had no memory of calling my cell phone repeatedly, talking funny, running up and down the stairs, getting into the icecream, riding the bicycle in the dining room. Course - I took a video to prove he was hysterical! Then I took the percocet away, and gave him Tylenol. Now me, I take percocet regulary and have no side effects - I don't go crazy. \nEveryone is different hon, don't forget that. Everyone handles things, including medications differently. I hope you are the one that doesn't experiencing any problems. I work respite (home care) for a living, despite my fibromyalgia and chemotherapy. I also believe in full honesty, with everyone including my patients.\n\"The Walking Medical Mystery\"\nToo many Allergies / Too many RXs & DXs\nA Rare Gem for Doctors and Guinee Pig\n~Medical Caregiver and Doctors Worse Nightmare~ ",

      "Content": " I would check with Teaching Hospitals. For Example, here, in Oregon OHSU (Oregon Health and Science University). \nThe reason why I recommend teaching hospitals is because I have personal experience in my chemotherapy with them. I find there new technology better, training and hospitality better, and teaching hospitals have the latest medical training, they have more studies with new medications, there are medical libraries people can go to and do research. I have something that affects every 1 out of 500,000 and OHSU figured out what it was and what treatment I needed, the local hospital to me didn't know what it was despite me being there for a week, doctors didn't know. \nI have a couple of friends who love cancer centers of america as well. \nAlso, just so you know, there are chemotherapy agents in many medications and then there is chemotherapy. A tidbit I learned in the past 4 years in chemotherapy. The chemotherapy is stronger in chemotherapy verses the chemotherapy agents. IE: (just an example) Take asprin say it had 3% of chemotherapy agents in it and then X had 99% of chemotherapy agents. The asprin isn't considered chemotherapy because of how much percentage is in it. Now X is a chemotherapy cuz of how much is in it. So the asprin would only have chemotherapy agents in it. That is just an example, I highly doubt asprin does have it.

But here's the catch, I'm in chemotherapy, I'm a diabetic, can't have dairy, only can have soy in moderation. What I want from you hopefully?  I am looking into diets, well obviously. My oncologist said he hasnt done research but knows certain foods are good for certain things... I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction.  ",

The reason why I'm saying not to wory is because I went in and out two weeks to the doctor, finally one ordered an mri and set me to the hospital. I never made it out, was sent up to another hospital and 2 weeks later i was on the table getting an emergency biopsy. 2 weeks later I was on chemotherapy. Your looking at 6 weeks I knew.

      "Content": " The mass can be anything.... extra fiber tissues... oh I forgot that name, and I get the extra fiber tissues too. There is also two different types of cancer, as my radiation doctor says.... \"You have cancer, whether it is cancerous or benign cancer is another story\". Could even be inflammation. You really don't know. As for giving your background, in all honesty, yes I work the med field, but I am not a doctor so I will decline to answer. You need to go over that with your doctor, and that is my medical opinion to go ask your doctor about\n that. But I do know on personal, and medical experience that if they are making you wait til November, it will be good news. Its when they call you within the first week of getting results back that something is usually wrong.\n IE: I went in for having 2 or 3 (cant remember) straight months of menestration (it never stopped) then I didnt have menstration. After those few months, I decided ok I gotta get checked out, went and got checked. Got labs, and a problem was found. Within a couple days I got a call saying \"we need you to come in for an ultrasound of your thyroid.\" I am like sure when, and was told the following morning. I do the ultrasound, a week later Im back at the doctor and she says (normally have a male but over rided him for a female for female issues) that she sent in a request for an endo dr and that I need to go as soon as I can. Within a week of that... I'm on thyroid medication from the endo dr. You see what I mean on how it is a lot faster if something is seriously wrong? Its like boom boom boom. \nAlso, ask your PCP (primary doctor) to do blood work. Because I will tell you if it is as you fear, the results will show up in a full panel of blood work. Full panel, is testing for everything, especially white cell and red cell counts. Normally when your white cell count is high, it means something and feels like you got the flu. Mods, that is on personal experience.\nHon, I am only a caregiver, and I dropped my patient load to one patient after I started my chemotherapy. You really should sit down with your doctor and ask these questions.\n\"The Walking Medical Mystery\"\nToo many Allergies\nToo many RXs & DXs\nA Rare Gem for Doctors and Guinee Pig ",

I don't have breast cancer, but the fact remains, this is the only cancer forum here. I have eye cancer. I'd rather go lose my breasts any day than my eyes. When I was scared, is when i went for my results and my doctor came in with his head down and face looking really stricken. Thats when I started going \"no no no no\" over and over. He grabbed me and held me. I will always hold a special place in my heart for that surgeon. He is truelly a special one to take the time to hold me and let me cry. And he said \"I'm sorry\" over and over. After calming down, he also told me he saw some wierd stuff during my biopsy. He explained that he saw something there, it looked like cancer but he wasn't sure because of the way it presented. I have two things in my growths, one being inflammation. You can talk to me any time, and you can email me. I will be here for you. The reason why I hang out in this forum is I figured we all knew what cancer was like, and we all been through some kind of form of treatment thats similar.\n\"The Walking Medical Mystery\"\nToo many Allergies / Too many RXs & DXs\nA Rare Gem for Doctors and Guinee Pig\n~Medical Caregiver and Doctors Worse Nightmare~ ",

We wont ring you 2 months later if it is serious. You'd get a call within the first 2 weeks results came back to come in faster. For example, I had menastration for 2 months straight, then no menstration for another 2 months. I finally sucked it up and went to the doctor. She did labs on me, 3 days later I get a call from an ultrasound clinic saying they need me to come in for ultrasounds of my thyroid. The next week I'm back at the doctors office for results and got \"you are going to a specialist we put in the refferall today.\" In the next week, I'm at the specialist, and found out that I only needed medication to fix things. Now, it is very normal for me to get extra fiber lumps in my bosom, they go away over time.

      "Content": " Mommy, I'm extremely blunt, so please don't take alarm in what I say.\nFirst off, a lump is a lump. There are two types of cancer (hear me out mods). An adnormal growth (like a lump) can be either Benign Cancer (just a tumor and no alarm will prob go away on its own) or Cancerous Cancer (yikes). 99% of the time it is Benign (no worries). \nIn my honest opinion, I'd do a MRI and ultrasound as well as blood work (such as CBC CHEM 20, etc). I personally never had breast cancer, BUT, I am in Chemotherapy. I personally know how scared you are, as each and everyone else here does. If the MRI shows a hard growth, then get a biopsy.\nTry thinking of it this way: say Elmo had a growth in their chest and didn't get a biospy. A year later Elmo dies unexpectedly. Why? Turns out the growth was cancerous and it spread all through the body and became terminal. So is it really worth putting the doctors off and worrying? \nAlso, I get many lumps in my BIG bosom too, they are usually just lumps that go away which are benign. \nBetter safe than sorry.\n\"The Walking Medical Mystery\"\nToo many Allergies / Too many RXs & DXs\nA Rare Gem for Doctors and Guinee Pig\n~Medical Caregiver and Doctors Worse Nightmare~ ",
