      "Content": " Hi all. I had two stereotactic biopsies on July 3 for two areas of microcalcifications in my right breast. I was told one group was starting to \"line up.\" I could actually see them - six little dots in a row. The radiologist couldn't make out their shape. The second was a cluster within some dense tissue (I have very dense breasts). I've had other biopsies in the past as well. One excisional (fibroadenoma) in 1999, right breast, one ultrasound guided (fibroadenoma) 2006 right breast, one needle aspiration (cyst) 2006 left breast, stereotactic 2010 (microcalcifications - fibrocystic changes) right breast. I'm 48 years old. The biopsies I had on July 3 came back as fibrocystic changes. I was very worried because of the calcs that were in a line for the one area, I was worried because there were TWO areas of calc, and I was also freaked out because the radiologist used the words \"of intermediate concern\" for both areas that were to be biopsied (I didn't ask, but probably was a BIRAD 4B). That of course is better than highly suspicious (4C or 5), but still, there was not one point during this last round of biopsies when any of my providers (2 radiologists, my GYN or any nurses) told me not to be worried.\nI wanted to share my story because sometimes what doesn't look to be good turns out okay. I have a grandmother who had two separate instances of BC, and many biopsies leading up to her diagnosis. As I was reading through stories on this site and others about\n microcalcifications, I hadn't come across anyone who had had as many biopsies as I have had at my age, but I'm sure there are many who have. Just in case you are reading this and are getting more scared about\n the number you have had, a good outcome can happen. ",
