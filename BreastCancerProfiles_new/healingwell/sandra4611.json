There are pain clinics that are trained in relieving that kind of pain. Another option to look into acupuncture. I've had it and it truly does work.

      "Content": " I had it 6 months ago. It sounds worse than it is. It doesn't hurt and the hardest part for me was trying to get comfortable before they started. They let me shift around a bunch until I was sure I was in a position that I could deal with for about\n an hour. If you can take in an iPod with headphones, it will help distract you and pass the time. You'll be staring at the wall for a long time and listening to the doc and nurses below you exchange info and numbers that make no sense. That was a little unnerving because you don't know what is happening. (I hadn't talked to anyone who'd had it before I did so my imagination was running wild.)\nThey give you a little shot of lidocaine which stings for a second. No big deal at all. They make a tiny incision and give you another anesthetic that will numb your whole breast for the rest of the day. After that you will hear the noise of the equipment whirring or compressing, but you don't feel a thing. Really. \nOnce they are finished taking the samples (I had 20 taken) they put in a tiny titanium marker. Since the majority of biopsies are benign, it will show up on subsequent mammograms or MRI's so they will know exactly where the biopsy was done the previous year. Also if you have a lumpectomy, the marker guides them to the right place. You don't feel the marker and it doesn't prevent you from going through airport security or prevent you from having MRI's, etc. \nWhen they are finished, they put a steri strip over the little cut and you go to another room for a regular mammogram to make sure the titanium clip shows up correctly. That's it. Takes about\n an hour start to finish. May be less if you don't have as many samples taken.\nAfter the numbing medicine wore off that night, the breast felt achy. I took some Tylenol and it was gone the next day. A week later I went back to have them check the little cut. I had a small bruise and a little tiny blister there. No big deal. No discomfort. The cut had healed already. I got a Band-Aid and left.\nGood luck! ",

Get your body healed first and have some down time from all this chaos.

He had me wait for two months after #3 to even talk to me about\n surgery #4 and now there will be another month wait til he does it. I want him to combine two repairs (muscles and pocket work) in the same area into one surgery so I don't have to have a #5, but he is reluctant and will only say he will \"consider\" it. With a history of infection, he said he would rather not have more than one area of incisions. That will obviously reduce the chances of another infection, but not eliminate it. Of course, having general anesthesia again is not without complications either. I hate it that cancer takes away our choices. ",

It's well known that your frame of mind can affect your healing capabilities. \nI can understand a bit of your situation because I also had complications after BMX and immediate placement of implants. I developed an infection on post op day one that would not respond to antibiotics until the 3rd change. A lot of damage had already been done but the new antibiotic stopped the infection and reversed some pending necrosis. On day 14 I went back to surgery and they removed the tissue, skin, and parts of three muscles under my left arm and on the side of the left implant. The implant was removed since there was no longer enough good skin to cover it, and a tissue expander was put in. After three months of saline injections and pain to expand the skin and another month of waiting, the tissue expander was exchanged for a smaller implant. The implant on the other side was now twice as big, so that side had to be reconstructed. I am 5 weeks out from that 3rd surgery with 2 more repair surgeries to come. I have a lot of nerve damage from 3 surgeries in 4 1/2 months. I have to have a surgery to repair my underarm and side, and another one to try to repair the muscles that prevent movement from the top of my former breast to my shoulder.\nBreast cancer certainly isn't for sissies, is it?\nI have read about\n the many problems smokers have with healing and know that some doctors want the patient to be at least six months smoke-free before they will do surgery.

They hired a Chinese doctor and my mother did not approve because of what she'd been taught. After seeing people being helped, she had to admit there must be something to it. She ended up quitting and going to work for Dr. Ho when he set up his own practice. I had elbow tendonitis that did not respond to any kind of treatment for a year.

There didn't seem to be any point going through that when a safe saline implant would work fine. \nI was not at all attached to having breasts.

      "Content": " Kaz62,\nWe've been in your shoes and certainly understand like no one else could. I've never heard it said that it was common to get a call back after your first mammogram. The mammo you are going to get next week will focus on a certain area and magnify it a bit so the radiologist can see it easier. The vast majority of people who get called back never have a biopsy. If you do have to have a biopsy, it's truly no big deal, not painful, just nerve wracking. Biopsies are negative the majority of the time. \nYou may also be asked to have an ultrasound or a MRI. They are just trying to make sure everything is ok. Those darned calcifications we women get as we grow older can be confused with early stage, non-invasive DCIS so look at your call back as a good thing. If it IS something, they will find it very early. Better than having a radiologist who is sloppy and doesn't bother following up. That happens. \nI got called back at about\n your age because of calcifications. The magnification mammo proved it was nothing. They compare your next year's mammo to this one you just had so they don't call you back again unless they see something new. It was ten years before I got a call back again because the calcifications increased in a normal way. This year there were changes so I got called back. \nThe radiologist report will have a BI-RADS score, 1 thru 6, which is their recommendation for whether or not you should have a biopsy. The BI-RADS score doesn't mean you have cancer, and being sent for a biopsy doesn't mean they expect to find cancer. You might just have dense breasts that are hard to diagnose. Your doctor or the radiologist will explain all this to you. \nBe worried, be concerned, but don't panic. It's too early. The vast majority of women who get a call back do not have cancer. The vast majority who are sent for a biopsy do not have cancer. Breathe. Keep in touch and let us know what happens. ",

In the 2 months since then, he has been with me at every appointment and procedure. \nBreast cancer is usually not painful. It's a good thing you have a follow up planned. Breasts develop calcifications as we age - it's normal. On a mammogram, they are usually tiny bright white round \"pearls\" scattered around the breast. Radiologists look for calcifications that are oddly shaped or close together. They compare current and previous mammograms as well. Many women have quite dense breast tissue which makes it harder to see these changes. \nMost of the time when they see something that isn't clear to them, they ask for a second mammogram that will magnify the area of concern. Ultrasounds are not as commonly used but are certainly helpful. Most women will have a biopsy next. Today a stereotactic breast biopsy is done. They give you a little lidocaine that stings a minute, but that's it. I found it completely painless. The incision is tiny, 1/3\", and closed with a steri strip. I had 12 areas of concern in one area so they took 12 tiny samples and found cancer is 8 of them. That means that 4 areas had no cancer at all even though they looked like the other ones. That's why they need the biopsy...to make sure. Lot's of women have a completely negative biopsy and your wife could be one of those.\nThe pathologist will check the biopsy samples and if they find cancer, they will identify the kind and stage of development. Mine was small and confined to a duct in my breast, DCIS, stage 0, but identified as an aggressive type. The usual treatment for that kind of cancer if a lumpectomy, where they take out the tumor and some adjacent tissue, followed by radiation. Chemotherapy might be added. She will likely be given hormone therapy, Tamoxifen, for 5 years afterwards. All that sounded awful to me, so I chose a mastectomy. No radiation or chemo would be needed. I took it one step further by choosing to have the other breast removed as well. I decided I didn't want to deal with worry that the cancer would come back or show up in the other breast. \nI also chose immediate reconstruction which was done via by a plastic surgeon right after the general surgeon was finished with the double mastectomy. Implants were placed. Not all women are candidates for this and have tissue expanders placed instead. Weekly saline injections slowly expand the tissue so it can accommodate an implant a few months later. \nSome women do not want to lose their breast so they would never make the same decision as I did. There is no right or wrong. Every woman is different. Let us know what happens. ",

It's still there but is not growing. No surgery planned.\nI got diagnosed with DCIS breast cancer July 18th and had a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction August 23rd. Prior to surgery I had 2 mammograms and an MRI with contrast to make sure there was no cancer in the other breast. None was found but I wanted the bilateral MX anyway. Imagine my surprise when the pathology report showed cancer in the \"good side\" too! It was a different kind, LCIS, but more concerning because of the link to other kinds of cancer. I've since learned that LCIS is harder to diagnose in dense breasts but it still amazes me they missed it completely. Unfortunately I've talked to many more women lately who've had the same experience. \nThe oncologist said I had made the right decision and that no chemo or rads or hormone therapy would be needed since the cancer was caught and removed before it became invasive & sentinel node biopsy showed no lymph involvement.\nI don't understand why women with cancer that is not yet invasive go through a lumpectomy (often a re-excision as well), 7 weeks of radiation 5 days a week, and 5 years of Tamoxifen, all the while crossing their fingers that it won't come back or show up in the other breast. With a double mastectomy, it's over and done. No further treatment. \nDCIS cannot grow in the tiny bit of breast tissue that might remain because that tiny bit doesn't contain a duct. LCIS can't grow because there are no more lobules. Doesn't mean you don't have a tiny change (1-2%) of some other kind of cancer showing up in the bit of tissue, but it won't be IDC or LDC or a recurrence of DCIS or LCIS. ",

That's the last thing you will feel. After you are numb on that little patch of skin, they will put in another kind of numbing medication that numbs the entire breast for several hours and make a TINY cut in the skin - mine was less than 1/2\" at most. You don't even know it's happening. You will hear the equipment moving and the doctor and nurse speaking to each other about\n positioning it. They biopsied 12 places on me. They will place a little marker in the area they biopsied and it's over. I had a two steri-strips over the cut and a bandage that stayed until the next week when I went back to have them check it and get the results. That night after the numbing wore off, I took some Tylenol because my breast felt a little achy down deep. \nThere is absolutely nothing to be scared of.

If you had symptoms of one of the aggressive cancers it would be different, but you don't, so you can relax a little. Your doctor is wrong...young women do get breast cancer...just not as often. It's statistically more likely in women over 60, so it's not the first thing doctors look for in someone your age. The family history you state is not a factor. The only family history that counts is a first degree relative- mother, father, sister, brother. Having other relatives with breast cancer does not affect your chances. However, you don't have to have any cancer history in your family in order to be diagnosed. (I had none, but my daughters will now have a first degree relative to add to their chances.) Women's breasts go through tremendous changes at certain points of their lives and lumps, bumps, and soreness are common in your 20's. (Particularly when you are having changes in your monthly cycles.) Your doctor may be right but since you are getting so upset, he should order a screening mammogram, not an ultrasound. They are not routinely offered to women under 40 in the U.S. and sometimes insurance companies won't pay for them before then, but they aren't all that expensive so you could pay for it yourself if you need to. There are organizations online that offer reduced cost or free mammograms. Google and see what is in your area. Good luck. ",

      "Content": " Usually they will call you back in for a diagnostic mammogram if your screening mammogram shows anything suspicious. The diagnostic mammogram may show an area of concern that the radiologist will give a rating to. It's radiologist talk for \"get a biopsy\" or \"everything looks good, no need for biopsy\" and everything in between. The report will say Birads 1 through 6 and will point out some characteristics that are concerning - or not. \nThen they will do a biopsy to confirm one way or the other. It takes about\n a week to get your results. ",

      "Content": " Oh dear, now I understand. How frustrating to have to wait three weeks. It will all work out in the end, however, if they do a mammogram, a scan (MRI or ultrasound?), and a biopsy. (Did they tell you what kind of biopsy? There are several different kinds.) Usually we only get one of those at a time and we have to wait weeks in between them, so you'll be ahead in the long run and will know for sure. When you only get a mammogram and then have to wait for another test, your mind go crazy. They can tell you fairly quickly after the mammogram if there is anything unusual if there is a radiologist on staff. Surely there is one at a hospital. The biopsy results take a few days. I think I had to wait about\n a week. Keep in touch and let us know how it's going. ",

      "Content": " How old are you? As we age, breasts develop calcifications. Radiologists know how to differentiate the normal ones from the suspicious ones. If there is anything that could possibly be abnormal, they call you back in for a magnification mammogram. Some skip straight to a biopsy. I had calcifications about\n 10 years ago and was called back for magnified mammo. The radiologist was great and took me into his office to show me what they found and why it was not suspicious anymore. (Normal calcifications look like scattered bright white round tiny pearls. Suspicious areas have clusters of rice-like or branched bright white spots.) Two months ago it happened again but this time it wasn't good news. I had a stereotactic biopsy (painless by the way) and got the results a few days later. They found it early however. It was an aggressive grade so I had a double mastectomy 5 weeks ago. ",

      "Content": " With your family history, you have every right to be concerned. However, at your age you have microcalcifications throughout your breasts. We all do as we get older. The radiologist has probably found some that aren't nice and round or some that are close together. They will do a second mammogram which will focus on the area of concern. Then the radiologist will give you a BI RAD score (0 - 5) which represents his recommendation of whether or not you should have a biopsy. Most women who have biopsies do not have breast cancer. Look at the topic above this one where I have talked to someone else who was concerned. I have detailed what a biopsy is like. Once you have all the details, you can make a decision about\n what you want to do. My cancer (DCIS) was caught early before it had spread to any adjacent breast tissue but was an aggressive sort. I decided on a double mastectomy because I could not worry the rest of my life if a lumpectomy had gotten it all, would it come back, or would it spread to the other breast. Peace of mind was most important to me. The normal treatment is a lumpectomy with radiation. Once I investigated radiation, I knew it wasn't for me either. Luckily my oncologist told me last week they had gotten it all, it would not be able to return because all the ducts and lobules are gone, and that I would definitely not have to have radiation or chemo or hormone therapy. By the way, the pathology report from the mastectomy on the \"good\" side showed cancer there too - a different kind, but small. It had been missed on mammogram and a bilateral MRI with contrast done before surgery to make sure there was no more cancer hiding anywhere in either breast. I made the right decision for me. Treatment for breast cancer has improved by leaps and bounds in the past two years. Even if you have it, it is no longer a death sentence. Good luck. Keep us posted. ",

      "Content": " Of course you are frightened. We've all been in your shoes so we know exactly how you feel. My cancer was also diagnosed in a routine mammogram. Don't worry about\n size. 17 mm is 1.7 centimeters, which is how most tumors are measured. That's not very big... just a little over 1/2 inch. If it does turn out to be cancer, sounds like they see it early. What kind of doc called you back?  Since you don't usually make appointments with a radiologist, I'm think this was some other kind of doctor. If it was a radiologist it would be more significant.",
