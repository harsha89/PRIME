      "Content": " hi all I am mostly in chronic pain site. \nI let years go by since my last pap test AGAIN\nin 2009 I had a mammogram done. my gyn dr said it was 50 % chance of being cancer so I had another done and they said it was cysts. I had to get mammograms every 6 months I did it for the first year and I never went back. I had a hysterectomy in 1998 I still have my ovaries.\nI started bleeding like I am having a period lightly......dark reddish brown, just enough to have to wear a pad or ruin my undergarments and britches. I have had nausea and sweating spells for more than a month now and I have been out of menopause since 2008\nmy doc died last year\n I read it could be dry tissue related from age????? wth? I am 53 yrs old. on the other hand I haven't had a sex life since 2001. my husband had a genetic disorder that he had to have extensive surgery and it caused severe nerve damage, result E.D. with no cure then he started stroking out he lost the speech center in his brain and is still learning to communicate\nlast night I woke from a sound sleep with burning pain across my left breast and It sent me through the roof when I touched the area close to my armpit and in a line across mid breast. \nI used to joke that I was so small breasted that a mammogram for me would be a chest xray. now I am not joking. I got on the phone this morning and called a new gyn and made an appt. for APRIL 1ST! GREAT A JOKE DAY! in my mind I am going over and over what I have to do to make sure my husband is taken care of and doesn't have to deal with if I die and now I cant sleep. I always take everything to the extreme ",
