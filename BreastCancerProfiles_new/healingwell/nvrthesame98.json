    "Content": " Well there you go!! Remember way back when? You just knew this was going to be another viscious battle with a disease that wasn't going to give you a chance? I told you to save those tears for the win? Well looks to me like you can put that mark in the Win column now!! That's about\n the best news you could get short of \"oh there was a mistake \"!!\nNow get that pain under control, a plan in place for treatment of the wicked little pest and get on back to getting those CP issues on a better road.!! Your time out of CP is officially about\n to be over.\nBy the way your dealing much better then your giving yourself credit for.\n \n ",
