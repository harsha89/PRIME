      "Content": " Thank you for the replies. I have been worried to the point of making myself sick over this. I'm scheduled to have surgery on July 22nd. The Dr is going to remove and biopsy whatever it is. The Dr who asked all the questions ordered an ultrasound and by what I could see on the ultrasound, it looked like a long thin black line near my left armpit. I talked to the nurse yesterday and she said it very well could be the norplant rod in there, but am still gonna have the surgery and have whatever it is removed and biopsied. I just wanted to make the surgery Dr aware that he may find a little plastic or metal rod in there. I didn't ask the mammogram Dr why he asked those questions. This is only my 2nd mammogram ever and I had totally forgotten about\n my norplant until a week after my mammogram. They have not done any other ultrasounds of any other areas. I will let you know what I find out. ",

      "Content": " It's ok. The norplant is a form of birth control which isn't even offered in the United States anymore because of it being hard to remove plus a few other issues. I had the norplant put in my upper left arm in 1992 and taken out in 1997. The Dr couldn't find the 6th rod so left it in my arm. I should have had him look for it and get it out but I was young and didn't think about\n what might happen when left in. The area in question on my mammogram is under my left arm near my armpit. I'm hoping that's all it is and nothing more serious. ",

      "Content": " I had a mammogram on June 24th and it showed abnormalities. The Dr who looked at my mammogram results asked me if I had a port under my left arm or if I had swallowed a nickel or ever had any gold treatments. He could've sworn I had a port. The answer to all of these questions were no. I'm scheduled to go in July 22 to have surgery to remove the mass and have it biopsied. I am just wondering if anyone else has ever had weird questions like that asked at their mammograms? They did do an ultrasound and it looked like a long thin black line under my arm. On a side note, I had totally forgotten that I had a norplant in 1992 and when the Dr removed it in 1997, he couldn't find one of the rods so he left it in there and said it wouldn't hurt anything. That was in my upper left arm. I'm now wondering if there's a possible chance that maybe that rod has migrated to under my arm and that might be what they are seeing on my mammogram? I did call them today and let them know about\n it but have not heard back from them yet. Any replies would be greatly appreciated. ",
