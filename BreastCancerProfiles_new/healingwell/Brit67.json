    "Content": " I had a follow up ultrasound mammo last week. The radiologist said he was going to recommend the microcalcifications (2 of them) be removed. My doc is going to refer me to a surgeon for a biopsy. Of course, all weekend I've been chewing my nails, waiting toÂ actually be able to schedule an appointment to see a surgeon to see what the heck is up. I'm hoping you guys can answer a couple of questions!\n \n \n \n ",
