I know it can be excruciating having test after test and not knowing what's going to happen next. \n Even though it can be helpful to speak with other people who have been through breast cancer, sometimes the horror stories can only increase the anxiety. \n I hope you will keep in mind that for every bad outcome, there is probably another woman who had a good outcome. And as I shared my story above, I am one of those who had an OK outcome. Having breast cancer is a horrible thing and I will live with the scars and the knowledge that I could have a recurrence. But there is hope for a good outcome. I hope you will hold onto that possibility.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi:\nI came onto this forum to look up another health conditions and something drew me to the breast-cancer posts. I joined the forum so that I could respond to your post. \nI am 56 years old and after a routine mammogram in April 2015, I was called back in for an ultrasound. After the ultrasound, I was taken in for a needle biopsy. Just one day after the biopsy, I received a phone call that there were three small lumps; one was cancer the others were pre-cancer. I will never forget that moment. I simply started screaming. That was a Friday so I had to wait until Monday to see the surgeon and start down the path of tests and specialists and making my treatment decision. \nI won't say that I know what you're going through because everybody handles this horrible news differently. But I hope I can be of some support. I assume you have been told that estrogen receptor positive is a good thing? It means that the breast cancer may have been caused by long-term use of birth control pills or other things in your life that added to your estrogen. It also means that medications that further suppress estrogen may be used after your treatment is over. \nI won't get into too many of the medical aspects, as I'm sure you have enough people bombarding you with that information. What I can tell you is to gather as much information as possible about\n your options and make the decision to feels right for you. I had to go back to my surgeon three times before I was able to decide what was right for me.\nThe emotional side of things is so hard because when you first get the diagnoses there's so much shock and then suddenly you are put on a train that is moving 100 miles an hour. You are tossed from one doctor to another for one test after another and bombarded with all sorts of new abbreviations. Even as a medical writer, I was overwhelmed. \nAnd yes, it may become the primary focus of your life for a few months. Because once you hear those words and once you have to say \"I have breast cancer\" it is awfully hard to put that on the back burner and think about\n anything other than the upcoming surgery.\nAs best you can, try to find some quiet time each day and tell yourself that you can be strong and you can get through this. It's OK to be overwhelmed. It's OK to be scared. It's OK to feel like nobody understands you; because most people don't.\nI hope this helps you to feel a little bit less alone. Please let me know what I can do to support you.\nSuz\nER+ Pr+ HER2Neu-, BRCA2(negative), stage 1. 3 small lumps in left breast. I opted for mastectomy in the hope that lymph nodes would be clear. They were, and I didn't need radiation or chemo. ",
