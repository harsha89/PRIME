    "Content": " Hi! I am a 46-year-old mom and had breast cancer three years ago. My tumor was removed and I have been doing well with the exception of a large seroma which is about\n an inch in diameter. I go to my oncologist every three months and have had regular mammograms. I just had my mammogram last month and all was good with the exception of the seroma. It is getting smaller but only about\n a centimeter at a time. I have read that the risk of infection is greater if I have it surgically removed. It is not painful and not visible to my physical appearance. Can I just leave it alone or it is dangerous if not removed? Will it eventually absorb naturally into my body? ",
