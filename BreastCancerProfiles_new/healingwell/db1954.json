    "Content": " This is danny. I've never joined a forum before. I'm now 65, I discovered a lump in a self-exam in 2/02, after just one year of HRT and no family history of cancer. I was lucky to only need radiation, tamoxifen, and femara. It's been 10 years. \nI have a terrific husband who unfortunately has had prostate cancer, throat cancer, and skin cancer. He's come through them like a champ, thank goodness!\nWe have two wonderful daughters and three terrific grandchildren. And six cats.\nThanks! ",
