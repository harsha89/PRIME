      "Content": " Mfsonly1 thank you that's a good idea I think ill ask my doctor to look around and try and find someone. 9 months is a long time right? The new place called me for an apt and said no mammo even if it has been 9 months. I'm not really sure why they are so strict about\n that? Good luck to you with the testing ill send positive thoughts your way! ",

      "Content": " Well I am very irritated with my local hospital again! I was scheduled for a mamo and and ultra sound (which at my hospital they say that you have to do both if there is a suspicious lump). As soon as I walked in they said I was way to young to have any type of breast tumors or cancer. I am 25 and I know plenty of women who have fought cancer in their 20's. So because of my age they canceled the mamo and decided to just do an ultra sound where the tech felt the lump and took 3 pictures all around my breast only one of them was anywhere near the lump. Then she leaves and comes back in and says since my age they aren't sure but it could be just inflamed tissue and since it has only been going on a month that I should wait at least another 3 weeks and if I want to I can come back then they will do a mamo. Don't get me wrong I really do hope that it is just inflamed tissue and i'm sure it is nothing but I feel like I was treated different because of my age and the test was not thorough enough to comfort me.

      "Content": " Hi I am 25 years old and have found a large hard mass in my breast about\n three weeks ago. I am scheduled for a mamo and ultra sound in a few days but I am just going crazy waiting for the tests. I also have been suffering with late stage Lyme disease for 9 yrs. I have a ton of family history with cancer particularly breast cancer. I was hoping to just get a little piece of mind here. It is painful and I heard that is good news. If anyone could give me any insight I would really appreciate it. \n ",

      "Content": " I hate to have to be posting on here again... hopefully I am not wasting anyone's time but, I still have the lump for a total of 8 months. I moved a few months after I posted on here and put the lump on the back burner I now have a PICC line since September and have been using IV antibiotics for my Lyme disease which has been helping. Once a few of my Lyme symptoms started to go away I can really feel the pain from this lump now! I am getting a second ultrasound now and hopefully a mammogram. I'm 26 now they can't put me in the 25 and under category anymore \n T`he lump has grown a little bigger and it isn't really thick but very wide. My concern is my family history is with IBC and I have read that that can't been seen on mammo and ultrasound is that true? Any advice? ",
