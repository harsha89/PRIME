      "Content": " Hello everyone.\nI had a screening mammogram last Tuesday. The doc called me late on Friday and said I needed a spot mammogram and an ultrasound. He said they found something \"well defined\" and \"17 mm\" big. When I asked how worried I should be, he said \"not very.\" I immediately called to get an appointment, but they were closed for the weekend. \nI'm worried. Can't help it. I have an appointment for Friday noon (and have called to check for cancellations already). I'm not sleeping well and having trouble eating, but have been doing a lot of research. Does anyone have any suggestions or could shed some light on this? ",
