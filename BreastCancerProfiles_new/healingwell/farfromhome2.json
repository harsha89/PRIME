    "Content": " Hello Everyone!\nI am a 26 year old mother of 3 (all of whom I breastfed). \n I have for some time now had very large hair follicles, that are extremely noticeable. Breast tenderness and irregular burning pain. I have on the side of my left nipple a raised up, what I think is a mongomery's gland, but there is something odd about\n it. It has a hole in the center and discharges what I compare to what is inside of a pimple. Does anybody have anything to say about\n these symptoms? Any one have anything similar? ",
