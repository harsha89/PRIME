      "Content": " Hi Everyone, \nI am new to this forum and I guess I'm not the only one feeling sick to my stomach. I had a mammogram done 1 week ago and got the call. I am 41 yrs old and it hasn't been easy these couple of days. I can't sleep & I haven't been eating much. I can't stop to think that I can be one of the unlucky ones. Today, I got a call from the nurse & told me that I have a 9 mm mass on my left breast & will be getting a call for an ultrasound within 2 days. Why are we wasting time? I need this taken care of stat! I'm thinking the more I wait the more it's spreading. I got my triplets to take care of & cannot imagine not being around. I am a wreck everyone is telling me it's nothing but easier said than done. Now, any pain I feel is on my left breast even my mind is playing tricks on me. Ugh! This sucks & now it's the waiting game. ",
