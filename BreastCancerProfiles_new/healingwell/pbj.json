    "Content": " I have to just found a lump and mine is not hard or real soft and it's 3.5 cm I just had an ultrasound, is it movable. I've found lots of info on breast lumps on the Internet, I feel very bad u can't get to the doctor do you have any free breast clinics you could go to? I found out there is lots of lumps women get that are not cancer I always thought any lump was cancer check out breast lump mice, those are pretty common they freely move around, there's also all kinds of cysts we get as we get older, aside from my big lump they found a cyst next to it, also if it's been banged or something you could get a lump have you ever had surgery on your breasts, i am waiting for a biopsy to be done on mine, my dr told me most of the women that come in there don't end up having cancer it's usually a normal breast disease and part of getting older,oh ya if it's movable that's a good sign, do you have pain does it change size with your cycle if so that could be a cyst, I hope your insurance hurries up so you can put your mind at ease, all the best ",
