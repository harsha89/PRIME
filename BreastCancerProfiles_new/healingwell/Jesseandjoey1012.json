    "Content": " Hey there! For the past month I have been experiencing a burning pain in my left breast. The first time it happened it was beneath my nipple, and now it's on the left side of my breast. I read up on it, and I don't believe it's cancer. However, I also do not think its cysts, due to the fact it isn't on the underside at all. Any suggestions on what it could e?\nAlso, to paint a better picture of my situation and who you're evaluating, I am a 20 year old female. I am obese, and don't have regular periods. I say all of this in hopes to offer more information for better analysis. Thank you! ",
