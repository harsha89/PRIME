    "Content": " hello there,\nI am 31 , and from last night i feel a burning, tingling sensational pain in my left breast. last month, before the start of my period I experience pain in my both breast which subsided at 7 th day of my period and then at 10 day it is coming and going. Now while i am writing this I am feeling nothing but ina couple of minutes I think it can come, what is wrong with me. please suggest, is it IBC or something else?. There are no rashes or redness or swelling but a viry tiny dot size spot like mosquito bite near the nipple skin which appears as if scratched by a nail but it is also subsiding in pain now. But i am still worried, please reply if anybody is online. Thank you. ",
