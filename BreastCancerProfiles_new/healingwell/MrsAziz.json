      "Content": " I think we first noticed this about\n a year ago. I tried everything from blackmail, to asking his family, pleading and more to get this assessed.\nHe didn't. Partly because life has been tough but mainly because like everything else it moved below the priority list.\nI have been checking it time and time and it seemed to get larger. Today its surely larger and he realized that too.\nIts hard and not necessarily movable.\nI am going to hate myself for not kicking up a huge scene if required and not taking him to hospital a year earlier if this turns out to be malignant.\nHe is going into see a doctor today or tomorrow - even if it means I have to go on a hunger strike or whatever :'( \nI am looking for reassurance maybe that because its a year, its possibly not cancer. I am going insane again. He has no idea how many times I have broken down crying while I lived in another country worry about\n this. I know how real the risk is.\nHubby is 47-48 years old, no family histories of cancer as far as we know. He is rather active and don't know is this matters but he's always had very high natural testosterone relative to age ",

      "Content": " Thank you for the support Susie. We couldn't get an appointment - so likely Monday or Tuesday. Hubby is simple with these things and doesn't comprehend why I am a complete mess. I have broken down alone so many times and cried my eyes out about\n this.\nI am so worried.\nI understand he doesn't want to start worrying if its nothing and I wish I could be so chilled. I do worry because medically the hardness of it, the immobility of it are not good signs.. Hubby's overall health seems fine though.\nWhatever the result I will come back and post on here. Its painful to find so many posts with no update once a doctor was seen. Hopefully, because they are all good news, however I would like to offer that to whoever reads this post in the future. ",
