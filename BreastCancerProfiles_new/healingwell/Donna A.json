I think it's up to us to be our own advocates! \nAnd when it turns out to be benign then you can feel good about\n taking care of yourself.\nIsn't is strange that we're made to feel \"crazy\" when we push for ourselves and yet that's what the doctors are preaching -- Be Your Own Advocate -- \nPlease let us know how you're doing...this is a scary thing to go through feel free to express yourself on this site, everyone here knows what it's like.\nHugs from Denver,\nDonna ",

They are little stubbles now and even though I'm happy to have hair I wish I could speed up the process as long as it didn't speed up my life! It seems to be going by like a fast train.\nLike Bernedette my hair got to a certain length and seemed to have stopped. It's just started again and boy is it curly. a new experience for me! I understand that it will go straight again so I'm enjoying not having to curl it.\nI miss having thick eyelashes and my eyebrows are thinner too but for some reason EVERYTHING else is thicker! Who knows, actually I'd trade all of the hair all over my body to get a guarantee that the cancer wouldn't come back. Hair is important but now that I've been through this a couple of times I understand the old saying \"If you have your health you have everything\".\nI'm keeping my wig in a box on a high shelf in the closet just in case -- but for now - just for today - it's fun to have hair again.\nThis chat room helps me so much - I love knowing all of you through your postings, if ever there is a get together I'm there!

Strangely I didn't think much about\n having them before but now I miss the beauty and feel guilty about\n fussing about\n not having a left breast. I try and tell myself that I'm lucky to be alive and that looks aren't that important but it is shocking to see my poor lopsided reflection in the mirror.\nHaving an implant wasn't that bad until the radiation damaged that side and now I've got one side higher and harder than the natural side. Maybe the sadness is just part of the grieving process and because I was so busy having treatments and surgeries I hadn't experienced the grieving. For whatever reason I find myself tearing up at the weirdest times. \nBernedette your burns will get better I promise, hang in there. Mine healed up within a few weeks after my last treatment and the itching went away almost as soon as the treatments ended. A little tip I received that helped was to sleep with a small pillow (I used a stuffed animal) under my arm so that my arm didn't rub against my chest, besides being able to keep my arm level with my chest to avoid the pulling that I had. It really helps!\nHave a good weekend everyone.\nHugs from Denver - Donna ",

Tomorrow the Today Show is doing a 1/2 hour segment on breast cancer and treatments -- might be good one to catch!\nSpeaking of that have you heard Melissa Etheridge's song - I Run To Live? It's about\n her fight with breast cancer and I also heard that Olivia Newton John is a long time survivor who is releasing a new recording to help the fight against breast cancer. \nI'm choosing to see the people above as hope that we too can be survivors - especially if we do everything we can to get well, which of course means treatments of chemo and radiation if need be.\nlove from Denver on a cool autumn day,\nDonna ",

I couldn't have paid that much on my own. \nIt is really natural looking and as I said I get lots of compliments. After visiting several wig shops in the malls I cried and felt like I was going to look like a sick alien forever, then found this site. And as it turns out I've had to wear it for almost a full year -- what with having a recurrence in June -- I'm hoping for hair around December but at first I'll still need to wear the wig.\nI finally made sense of the cost by telling myself that losing my hair was bad enough without having to deal with a wig I didn't like. Don't know if you still need a wig but here's the web site for the company I dealt with and they're world wide. www.iwanthair.com/\nlocations/mem_CO_hairunlimted.htp - the contact email is carlacci@gmail.com it's for Hair Unlimited but I think the parent company is Transistions.\nI know what you mean about\n meds. Wow, I've never been so consumed by what I'm taking and when I'm taking it. It's weird to have to take so much and to have to pay the co-pays. Ick. I just keep telling myself that this is only temporary.\nI agree with Bernadette - NO VOMITING!

It kept me in constant leg cramps. \nHad my 3 radiation treatment yesterday and going again today, only 6 weeks to go. I was so frightened on my first day that I broke down and cried. Let me tell you that made for a great first impression! My rad onco said I will get some burning because I've had a mastectomy, an implant and a recurrence. Plus my second tumor was in my chest wall so I'll get both a top skin and bottom chest treatment. I'm certainly not looking forward to getting burned but maybe it won't be as bad as I'm projecting. \nI've been making myself laugh --- as the machine starts up I mutter (to myself) go get 'um eat all of those crummy (insert a stronger word here) cancer cells!

And I had a different reactions to my second go around with chemo - first time was AC and this time was with Taxol. I really got worn out and I was very emotional, kind of like the worst case of PMS you can imagine. No one mentioned that as a side effect but it was for me both times. Guess chemo produces the same type of hormones. My poor husband - here he thought we were through all of that after menopause!\nOn my way with the radiation and heard yesterday from my rad onco that I should expect to have burning because I've had a mastectomy and a recurrence. She said that because they will treat the top layer of skin (that's the thinnest because of the implant) as well as the deep tissue (she told me my recurrence had gone into my chest wall ick) I will have some burning. Who knows what that really means -- some burning?? Guess it depends on your skin etc. I am a little depressed about\n the whole thing and trying to have an imagine of the Pink Pac Girl eating the cancer cells and healthy pink cells replacing them.\nSome days are better than others!!\nWow, can't believe you're still dealing with your cough - that has to be a drag.

I wouldn't have been able to pay the difference either.\nI order the little turban/headcovers the first go round with my chemo and I got a few scarfs -- I'm with you I won't walk around bald either!!\nI'll be thinking of you tomorrow - by the way I imagined my first treatment to be much worse than it actually was. I had a couple of people tell me horror stories of friends of friends etc. that they'd heard of that had it really bad. Not exactly sure why anyone would do that but almost everyone knows someone who's had cancer and has a story to tell.\nI was so scared that I cried the night before and couldn't sleep wondering if I could endure it...well, the answer was yes I could. Actually my side effects happen on the third day after the chemo, the first two days are a breeze. Strange but true and still even at their worst they weren't as bad as I had imagined!\nI will tell you that I experienced really profund mood swings and by the fourth day after chemo I'm pretty teary. It goes away in the next couple of days but I wasn't prepared for that. Don't know if you'll have the same reaction -- I understand that chemo is as individual as cancer in the way it affects people.\nPlease let me know how you're doing. ",

      "Content": " Hi Bernadette, yep, both on the left side. \nActually my recurrence was on the scar from my mastectomy. I was told that less than 2% of mastectomy patients have a recurrence and that I'm on the unlucky side of the statistic. Hopefully the surgery got it this time, and if not maybe the chemo and if not maybe the radiation.\nI understand the anger at this disease...I think that's pretty normal. Sometimes I feel very lonely, especially around my family because they don't know what it's like to have your life threatend with cancer, and even if they try they can't understand the feelings.\nIt's hard to be positive all the time, especially when you're not feeling well. Besides coughing all the time stinks and it's difficult to sleep which adds to the depression.\nI'm interested in the book! I'll look for it at the book store. Do you know the author?\nI can't stand sitting at home with nothing to do either. During my first cancer treatment I stayed home on my chemo weeks (I got chemo every other week) and went to work the off week. I hated it, it's not like a vacation or time off where you can do something fun or complete a project. \nThis time around I stay home if I'm really sick or if I'm going to be teary (a side effect for me on the 3rd day). I don't want to cry at work - it's depressing for me and for my co-workers. Plus going on long term disability is a huge budget issue. I understand you're being depressed. I think I remember someone writing on this site that it's okay to express real feelings. I can't promise that I'm always going to feel up even without going through treatment. \nMy new most hated phrase is \"keep a good attitude\" man, that really makes me feel crummy. Especially if I can't do it. It seems that only people who've not had to deal with cancer can say that. In the real world it isn't that easy!\nThanks for asking about\n my history, I'm glad to have a connection!\nHugs back to YOU,\nDonna ",

To me it's a stark reminder of what our bodies are going through.\nI think I mentioned before that I experience horrible PMS like symtoms which of course made everything worse.

My cancer was deemed \"very aggressive\" and I did have it in my lymph system. I hoped that the mastectomy and chemo would take care of it. Unfortunately I did get a recurrence but still hope that this cycle of chemo and radiation will be the last of it. \nAs for about\n me - I'm having my 58th birthday Sunday. I am married to the love of my life and have 3 children - 2 step children and a cat named Bob. I work every day that I can and am looking forward to being completely healed!!\nI live in a suburb of Denver. Had my first diagnosis in July 2004 and my second June of 2005. It seems like I've been bald forever - two chemo treatments is plenty for me. My hair did fall out on the 16 day and that's exactly when the oncologist said it would. I had A/C the first time no radiation and Taxol the 2nd time with 4 weeks of radiation coming up.\nI love having so many people to do a reality check with. Sometimes I think that I only hear select things at the oncologist's or I'm so worked up that I forget, either way it's good to talk about\n it and have so many people with so much experience.\nLori I appreciate what you're saying -- thanks!\nhugs and best wishes,\nDonna ",
