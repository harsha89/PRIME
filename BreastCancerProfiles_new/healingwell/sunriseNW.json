    "Content": " I had lump removed from left breast in May - no chemo needed and refused radiation due to possible damage to already weak bones from osteoporosis plus other concerns. So hope the tamoxifen I was just put on doesn't make the bones worse. Thanks everyone who mentioned slowly ramping up to the full dose. As for constipation I have a cheap solution. Take magnesium increasing the dose until you are loose. If you get more than you need then your body expels it (eliminating the constipation problem). \nI was told that breast cancer has an emotional component and I need to release any repressed anger or resentment. (The breast = nurturing?) Now I'm trying to figure out how to express feelings instead of stuffing them. \nCould the low energy be left over from the surgery or does it get worse after taking the tamoxifen? ",
