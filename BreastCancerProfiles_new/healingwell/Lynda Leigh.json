      "Content": " Where do I start!! Two weeks ago I was called back in for a second mamo and tests and bam there it was big time. I am scheduled for a double mastectomy on the 29 th of this month. I have had cancer 2 other times and I know what is a head of me in that aspect. I was told if they get all the cancer that I will not have to go through radiation or chemo again. I know 2 other ladies that didn't have to go through this. BUT THAT is ok if I do. I just don't know what is going to happen to me. Will I be able to use my arms and if not for how long etc. I know this is hard for youns that have gone through this and my heart goes out to each and everyone of you. We are fulltime RVers and that is hard too. We were in Florida 2 weeks ago when I flew back to S. Calif to see my Dr for a check up. That is when my life changed. We are now in Ozark, Mo and heading back for S Calif to have the surgery. I have seen my surgeon but not had my pre op yet that will be on the 28 th. And I will also see the Nurse that is incharge of the prosticious etc. If anyone can give me some ideas what I will be going through I would greatly appreciate this. Thanks again for listening. \nLove ya\nLynda ",
