      "Content": " This is hard to believe. I went for my biopsy yesterday and was on the table, face down, the tech trying to get my breast in far enough to x-ray the area was unable to see the area. The Dr. came in and he checked he said the area is in but where is this calcium. turned out I have a mole at the spot where the radiologist indicated a problem. seems the tech failed to put one of those round markers on the area. They did another mammo and the Dr. and the radiologist confirmed the calcium was on the skin from the mole, which is common to see but with the tech not alert\ning the radiologist to the mole he only saw calcium but could not tell on the mammo it was surface or in the breast.\nI was so relieved and thankful but this tech should be told to make sure she is covering everything needed for good pictures for the radiologist to read. I had this mammo done at out local hospital was was seeing a breast specialist at a major med. center. The anxiety I went through for over 2 weeks was terrible which I am sure everyone who gets a report more testing needed goes through.\nFibromyalgia. mofascal pain syndrome, dxed in 1882. Costochondritis, Two herniated cervical discs. Cervical and upper spine arthritis with a large bone spur in mid back. IBS.\nLook toward the sun and the shadows will alway fall behind you !!! ",

      "Content": " I have fibrocystic breast disease for years, I am 71. Recently had a mammo done and calcium spots were found in my breast. I saw a breast specalist who said  he is not too concerned but wants a biopsy to be sure. The procedure was explained, the biopsy only takes a few minuet but I would  be there for about\n 1 hour with compression on the breast. I went the net and have myself scared out of mind most sites saying it is cancer but some saying fibrocystic changes. Plus read you must lay on your stomach for  hour, I have fibromyalgia and I know I will go into back spasms being in that position for a hour. ",

      "Content": " Thank you for the info, it is a frightening thing to happen to any of us. The dr. did say he did not think it was anything but it must be micro because he had to use a magnifying glass to view the area.\nOne other ?? they told me I need to have compression on my breast for awhile afterwards, how is this done? They ask if I had any ? I could not think. Good my husband was along because when he said biopsy my mind went.\nThanks for your help, I will take your info along in my head.\nFibromyalgia. mofascal pain syndrome, dxed in 1882.
