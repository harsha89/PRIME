      "Content": " that I have breast cancer. I have posted before on the Depression and Anxiety board, that was last September, October..ect. I got that all under control and was feeling pretty good. Now this.\n This lump is very pronounced in my right breast, right under and around the nipple, a bout the size of a walnut, if not bigger. When it started it was smaller and I had a mamo and sonogram done, they came back fine and off I went. about\n three months ago I noticed it changing but thought it was because of hormones. It got to the point it didn't shrink, just got bigger. I was sent to have a biopsy done on Tuesday, I got the call a while ago that it was cancerous. I'm really scared because it's so big! \n \n I go in for an MRI on the 17th then will take with my doc about\n options. My poor husband is so sweet and strong and I know he will love me and be with me through all of this.\n I have three girls that I need to tell, sometime soon. I worry about\n how we are going to pay for this and what will happen. \n Eight months ago I was fighting a depression so hard I thought about\n dying, now here I am again. It's so scary. ",

      "Content": " Ok, I went to the doc yesterday and from the MRI, talking with her and my husband, I am going to have a masectomy done on my right breast with reconstruction right after.\n The skin doesn't want to move around the lump, so she thinks it may be attached, so the nipple and all would have to go anyway. I would rather they just take it all and hopefully and cancer cells with it and I can move foreward with this. I go in on the 9th to talk to the plastic surgeon and then the two docs will get a time together to get this all done.\n I'm nervous about\n the whole thing, and not thrilled about\n loosing my breast, but I feel like it's the best choice for me and my family. I have no idea what kind of treatment I will have to have afterwards, hopefully my lymph nodes will come out clean. ",

I remembered how much this board helped me out throught the depression and anxiety I had, comming back here just seemed like the right thing. \n I think my husband is reeling from this more than I am. He is he one who always wants to \"fix\" things and is always there for me. He always figured he would be the one to get something like this, he works around toxic chemicals and such. It never really crossed his mind that I would be the one. He's already said he's going with me to all of the doctor's appointments and such.\n I'm in no rush to tell the kids, but know it will have to be done, but I am going to wait till I have more info.

It's just a lump very close to the surface, it feels like if I cut the skin I could pop it out. LOL, not a pretty image I know, but that's how it feels. \n I told the kids today, there was getting to be to much talking and I was afraid they would over hear something or hear it from someone else. They took it hard, but we talked it all out and they are doing ok. My youngest is 11 and she took it the hardest, which I knew she would. I let her ask me any questions she wanted and she's doing better now. \n It will be a long week, but we will get through it one day at a time. ",
