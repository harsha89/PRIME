      "Content": " I'm 23 years old and found a lump in my breast about\n a week ago that hurts like a bruise. I haven't been to the doctors because I was due to start my period and researched that its normal to get lumps when you are about\n to start your menstrual cycle. \nIt has yet to disappear but I don't want to bother a doctor for their time over nothing, I just know breast and all kinds of cancer runs in my family so I also want to be smart about\n it. I haven't told anyone about\n it so I guess I'm looking for advice. shall I leave it another week or just go in and get it checked straight away\nThanks in advance,\nJade ",
