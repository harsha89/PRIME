      "Content": " well is been quite long now that we went through these processes. to be updated on the whole information i need to contact my mum once more. but anyway i think what yoou mama need is to be healthy again. the procedure might be uninteresting to her i guess. just try there and see with your eye. life has no duplicate and i know how worried we were during this hard time of ours. cancer is a deadly sickness as we all know and is not advisable to delay.
