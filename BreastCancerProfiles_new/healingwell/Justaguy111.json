    "Content": " My girlfriend was diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer in July. He proscribed tamoxifan and hormone treatments. I suggested that she take one gram of Doctor's Best C3 Curcumin per day, EGCG, and Ubiquinol.\nShe has been doing that since July 24th, but her neck tumor has and cancer markers have increased.\nShe's been exercising eating right, etc.\nThe doctor is changing her medication.\nAny suggestion about\n the curcumin? How much? With olive oil? How long should it take to have an effect?\nMany thanks. ",
