      "Content": " Recently I went for my annual mammogram.  I am 41 and had my first mammogram last year and was told that I have dense breasts.  Two days after my mammogram I received a call from my doctor asking me to go back for a lateral compression test because my mammogram was suspicious.  They said that I had a spot that was very close to my chest wall and the lateral compression test was unable to give a clear image so they sent me for an ultrasound.  The radiologist came in and did the ultrasound himself and said that I have a very dense area near the chest wall and ribs.  He said it is not normal to have dense tissue there and that my mammogram had changed from the year before.  He does not think that it is cancer but \"it is not normal\" so I am going to have a BSGI test next week.  This test (breast specific gamma imaging or molecular breast imaging)is supposed to be able to give an accurate result within minutes to determine whether there is any cancer present.  Has anyone had the BSGI?
