      "Content": " I had a lump that didn't feel right and have always had regular mammograms. I went to doc and he sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound and both test showed something abnormal. They did a core biopsy and sent it to be tested. Preliminary test show a non cancerous tumor but they have sent it to another lab for a second opinion.
