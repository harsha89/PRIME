      "Content": " Dr. called and said it is 6mm fatty nodule ?? I meet with a sugeon this Friday to have it removed. They said at that size they won't even do a biospy before hand. Just remove it and send it to pathology. She didn't seem at all concerned. She said it was there in 2007 and 2008 but much smaller and since it has grown her suggestion was just have it removed and gone! So, that is all I know now. ",

      "Content": " I have a question. They talked to me just briefly and said next step is a stereotactic biopsy. They are going to call me back. My question is do I go to where I had my initial testing which is a diagnostic imaging clinic or would you go to James Graham Brown Cancer center where they specialize in Breast issues and have them to the biopsy and let them take it from here. Even if it is nothing I still am wondering if since we are at the biopsy point I should go to a center that where this is their speciality. Also, I think I need to just breath and take this all in and maybe do this end of week or next week. You feel this need to panic and I don't think that is good either. Thanks for all the support. ",

      "Content": " I had my regular mammogram last Oct.  This past Sunday I felt a pea size hard lump on my right breast.  I went to my Dr. on Tuesday and of course she sent me for a mammogram .  I had that done on Wed. and they also preceded to do an ultra sound.  I received a letter today from the diagnostic place stating my results indicate further medical consulations and breast evaluation.  I will call my OBGYN first thing Monday morning to see what this all means but can anyone give me some moral support or insight at this point to finish the weekend.  I don't understand why they mail you these letters knowing you'll get them on Sat.  and not be able to reach anyone.  This has really freaked me out.  I'm 62 yrs. old and scared to death.  I don't want to over think this but you can help ... Your mind goes a million miles a hour.  I'm wondering if not cancer what else could this be and why further evaluation???? What does it all mean.  I would appreciate any and all help.\n ",
