    "Content": " Hello, I am 19 years old and recently had an ultra sound performed on my breasts due to a lump in my left breast. The radiologist said it is a Fibroadenoma. I have to get a biopsy to confirm it is not cancerous, although the radiologist said she is positive it isn't, and then get it removed due to it's size. It is fairly large, larger than a golfball. I am writing on here because I wanted to see if anyone had experienced the same situation and would be willing to share their experience with me. I have never had surgery before, so I am afraid an unfamiliar of the process. Also, does removal change breast shape and size? Will my breast be significantly smaller than it is now? I would really love to hear any ones experiences. Thank you. ",
