    "Content": " Hello to all,\nAlthough I am not diagnosed with breast cancer, I want to share a podcast that I have worked on with the University of Washington Medical Center. It is called the UW Medicine Pulse Podcast, and we recently produced an episode about\n inherited breast cancer research. You can listen to the podcast here: http://www.uwmedicinepulse.com/taking-action-against-breast-cancer/. While quite informative, I hope you find the podcast to be encouraging, if nothing else. \nWe spoke with Mary-Claire King, the researcher who discovered and proved that some breast cancer can be inherited, and with Dr. Elizabeth Swisher, who is developing tests for people to see if they have the breast cancer gene mutations. We also spoke with Stephanie Cone, a woman who, along with her two sisters, opted for preventive double mastectomies when they found they had inherited these gene mutations from their mother, who had been diagnosed with cancer four times in her lifetime. \nThese women are brave. You are all incredibly brave. Slowly but surely we are fighting the good fight against breast cancer. I truly admire and applaud the efforts of each and every one of you for fighting! And, I wish all of you well.\nMary E. ",
