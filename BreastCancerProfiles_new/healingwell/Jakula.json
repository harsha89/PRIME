    "Content": " If i found out that i had breast cancer whatever stage i would take the meds and see my doctor and go for tests to try and let them help me through the medical field.While dealing with that stuff i would surf the net for alternative ways to help myself to find prevention and maybe cures for this t cancer.The first thing i would search on the net is green vegetables and see what could do for me.I would buy myself a juicer machine and learn how to juice vegetables and fruits.I wouldnt give a dam how the greens would taste.I would surf the net for other ways to maybe cure breast cancer if there is a way to cure it.I would look and read about\n testamonies from breast cancer survivors and what they did to make it go away,either medicine or alternative ways.I would change my diet from junk food,fried food,dairy stuff and sugars and liquor etc.I would eat healthy and go to health food stores.I guess i would have fear but my fear would leave me almost,if i new there is alot of chances to survive this.I would pray to god for faith.I would type stuff into yahoo,google,msn searches and what i might do is write um,breast cancer cures,juicing vegetanles curing cancer,maybe instead of eating veggies i would drink themetc.I would sit in front of the computer all day to find help online.http://shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/cancer2.htm,i was looking and saw this site,there are so many ways for help,doctors,medicines,god,prayer.I would look up stuff like dr.norman walker vegetable juicing,or the juiceman.There is so much i would look for.I would not be afraid i would battle this with all my might.Good luck to You,dont lose faith.Also a cancer survivor DR.Lorraine day reversed her breast cancer too,like i said i would keep searching the internet.May god give you strength and help too.I will say a prayer for you.All of this might work or might not everyones bodies are different.This is the things i would try to do for me if i had breast cancer.Dont be afraid of that word.God BLess.
