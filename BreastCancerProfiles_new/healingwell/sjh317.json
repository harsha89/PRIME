    "Content": " Hi to all,\nI found a hard lump in my breast(I have a history of Fibrocystic Breasts), but this feels very different to me. It hurts, and I feel like I am having 'chest pain' and back soreness as well. Has anyone experience that? Anyway, one diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound later, I was told I have a complex breast cyst filled with 'debris'. I go back after the holiday to have a needle aspiration and biopsy. \nWarm thoughts and prayers to all,\ns. ",
