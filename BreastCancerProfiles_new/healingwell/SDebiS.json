    "Content": " It's strange how you're diagnosed with breast cancer and after 5 years, everyone says 'Oh, how great! You've survived; now you're free of it.\"\nI was diagnosed with breast cancer 22 years ago when my daughter was just 8 months old and I lived each and every year after that for my next mammogram -- two malignant lumps were removed, I had radiation and went through a quick menopause at age 35/36! \nThen I had genetic testing.....That proved successful -- no mutation and my chances I was told of breast cancer was next to none!\nWELLLL, wasn't I surprised to find out I have a radial scar and now need to go in for another lumpectomy!!!
