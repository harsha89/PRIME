      "Content": " Thanks Gail, That gives me some comfort. I was begining to think noone was going to answer me. My mother was told to come back in 6 months and it was Cancer. She is a survivor (thank God) I guess I am lucky and am very thankfull to find out now rather than later! I will keep you updated. I am going Thursday for the sonogram. They are doing both breasts since they saw something on my left breast and I have a lump on my right breast. Again, thank you for your comfort. It feels good to talk to someone! ",

      "Content": " Hi Everyone,\n The other day my doctor found a lump on my breast during a routine physical. At first I was not worried, but now I am scared. I had a mamogram and am waiting for the results. I started to think about\n it and realized as well as a lump on my right breast right above my nipple I have been having extreme fatigue and pain in my right side of neck, entire ack, and down my right leg. I have had the fatigue for about\n a week and the pain on my right side for about\n 2 months. Does anyone think this is related to the lump in my breast. I have been really worried and would feel better if someone new more about\n this.. thanks in advance!\n \n ",
