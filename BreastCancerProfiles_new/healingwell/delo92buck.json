    "Content": " I know this may sound odd to some, however, I'm a little concerned about\n some things that are going on in my body. I've always heard, \"listen to your body.\" Now, I'm just having to wait for my drs appt and it's driving me crazy. For the past 4-5 days, I'm having a 'heavy,' slight burning and 'fluttering' feeling in my left breast. It's all in one area of my breast. I'm not diagnosing myself, however, I am fighting to get a mammogram. Because it's a new drs group, they won't even an order for one. Has anyone ever had these \"feelings?\" I'm trying not to be negative, however, it's weighing heavy on my mind. ",
