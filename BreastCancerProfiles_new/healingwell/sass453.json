    "Content": " Hello - October 2008 a mass was found by mammogram and confirmed by U.S. in my left breast - I was sent to a surgeon who was going to perform a biopsy and decided to try aspiration - there was fluid (if I recall with blood) so they told me it was a complex cyst and come back in 6 weeks.  I did not make appointment until this week - the ultrasound revealed that the cyst was still present but smaller - should they not look at this further - I have not been notified to come back for further tests.  Any comments?
