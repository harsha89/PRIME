      "Content": " Hi, I'm working on my dissertation for my Ph. D. in Social Work. I plan to publish the results of my research in professional journals and present at conferences. I'm looking at coping resources utilized by women under treatment for breast cancer. I have IRB approval from Jackson State University, the Northeast Louisiana Cancer Institute, and the Christus Schumpert healthcare system. \nThe surveys are self-administered. The surveys are completely anonymous; number coded and requires no intervention. If you would be willing to complete a survey packets and send it back to me, please contact me directly at HolbroC@stfran.com (work email) with your mailing address and I will mail you a packet and return envelope. Thank you in advance for your help. \n ",
