    "Content": " about\n 5 weeks ago a very strange red/purple bruised appeared on my right breast.The following day i went to my doc and after examination i was refered to a breast clinic.(im from uk so things maybe a little different) 2 weeks later i went to this appointment and after being examined i was then given a mamo and \n.Both these came back normal and i was told f symptoms persist to go back.The following day i went to my doc because the pain in my breast was really bad and it now looked swollen.I was given 7 days of antibiotics which didnt work.I then went back to my doc because altho the red/purple mark had faded alot the bruise was still there.Along with pain,swelling,itchyness, ridges on my skin and an area of thickness which is ontop of the bruise..Also under my arm feels painful and swollen with an area of ridges too.On monday of this week i went back to the breast clinic and this time had a FNA.2 samples were taken.Today i had grat news that it's not cancer.but why do i not feel good about\n this? I have read stories and searched the net about\n IBC.I know this is a very rare for of cancer.My question is,is a FNA the best biopsy for this? because 5 weeks into this my breast hasnt improved.\n \n ",
