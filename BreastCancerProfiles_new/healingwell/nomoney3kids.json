    "Content": " \n  I'm 43 and couple of weeks had my annual mammogram -- received call from Dr. stating radiologist is recommending ultrasound to left breast due to left breast nodule.  So I go for u/s and they find one large simple cyst at 3:00, one complex cyst at 3:00 and 2 noted cysts at 4:00 -- my Dr. is sending me to a surgeon tomorrow for a consultation.....here is a little of my family history.....my father just died of lung cancer in Dec. 05, my mother had lymphoma during 1969-71 in three different area (groin, neck & collar bone area), the day before we buried my dad my brother was diag. with T-cell lymphoma, grandmother (dad's side) died from breast cancer, and couple of his siblings have died from cancer.  On my mom's side of family --- grandmother died from throat and chest cancer, mom's sister died from breast cancer, and three brothers from cancer and one fighting cancer at this time.......I am scared to death.....what to do.....what to expect......what to insist be done.....any advice would be greatly appreciated.
