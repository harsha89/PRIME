      "Content": " There seems to be a lot of people being told by doctors 'its probably nothing, your too young, etc' its wrong. \nSo the statistics say your unlikely to get cancer but shouldn't doctors be testing anyway, the cancer rate isn't going down, if anything its going up.\nI found a lump in my other breast when I was 17 and even though the doctor I had at the time thought it was nothing she said 'Lets get it checked out just in case'. It turned out to be a cyst but I was so comforted just knowing everything was ok, rather than this horrible wrenching feeling something 'might' be wrong :( ",

I am going to get an appointment with a female doctor, see if that will make any difference.\nAnd I'd just like to say you guys are all amazing women and men, you have been through, or are still going through such a tough time in your lives yet still you find the time to reassure and comfort others, you all deserve medals! xxx ",

      "Content": " Thank you for your reply bev,\nWell this is definately a new lump, I regularly self examine and its different thats for sure. He keeps saying its a hormonal thing, or a fatty lump. Im sure it probably is but cancer just seems to be everywhere I look at the moment. \nBut no, he hasnt done any tests at all, just an examination. I would feel more at ease if he did a biopsy, I know they can do that at my surgery, my friend had one done there so its not an inconvienience to wait for appointments at the nearest breast clinic etc. \nParanoia is a fickle thing :) ",

      "Content": " I found a lump in my breast in January, went to the docs and he said to come back in 3 months for a check. I've obviously been doing a lot of research on lumps and have kinda spooked myself a lot! \nSo I went to the docs again today and was tols again he didn't think there was anything wrong. I not too sure.\nIs there really any way for anyone, even a doctor, to tell if a lump is cancerous or not? I know all the odds are in my favour, but there are those unlucky few.\nLike I said maybe it is paranoia, especially with all the reading I've been doing but just wanted to know for sure. ",
