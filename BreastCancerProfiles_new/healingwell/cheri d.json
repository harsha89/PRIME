      "Content": " Hi Straydog, \nThank you for reaching out and for the info. \nI had the biopsy done yesterday and wanted to come back and share in case anyone else happens to do a search and wants to know a little about\n it! \nThe most painful part was the numbing shot. The punch biopsy of the nipple itself was over in just a few minutes. Slight discomfort but not too terrible. He had to put in 2 stitches. I go back on Monday to have the stitches removed and to go over the results. ",

      "Content": " Hello BC forum, \nSince August 2016, I have been having an issue with my left nipple. It has pretty severe itching on and off (I'd say 4-5 out of 7 days a week it is very noticeable). My doctor gave me medication to take if it was a yeast infection on the nipple, along w/ cream for eczema. Itching, redness and flaking was still present in February so they sent me for a mammogram and an ultrasound. Nothing suspicious showed up there. \nI had my annual gyn appointment earlier this week my doctor referred me to a surgeon for a nipple biopsy to check for pagets/IBC. This has me very worried. \nDoes anyone have experience with a nipple biopsy? Is there much pain? What can I expect afterwards? \nHave you seen other stories here that had the same symptoms but turned out to not be cancer? \nMy maternal grandma died of BC in her early 40's and this really scares me. \nThank you for reading â™¥ ",
