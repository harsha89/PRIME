    "Content": " I am a 56 year old woman whose main complain was fatigue, muscle weakness and just generally feeling \"not right\". I have positive ANA 1:2560, homogeneous. All follow up tests show negative for Lupus, scleroderma, sarcoid, myositis. I have elevated CPK, approx 336. Mildly elevated CRP. Last week I had a muscle biopsy from my thigh. Don't have results from that. Dr mentioned just sitting back and monitoring symptoms. I have been having tests since September. Any input? Thanks! ",
