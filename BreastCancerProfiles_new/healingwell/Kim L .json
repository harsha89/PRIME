    "Content": " Hi, I had a special view mammogram today because my orig mammo showed some density. After the first pic, she said she had to magnify it even more because it \"spread out.\" After the test, she confirmed that the radiologist said that's all they needed, as the pic is good. Is the fact that it \"spread out\" a good or bad sign? ",
