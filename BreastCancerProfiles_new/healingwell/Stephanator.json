      "Content": " Okayy, so Im 17 & found this squishy thing in my armpit, like right were my lymph node is. My doctor said my lymph node was swollen, but I also have a rash like thing in between my breasts, and they gave me cream for that but it's not going away. And the rash has this horrible smell, like it's beyond disgusting. And the doctor also said it could be something else if it didn't go away in a few weeks. But it's been a few weeks.. Can anyone relate? Help me please, I'm so confused! ",
