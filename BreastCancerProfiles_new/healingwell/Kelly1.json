    "Content": " Hi all - I hope someone sees this since the thread is a bit old. I had two excisional biospsies done about\n five months ago. I ended up having duct ectasia, so the milk ducts were removed. The area around the scars from the surgery is still hardened. Is that normal? I asked the nurse, and she said it was after surgery, and takes awhile to get better. Unfortunately, I have obsessive compulsive disorder, and I'm convinced something is wrong with me. I haven't been able to function. I'm suppose to go see the surgeon tomorrow. I'm so scared to learn what is wrong. I've actually been in therapy since all of this happened - my pscyhologist actually things I have post traumatic stress syndrome. Anyhow...I was just wondering if the hardening is normal or could be something more serious. Thanks for any feedback. I'm not sure where else to turn, and it helps to share with people who understand.\nI should have noted that the biopsies were benign, and my post op visit went well. I'm 42 with three kiddos. Thank you again. ",
