    "Content": "The same thing has just happened to me. I happened to do a quick self exam and felt a lump. My OB/GYN saw me 2 days later and confirmed a breast mass. I asked him if it was possibly a cyst and he said he didn't know. The U/S or Mammo would confirm if it was w/liquid or solid. The Mammo and U/S came out negative and the U/S tech came in and said we were done and everything was negative to follow up with my doctor. I did and he referred me to a general surgeon for additional opinions. He said the surgeon would be better at guiding me to the next step and we coul decide together what that would be. Once in a while in the past few months (this may sound weird) I have to look down at my right breast (same breast I found the lump) because sometimes I swear I just leaked something out and it gets cold (only this breast). When I look there's usually nothing there though. Not sure what that means. Frustrating. Originally Posted by poodle I found a lump in the lower left quadrant of my left breast. There is some pain but no discharge. Nagative mammogram and ultrasound. What should I expect next?",
