    "Content": "I did a BSE examination on my breasts and went to the doctor's because I had breast pain. He said there was nothing to worry about. I am 16 years old and have no history of breast cancer in the family at all, that i know of. I went on the internet and looked up symptoms and it said that sometimes one breast is larger than the other and hangs slightly lower. And the nipple is in a slightly different place from the other. This is right for me. It is a slight difference but you can notice it. I still get slight pains under both arms and in both breasts and I also have rather large montgomery glands on one breast than the other. I'd like some advice thank you ever so much xxx",
