      "Content": "I need to know of any signs of breast cancer besides a lump? I am 31 years old and for the past two weeks I have been experiencing pain in my right breast. I thought it would have went away by now but it hasn't. I'm experiencing a pain and soreness on the top part of my right breast in the area right below my arm pit. I don't feel any lump but I haven't really did a good check because to be honest with you, I am scared to death to check. Is there any other signs and is breast pain and soreness one of the signs?

It just hurts so bad that the soreness is on my mind every minute of the day. It just feels like there is something in there. Bridgette",
