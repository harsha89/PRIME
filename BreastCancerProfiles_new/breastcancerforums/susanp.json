      "Content": "Hi there, What you are describing sounds like the standard treatment these days, probably adriamycin and cytoxan followed by taxol or taxotere. I don't know how old your mom is or how healthy but what is beginning to happen is getting those same drugs, only on a dose dense schedule, two weeks apart instead of three. That could really interfere with your mom's immune system and blood counts depending on her overall health, although I thought I've been reading that older women are doing just as well with these treatments as the younger ones. In addition to the bone scan I would also ask for a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to check for metastases since she had positive nodes. I had the same chemo that your mom will and I will tell you that she will do fine with it, in fact you should stay on top of her to make sure she doesn't try to do too much. The better she takes care of herself and rests, the more likely she will get through treatment with no problems. That's not to say that she shouldn't get out, do some mild exercise, eat right and enjoy herself. Just be smart and don't overdue. I'll be thinking about you guys on April 1st. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Marybeth, So sorry this has happened to you. The complications we sometimes get may actually be worse than the treatment! I did the AC every three weeks and the Taxol every week. After the AC treatment I kinda felt flu like symptoms for about 5 days afterward. Didn't do much except rest a lot. The second week was better, and the third was enjoyable. Each treatment was basically the same. With the Taxol, I thought at first they forgot to put the drugs in the mix! But what happened to me is it had more of a cumulative effect, the more tx's under my belt, the more fatigue I felt. Also had trouble sleeping the night of infusion due to the steriods so I needed to take the Ambien just that night. There is a new drug out, Abraxane (sp?) which delivers the taxol without needing the steriods. Don't know if that would be an option for you. Anyway, rest often, eat right, exercise mildly when you can (yoga is great!) and you should do fine. Chin up! Take care, Susan",

I had one positive node, a very large tumor and am HER2+ so I entered a clinical trial to get herceptin. I believe I did all I could to aggressively rid myself of the cancer. Statistics are just a guide. I hear all the time about stage 1 or 2 patients that recurr 6 months after treatment ends. Why haven't I????? I haven't a clue. And I'm not about to look a gift horse in the mouth! Good luck to you. Susan",
