      "Content": "I thought this sounded too good to be true so I researched the actual trials. The trouble with reporters and those who manage trials is that they have financial stakes in the efficacy of the drug. While a trial run by the pharmaceutical company that developed the drug often meets FDA standards enough to earn FDA approval, later trials that are independent are generally given more weight. It seems statistics may have been manipulated in this report. One patient's success is significant for us, because we are all on the cancer journey. For the FDA, they are not enough. Nor are they enough for the majority of patients. Here is a copy and paste that may provide some enlightenment on the issue. It was published earlier this month. Just to add, though, this is referring to a trial for electrochemotherapy for head and neck cancer. I don't have the time to unpack all the data on other trials, but the earlier trials for breast cancer on humans showed that the method could only be used to investigate whether or not chemotherapy was an option--in other words, it could be used only as a diagnostic tool. I would be curious to see what new information comes to light about the current phase of this trial that has just been reported, and whether or not it gets approval. For now, investors have all dropped their shares in the drug, which has been somewhat of a financial crisis for the pharmaceutical company. OncoSec's (ONCS.OB) phase 3 data announcement for its OMS ElectroChemotherapy trial using bleomycin for the treatment of head and neck cancer appeared to be positive. The company reported \"no statistically significant differences between time to death or local control rate at eight months between the control and experimental groups for HNBE-01 or HNBE-02 or the combination of both studies. Median time to death was statistically indistinguishable between surgery at 209 days versus 231 days for electrochemotherapy (p=0.55). Local tumor control at eight months was achieved in 92% of control group patients versus 90% of electrochemotherapy patients.\" The Data Monitoring Committee (DCM) had recommended that enrollment of the two-part phase 3 trial be terminated back in May of 2007 due to both safety and efficacy concerns. However, OncoSec reported that after they had completed their own analysis of the data, they had concluded \"there were no statistically significant differences between time to death or duration of local control between the control or ElectroChemotherapy experimental arms in either the HNBE-01 or HNBE-02 trials, or the combined groups across studies.\" The only truly noteworthy issue observed from the trials by the company was via comparisons of pain after treatment by surgery versus by the ElectroChemotherapy treatment with pain reported by 35.4% and 46% of patients, respectively. Although a concern, the difference may not be significant considering the OMS treatment doesn't have the scarring and disfigurement propensity that surgery may have in many patients, depending on the severity of the resections.",

      "Content": "It's been a while since you posted and I'm not sure whether HER 2 and triple negative breast cancer intersect but my mother's HER 2 fourth stage breast cancer was highly responsive to Herceptin. After it stopped working, the oncologist told us of an oral chemo tablet that has an ingredient that is similar to Herceptin called Lapatinib. During my mother's early fourth stage, it would most likely have been more effective for controlling her liver metastases than the herceptin was. It is, however, three times the price of one Herceptin dosage and Herceptin is already cost-prohibitive for those without really stellar medical insurance. In my country, we have groups that are working towards bringing medicine costs down and we can only hope that this is a global phenomena that will lead to reasonable pricing in the nearest future.",

      "Content": "After having watched my mother continuously treated with damaging agents by alternative treatment practioners (some of which caused her late diagnosis at stage four and some of which could spread her cancer and some of which probably weakened her chemo treatments) I would not touch anyone other than mainstream allopathic practitioners with a ten foot pole. When it comes to these big profit making schemes online, I am even more distrustful. I'm a big proponent of Occam's razor: the simplest explanation is the most likely. In this case, if there were indeed a side-effect-free chemo that had a 90% response rate, it'd be all over the news and all oncologists would be using it. That they aren't makes me believe it is a scam. Given that cancer is the leading cause of death globally, any serious improvements in treatment would become part of common awareness extremely quickly. On top of that, the claim of being 'under attack' is a common marketing ploy scammers use to create the illusion of enormous success while explaining away the suspicious fact that their treatment has not become world famous. Purely on that basis, I would stay very far away from this doctor. Incidentally, a fracture where there is bone metastases is extremely serious and can lead to death. It is not 'do-able.'

      "Content": "Thanks Didee. I don't think paracetamol or aspirin are going to do the trick because she's currently using post-op painkillers, which only work a little. This herceptin throat seems a lot worse than the 'chemo-throat' she had. I looked into magic mouthwash. It's not a specific recipe, as it's altered by the doctor prescribing it, but it typically contains a painkiller, maalox (which they say lines the throat,) an anti inflammatory and a local anaesthetic. For anyone else reading, there are questions about its efficacy and safety, only because the specific combinations haven't been tested. Its typically prescribed for radiation and chemo. We shall give it a try, though. I'll see if her oncologist can whip something up.",

A more realistic trial and one that the FDA would pay attention to would continue for a year or three and would consist of at least a thousand patients. That trial would need to be followed by other trial phases. I'm not going to go through the others but would be surprised if any of them were any more scientific.",

      "Content": "Hi. I've been away for a while. My mother has terminal fourth stage breast cancer with metastases in her liver, sacrum, ribs, lymph nodes and bottom vertebrae. She has been lucky enough to have received herceptin for a year, which was a miracle for her because it extended her life an additional two years. Her liver tumour shrunk by 80 percent but radiation and chemo have done nothing for her bones. She is now in terrible pain and is being cared for by a Hospice worker from home. They are giving her morphine syrup, which is making her even more nauseous than the chemo did and not really getting to the bottom of her pain. Now the medical aid is stopping payments on the Herceptin so she will need to discontinue it--a serious blow to all of us. I was hoping for some advice, first on how to manage the morphine nausea. She is taking anti emetics and nexium for it but, again, there is no relief from them. Are there alternative pain killers or delivery methods that would minimise the side effects? Her quality of life is now entirely gone. She just stays in bed doing nothing all day. The oncologist now wants to start her on chemo pills, presumably for the bone metastases. It is not my decision to make but I would like to stay informed about this stage of the illness and attempts to make her life comfortable. Is there anything at all I and the family can do to support her symptoms?",

      "Content": "I hope you don't mind a family member of a cancer fighter in this area of the forum. My mom has 4th stage breast cancer and the cancer is extremely aggressive. It's moved to her liver, sacrum, two ribs, lymph nodes and vertebrae (low on the spine) and when she was diagnosed in June last year it was entirely by accident. She wasn't feeling on top of the world but she wasn't feeling ill either. She responded terribly to treatment and had a torturous chemo cycle. The doctors then stopped that because they decided there was nothing more they could do. She's on palliative care: a tiny bit of chemo and some bone strengtheners. She has eight months left according to the oncologist. The thing that's confusing me is that she is feeling really well. She's taken up hiking and photography and goes out into nature to take pictures. She gets tired from visits. I am struggling to understand how she could have fourth stage cancer if she is feeling so well. I'm fighting my denial and I don't know what to feel anymore. I'm so grateful that she's having quality of life. For my own personal journey with this cancer, though, I'm really struggling not to think she's not going to die so soon, and she's miraculously getting better. Emotionally, I'm just so confused. She has no pain. She's bubbling over with joy (aside from those moments when she realises the authentic situation.) I guess she's fighting her own denial too. I don't know if I can have hope because she's feeling well, or if that will land me in a whole lot of pain later. At the core, I have some awareness that she will die and I've been celebrating every special day with her spectacularly, as if it were her last, and seeing her as much as she'll let me, but on the other hand it just keeps going through my head that maybe she's getting better. That's illogical--or is it.",

      "Content": "Didee, if my mom did everything I wanted her to do, she'd have sought a second and third opinion by now, be notified about clinical trials, and be consulting with her oncologist with every symptom. But she has only sought one opinion, and I know my mom well enough not to try to convince her to seek another. I also get a sense that she needs to deal with this in the best way she can, both practically and emotionally, so I really try to allow her that. So for now all I can do is phone the oncologist she is seeing, who says statistically she has six months, and that there is no room left for 'miracles.' Incidentally, before the chemo, when my mom was also in fourth stage, she did allow for that possibility. I have discussed my mom's position with my own doctor in depth, and she has told me that the oncologist is being optimistic. She seems to think death will come sooner. But again, I spoke to a friend whose mom had breast cancer some years back, and she was given little time but lived for three years.Maybe the solution is to try to live in the present, as you say, instead of trying to predict the future. I guess I'm trying to find hope to grasp onto and struggling to accept that I'm powerless here. As someone said to me on sunday, this isn't supposed to be easy. But maybe it can be precious.",
