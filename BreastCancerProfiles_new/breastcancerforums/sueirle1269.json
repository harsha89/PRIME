      "Content": "Dawn, I just stumbled on this site looking for info. for a friend of mine who is suffering from lung cancer. I happened to read a few of your posts and wanted to share some info. with you. I haven't read all of your posts, so I apologize if I don't know your whole story. My mom had breast cancer three years ago. About one month after she was diagnosed I found a \"lump\" in my breast. I was horrified! I went to two doctors who didn't feel a \"lump\", but also said my breast was \"lumpy\". After mammogram and ultrasound and nothing found I was still a wreck. My O.B. was convinced because I also had severe pain that it was swollen breast tissue and was probably hormonally induced. My doctor prescribed a diuretic and said to try taking a bcomplex vitamin. It took a few months and an increase in my dosage, but the pains and lumps are pretty much gone. I occasionally get a small pain or a lumpy feeling, but nothing like I used to have. The pain I got before treatment was severe. I thought for sure something must be terribly wrong. I hope this provides you with a little relief. Sue",
