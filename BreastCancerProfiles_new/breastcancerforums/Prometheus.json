      "Content": "I'll throw in my two cents as a radiation therapist. Yes seeding through tumor biopsy or excision is a possibility, but imagine if you never had the excision/biopsy you'd be way worse off. It's better for doctors to know what they're dealing with so they can come up with a proper treatment approach. If they do the biopsy and the tumor is benign you're in the clear no worries. If they do the biopsy and the tumor is malignant than they know they must take appropriate action. For breast cancer a combination chemo and radiation therapy approach is common. For radiation therapy the whole breast is treated for a period of time to eliminate the initial cancer and any microscopic cancer that might be in the breast, after the initial phase of the treatment a \"boost\" is given. The boost is basically extra radiation given to the tumor site and scar from the tumor removal, the goal of the \"boost\" is to kill any possible remaining cancer that may have seeded during the tumor removal. So in a nutshell from how I see it as a radiation therapist. Yes, you may be at risk for seeding during a biopsy but it's better to know you have cancer and get the proper treatment than to refuse a biopsy for fear of seeding and let your potential cancer go untreated. Breast treatments account for seeding from the biopsy and always give more than enough chemo/radiation to eliminate all possibility of a second incidence. So the original post does bring some important information to light but at the same time if you have or may have breast cancer don't be alarmed. This may be news to the general public but to the team that is treating you it is old news and you will receive the proper course of treatment.",
