    "Content": "My mom recently had a physical and doctor found a lump. It seemed to move under the skin so Doc was optimistic that it was cystic. Just as a precaution my mom was sent to get a mamm. This led to a biopsy that showed the presence of some cancer cells in this mass. She is now scheduled for an MRI. Why are the docs sending her to get an mri if she already had a mamm and biopsy. Is it that they are looking for more cells that may have spread? I don't understand. I don't want to lose her, but I am fearing the worse. I'd like to know what stage and the aggressiveness of her cancer, but I can't seem to get any answers. She was too afraid to ask and we have yet to get documents showing the results of her tests. If anyone can talk to me, I'd really appreciate it. Thank you!",
