      "Content": "Hi, Saw my BCN and Surgeon today, and it was decided I should have another ultra sound and to my relief it showed up not one but three cysts which were very tender indeed. The largest was aspirated to relieve the pressure and I too now feel relieved. The surgeon will see me in a couple of weeks for a routine check and will ensure it hasn't refilled.......... Why do we always imagine the worst.....",

      "Content": "Hi Brainman, thank you for responding so promptly. I had a phone call from the BC Nurse this evening and she has got me an appointment with the surgeon who did my original operation on friday. We had a chat and a Cyst was suggested as a possibility and if so the surgeon will possibly aspirate. I am feeling a bit less stressed now, common sense tells me that is is unlikely to be a recurrence so early. thank you once again and I will let you know the outcome after my visit to the hospital.",

      "Content": "I am 60 years old and was diagnosed last Oct 2007 with Stage 1 Grade 2 Invasive Ductal Cancer ER+ PR+ Her - I had a WLE and ANS - no lymph node involvement so had 20 doses of Rx (finished just a few weeks ago) also prescribed Letrozole. Suddenly over the last two weeks a large walnut sized lump has grown and is painful and my breast is a little inflamed and itchy. I am waiting to see my consultant surgeon urgently. Could this be Inflammatory Breast Cancer or recurrence ?",
