      "Content": "Thank you and I tend to agree with the not waiting 6 mos. When I told my daughter that was what the radiologist wanted me to do, she was livid. I too have thought about what could happen if I wait. I want to know now and have it taken care of and if need be start treatment IF it is indeed cancer. The sooner the better I would think. I have an appointment with the doctor next Thursday and am going to push to have this looked into and hopefully resolved.",

      "Content": "Hello, I just had a routine mammogram yesterday and they said that there was a small cyst or lump very deep in my breast, so deep that they had trouble picking it up on the ultrasound. They also said it couldn't be felt through self exam. I am 45 and going through peri-menopause, I don't know if it's all related or not. Anyway, the radiologist said to wait for 6 months and then have another mammogram done. I'm at a complete loss and worried sick. Should I get a second opinion or wait it out? Any advice would be so greatly appreciated. My thought's and prayer's are with everyone.",
