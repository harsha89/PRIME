    "Content": "A little over a week ago I had a diagnostic mammogram followed by an ultrasound for a lump I discovered during a self exam. Lump did not show up on Mam but was visible on ultrasound. 2 days later I had a core biopsy. biopsy report says it is infiltrating ductal cancer that may be into the pectoral muscle. less than a week later I had a lumpectomy with sentinal node biopsy. Dr called today to say that good news is that it was a stage 1 and biopsy had clear margins BUT one of the 2 nodes showed metastic deposits. may need another surgery. What does this mean? what are my options now? Before he did say I would need 6 weeks of rads, will I also need chemo now? still waiting on the hormone test results. I tried looking for info on metasic deposits in nodes but cant find anything. most forum threads are ones that had negative node tests. please help me with what my options are so that I can get this done and get this cancer out of me and move on with my life. I am a 37 year old mom of three girls, ages are 12-14-18. any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",
