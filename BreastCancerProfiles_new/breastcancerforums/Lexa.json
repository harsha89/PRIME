      "Content": "Hello Worrygirl. For peace of mind I would definitely get a second opinion. I recommend that you see a breast specialist It may be nothing to be concerned about but in my experience, it's best to be examined by a specilaist in the field. No one can really know for sure without a biopsy but a specialist will let you know whether one is warranted. Good luck!",

      "Content": "Hello Amy You are correct in that there are other reasons this could be happening but it is critical to rule cancer in or out, I highly recommend that you take your films and get a consult with a breast specialist. My mom had bloody discharge from her nipple and unfortunately it was cancer but she is here to talk about it 24 years later. Again, to get definitive answers, I would indeed see a breast specialist who will indeed give you a thorough exam, examine your films and definitely do a biopsy to determine what is going on as there is nothing worse than not knowing. Good luck and please keep us posted.",
