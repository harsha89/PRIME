    "Content": "Hello, My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 DLBCL, but onco said it is as good as stage 4 since spleen was involved. she is through 6RCHOP on March 7, 2014. The PET CT done after 2 months of break showed left breast lump activity, which was there even before starting treament, but doctor said it may be due to DLBCL. To check breast activity breast lumpectomy was done and it showed different cancer ie Triple negative breast cancer, 2 cm tumor size no lymph nodes involved. however we got modified radical masectomy was performed. But my onco say no more treatment since she received 6 RCHOP and H and C also work on breast cancer. No radiation also given for breast. Any comments. i thought radiation is compulsory for breast and why no treatment.",
