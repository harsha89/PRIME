      "Content": "Hi Everyone! For those of you that haven't heard of us before, please allow me to provide a summary on My Hope Chest, a charity that I began working with a few months ago when I applied for assistance: The purpose of the My Hope Chest Breast Reconstruction Fund is to help restore self-esteem and dignity to breast cancer/mastectomy survivors by facilitating breast reconstruction surgery for those who do not have adequate financial means to afford such surgery. We work with plastic reconstructive surgeons who agree to accept a reduced rate fee for and/or donate services. We've developed a survey that NEEDS YOUR PARTICIPATION, please!!! The information we get from this study will be used to help us gather support to further this mission. It seems that the need for reconstruction surgery funds is overlooked by many; and almost seen as a non-issue because insurance that covers mastectomy pays for reconstruction now (most of the time); and LET'S NOT FORGET that a good deal of people still think of breast reconstruction as cosmetic. We who have had mastectomy KNOW BETTER. Now we have to let the rest of the world know, too. Your participation is VITAL to My Hope Chest. We have dozens of women waiting for our help - I'm one of them, too - and funding is hard to come by without proving the great need. The survey will only take a few minutes, and is easily accessed by a link on our website. Personal information is not required for your participation, but there is a place for you to share it with us if you'd like further information from us, etc. {links deleted by admin.} THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! God Bless!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I spent the day posting all over the net & sending over 500 emails to get the word out on the My Hope Chest study, and forgot the specific rules for this forum. I will try not to do this again. Any chance you can copy & post this message for me with links, please? You know I had to at least ask.... Regards, Victoria",

      "Content": "Hi Eleanor, Sorry to hear about your mom's troubles. What a wonderfully brave woman she must be to have been battling for 23 years... WOW!!! I don't have any advice or medical expertise to pass on, but I want to send my regards & prayers. Are you an authorized person to be made privvy to her medical file, so that u can ask her doctor/s what the deal is? That's where I would start. Hospice people have knowledge to share from experience, but docs are more likely to give it to you straight based on training, etc. Since they spend all that money on schooling, I'd like to think they have lots of information to share.... lol..... Force yourself into \"the loop\" if u really need to know the details. SOMEONE should be telling u what u can do to at least make your mom feel more comfortable. Best wishes for all that you are dealing with. Your mom is lucky to have such a concerned daughter that took the time to post on here. Please post updates when they become available.",
