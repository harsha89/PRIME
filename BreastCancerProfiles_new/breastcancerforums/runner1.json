    "Content": "The tip from Muttsmom is so important it can't be stressed enough...drink tons of water! It does make a big difference! I had a mast w/free tram flap reconstruction and didn't have much pain at all. I would definately go for the diep...my plastic surgeon didn't do that type of reconstruction then but I've heard it's definately the way to go. My chemo was FEC x 6. It was not pleasant but not totally debilitating. I worked the whole time (I was even able to continue running although a lot slower!!). I had my chemo every 3 weeks on a Friday so would take that Friday off and have the weekend to feel my worst. By Monday I was doing okay. I just felt more draggy then usual but it wasn't as bad as I'd feared. I have just located a lump in my axilla which I'm getting looked at on 1 June. I have a feeling it is my bc coming back as the lump has gotten bigger so I'm trying to prepare myself. I'm sorry yours was a recurrence but as one of the other ladies said...if you have to have a recurrence, a loco-regional is the best to have. -Sandy",
