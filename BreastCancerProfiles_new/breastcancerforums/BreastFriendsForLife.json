    "Content": "Hello all you strong, brave women and men, I'm new to this community, and I'm hoping to learn from all of you, and give support where I can. I have recently registered to participate in the Breast Cancer 3-Day in Boston this August. It is a 60-mile walk over three days, but this will be so much more than \"just a walk\". The Breast Cancer 3-Day is a weekend of hope, as we honor lives lost, celebrate survivors, promote breast cancer research and help bring breast cancer care to those who so desperately need it. My personal challenge begins now. Over the next several months, I will be spending many, many hours in training and helping to spread the word about breast cancer awareness. There are times when I don't feel like training or my feet hurt or I'm just tired. Then I think of all the people that I care about who have been affected by breast cancer or who might be affected by it in the future. I walk for them. I also walk for you amd the important women (and men) in your life! I walk for our friends, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, cousins, sisters and daughters. Aside from walking 60 miles over the course of three days, I have also committed to raising a minimum of $2200 to participate in the 3-Day, but my hope is to surpass this goal. The more funds that we can raise, the closer we get to finding a cure! Net proceeds from the Breast Cancer 3-Days benefit Susan G. Komen for the Cure to fund breast cancer research, education, screening and treatment programs, as well as the National Philanthropic Trust Breast Cancer Fund, to provide an endowment for breast cancer initiatives. Please consider making a fully tax-deductible donation to help me achieve my goal. I will be doing all the walking (or crawling)...all you need to do is to go to www.the3day.org/boston07/lenirehill to make an online donation. Even the smallest amount counts! If you would like to make a donation in support, honor or memory of a loved-one I'll be happy to wear that special someone's name on a T-shirt at the 3-Day. I would also like to invite you to join our team, \"Breast Friends For Life\", if you would like to participate in the walk. To learn more about the Breast Cancer 3-Day, visit www.The3Day.org Thank you so much for taking the time to read this. Please pass this message on to anybody who might want to help. I hope that you will join me in this fight against breast cancer! Sincerely, Leni",
