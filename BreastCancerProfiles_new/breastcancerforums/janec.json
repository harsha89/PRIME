      "Content": "Hey, thanks for the replies guys... I'm not entirely sure, but think it was hormonal - she got cancer around the menopause and with undiagnosed diabetes, so think that points to hormonal? I don't know which chemo regimes they have tried, only that initially she was told that if the first one didn't work, they had another one and that one would work... Neither of these seem to be doing any good, so now oncology say there are another 2 they can try... Sorry, i know you can't really tell me much without the facts... Thanks for the help though...",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm just looking for some advice on the amount of chemotherapy options. My mother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer almost 4 years ago. She had mastectomy followed by chemo and tamoxifin. In Feb this year she found a lump in her chest tissue (between ribs). Scans showed lump and some cancer in glands in neck. Chemotherapy followed by radio was suggested. She has tried one lot of chemo (3 sessions) which didn't work. Now on second lot and after 3 sessions still no joy. She has been told there are 2 more types they can try. I just want to know what the likelyhood is that either of these may work, or what other options are if not? Also, the docs have been doing a scan after 3 sessions to check progress. When she went for her 4th this time, they didn't have the test results because of new compter system, but they gave the chemo regardless. I don't understand why they gave the 4th lot before knowing the results??? My ma gets very ill with the chemo and 3 out of the 4 times ended up in hospital with very bad infections. Any help appreciated. I live 11,000 miles from home, so hard to get the full facts... Thanks v much",
