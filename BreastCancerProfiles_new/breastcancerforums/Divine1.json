My husband came in last friday night to pick me up and we were going to stay in Iowa till Sunday and come back home to Ill. We had gone to my other brothers house for a visit and was leaving there about 12:40 am when out out the blue a car ran the stop and T-Boned our Truck. I have a 1 ton Dodge Ram Dully, But she hit us so hard that it threw us to a spin and then into a retaining brick wall. Well I got banged up and my New Implant in No Longer in the spot it is suppose to be.It does hurt and I just went to see my PS yesturday. He said I have to wait 4 week before he can fix it,,, I guess the swelling??The SEATBELT had done all the damage on the RT implant.. I have lower back pain along with other milder things, All I can say is thankgod I had A BIG Truck. Good Luck to all Hugs Tammy",

      "Content": "Thankyou to all that replied to my Question. My question Now Is to Dr Jay? What do you mean when you say my daughter has a greater chance developing BC because of Family Histosy? Do you mean Me? I am the Only one in the whole family that has ever had BC. So that does mean she is at a Bigger Risk now, even though my Breast Cancer was brought on by Premarin? That is what I really don't understand? Why? If I had a Hyst at a early age, No Cancer, and was put on this, ended up with BC later in the years why does this effect our daughters?? Thankyou for listening to my questions.. Sincerely, Tammy",

Iam on the 5 yr treatment of Arimidex and so I do not Need the Port No longer. His worry is if a part of this breaks of inside then it can travel and go to the heart and that could be deadly. So Iam with my Dr all the way. I go on the 20th my birthday to get my nipple and tatto done and then following that the port will be pulled. Then all this will be over and done, No looking back only looking forward to bigger and better things in the future. (2005) Gob Bless you all,, Tammy",

      "Content": ",Good Evening to all. I hope you all are doing well these days. I went to my PS dr on Tuesday and we have a date of Feb 23rd for my Breast surgery. Those of you that know me I was in a car accident the 8th of Jan 05 and I have Implants due to reconstruction from BC, well the seat belt did it's job and held me tight, So tight that is ripped my implant out of it's place. Now when these are put in your chest they are sewen in a pocket into the chest wall, well that is what ripped. When I lay on my back my Implant lays down along on my side, there is pain along with that. So anyway!!! I am going to have this fixed and I will have my breast look good once again, and may I add I pray to the good lord that I have No more bad luck. So I just thought I would let you know what was going on with me.. God Bless you all and Thanks for listening.. Hugs and Love to all, Tammy",
