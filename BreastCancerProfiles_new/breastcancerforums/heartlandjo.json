She and three of her friends wrote a book called \"Nordie's At Noon.\" They are four young gals each diagnosed with BC. If I remember correctly, three were in their 20's and the fourth was in her early 30's. They would get together at Nordstrom's for gooey dessert and mutual support. I wish you success on your journey and a full and speedy recovery. Jo",
