I know of some women who have gone the oopherectomy route, but I don't think any of them post here. I would expect Dr. Lu can offer more insight into radiation to the ovaries, but it does not sound like your doctor thinks it is such a keen idea. Good luck in making your decision. Lauri",

Also, the hormone receptivity of her tumor will dictate additional medication she may be urged to take. I know that you must feel frightened and nervous about all of this, but it is doable. Women survive breast cancer every day, and more every year. If you can, like Shelly suggested, go to the doctor's appointments with your mom. It will help you understand what she is going to go through and a second set of ears is always helpful for the patient. There is a lot of good information at the Imaginis.com web site. I suggest you check it out. Don't hesitate to come here with questions and concerns, too. We will do what we can to help both of you. Hugs, Lauri",

I read Dr. Lu's response on the other board and think you got solid advice. I think the recommendation for mammography is usually 40, at least for a baseline. Breast self-exams are really important to do monthly so you get familiar with your own body. That way you are more likely to notice lumps, bumps or other changes. If you do not know how to do a self-exam, check the American Cancer Society's web site for more information. I agree with Nancy (Muttsmom) in saying that you should have an annual check up with your gynocologist or primary care physican for a clinical breast exam and PAP test as well as other routine tests. I hope this helps. Greetings from Minnesota. Lauri",

      "Content": "Hi Pam, welcome to the board. Sorry you need to be here, and sorrier yet that you are in such a difficult situation. I know that Tamoxifen is sometimes prescribed for women who are not in menopause. I have a Michigan \"breast friend\" who is in her late 30s and is just finishing her 5 yrs on tamoxifen -- and she is certainly not menopausal. I certainly would not think that you need a hysterectomy when nothing is wrong with your uterus or ovaries. Oncs sometimes put women into \"chemo-pause\" during treatment using drugs to shut down the production of hormones. I suspect this is what your doctor referred to when he suggested a pill every three months. We have gals here at every stage of treatment and at every age, so I am sure you will hear from some of them. In addition, one or both our our resident doctors may respond to your questions. Here is an excellent web site with information on Tamoxifen. http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth...en.asp#what_is Good luck. Lauri",

I read Dr. Lu's response on the other board and think you got solid advice. I think the recommendation for mammography is usually 40, at least for a baseline. Breast self-exams are really important to do monthly so you get familiar with your own body. That way you are more likely to notice lumps, bumps or other changes. If you do not know how to do a self-exam, check the American Cancer Society's web site for more information. I agree with Nancy (Muttsmom) in saying that you should have an annual check up with your gynocologist or primary care physican for a clinical breast exam and PAP test as well as other routine tests. I hope this helps. Greetings from Minnesota. Lauri",

My mother has had this and it was very painful. I also agree that you need to pursue the pains in your remaining breast. I may be nothing more than irritated nerves, but you want to know. Sorry about the insurance situation and the absence of your preferred doctors. What bad timing. Angel offered a couple of suggestions that sound like they are worth trying.

Most would assume that after 13 years you would have been considered \"cured,\" but this is just another example of why we are reluctant to associate that word with breast cancer. I know the survivors and the doctors disagree on this point, but too often we hear of long-term survivors who have recurrances. I cannot answer your questions, but I am sure others will offer their views. There is a good Web site at www.imaginis.com that has a lot of breast cancer information. You might try there. The only time I was advised to avoid anti-prespirants was during radiation and before mammograms, so I am not sure what your plastic surgeon is concerns about. Again, welcome on board. I'll scoot over to make room on the sofa for you. Hugs, Lauri",

In addition, you will find people here at all ages and stages of treatment and recovery. I did not have chemo, so I cannot address you problems from personal experience. But, from what i have heard from others, neuropathy is a common problem with Taxol. The pins and needles feelings are probably related to that. I would certainly talk to your onc. about the discomfort. Perhaps there is another drug they can give you that would offer some relief to get you through those last treatments. Maybe someone else on the board has another sugguestion. Good luck. And, please keep us posted on how you are doing. Feel free to jump into any discussion. Your views are always welcome. If you have not, please take a moment to find our roll call post and add your name. It is a great place to learn about who is here. Hugs, Lauri",

      "Content": "Your mother's treatment sounds pretty standard. Like Shelly said, a lot will depend on what they find in the lymph nodes. Also, the hormone receptivity of her tumor will dictate additional medication she may be urged to take. I know that you must feel frightened and nervous about all of this, but it is doable. Women survive breast cancer every day, and more every year. If you can, like Shelly suggested, go to the doctor's appointments with your mom. It will help you understand what she is going to go through and a second set of ears is always helpful for the patient. There is a lot of good information at the Imaginis.com web site. I suggest you check it out. Don't hesitate to come here with questions and concerns, too. We will do what we can to help both of you. Hugs, Lauri",

My mother has had this and it was very painful. I also agree that you need to pursue the pains in your remaining breast. I may be nothing more than irritated nerves, but you want to know. Sorry about the insurance situation and the absence of your preferred doctors. What bad timing. Angel offered a couple of suggestions that sound like they are worth trying.

      "Content": "Hi Pam, welcome to the board. Sorry you need to be here, and sorrier yet that you are in such a difficult situation. I know that Tamoxifen is sometimes prescribed for women who are not in menopause. I have a Michigan \"breast friend\" who is in her late 30s and is just finishing her 5 yrs on tamoxifen -- and she is certainly not menopausal. I certainly would not think that you need a hysterectomy when nothing is wrong with your uterus or ovaries. Oncs sometimes put women into \"chemo-pause\" during treatment using drugs to shut down the production of hormones. I suspect this is what your doctor referred to when he suggested a pill every three months. We have gals here at every stage of treatment and at every age, so I am sure you will hear from some of them. In addition, one or both our our resident doctors may respond to your questions. Here is an excellent web site with information on Tamoxifen. http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth...en.asp#what_is Good luck. Lauri",

It's hard to tell what's under the skin where I had lumpectomy. I've had a second biopsy in the same area, and there is scar tissue from the surgeon mucking about to make sure nothing else was there. I see my PCP (primary care physican) annually and get a lecture about how I need to lose weight (tell me something I don't know ), and I see my oncologist once a year. He has blood drawn for a series of tests he calls a \"cancer panel.\" So far, in eight years, nothing is amiss. That's about it. I take meds for underactive thyroid, an antidepressan, a low-dose diuretic to help with blood pressure, Lipitor for my cholesterol (genetically elativated) and Fosomax for my thinning bones. Other than that, I am all right. Hope you are having a good week. Welcome to the board. Hugs, Lauri",

I have no expertise with homeopathic treatments. Most of the women I know have used conventional chemo therapy. There are a number of drug cocktails being used here in the United States, but I do not know if they are available in India. Nor, do I know about your access to choices in medical providers. I would certainly hope you could find a doctor willing to go the extra distance in finding treatments for your wife. I had a good friend who survived five years after being diagnosed at Stage IV. So, I would hope there might be help for your wife. Dr. Leo has assembled some good resources here for you to explore. Another useful web site is www.imaginis.com. Sending warm wishes and prayers for your wife, Lauri",

My surgeon removed as much of my tiny lump as he could during a biopsy, so I am not surprised that is what you are scheduled for. Wire guided is often done, according to the medical staff where I had my biopsies done. What you are being told about treatment is dependent on the pathology report. IMHO it is all speculation at this point, so try not to go there, yet. Good luck on the fifth. My thoughts will be with you. Please let us know how things go and what you find out. We will be thrilled if it is benign, and will hold your hand if the news is not good. Try not to worry until you know you have something to worry about. Take care, Lauri",

TIA, Lauri Hello, I was in the process of searching information about tissue expanders and came across your site. I have read the postings with interest and would like to be on board also. I had a lumpectomy in 91 with radiation and here I am 13 years later with re-curring breast ca. I elected to have a bi-lateral mastectomy because I don' t want to do this any more. I had the sentinel node dissection done and there was no sentinel node found so they removed a few nodes to be safe. I have tissue expanders in and will start expansion next week. I have found this whole thing quite uncomfortable expecially the side that was previously radiated. I am now on anti-biotics for infection. When I saw the plastic surgeon she said I cannot use antiperspirants. Have any of you been told that? When researching I also found that parabens are thought to be a bad thing with breast ca. Do you know anything about that? I have to say only prayer has brought me through this. I am so looking forward to getting the next surgery over. _________________ Blessings, Betty",

The head may know that, but sometimes it's hard to accept that fact. I know. I sure relate to your feeling of being under a \"black cloud.\" That's exactly how I felt, too. At the first anniversary of my diagnosis, I remember too well sitting in my onc.'s office with my head on his desk saying, \"I know I am well, that I am all right, but I don't feel like it. I don't feel hopeful or optimistic.\" He suggested I see a therapist for some counseling, and I have been on antidepressants ever since. They help a lot. I know many women who fight cancer-related depression, so it is not that unusual. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you think it might help you. Please stay in touch and let us know how we can help.

I have a husband that always looks for the worst in any situation and always expects things to go wrong for him. His whole family was that way. On the other hand, I tend to expect things to work out for the best. I don't know about scientific studies, but I would suspect that a positive attitude goes a long way in helping people recover from surgery and/illness. And, you are so right.

They appear like little specks on the mammogram, and when fine calcificiations are clustered together, the can indicate the presence of cancer. But, NOT ALWAYS. I had micro-calcifications under my lumpectomy incision, but there was no cancer. Anyway, you are on the right path in getting additional diagnostic tests done. Keep us posted on how you are doing and what you find out. Do not hesitate to bring your questions here. Either of the docs or one of the board members is likely to have a good answer for you. In the meantime, do check out the Imaginis Web site. It has lots of good information. Good luck. Lauri http://www.imaginis.com/glossary/glossary_c.asp",

It sounds like you are progressing well. If your doctor does not have some standard exercises, try your branch of the American Cancer Society. They have a Reach for Recovery program, and I would think they would offer some exercises. I'll see if I can find some on-line sites with more information. It's been so long since I had my surgery, I have forgotten just what I did. But, I do remember walking my fingers up the wall. Like you I had little discomfort, which surprised me.

I have a husband that always looks for the worst in any situation and always expects things to go wrong for him. His whole family was that way. On the other hand, I tend to expect things to work out for the best. I don't know about scientific studies, but I would suspect that a positive attitude goes a long way in helping people recover from surgery and/illness. And, you are so right.

My surgeon removed as much of my tiny lump as he could during a biopsy, so I am not surprised that is what you are scheduled for. Wire guided is often done, according to the medical staff where I had my biopsies done. What you are being told about treatment is dependent on the pathology report. IMHO it is all speculation at this point, so try not to go there, yet. Good luck on the fifth. My thoughts will be with you. Please let us know how things go and what you find out. We will be thrilled if it is benign, and will hold your hand if the news is not good. Try not to worry until you know you have something to worry about. Take care, Lauri",

      "Content": "Hi Maria, and welcome to the board. Sorry about your sister's diagnosis, but like other others have said, this sounds like it is really early, which is good. That's when cancer is most treatable and the prognosis for long-term survivial is best. I am sure your sister's surgery will go smoothly. Even with a mastectomy, an overnight stay is about all you get anymore if there are no complications. Regardless of whether she has lumpectomy or mast., she will get post-op care instructions and exercises to do to restore range of motion in her arm on the side where the surgery is done. I know it feels like there is a lot of information to digest all at one time, and there really is. But, we will do our best to walk you through it all. Like Margie said, just being with your sister during this time is one of the best things you can do. She is going to need someone to listen to her and she reacts to this diagnosis. You are being a good friend to her by just listening. If you need additional information on Breast Cancer, there are some good links on this board, or you can try the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. Kohmen Foundation, Dr. Susan Love's or Imaginis.com Web sites. If you are unable to find these sites, let me know and I will get you clickable links. Hugs, Lauri",

You might try propping pillows around yourself in bed to get comfortable. Or, use that recliner. My DH has allegies that bother him in the fall, and occasionally sacks out in our reclinder because the sinus drainage does not bother him as much. The bottom line is do what you have to do to be comfortable while you mend. Have a good week. Gentle hugs, Lauri",

I've had two biopsies done with wire localization. Neither one was terribly uncomfortable. I hope yours was not painful. At the hospital where I had my biopsies, the radiologists said most doctors use the wire localization procedure. That way they don't miss what they are looking for. Let us know how you are doing when you feel up to it, Lauri",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, welcome to the board. You question is really beyond my scope of knowledge, but I'll harzard a guess as to why the doctors are not recommending a CAT scan at this time. Your cancers were found at the very earliest stage. You did not mention the status of lymph nodes, but I am assuming they were neg. Since the cancer was found at Stage 0 the doctor probably does not think there is any reason to do further testing at this point as it is unlikely the cancer has spread. This is just my guess. I was diagnosed at Stage 1 and have not had CAT or MRI scans. My onc. said blood work and physical exam just do not warrant these tests. Hope this help. I am sure Dr. Leo or Dr. Lu will offer their advice, too, as well as other board members. Take care, Lauri",

This is serious stuff and it is what we do not know that frightens us in situations like this. I did not have chemo, but many of my breast friends did. And, they all say it is doable. I am sure some of the gals here will post about their experiences with chemo. A couple of things that I hear repeatedly are to drink lots and lots of water to flush the drugs through your system. The other is to take the anti-naseua meds whether you think you are going to need them or not. Finally, most say that losing their hair was the most traumatic part of the treatment. But, it does grow back. What I am sharing is hearsay, so I hope some experienced hands share their knowledge with you. Glad to see you back on the board. Hugs, Lauri",

My PCP has me on 70 mg of Fosomax for bone density, Wellburtirn for depression, at 25 mg diuretic (HCTZ) to help with slightly elevated blood pressure and Lipitor for my cholesterol. I am supposed to be taking 1200 mg of calcium + Vit. D daily but I seldom remember. I try to remember to take an aspirin and a multi-vitamin daily, too. I have tried Glucosamine Condroiten but did not see any improvement in my arthritis. When I remember, I try to take a fish oil capsule each day. I really need to organize all the pills into one of those daily reminder boxes so I don't forget to take them. Lauri",

You might try propping pillows around yourself in bed to get comfortable. Or, use that recliner. My DH has allegies that bother him in the fall, and occasionally sacks out in our reclinder because the sinus drainage does not bother him as much. The bottom line is do what you have to do to be comfortable while you mend. Have a good week. Gentle hugs, Lauri",

      "Content": "Hi Danielle, welcome to the board. Your mom's diagnosis sounds just like mine, a 6 mm (I think that is .6 cm if my math is right) tumor infiltrating ductal carcinoma. I had a lumpectomy, not a mast. You mom is a bit younger than I was at diagnosis. I was 50 -- just a few months shy of 51. My daughter was a student in college at the time. I know that she was really concerned about me. She went to her college professors and told them what was going on. They were all understanding and cut her a lot of slack in getting assignments done that quarter. Anyway, that was almost 9 years ago. Now, DD is married and has a DD of her own. I hope your mom has somone to go with her when she visits the doctors to talk about treatment. Your head is in such a spin it helps to have a second set of ears to help digest the information. A tape recorder also is a good way to make sure you don't miss any vital information. Please keep us posted on how your mom is doing, or give her this link and let her come to us. Sending comforting and calming hugs, Lauri",

      "Content": "Doc, I have gotten this message from two souces, so it seems it is making the rounds. I just wondered if there is any truth to this or is another of those urban legends/myths that we encounter from time to time. Lauri Subject: UPDATE FROM JOHNS HOPKINS HEALTH CENTER Johns Hopkins has recently sent this out in their newsletters. This information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Dioxin Carcinogens cause cancer. Especially breast cancer. Don't freeze plastic water bottles with water in them as this also releases dioxin from the plastic. Dr. Edward Fujimoto from Castle hospital was on a TV program explaining this health hazard. (He is the manager of the Wellness Program at the hospital.) He was talking about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said we should not heat our food in the microwave using plastic containers. This applies particularly to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination of fat, high heat and plastics releases dioxin into the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Dioxins are carcinogens and highly toxic to the cells of our bodies. Instead, he recommends using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers for heating food. You get the same results, without the dioxin. So such things as TV dinners, instant Ramin and soups, etc., should be removed from the container and heated in something else. Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. Just safer to use tempered glass, Corning Ware, etc. Remember when some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the foam containers to paper? The dioxin problem is one of the reasons. To add to this: Saran wrap placed over foods as they are nuked, with the high heat, actually drips poisonous toxins into the food, use paper towels instead.",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, welcome to the board. You question is really beyond my scope of knowledge, but I'll harzard a guess as to why the doctors are not recommending a CAT scan at this time. Your cancers were found at the very earliest stage. You did not mention the status of lymph nodes, but I am assuming they were neg. Since the cancer was found at Stage 0 the doctor probably does not think there is any reason to do further testing at this point as it is unlikely the cancer has spread. This is just my guess. I was diagnosed at Stage 1 and have not had CAT or MRI scans. My onc. said blood work and physical exam just do not warrant these tests. Hope this help. I am sure Dr. Leo or Dr. Lu will offer their advice, too, as well as other board members. Take care, Lauri",

It has been a delight to watch DGD Melanie Rose, who is 16 months old, play with all the new toys. Of course, the grandparents are only to happy to keep her occupied. What a cutie she is! We have a houseful here, and there is more snow in Indiana than in Minnesota! Hard to believe. However, the forcast is for days in the 50s by the end of the week, so the snow will go. We are heading back home Wednesday or Thursday and will take two days. Happy New Year to all and may 2005 bring us closer to a cure. Hugs, Lauri",

I know what you mean about wanting to celebrate with other survivors -- women who have walked this same road. It seems like no one understands us like someone who has \"been there, done that.\" The women on one of the other boards I post on have regular gatherings. We've gotten together since 2000. I think there were almost 40 of us together in St. Louis. It is a grand way to share real hugs and get to know each other. It is always sad when we lose one of our dear breast friends. Since that St. Louis meeting, I think we have lost about one third of the fine women who were there. Each one of them has been a dear friend and has left a lasting memory. It is sad that so many have died, but I am richer for having known each of them. Happy hugs for you, Lauri",
