      "Content": "Thanks Maureen, Mom had a successful operation, she's recovering very well. According to her onco, after at least two weeks, she will start with her hormonal therapy and after a month with her chemo. Surprisingly, they didn't found any lymph node involvement. By the way, the case of my mom is, the primary is breast at 2 cm mass but with liver mets. I will have to clarify also with the doctor, what would be the parameter for staging because of these findings. I know that the main basis of staging is first the diameter of the mass and the organ involvement, I am a little bit confused also. Hoping for more positive results in the coming days. Thank you for your prayers, God bless.",

      "Content": "Previously I posted on the Liver cancer section, but because of my mom pet/ct scan, it has been finalized that the primary coming from the breast. She is due for the mastectomy on Jan 5, with frozen biopsy, after that depending on the degree of invasion, chemo. She's not that strong in terms of handling such difficulties, so we are always there for her, encouraging her. I am praying a lot for her fast recovery and God's mercy. I am spending most of my time with her, I love my mom so much.",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, We just visited the surgeon who performed the surgery for my mom, he remove the anterior tube and remained the posterior tube. We have to wait for another week to remove the second. We also learned that my mom is a triple negative form of BC, I know something about this, that is why I am keeping it to myself not to alarm other members of my family. We will see her onco on Monday to prepare for the treatment plan. This is the time when you can feel the necessity to pray, ask for God's help. This is also the time when you feel that you are just a speck of sand on this earth, so little time, so many things to do. I promise myself to be strong for my mom, whatever it takes, wherever we may go, till the end. Mama Mary please hold my mom tightly in your arms. Anybody who has some good experience with triple negative BC are welcome to enlighthen me more about this beast. Thank you.",
