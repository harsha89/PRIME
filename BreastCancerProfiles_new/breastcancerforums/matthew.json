    "Content": "- Age - Age of diagnosis or time since diagnosis - menopausal or not at diagnosis - Specific type of cancer (adenocarcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ, lobular carcinoma etc) - Markers such as estrogen and progesterone receptor status (ER/PR), her2neu status. - Stage at diagnosis - Treatments: surgery, chemotherapy (if possible with names), radiation, etc. - Please state your question clearly. - 21 - same, diagnosed on 15.06.2011 - invasive ductal breast cancer - Stage III - I'm clueless about these... I will get my results through post soon so I will be able to provide a greater insight. - No idea yet, my oncologist has to analyse and discuss my results with his team to come up with a treatment plan. I'm going to find out more tomorrow but they will soon schedule a mastectomy and lymphadenectomy as well as subsequent treatments. I have been hit massively with a cancer diagnosis. Some detailed information can be missing at the moment but as I said I will get my results soon so I will keep this updated with full medical details. Around a month ago I noticed a bump on my right breast. Soon after it started to get swollen and a I felt loads of pain around this breast and under my armpits. Also it reduced my mobility and standard painkillers stopped to work. Also I noted that my lymph nodes are swollen as well so I went to my doctor and he wasn't very optimistic and referred me immediately to hospital for further tests (blood, ultrasound and a biopsy) My consulting doctor said it's really rare to get a breast cancer in case of man (I got told that there are around hundred times less cases comparing to women) I have a cancer history in my immediate family... from my mother's side (grandmother: thyroid cancer and a PCC, grandfather: breast cancer but died due to other diseases before any treatment started) and from father's side (grandmother pancreatic cancer with multiple metastasis and grandfather had a brain tumour). I got told that my chances are weak but it's important to not give up. What should do now ? I haven't told my parents yet as I'm away at the university and my mother waits for lumpectomy (fibroadenoma) so I didn't want to bother them but soon I will have to and I'm completely clueless about how to deal with it mentally. Also how could I help myself ? Things like lifestyle changes Thank you for any advice, I'm torn inside",
