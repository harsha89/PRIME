    "Content": "Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this. My mother has metastatic breast cancer and is currently experiencing hypercalcemia. Her latest calcium levels are 9.6 mg/dL, and that is a vast improvement to the 15 mg/dL that she had a few days ago. She started taking sensipar (cinacalcet) in addition to the calcitonin she regularly receives. I attribute the sudden drop in Ca levels to the sensipar. Q: Is there anything else that I am not aware of that could help her calcium levels go down? Her potassium levels are also very low, for which the doctors have only ordered IV potassium and fluids. Q: Is there anything else that I am not aware of that could help her potassium levels go up? Finally, regarding the cancer itself, my mother has taken and stopped responding to the following chemotherapy agents: *Cytoxan+methotrexate+5-Fu (Fluorouracil) *Tamoxifen *Arimidex *Taxol+Avastin *Navelbine *Adriamycin *Afinitor+aromasin *Eribulin *Taxotere *Ixempra. Q: It had progressed far enough that her current oncologist seems to be taking a palliative approach and has a fatalistic attitude. Although my mother is near death, spontaneous remission is not unheard of and if there's another chemotherapy agent that I haven't heard of, or ANYTHING that I'm missing, PLEASE help my mother live! I know that spontaneous remission is rare, but I'm asking online out of desperation, so if you have anything to contribute I would appreciate it greatly! Please forgive the US trade names of chemo agents. If you are from another country, the generic names can be found via a quick google search.",
