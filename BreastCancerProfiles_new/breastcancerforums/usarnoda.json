      "Content": "Hi all, My name is Pat Schwartz. I was diagnosed with cancer 5 years ago, and I had been battling it since then. I tried so many different treatments, but every time I would go back for a check up, I would be told my cancer was still present. Somebody then told me about a website where they do alternative remedies. www.geocities.com/arnodait I didn't believe any of it at first. But since I was suffering a lot and would do anything just to feel better, I emailed them and my life changed radically. They have medicines that really do wonders. In less than 2 weeks, I felt much better. The treatment itself took about 3 months. Now I live cancer free, I am living a miracle. I urge everybody to try alternative treatments, any alternative treatments. Chemo, radio and all pharmaceutical drugs are not the only things that help. Your Mom too could get cured if she's still around. Use the internet. Pat",
