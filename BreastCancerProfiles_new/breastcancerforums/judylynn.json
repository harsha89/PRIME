      "Content": "Hi. I'm Judy, and when I was 18 I began having tumors removed from my breasts. They would show up every few years. In my early 30's I had a hysterctomy, and I always said that was the best surgery I ever had. I felt better and my monthly cycles were done. I had all the children I wanted. I've now had a mastectomy on the right side and I'd like to get the other off too. My insurance considers it a preventative measure and thay won't pay for it. My oncologist wants me to do the BRCA testing, and I haven't been able to afford it so far. The way I have understood it is that it may not make me feel better, but I can plan better as to prevention of cancer recurrence. Plus, it would mostly be for my daughter so she and her doctors could be more vigilant if it runs in our family. The counselor also said that if it's in our family, her insurance will be more likely to pay for her preventative care if the time comes.",

The doctors move very quickly sometimes, and questions you need answered aren't if they're not written down. Let me give you a couple of sites to go to where there is a lot of activity in terms of questions, answers on breast cancer. csn.cancer.org is good ; and beyondtheshock.com ; I think you can get a lot of information there from people who have gone through the same thing as your friend.",

I really don't no about the spot where these calcifications are, but mine always turned out benign. I guess some places can be worse than others, but I think it more depends on the type of cancer should you have that. I have heard of a few cases where people had cancer in both breasts at the same time, but not very often. Just keep in mind that it certainly may not be cancer.",

I expect my left breast will be taken off too in the next few years. I did have to take chemo, but my doctor said that the negative breast cancers are harder to treat, so maybe having the her2 positive will make it easier to treat.
