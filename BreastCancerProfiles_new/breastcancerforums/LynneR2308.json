    "Content": "Has anyone else had a Cardiac Arrest during a session of Chemo. A close friend of mine had 6 sessions of chemo (breast cancer), which finished 7 months ago. But during that final session she suffered a Cardiac Arrest. According to her hospital she is the only person to have survived this in the UK, so they do not know how to treat her side effects. She suffers still with white coated tongue, Sickness, buzzing in Ears, sore mouth with metal taste. They also have no idea as to how long these side effects will last. Can anyone advise on where to turn now? or give some support to show she is not alone? She feels totally isolated and although unique (and very special to us) it is very worrying for her. Your assistance would be very much appreciated, Cheers nb posted this on the open section of this site and have had no reply - can my friend in UK really be alone?",
