      "Content": "I totally agree with you. However, besides the methods you mentioned, I think the diet also plays the important role. As my opinion, consume foods suggested for cancer prevention is one of the cheapest, easiest and best way. As many research, wheat germ is very beneficial to prevent cancer. By adding wheat germ into daily diet, people may lower risk factors for many cancer types. In fact, wheat germ shows good ability to neutralize glucose metabolism and keep numerous kinases in check. Glucose metabolism and kinases are 2 factor which may trigger cancer. Thus, it is the permanent food in my meals. Source: https://wikihomenutrition.com/wheat-...ealth-benefits",
