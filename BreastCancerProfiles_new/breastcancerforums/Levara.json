    "Content": "My Dad rang me on 1 July 07 to tell me that my Mum had lung cancer. It shook my world upside down. I have always been classed as the 'rock' of the family, by my Mum, Dad and little sister. Mum went downhill, and died at home with me, my Dad and my sister all there on 15 October 2007. My sis has not coped so well and shed plenty of tears. I have shed a few but neither my Dad nor Me have had the big cry. I keep saying, \"I'm too busy with work and the kids dramas and everything else.\" though I suspect that I am putting off dealing with it. The problem is that I do not know how to deal with it. I have never lost someone like this. I just don't know what to do. I found out later that it was breast cancer that spread to my Mum's lungs. I have flash backs of her last days. I have flashbacks of seeing her moments after she passed, I have flashbacks of her despair at being terminally ill, I have flashbacks of her strength prior to diagnosis. I seriously do not know what to do. I just don't. I feel like a time bomb about to go off. I can't let myself go with my sis and my Dad. My other hald and kids are there for me,, but I am also their rock. I have trouble being vulnerable. Sometimes I feel like an emotional block. I feel guilt for not having the big cry. I feel like I am devoid of emotion because i have not had the big cry. Am I alone in not knowing how to deal with this? How to let the emotions out? How to cope???? Sue",
