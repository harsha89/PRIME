      "Content": "You are so VERY young and you should have GREAT breast surgeons in your area! I too have breast cancer and am going through chemo. (to allegedly shrink the tumor) I tell you this because my mother did the same thing 12 years ago. She chose to have chemo for six months and a double masectomy with immediate reconstruction. Alas it didn't work...we are now looking at surgeons that will be able to operate on her so she can just lift her arms. I will not make the same decisions. I hope I am not coming across as angry...but I am. I am VERY angry. Doubt and double check everything you are told. Trust your instincts.

Initially it looked like just the lump being removed and now, with genetic testing and being high risk anyway, I've been asked to consider having both breasts removed. I'm told it reduces my chances of getting breast cancer again by 90% - which is such a high percentage I cannot ignore it. I have reconciled with myself that having both removed is the sensible thing but I am scared about having the strength to go through with it and looking at myself in the mirror between surgery and reconstruction. I also worry how it will affect me as a woman and my future self image with my partner. I know there are plenty of others out there who have done this and could give some advice...I do not mean it to sound more worried for how I look than my life, it's more about me as a woman and feeling confident in myself.",

      "Content": "I am new here but not new to cancer. My grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer in the 80's. Stage 4 affected most of her lymph nodes. Six months of the red death....she lived and did not die of breast cancer. She died at the age of 90 because she lost my grandfather. A note to make is that two of her sisters DID die of breast cancer. My mother was diagnosed with stage 3 cancer 12 years ago. She did chemo for six months and then a radical masectomy. While she is cancer free....her breast reconstruction did not work. She is unable to lift her arms. (subsequently her younger sister was also diagnosed with breast cancer) I now have breast cancer. I also have a daughter and grandaughter. Chemo is kicking my ASS....the oncologist said that they have made so MANY advances. Really???? I am sick daily....my head, bones and memory hurt. Here I get off kilter....I have wondered for years, if there were a penis cancer? Would it take this long to cure????? I think not.",

I don't work for him or anything but he tends to clean up other plastic surgeons mistakes. I hope that you will at least check him out. Everyone needs to look and feel their best after BC. I am so very sorry that you have had the same experience that my mother experienced. When I heard your story...I had to respond. I hope I haven't overstepped my boundaries.
