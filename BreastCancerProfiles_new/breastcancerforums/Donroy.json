My wife was in nursing school going over mammography when she was in her young 30s, and her instructor encouraged them to get a mammogram before 40. Her PCP said OK and the first mammogram she ever had, was positive for cancer, no family history whatsoever. What followed was almost 20 years of living and loving, giving birth and being loved before this nasty disease took her away from us. My recommendation? Do it without reservation or hesitation and don't second guess yourself, especially if something doesn't seem right. My wife had an incredible ability to sense when something wasn't right in her body, and she was very, very accurate with her self assessments. If all is well, awesome, your peace of mind was well worth the trouble. Best to you, Don",

      "Content": "Thanks GBMsibling, yea, I think so now too. Off and on on wide mood swings. She's going to call the doc today about maybe some diuretic. Her feet, and lower legs are really retaining water. The only problem with weaning her off the steroids at all, is that she tanks right away. She sleeps a lot and is nauseated and vomiting and can't eat much at all. She has gained a fair amount off weight since being put back on 4mg. Dex back in March when I posted the original post. She is now quite a bit weaker, more short of breath, has the classic signs and symptoms of chronic steroid use, but is still better than when off of them. It has been 1 year since her bone mets were discovered and 10 months since her liver mets were found. Her bones hurt her a lot, but she seems to be able to get on top of that with her meds, most of the time, when needed. Her bone pain comes and goes in different places for different lengths of time, but her skull and skull base, lower spine and hips are pretty constantly painful. She is trying to participate in a YMCA sponsered physical rehab for cancer patients and survivors twice a week, and it scares me a bit because she is much weaker than the other participants. No one is pushing her but I feel like I need to be right there in case something happens to her. She wants me to go work out while her class is in session. Hoping and praying for the best here for her, not sure what that is but.",

      "Content": "Fast forward a couple of months until now. Once again they tried to reduce her steroids from 4mg Dexamethasone to 2mg. This didn't work well and she called them after 2 days and they placed her back on 4mg. My question now has to do with the side effects of steroids. She has gained weight, her face is more round, she has a hump of sorts between her shoulder blades etc. but I'm curious about how it may be affecting her state of mind. She was very uncharacteristically emotional today, crying, angry, and quite nasty about the simplest of things. I don't know if this is steroids or possibly hepatic encephalopathy. Does anyone know how to tell the difference? She has been on steroids for close to a year now and while she has had a shorter fuse, she hasn't been emotional or as nasty as she has today. Can anybody shed some light on this? I'm trying to be as patient as I can because I know it's either her meds or the disease process but wow. Scared of this whole thing. Thanks everybody.",

      "Content": "cindimorgan, cancer is so incredibly different for every person that trying to predict it's future course is all but impossible. It primarily depends upon how fast it renders major organs inoperable. It sounds like her lungs in this case. Is she on supplemental oxygen, or get winded and short of breath easily? Does she have a lot of secretions in her lungs, and if so can she clear her secretions? If indeed her lungs are the big bully in her case, you may notice difficulty breathing, maybe fluid in her lungs, inability to oxygenate her blood which in turn will not properly oxygenate her organs and thus the cascade begins. This doesn't directly answer your question, but may give you signals to notice that mark major trouble in the near future. If she does have great difficulty breathing, I know that morphine helps the work of breathing a great deal and may provide some relief for her when the going gets rough. Hang in there and cherish your time with her and make a few memories before she leaves. Best of luck to you.",

      "Content": "Hi all, new to the forum with a few questions. My wife had four separate bouts with breast cancer, currently she is battling mets to her bones and liver. My beautiful wife had 10 courses of radiation to her skull base in June of 2014. This was to alleviate double vision caused by cancer on her skull base affecting her optic nerves. Shortly after that she was diagnosed with liver mets and started a 12 week regime of Taxol. Her side effects became to severe (neuropathy in her hands and feet and a peeling burn like skin rash on her arms) and she quit doing chemo and is now just taking Letrozole (Her+), monthly biophosphonate infusions and her palliative care meds. Twice now they have weaned her off of her steroids and she, each time has done terrible. Just 2 weeks ago (off steroids) she was sleeping about 18 hours a day, nauseated, vomiting, losing about a pound a day in weight, etc., etc. Her oncologist put her back on Dexamethasone and it's absolutely amazing the turnaroud she has had. She is sleeping only around 8 hours now, eating well, not nauseated, energetic, etc. I'm curious if others have had this same experience with steroids, and if this is just masking her illness to the point that her signs and symptoms will hit harder than ever when they do come? In the mean time it has brought her life back to some semblance of quality that was lacking just 2 weeks ago. Great stuff.",

      "Content": "Interesting thread. It's my understanding that in breast cancer cases when they do radiation its usually a one course kind of thing. I could easily be wrong, so chime in if I'm off on that but my wife initially had radiation and a lumpectomy to her breast. Five years after this it came back and she had bilateral mastectomies. Five years after that it came back again, but it was just on the margin where they had done her mastectomies. They cut tissue in that area and then decided to do radiation again. The radiation oncologist said they had made some advances in radiation with hyperthermia and would like to try it again. What they did was superheat her breast area under a heat lamp until it was sufficiently hot (don't know temp. they used) and then the do the radiation, explaining that it was more effective that way. Now this may very well be true, however for her, it created a huge blister the first time, and the second time they quit because it actually burned a hole in her chest. Now normally I think it would be different but since she had mastectomies with implants, there was not much more that skin to burn through. I don't know if the beam was misdirected from the margin of her breast or what, but there was such a huge hole there you could see three ribs crossing the open wound. They had to undo her lat reconstruction and did the lower abdominal procedure ( don't know proper name.) This however was six months later. She had to do wet to dry dressings a couple times daily for that entire time. Fortunately she is an RN and very adept at that sort of thing. I think this would not have happened if she still had all her breast tissue. That being said I think it's interesting and perhaps would be very effective. I would love to read some studies on it. Good luck.",
