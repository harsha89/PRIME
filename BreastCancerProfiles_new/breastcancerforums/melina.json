    "Content": "aww.I am sure you will be o.k.Follow your hunch though.I am learning not to disregard symptoms now and questioning doctors I was always scared doctors would think I was paranoid. I had Lyme for 3 years before diagnosis . I now have a funny feeling about one breast but strangely I am being called back for an ultrasound of the other one, My mum has the BRCA 1 mutation and other close relatives have died or survived breast cancer. I am doing the genetic test and had to ask for info on all cancers in the family well on both sides-Leukemia on my dads side and his mum died from stomach cancer and my mum's mum died from stomach cancer. I am not going to worry too much-Lyme makes you have all sorts of horrible symptoms. My mum had regular mammograms and her cancer at 48 was spotted early and she is now 58 and been all clear!!!!! Now I should have the confidence to ask them to re-check both as they called me back for one. So I understand how you are feeling. I have just been nursing and the breast they want to check again is a lot bigger than the other one.More veiny but I feel lumps and bumps on both.I also thought it was normal with nursing to end up with mismatched boobs. The reason I am typing this and talking about my own worries is that i understand that you have cancer in your family but it does not mean it will happen to you.Do not be shy (like I am) and ask for what you want. I am sure that if you ever do develop this disease they will catch it early unlike the people who lived generations before!!! I hope this makes sense as it is early and I am just waking up.Take care-all the best for you!!!!",
