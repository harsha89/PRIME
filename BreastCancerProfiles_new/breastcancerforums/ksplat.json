      "Content": "Dear Christina I am so very sorry to hear your Aunt is suffering with this terrible disease. My prayers & thoughts are with your Aunt & you too. You are obviously suffering along with your Aunt & I hope you have good support from your family & friends? You will need to lean on others whilst you are offering your love & support to your Aunt. It is hard to make suggestions as I'm not familiar with your Aunt's story? I can share with you my experience with the passing of a loved one & although it's a little cliched, spend as much time with her whilst she is enduring this suffering. Speaking with her, story telling & talking about pleasant family memories is a good way to communicate. Music is also another medium, choose music which your Aunt enjoys, can be soothing & relaxing. Is your Aunt still eating/drinking or is she in the end stage of her Breast Cancer? There is a \"nutritional suggestions\" thread here which offers great advice on smoothie type shakes that are useful if your Aunt is unable to eat regular type food. How is your Aunt's pain management? I do hope she is comfortable. I'm sorry I can't be of more help? If you could perhaps post again & share more of your Aunt's story & current condition we could be more specific with our suggestions. Don't be a stranger here if you need to \"offload\" or rant & rave or just talk about your Aunt. Keep us updated if possible? Thinking of you, Angie.",

I'm sorry you are having to endure this discomfort & pain. As I'm not familiar with the side effects of this chemo I cannot suggest anything? Terribly sorry. It's a real bonus to have your bloods so good & an added bonus to have recognition for the \"honey\", from the nurses. I hope someone will come to your aid soon, with some simple, staightforward advice. Thinking of you. Cheers, Angie.",

When my Bro had his tumour biopsied they actually did the pathology whilst he was still on the op table. He had a brain tumour though. I'm sorry to hear about your MIL, am I right in thinking that you live the closest to your MIL? How did the other family members react to this awful news? This is obviously a very challenging time for you. I hope you don't mind but I'm going to move your post to the Breast Cancer thread as this was the initial diagnosis for your MIL all those years ago & as you said she has had a recent recurrence in her other breast. This thread is well supported by forum members & I'm certain they will offer their support & advice which is what you are in need of at the mo. My prayers & thoughts are with your MIL & family. Cheers, Angie.",

Talking to your parents is the first thing you need to do. As Jim mentioned in his reply....tell them of your worries about your Mother's health, explain how this is affecting your life & your school life. Secondly, I would access a counsellor through your school & talk to this person about your worries. You may find advice on how to deal with your family worries & talking about your problems will almost always show you some clarity & it will also be comforting for you to talk about it (even if your parents are reluctant to discuss with you). You & your family are in my thoughts & prayers. Keep writing to this forum as you will also find kindred spirits here, comfort & support also. Cheers, Aussie Angie.",

I was relieved to read your update & that you had finally started your treatments. I hope the frustration & fear you were experiencing have decreased alot since the treatment started. I am not familiar with BC, I have a Bro with a brain tumour, but I have taken chemo before. I know how vain we women can be (especially me LOL) & I was pretty devastated with the hair loss I suffered. I am now happy to tell you my hair is back to it's former glory (3 years later), in fact my hair is longer now than it has been for a good many years! I do know that chemo can take it's toll physically & emotionally. Please take good care of yourself. Please keep us updated through this time, this is a great place to come & \"offload\" your worries, RANT & RAVE, whatever! We offer support & comfort & friendship, & we try & answer any questions you might have? Thinking of you, Cheers, Angie.",
