    "Content": "Hello all, I am new. I have been diagnosed with nothing yet. But they see cysts that are abnormal in appearance. Alot of them. Maybe there are other things, the radiologists say that there is alot of \"junk\" in my right breast. I am worried. My right breast hurts. My radiologist has essentially said that the report he is going to give the dr. will say that I will have to see a breast specialist. So, who is the best in NYC dr. wise? Please let me know if you can. I just want recommendations as I have no idea. Thanks very much for your help Melissa",
