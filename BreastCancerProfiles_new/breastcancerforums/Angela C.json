      "Content": "Hi. I hope people still read this forum. My mom was diagnosed with mucinous carcinoma of the breast, with a very large (10cm) tumor that's invading her chest wall and positive in her axillary nodes. She's still waiting for an appointment with an oncologist since we got the news just yesterday. Has anyone had similar experiences? I just want a glimmer of hope. We're ready for chemo, surgery, radiation, and whatever is needed to get through this.",

She'll be seeing the oncologist for the first time, hopefully, by the end of the week. We'll be bracing ourselves for news on her bones, other nodes, and the rest of her body. And I'll be hoping for the best. I'll be updating this forum with any news, and for subsequent advice. We'll make it through this!",

      "Content": "update my mom got a CT scan which showed no spread to her liver, lungs, abdomen, etc. so we're facing stage III cancer at the moment. we're still waiting for the results of her bone scan, but she starts chemo tomorrow morning. what a long journey. i feel a lot calmer from the first time i posted here. we're going to face this, and i'm just glad we're finally going to fight this tomorrow. one setback is that her insurance (she's a nurse) did not cover appointments at the #1 cancer center in the nation, which happens to be across from her work. she was trying so hard to get a doctor there.. but it just didn't work out. but we're still moving forward, and she has a doctor we trust. any info on chemotherapy experiences? we're going wig shopping this week. hopefully the side-effects won't be so bad for her.",
