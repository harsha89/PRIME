    "Content": "Hello, I am writing on behalf of a friend of mine. Her sister (57) has been recently diagnosed with an agressive form of breast cancer. Unfortunately, the doctors are not prepared to give her chemotherapy or even a mastectomy. The reason is that my friend's sister is severely disabled and has been in an institution for 50 years. She will not be able to tolerate the chemo or surgery. I was present during the visit by the oncologist and the doctor said that if the cancer erupted from the breast, treatment would become very difficult, even thought they aren't doing much. My question is - has anyone ever heard of the cancer erupting and if so, does that mean that my friend's sister won't have long. From my own experiences with my family, I have grave fears that she won't last until Christmas as the only treatment is palliative. I thank anyone who might be able to shed some light on this aweful fate",
