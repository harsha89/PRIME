We are still trying to process and adapt to this situation. I had actually never heard of this type of cancer before, but I've since done quite a bit of online research. Still, no matter how much I research the facts and information, knowing what to do and how to best support my mother during this difficult time isn't really something a normal website can tell me. That's why I came here. If you have ANY advice on how to make this easier for my mother I would be grateful beyond words. I feel like anything I say to her would sound cliche and I don't want my words to be empty. I want to show her that we are here for her no matter what, but I don't want her to know how incredibly scared I am. I try to stay positive as much as possible, but I'm having such a hard time focusing on the present and not worrying about the future. I know that many of you have survived this awful disease or that you are currently battling it, so you would understand more than anyone.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Muttsmom what a great day that will be !!!!! I agree completely! Until Mom was diagnosed, I had no idea how many of my friends have had to go through this same thing in their own families. We will all rejoice someday when this can't hurt us anymore... In other news, Mom had an appointment yesterday and the doctor was very hopeful. He said that she *might* not have to go through chemo treatments, that hormone therapy may be sufficient. Now he is just a general doctor and not a surgeon or oncologist, so he said not to get our hopes up, but that it is a possibility. Her next appointment is on Thursday. She will meet with the surgeon and also get a biopsy. I'll let you know how that goes. Again, thanks for all of your support. This is a wonderful site!",

Until Mom was diagnosed, I had no idea how many of my friends have had to go through this same thing in their own families. We will all rejoice someday when this can't hurt us anymore...
