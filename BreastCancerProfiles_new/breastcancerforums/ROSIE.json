      "Content": "I just received my results too.. first mammo then ultrasound.. then I decided to do Ultrasound guided biopsy.. results came back positive.. 2 sites same breast right.. lumpectomy at this time is not a good option.. I chose the untrasound biopsy because it was the \"least invasive\" procedure to do to get a good result.. Now the surgeon that I was referred to wants to remove t he breast entirely.. but I am now looking into a skin saving mastectomy done by a phisician in San Diego California at scripps institute.. hope this helps.. I too am long winded.. good luck in your choices.. look into a stereotatic biopsy.. a little more painful than untrasound I hear.. but is guided using a mammogram while biopsying the tissue.. in my case they were able to numb me up using lidocane and then I got to watch them take 7 samples from each lump.. unfortunately both sites came back positive.. both sites are on opposite sides of the breast .. that is why lumpectomy is not a good option.. Remember surgeons \"cut\" that is what they do.. I hope your doctor is willing to be open to what different prodecures are there for women.. if not find one that is.. The internet has been a great source of information for me.. my surgeon that I saw first wanted to take the whole breast.. now I am talking to one that is going to try to save as much as possible..",
