    "Content": "I am a 35 yr old woman. Since Dec 2011 my right axillary lymph node under my right arm will have a trobbing pain like there is a golf ball sized something under my arm. Other times it's hardly noticable. I went to the Dr. in Feb. because it wasnt going away. I was give a 10day round of bactrim and that did not seem to help. They sent me for an ultrasound they found a 1.8 x 1.0 cm enlarged lymph node. Ordered another ultrasound and mammogram in 6m I have since found dime size lump in my breast which my obgyn say \"ehh doesnt feel like anything to worry about\" I had an aunt on my father's side die from breast cancer. I am a little paranoid about breast cancer anyway. So should I get a second opinion, goback to my general (who I went to for the lymph node) and tell her about the lumps I found or just suck it up, quit freakin and wait till the test?",
