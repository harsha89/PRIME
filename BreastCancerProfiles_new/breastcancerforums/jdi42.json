    "Content": "Hi, I will share with you what seemed to work for me when I has my lymph nodes removed (as a result of a mastectomy). I found if I used my arm alot, stretching, but also in physical exercise I regularly performed then the pain starts to subside. I also found that if I would get a massage in my back, then that would help the seroma drain. I have a massage device which I can cuse on my own back and this helps greatly. But the main thing is regular extercise, in a variety of different positions. If you can find an activity to do which forces you to move that area of your body, then it seems to be much better than just stretching. (For breast cancer survivors, doctors recommend rowing to ensure a good recovery when lymph nodes are removed). Joyce",
