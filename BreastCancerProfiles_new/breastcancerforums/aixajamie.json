    "Content": "We just found our my mother, 58, has recurring breast cancer for third time. This time it showed up in her pelvis. Her MD started Doxil today with no plans of radiation(She said radiation in the pelvis is harmful to the blood cell count) or hormone theropy. One of her other MDs suggested to \"throw the kitchen sink at it\" because of its size and stage. My question is, does anyone have experience with Doxil? How was your experience? What do you think about the lack of radiation treatment? Should we be doing more? Thank you. Merry Christmas.",
