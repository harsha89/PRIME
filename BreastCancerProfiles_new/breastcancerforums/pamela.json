      "Content": "I don't know what went wrong. I did not feel any lidacaine burn or it beeing addministered into my breast. But I felt an extreamly intense red hot burn when the machine shot the needle into my breast, It took all my strength not to recoil away from the pain. They added more pain relief to the needle and continued. I felt 4 extreamly painful stinging sensations before she paused, I was shaking, she continued with both technicians staring into my face, trying to calm me for 2 more muted less painful stings. The doctor was visiably upset at my pain, and told she had planned to take 12 samples, but she now had 6 really good samples and was going to stop, leave the room and have them check under the microscope. The samples were what she had hoped for, the pain dulled and the rest of the proceedure was as I expected. From the beginning of the biospy they promised no pain, I really wished I could have prepared myself better, I don't think I could do it again. I hope if I ever have to do this again there is something else they could do to manage the pain...maybe I should have been tested to see if Lidacaine would work for me...maybe they didn't wait long enough for it to work, I don't know. I don't know, is what I keep saying to everything since the mammograms indicated microcalcification flecks cluster of 4C. If this is rare, I truely hope the other 83 woman who go through this to save the 17 that actually have cancer can have a conversation, not an I don't know, with their doctors about pain management, to be absolutely sure, what ever they choose actually works for them. My hope now is the vast majority of biopsy samples that are not cancer will include mine.",
