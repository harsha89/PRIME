      "Content": "Hi all, My aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer a few years ago, and decided to forgo \"western medicine\". She was treating herself with holistic and natural remedies, and all seemed well for almost 4 years. Last August, my uncle took her to the ER because she couldn't get out of bed, or move with out pain. It turns out that the cancer had spread to her bones, liver, lungs and brain. She decided to try chemo and radiation, and the dr's didn't think she would make it to x-mas. In February, she had a MRI done to check the tumors on her brain, and found that one of the four had been resistant to the radiation, and had doubled in size. Lately, she has been slurring her speech, falling down, and has trouble with her memory. She will completely forget what she was talking about in the middle of a conversation. Is this a sign of the end? She is such a strong woman, and has been fighting for years, but we all fear that the cancer has almost won. She is only 48 years old.",

Between all the tests and oncology dr's I have been going to with my father in law These past few weeks, I haven't been on here much. Thank you for your prayers. She belongs to a prayer group, and strongly believes in the power of prayer. Jim: Thanks for moving it. I saw the description of the forum after posting. The doctors didn't seem all to concerned about the mets to the liver, as it is relatively minot compaired to the bones and brain. She was taken to Princess Margaret Hospital on Monday afternoon, to try and get a handle on her pain. They said they will keep her for a week or two. We were informed yesterday that she will not be leaving. The cancer has completely taken over her spine and front portion of her brain. She also has a new fracture on her neck, and has become completely immobile. Her birthday is 3 weeks away, and the Dr said he doubts that she will be here for it. All we can do now is hope that they keep her comfortable, and she passes in peace.",

      "Content": "I am sorry to hear about your wife's cancer. I hope this story will be a little helpfull. I fully beleive that staying optimistic and strong in sprit make a huge difference, no matter what doctors may say. My aunt was diagnosed with Breast Cancer in 2003 at 42 yrs old. She had found a lump 14 months prior, but did and said nothing. She opted for holistic and natural remedies, and the doctors all advised against it. She seemed to do very well for quite a few years, until last summer, when she experienced excruciating pain in her neck, and couldn't get out of bed. After a trip to the ER and multiple tests, we found out the the cancer had spread to her liver, lungs, bones (especially the spine) and her brain. She then decided to go ahead with chemo and radiation. The doc's told her that any treatment at that time (July) would just be pallitive, and she wouldn't see Christmas, due to the extent of the mets. Christmas came and went, and her tumors in liver and lungs showed reduction in size. The brain and spine tumors continued to grow, and she was told in February that she wouldn't see Easter. Easter passed and she was still just as vibrant as ever. Still undergoing both chemo and rad. Things seemed to take a turn for the worst in July. She fell and fractured her neck and was taken to Princess Margaret Hospital where they said she would not be leaving. The images of brain and spine x-ray showed completely black. No area left untouched by the cancer. The doctors said they had not seen a case with such extinsive mets that lasted a any more than a few months and yet here she was, a year later. It was a miracle in itself that the neck fracture didn't kill her, weak as she is. 3 weeks is what we were told. She wouldn't see her birthday. Well, we are in the 4th week, and her 49th birthday is tomorrow. She is still in the pallitive ward, and we don't know how much time she has left. She has so far beaten all odds and far surpassed any of the doctors predictions. I don't beleive that anyone can put a definitive date on a person decides who decides thay are not ready to pass.",
