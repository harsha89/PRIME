    "Content": "Hi, I was just wandering if anyone can tell me if it is normal or not to have different breast density in left and right breast? Im concerned about my mammogram maybe i shouldnt have looked at them and now i have to wait til tuesday for my results since my dr is away. FYI Im a 28yo mum of 2 beautiful children 1 boy 1 girl, and have been getting pain radiating from my breast thru to my back. I do have a palpable lump and also had an ultrasound with a not so nice lady who basically made up her mind it was nothing prior to anything, the ultrasound took her 5mins tops then she told me the ultrasound showed normal breast tissue, however I am still awaiting the report on this also. So my question to you all is should both breast have different density and by this I mean the bright white whispy lines everywhere. Im sorry I can not clarify better what i mean. I would post a pic if i was allowed. I understand that none of you are Drs or able to give me medical advise but I would very much appreciate any info you can share on this. TIA",
