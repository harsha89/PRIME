    "Content": "This thread is for men and women who have experienced excruciating, unbelievable pain during needle and wire biopsies. Who were given little or no anesthetic, topical or otherwise. My handle is Volauvent and I am one of you. You can go here to see what others have gone through: http://www.cancerforums.net/threads/...otactic-biopsy We now have a variety of methods to numb the body against pain and to control pain. In reading about the needle and wire biopsy procedures on the Internet, I found no reasonable excuse for avoiding a numbing agent, causing unbearable pain to the patients. I did find one study that was comprised of 40 women, 20 having been given a topical anesthetic cream and 20 having been given a placebo. Ages: 55-56. Yep, 40 women. Wow. It was found that yeah, the women given the topical Lidocaine has somewhat less pain. Excuse me while I faint with relief. <link removed as per FORUM POLICY> To perform your own research, search \"pain during needle and wire biopsies\" If you want to fight for the humane treatment of us, the patients who have the double whammy of angst about the possible biopsy reports and inexcusable, barbaric pain, join me now.
