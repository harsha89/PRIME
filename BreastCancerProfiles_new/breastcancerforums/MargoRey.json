    "Content": "Hello, my name is Margo Rey a breast cancer survivor! First off visiting forums like this is always emotional, yet at the same time inspirational when I read stories of survival. I wanted to let you know that you all are in my thoughts especially during this month. I came here to share with the forum some quick words of encouragement for anyone who may need it. Although life after recovery is difficult you gain a sense of perspective. The emotional and physical pain you experience only makes you stronger in the end, so always keep fighting and remember that you are not alone. It helps to have others pulling for you so just know you have me, pulling for your survival and full recovery everyday. Since it is Breast Cancer Awareness Month I wanted to share with you this video. I hope that you listen to the message, share it with others and get involved in the fight against breast cancer.
