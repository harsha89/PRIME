    "Content": "Hello, I'm 27 (almost 2 and recently found a lump on my left breast by accident. I felt it through my shirt, through a closer observation I felt it and it was hard and unmovable about the size of a pea, maybe a little bigger. I called my ob office and they scheduled me in for the next day. She felt it and scheduled me to go to women's services to get an ultrasound and mammogram of my left breast on Tuesday. She did not say anything, but on my paperwork it says to identify the lesion as cyst vs lump. I'm really nervous and was wondering what other possibilities this could be?",
