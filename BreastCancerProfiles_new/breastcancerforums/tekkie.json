      "Content": "I have been on Tamoxifen for 4+ years now and never had any problems with the drug such as hot flashes, sweats, etc. However, I am currently waiting for a biopsy to see if I have some form of uterine cancer, and I have just found out that I have cataracts, 2 types, in both eyes. Once I have my biopsy results I will see my oncologist to discuss the Tamoxifen. I had hoped to be on it for more that five years as breast cancer mets have been the cause of death of three women in my family, including my mom last October. I am still at the point where I think that the side effects are better than the risks. Hope this helps!",

      "Content": "Hi. I went through breast cancer back in 2009, and started taking Tamoxifen in August of 09. Now, 4+ years later, I am scheduled for a biopsy next month to see if I have uterine cancer, and I have vision problems and cataracts (2 kinds) in both eyes. It would seem logical to discontinue the Tamoxifen, but my Mom passed away in August from BC mets, and two of my aunts died that way earlier. Until now I had been hoping to stay on the Tamoxifen longer because of risk factors. Anyone else have these kind of problems? Thanks!
