I finished treatment last June eager to get on with my life, which I have done, but still with that dread of hearing \"recurrance\" or \"mets\". Over the past year that dread has been pushed further to the back of my mind as life returns nearer to normal, but it's still there and I think always will be to some extent. I started Arimidex right after finishing rads, which was about six weeks after finishing chemo. Good luck to you both!",

      "Content": "Hi Loretta! I understand exactly where you are with the fear, uncertainty! I was there in Dec 03--diagnosed on 12/8 and had surgery 12/18. I had a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy also, and had one positive node. I think that was the scariest news I ever got, even more so than the original diagnosis. Both of my parents died of cancer--Dad from mets from lung cancer, and Mom from brain cancer. Both were diagnosed as untreatable and Dad lived six weeks after diagnosis (that was 25 years ago) and Mom 5 months in 2002. So you can see my experience with cancer was pretty much doom and gloom. It took me several months to really convince myself on an emotional level (I knew it from an intellectual viewpoint from the start) that my case was different and that I really have a very good chance of beating this. A coworker who is a long term bc survivor and the ladies on these boards helped tremendously. 14 months out I'm doing fine and nervous about my upcoming checkups next week! I asked my surgeon before surgery if a mastectomy would provide a better prognosis if nodes proved to be positive, and he said it would not, it would just affect the post surgery treatment (I did chemo and radiation both), and that in fact odds were a little better with lumpectomy, although not statistically significant--as we all know statistics aren't meaningful to us as individuals anyway. I'm praying for you for strength and support to get through the next few difficult months of decisions and treatment, and come out the other side healthier than ever and raring to go! The fear never completely goes away for most of us, but it does get lots better and easier to handle.",

      "Content": "Hi Laurajean! Welcome to the board. I'm sure you'll find all ladies (and a gent or two) here very helpful and supportive as I did! I think you'll find almost as many different experiences with both surgery and radiation as there are patients, but for me the surgery and radiation were no major problem. The hard part was the chemo, which it sounds like you probably won't need, and even that was not as bad as it could have been. After surgery I had some pain for a day or two, but only took one or two doses of the vicodin and after that just tylenlol or ibuprofin. I took two weeks off work mostly because it was over Christmas holidays--could have gone back sooner. Hardest part of surgery was it was out patient and done in the evening so they were anxious to get me out the door and sent me home before I was really out of the anesthesia completely and a little nauseous! If I'd had another hour or two to lie still it would have been much better!! Radiation for me was a breeze--minor sunburn is all. I can't really say much about the fatigue--I only know I felt much better and had much more energy during rads than I had for weeks before, but then mine followed right after chemo, so I think I was still recovering somewhat from that. I went back to work during rads after being off during the last 6 weeks of chemo. My appetite also was much better during rads after being pretty iffy during chemo. I'm sure you'll hear other experiences from other women on the boards. I know it helped me to hear different reactions and to know what side effects others had and what was \"normal\". Just remember you won't necessarily have the side effects you read about as everyone is different. Good luck with your surgery and treatments!",

I was surprised to hear that some people get through dose dense on their own without the boosters. Also don't understand why your dr says it's too late now to start with the boosters. It's clear you need some more definitive answers to your questions, and if your present dr won't give them to your satisfaction, seeing someone else is your right. Good luck!",

      "Content": "When my surgeon said numbers were slightly better for lumpectomy than mastectomy he was refering to long term survival--the big picture, and said the difference was so small as to not be significant--basically it was the same--mastectomy for early stage bc did not give a better prognosis than lumpectomy with radiation. He speculated that maybe avoiding the major surgery may be easier on the body in general giving the immune system/healing mechanism more umph to fight the disease rather than the recovery from surgery--just his opinion. I'm sure there are lots of things to take into account with each individual case, and every woman needs to make her own informed decision with her Dr's guidance.",

      "Content": "Your wife's diagnosis sounds very similar to mine. My onc didn't give me an option--I did the AC + T dose dense, then on to Arimidex. Since I had a lumpectomy rather than mastectomy I also did radiation. The way I understood it, the positive lymph node, even though it's only one, means there are or have been cancer cells floating around outside the breast, and we should hit them hard from the start in hopes of getting rid of all of them! While it wasn't an easy ride, it was doable, especially knowing that there was a very good chance I'd be back to my normal self within the year, which turned out to be the case. So far I'm doing well on the Arimidex, except for some hand pain mostly in the finger joints, but this seems a minor price to pay. Good luck to your wife whatever you decide is right for you.",

      "Content": "Hi Danielle! Sounds like your mom is having pretty much the same chemo as I did, except I had Neulasta instead of the Neupogen. I also found my last AC to be the worst. Everyone said Taxol would be much easier, but the first one didn't seem so. I found, however, that they got easier as I went along, and have decided that with the dose dense and only 2 weeks between treatments what I was feeling with the 1st Taxol was the remains of the fatigue/general malaise left over from the AC along with the Taxol side effects, which for me were mostly fatigue and mild bone pain for a couple of days. I had MUCH less nausea with the Taxol, although they changed my nausea meds between AC and Taxol because of the increased nausea after the 4th AC, so not sure how much to attribute to the change in meds or the change in chemo! Hope your mom has an easy time with the Taxol. Just tell her not to assume each one will get worse as the AC did, as that wasn't the case for me and may not be for her either. Good Luck!!",

      "Content": "Hi Susan! My last chemo was 4/29/04. I'd heard it takes about 6 months to get back to a normal short hairstyle, and that seems about what it was for me. I had a wig that looks much like my normal hair, so continued to wear it longer than I would have had to, but my daughter's wedding was Sept 25, '04, and wanted to look more like my normal self in the pictures than the really short \"athletic-type\" hair that I had at that point. The Monday after the wedding I took off the wig for good! I was just really happy to be feeling like my old self for the wedding--a weekend long event on Mackinac Island, MI--which was planned well before my diagnosis! It was like a fairy tale. Best wishes to you as you return to a more \"normal\" (if there is such a thing!) life style.",

Hot flashes have been about the same as I had from menopause before diagnosis. Too early to tell about bone density issues. My test before starting the meds was excellent so I'm not on anything except calcium supplements at the moment. Will repeat bone density next year to see if there's been any change. I never took Tamoxifen since being post menopausal at diagnosis my doc recommended going straight to Arimidex. Good luck!",

I worked part time, but as soon as rads were finished went immediately back to full time with no problem. I work in retail so am on my feet and running around the store constantly all day! I was more tired at the end of the day than before bc, but even that only lasted a couple of weeks. Also, like Sharon, I had no other chronic health problems to complicate things. I should think Cathy will be just fine to enjoy a relaxing vacation as soon as treatment is over. Just don't plan on any marathons!! Hope you have a wonderful time. Good luck with radiation!",

Also a slight risk of hormone negative bc for women who took daily aspirin for 5 years. They said general use did not cause a problem, whatever that means, but that NSAIDS would probably not be used to prevent bc as was suggested might be possible by previous studies! I would like to see the actual article, and hear from some of the Drs what their take is on it--what dosages were involved, etc. Anyone have any further info?",

Hardest part of surgery was it was out patient and done in the evening so they were anxious to get me out the door and sent me home before I was really out of the anesthesia completely and a little nauseous!...He speculated that maybe avoiding the major surgery may be easier on the body in general giving the immune system/healing mechanism more umph to fight the disease rather than the recovery from surgery--just his opinion. I'm sure there are lots of things to take into account with each individual case, and every woman needs to make her own informed decision with her Dr's guidance....After surgery I had some pain for a day or two, but only took one or two doses of the vicodin and after that just tylenlol or ibuprofin. I took two weeks off work mostly because it was over Christmas holidays--could have gone back sooner....",
