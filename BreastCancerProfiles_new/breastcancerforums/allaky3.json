      "Content": "I got my biopsy results back and it's a fibroadenoma. I'm so relieved but also very glad that I pursued the biopsy! After seeing some friends and family members battle breast cancer, it seemed like a must. I will be diligent now about my annual mammo. Though mine was benign, I hope anyone in this situation would get the biopsy. I am terrified of needles, not to mention the possibility of cancer. The biopsy wasn't nearly as difficult as I'd expected...just the waiting was hard. Thank you for your information and support!",

      "Content": "I'm 38 and found a lump in my breast. I went to my gyn and she could also feel it and also said there were smaller places surrounding it, but not attached to the chest wall. I had a diagnostic mamogram and ultrasound and both were negative. A needle biopsy is scheduled for next week. Does this sound fibrocystic? Has anyone else had negative results and still have a lump? I guess I'm just confused by the negative results and still have a lump the size of my thumb nail. Obviously I'm worried about cancer. I'm otherwise healthy and have had no problems like this before. I have no risk factors for breast cancer.",
