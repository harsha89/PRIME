I think I am at the limit between stages IIB and IIIA, but it is IIB that my surgeon wrote in the diagnosis. Thanks a lot for the encouragement - the important think is not so much how bad the chemo is, but what will happen later - one year from now, for example. I wish you to have all things clear of further complications, too. The therapy - as I was informed - comes from USA and the laboratory where the vaccine is done is there. So I hope that there will be somebody acquainted to give some more information about it.",
