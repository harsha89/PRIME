    "Content": "To all of you who feel that you are just not given enough info or advise about diagnosis, treatments, meds, pain and any number of other issues I have learned this. Having been to Oncology centers in several different places and states including Dana Farber in Boston and Providence Hospital Cancer Center as well as others. It amazes me at the differences in the quality of care and the amount of information from one place to another. I will not use this sight to degrade any particular place but I will give the highest of praise to the Providence Hospital Cancer Center in R.I. and the Doctors and especially the Oncology Nurses there. When I read some of the testimonies on this forum I am amazed at the lack of info some patients receive. That being said I have to suggest that if you are asking questions and feel that you are not getting answers, it is not because there are no answers. You must be proactive when it comes to cancer. Call other centers. Call the Cancer foundations. Call more doctors. Get edjucated. Be a warrior. The truth will free you so find the truth., it is out there. The treatments do cause more pain than the cancer at times. So many people here don't seem to get this info and wonder if it's the cancer or the meds. You can get these answers. Be a warrior, you and your families. Fight-fight-fight! This is the spirit that your own biology will respond to. Fight on! Blessed be. Johnnyg",
