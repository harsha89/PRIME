    "Content": "I am a 47 year old female, grandmother had breast cancer in her 70's, no other family history. I go regularly for mammograms. This past mammogram revealed a 4.6mm nodule with not entirely smooth borders containing 4-6 microcalcifications. The report indicated it might be suggestive of an intramammary lymph node with calcifications. However, since the finding is new, biopsy is recommended. Since the nodule is at the tail of the breast, a surgical biopsy is indicated. BIRADS 4B. I have had microcalcifications removed from the same breast 13 years ago with benign results. This time I do not feel I will have the same outcome. I am absolutely terrified I have breast cancer that has metastisized and spread all over my body. I have an anxiety disorder (all my life) and I am absolutely convinced I don't have long to live. I met with the surgeon and basically she said she did not know what it was and it was wise to have it biopsied. She indicated there was about a 65% chance of it being benign. I also see a psychiatrist who tries to put things into perspective for me. Can you please shed some light on this for me? I am going out of my mind. I will be setting up an appointment for the surgical biopsy. From reading this, what do you feel the likelyhood is that it is cancer or not. Also, if it is cancer, does it sound likely to be early stage? Thank you.",
