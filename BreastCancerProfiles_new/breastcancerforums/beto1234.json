    "Content": "I truly hope I am not offending anyone by posting on here. I am just going insane, and I need some advice and have nowhere else to turn. I am probably in the gym 5 days a week, and do a lot of weight lifting. About 3 weeks ago, I noticed I was getting a pain in one breast that felt like shooting/ stabbing pain. I brushed it off for a few days, until I started googling it.... and what I found really freaked me out. The pain seems to be provoked by certain movements of my arm... and has improved a bit... but it is still there. I exam my breasts 10 times a day since this started, and haven't felt anything unusual. ALSO, about a month ago... I had a respiratory infection or something and developed underarm pain around that time. It seemed to subside until I started prodding at my breasts and underarms and it came back. I also found on google, axillary node pain that comes and goes is a red flag. Needless to say I am freaking out and thinking the worst. I have an appointment tomorrow, and I am terrified.... to the point to where I don't even want to go in fear that I will find out something terrible. I really need help, I can't think straight!",
