    "Content": "In response to the query re breast cancer that has spread to sternum,,I have plenty of experience with that. Originally diagnosed in 2002, I had 6 years on Tamophen that kept the little stinker at bay. But it returned in 2008. I have had metastic cancer for 6 years and it was first spotted in the lymph node behind the sternum. First approach was hormonal therapy (which didn't work for me), at which time it spread to lung. I was put on Xeloda (which did work for me for almost 3 years). Unfortunately it showed up again in sternum area. Then I had it surgicaly removed ( because it was the only site evidenced in the pet scans). That worked for about 1 year then it came back again. This time it was resting on the sternum and causing some bone damage. I was then placed on Xeloda again, this time it did not work. I had an \"ablation\" which is a radiation procedure. That seemed to do it ---but it returned again in the same spot---the lymph node behind the sternum. It was no where else at that time. I was placed on another oral chemo, which did not work and again it spread to the lung. I am now on Navelbine, which is a intravenous chemo. I hope it works.....I'll know the next Pet scan. My understanding is that the cancer has changed its histology - like a bacteria- so it is very hard to decide what will work over time. My oncologist is great but no one knows how or who will respond to treatment-----just keep trying----there are new drugs all the time. It is hard but I try to \"keep the faith\". I feel good most of the time so I am optimistic. It is not anywhere else. good luck to you .",
