Since the original tumor took so long, why do some suffer recurrences so quickly, despite stage, grade, ER/PR status or whatever? Thanks for any help you can give us, Cassie",

      "Content": "Linda, You mention pain and swelling in your breast after a fairly long time, and I wondered if you've had it evaluated by a lymphedema therapist? It sounds so much like what I dealt with, and no doctors could identify it as lymphedema (they are not trained in this, unfortunately). Having finished a course of therapy with a very well qualified therapist, the pain and swelling are gone (oh, relief!). Breast lymphedema is not very well known, since it's fortunately rarer than arm lymphedema, so you do have to find an experienced therapist with great training. Here's a site that might help you find one: www.mylymphedema.com It can be a battle to get a referral--try your PCP, surgeon, medical onc--whatever it takes. Insurance has to cover at least part of it according to the 1998 act that covers breast cancer treatment. I hope you'll look into it, because if it's lymphedema the relief of therapy is wonderful. Let me know if I can help. Cassie",

      "Content": "Hello, Juliana, I hope by now you've found the help you need, but in case you're still searching, there's a new site that has links to the National Lymphedema Network's referral list, plus the referral list of qualified graduates from four of the lymphedema training programs approved by the NLN (they meet the training standards of the Lymphology Association of North American--LANA). www.mylymphedema.com My own experience with arm, hand and chest LE is that not all therapists are skilled in chest LE, as it is rarer than other forms. Be sure to ask what your therapist's experience and training have been for dealing with this. Hope this goes well for you--LE is discouraging, but it does get easier to deal with as the care becomes part of your routine. Hang in there and you'll soon be back to all your favorite activities. (If you have trouble finding compression garments for the chest LE, let me know, as I've been through a real hunt for help with this and have uncovered a few resources). Wishing you a quick adjustment, Cassie",

      "Content": "Good morning, Ischia, YES! There's treatment for lymphedema, all thankfully non-invasive (but not easy, either--steep learning curve for on-going self-care). It involves a referral to a well-qualified and (especially in the breast or chest) EXPERIENCED lymphedema therapist. She takes measurements (in my case she discovered swelling I wasn't yet aware of myself) and does a soft, gentle massage that opens new pathways for lymph drainage and stimulates the flow so the fluid moves on out. Compression garments keep the fluid from re-accumulating. You learn the massage yourself, and then if you have trouble later (from heat, over-exertion or any physical stress) you can reduce the problem yourself. I had very minimal swelling in my chest and upper arm--wasn't sure myself that it was even swollen. But my arm was heavy, tingly, achy, and my chest was downright painful--couldn't wear a bra. After five weeks of therapy and being fitted for the right compression garments I'm up and running again. Here's the web address for the National Lymphedema Network, which has lots of information, lymphedema alert bracelets, and (with a year's membership) a newsletter: www.lymphnet.org Lymphedema is unfortunately for life, and as I say it's a bit of a to-do (at least until you get things under control), so I do hope your trouble is something that's a quicker fix--but just wanted you to know that if it's lymphedema it's definitely controlable, and well worth the effort to learn how. Doctors don't know much about it, so self-education's key, but you sound like you're up for that! Keep us posted on what you discover. Prayers, Cassie",

      "Content": "Whoa, Linda! Two years is a long time to wait for help with this. Many of us have run into the problem of medical providers not knowing what's available. I assume from the TN on your name you're from TN. Do check the website I mentioned above (try all the links) for therapists near you. Here's what you need: a referral for therapy from your doctor. If the oncs aren't up on this, ask your surgeon or your PCP. For many years the only thing a woman could do was \"live with it,\" and many doctors are still in that mode. But there is help. Lymphedema masssage can reduce the swelling and open new routes for the lymph fluid to take to continue to drain the area. Compression does help, but it's best to be fitted by your therapist or a fitter she recommends AFTER the swelling is reduced. Bellisse makes a bra for lymphedema, and Juzo does also, though theirs is not in their U.S. catalogs and has to be requested specifically through a distributor. Both should be covered as mastectomy bras under your insurance. There is a 1998 Federal Act that mandates insurance companies to provide post-cancer lymphedema treatment if they provide cancer treatment (you may, of course, still have to pay the co-pay). In the meantime, here are some things you can try for relief. Don't wear an underwire bra or a bra with tight, narrow straps that cut into your shoulders, as both of these will block lymph vessels and make the condition worse. Avoid heat--hot baths or showers (warm is okay), saunas, exercise in the heat, anything that raises your body's core temperature. A camisole or sports bra may give better gentle compression than a regular bra, but again be careful of any tight binding. Also, those sport shirts that bikers wear (CoolMax-type fabric) or a tight leotard can give relief and prevent further swelling until you can get help. Getting help with this is essential because areas swollen by lymphedema are breeding grounds for bacteria, and once an infection is started (from something as simple as an insect bite!) it can quickly become systemic and often requires hospitalization for IV antibiotics. In my opinion, it's also essential because it's either uncomfortable or (in my case) downright painful, so it's disabling because it immobilizes us. The point is, there's no reason to \"live with it,\" because there's help. Better end before your eyes wear out! Please do check out the therapist lists and insist on getting qualified help, Cassie",
