      "Content": "I am 38 year old female with history of BC in family.. mom deceased from it, maternal aunt and 42 year old sister. I just had an mri and a mri guided biopsy was recommended due to\"a clumped focus within a segmental area which shows persistent enhanced curves\".. My surgeon said that that description described in my mri report is usually indicitive of dcis and said I should go and check on line about breast mri's.. . Does anyone know a web site where I can find a description of dcis picked up by an mri. Mentally I am setting myself up for a double mastectomy as the risk in my family is too great.. I am high risk and I have 3 young children.. 8 months and 20 months and 8 years.. and I cant bear to be in fear every 6 months.. Thanks and good luck to all",
