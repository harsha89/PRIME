She's has malignant pleural effusion and has decided to stop all medical treatment. She has been more like a sister to me although it's always been long distance. I do not know if I can even make it to her funeral so I was thinking it could be something that could be read at her funeral. And sending a copy to her sister and give one to my husband. t.jackson",

So now I'm hoping she's up to having that peurodysis you mention. She's down to a size 2 right now so I hope she can handle it. Thank you for your reply. \"One Day at a Time\"",

      "Content": "My SisInLaw has breast cancer that's spread to her breastbone. Last week she was hospitalized for pleural effusion; they drained it; gave her a tube to take home; a day or so later she was feeling the pressure again. From what I read, if it's caused by her cancer then it will just continue and continue to fill up with fluid and they can only drain her so many times and then no more due to infection. Anyone know anything about this. Is this the end of the road for her?",
