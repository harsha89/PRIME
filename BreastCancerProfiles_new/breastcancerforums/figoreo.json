    "Content": "Had a routine mammo this past Sat. Call from Dr. last evening that further testing is needed. Picked up script & radiology report from office today and this is what it says \"there is subtle increased density which appears somewhat spiculated.\" Impression reads \"Suggestion of spiculated density approx 11:00 location left breast 8 cm deep to the nipple.\" Monday I am scheduled for \"direct compression spot imaging and a true lateral view of the breast\" followed by Ultrasound if needed. Googled the word \"spiculated\" and now I am scared/nervous. My husband was just diagnosed with DLBCL so I am freaking out a bit right now because I am worried about him and don't want to be worry about myself. Hoping someone can allay my fears so I can make it until Monday without worrying. Thanks for any info.",
