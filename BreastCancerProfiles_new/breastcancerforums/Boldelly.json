      "Content": "Hi I am new to this side of the forum as my daughter had Hogkin's lymphoma about a year and a half ago. I found a lump in my left breast just last week and I am scheduled for a Mam on the 27th of this month. My breast is not sore at all. I guess what I would like to hear from you who have gone through it is what are the tale tale signs of breast cancer? Are their any symptoms? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks and have a great day. Laurie",

      "Content": "I know what you mean about not reading too much on the internet and freaking myself out. I had a benign lump after my daughter was born in 1990 in the same breast but on the under side and this time it is on the upper part. We had no history of breast cancer in our family until my Aunt just found out she has breast cancer and that is all of that type of cancer on my side of the family. I worry a lot about my daughter, as a matter of fact we are at MD Anderson right now doing her 3 month scans. I have a mammogram appointment on Monday and I assume we will go from there. This just really sucks because all it is doing is adding more to my plate which is overflowing as it is. I really appreciate you replying to my message. Laurie [emailÂ protected]",
