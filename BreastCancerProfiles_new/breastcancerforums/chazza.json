    "Content": "hi Emma, have just found your post, so sorry to hear your news. I am 37 & have been given a shady diagnosis which hasn't stopped my oncologist pushing for a mastectomy, which I am refusing. I have found a web site which I have found to be really helpful. It is beatingcancergently.com I am now on the recommended protocol & my last MRI showed things to be stable. I am a big believer in supporting your body, even if you go down the conventional treatment route, this protocol will help strengthen your body & immune system & help you to recover quicker. I wish you all the very best in your recovery, please don't be scared. You are a strong & beautiful person no matter what & you can get through anything life can throw at you. Love, light & a thousand blessings xx :P[/list]",
