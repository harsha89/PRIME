    "Content": "Hi, I am a 20yr old male who is supposedly healthy, however in the last 2 years I have had many health problems and tests but the doctors can't seem to find anything wrong with me. 2 weeks ago I felt a small hard lump underneath my left nipple, my nipple has also inverted itself, it was also extremely sensitive and saw to touch, the lump has got bigger in the last 2 weeks and it's still very saw when toched. My left breast is visibly larger than my right one now. Other things that I have noticed in the previous 2 weeks are: (not sure if any of them are relevant) but I have lost half a stone in weight without trying, I have noticed small amounts of blood in my feces, when I urinate the colour seems darker, I urinate for longer and it has a stronger smell, and the final thing I have noticed is that I have had trouble keeping my erection and not being able to climax when I've been having sex with my girlfriend. I know I should go to the doctors but I thought I'd get a bit of advice on here first.",
