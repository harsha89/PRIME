      "Content": "Hi, I'm a breast cancer \"pre-vivor\" but I'm also a journalist and am writing an article on my choice to do IVF and PGD (pre-implantation genetic diagnosis) to weed the mutation from my family line. I will be telling my own story, but I am looking for others to share their stories too. If you: 1) Have one of the BRCA mutations 2) Will be starting IVF for PGD soon or have recently done it 3) Live anywhere near New York City (NY, NJ, CT, PA, DC, etc.) Please e-mail me ASAP. I can be reached at [emailÂ protected] -Debbie -If you're in the same boat and just want to talk (off the record) to someone going through it, e-mail me too - there are so few of us...",

      "Content": "Sorry about soliciting. I'm pretty new to the whole boards thing and I had no idea how else to connect with others for this. Heffalump: it was a really hard decision to make, but I'm glad I did it. Because of a ridiculously strong family history, I've been part of a surveillance program since I was 20, and went to Sloan Kettering twice a year for check ups, mammography, etc. After nearly a decade of this, I started wondering if it was worth running scared if I didn't need to be. So I got tested. Somehow, I'd convinced myself I didn't have the mutation. 'Course, I was wrong. I wasn't happy with the results, but after the initial horrible shock, I started to feel less out of control of my situation. I know for sure what my risk is now. I know what my options are. I also know that with PGD, I won't have to put my children through this. That, of course, is my take on it. It's an incredibly scary thing and it's not for everyone. I've never regretted it, though. Forewarned is forearmed and all that. e-mail me offline if you'd like to get some coffee. Seems we're on the same campus...",
