    "Content": "I've never posted on a forum before and have always been the sort of person who thinks I can get through things by myself, but for the first time I really don't know how to get through this and was wondering if anyone out there can help. My mum has had 8 different tumours over the past 20 years, since I was 11 years old. She has beaten them all, including one \"terminal\" diagnosis in 2007. Her doctors say she's truly special. Most were breast tumours but the last two have been in her brain. One at Christmas 2008 and one now, the one that is finally going to beat her in the next few months after so many brave, brave years of her fight. How do you cope? How do you say goodbye to your best friend, the one person who has always fought your corner, held you when you needed her and given you a kick up the backside when that was the best medicine? How do you support your dad when he is about to lose his life partner? I know is sounds desperate, but I am... somebody tell me how to get through this because I can't imagine how I'm going to do it!",
