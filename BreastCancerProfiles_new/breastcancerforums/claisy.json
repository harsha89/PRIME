My heart goes out to you. I have often thought what would I do if I got cancer in my right breast and nodes were removed. This is a terrible position to be put in. So far, I have not had any swelling. I don't have many comforting words for you. I think I would ask every question I could think of to the surgeon about where to put that IV. Seems like I have read somewhere that they can put it in other places, especially since you have had nodes removed from both sides. I also had a port...and I am so glad I did. I would recommend it to anyone having chemo. But your case is special. I can't comment on what the nurses told you. I know they know more than I do. Having said that, I also know the medical establishment does not take lymphedema questions as seriously as I think it should. Maybe Leo can help more if he reads your post in time.

      "Content": "Thank you so much for responding to my question about my daughter. I was DX at 52, I am now 56. She is 33. So I guess waiting until she is 35 seems reasonable before she has a screening, that's what her ob/gyn has told her. SEEMS REASONABLE TO EVERYONE BUT ME!!!!!!! I have heard and talked to so many young women that have this horrible disease, and I guess I just want my daughter to do everything she can to catch it early. It seems to me she would be in a much higher risk...mother with breast cancer, having her first baby at age 33...I don't know...I am rambling on and on here...she is not nearly as concerned about it as I am.

My onc. sent me to a PT about a year after my surgery, thinking I had some swelling...I didn't have any. The PT I saw told me she sees lymphedema more in women who are overweight and had radiation. I am not overweight and did not have radiation. Has anyone else been told this? My husband measured my arms Saturday, and there was no swelling. I guess this heavy feeling is a normal thing? I was just wondering if anyone else here has the same feeling I do in their arm..but no swelling. Thanks",

I would feel better having one every 6 months...but does that mean I would be getting too much radiation? I was DX 4 years ago on Oct 30. I could not feel my lump..1.6 cm. I had lump., 4x A/C, mast. and immediate tram flap reconstruction. I want to stay ahead of this game if possible. I can't take meds. because of side effects. I have tried tamoxifen, arimidex, and femara.....NO MORE. She has told me I do not need mammogram on the reconstructed breast. But I have heard from other women who do have it. I am so confused.
