      "Content": "Hello, I wanted to ask for your kind help. My mother has cancer and she has lost almost 20 pounds. Does anyone know of anything she can take that may help stimulate her appetite? I\u0092ve heard marijuana may be helpful but my mother has some heart problems, and I\u0092m afraid that could adversely affect her heart rate. Any suggestions and ideas would be deeply appreciated. Thank you very much for your kind help. Tom",

      "Content": "Thank you so much, Serous2c. What you mentioned about liquids working better than solid foods makes sense. I will ask my mother to try some of the ideas you mentioned. Thank you for your thoughtful advice. TuesdayCross, my mother tried marijuana but I think that due to her advanced age and heart problems, it gave her palpitations. I guess everyone is different. However, I do appreciate your kind advice. Thank you! Tom",
