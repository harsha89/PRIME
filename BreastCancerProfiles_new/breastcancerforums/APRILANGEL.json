      "Content": "Hi there. I come and read all the updates here from people but have not posted lately. I prefer to try and think positive and trust in my Doctors. I have read many negative thoughts here and it kinda gets you down to read them. I hope all that are going through the breast cancer treatment will try to think positive and trust in God and you will all get through your treatments and will go on to reach the millstones of 5, 10 and so on remission. Chemo is very hard on you, I am coming up now on my 3rd Chemo treatment on New years eve out of 6. Not looking forward to it. I have had a time with the Chemo. It is really really bad. The first Chemo put me in the hospital for 4 days and nights and I had to take 2 pints of red blood plasma. I had to have so many bags of antibiotics I lost count and many bags fo fluids. I has thrush and a fever of 103.4. I got through it. I t was not much fun. I was miserable. Round two was some better for me. The first day I felt okay and I went back the next day to have a shot. I felt okay that day. AFTER THAT I layed in the bed for 5 days. For the last 3 days now I have felt some better as when I went back the first part of this week I was sent to the Chemo room and had two bags of fluids. So, I hope I will be okay for Christmas day so I can enjoy eating a little Christmas dinner. In my case everything tast like salt. I have a constant salt tast in my mouth. Yuk. The good news is that the Chemo is doing what my Dr.s wanted it to do. The enlarged lympe gland under my right arm is not enlarged anymore and my tumor is shrinking. With 4 more treatments to go before surgery I hope it will all be gone and that the surgery in the spring will get it all and I can get through radiation and be on my way to recovery. I am totally bald. HA HA. It came the 3rd week by the handfulls. Maybe when my pretty hair comes back I will have natural curl. Ha ha. Love to all of you and I HOPE YOUR CHRISTMAS IS WONDERFUL WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND LOTS OF LOVE. HUGS TO ALL. MARY ANNE (MABLETON, GA) ATLANTA, GEORGIA AREA",

      "Content": "Hi there SHAG. I have just finished my 33 radiation treatments for stage 2 b breast cancer. My journey started in Oct. 2007. I have a journal on carepages.com It cost nothing to sign up and start your own page and there are many may people there that will support you. If you want to stop by there and check it out my care page name is maryannespage I read here all the time but I was best suited to share my story on care pages. I turned out well for me as I got a lot of support there and have met a lot of nice folks. I am not taking anything away from this site at all. Don't get me wrong. I think people here will understand where I am coming from. God bless you SHAG as you start all this treatment. I hope you will come and read my care page. It has been a long journey for me. It has not ended I just got more bad news today. Now I have to have another biopsy on my left breast for calcifications noted on my mammogram I just had last week. They have been there for at least 3 years with no change. Maybe my Dr. just wants to be safe than sorry. I pray that is all it is. I am scared as hell again. I would hate the think I would have to start al over again for the other breast now. DAMN ! Talk to you soon. Hugs, MARY ANNE Originally Posted by shag Hi all, I am new here and was just looking for people that know what I am going through. I was diagnosed with originally with stage 2 breast cancer (triple negative) After more extensive testing they have bumped me to a stage 3. To think that 6 months ago I thought that the worst news would be them telling me I was diabetic or something. Anyway, I have a great team of doctors at Johns Hopkins and at Yale who are working together to get me through this. I have agreed to do a clinical trial so that maybe someone far down this rocky road will be helped. The chemo is 14 weekly treatments, surgery, chemo for 21 biweekly treatments then 6 weeks of daily radiation. If there are no delays I should be done with all of it by 12/09. It seems like forever but it should boost my chances so I won't complain (I don't think I will anyway) I start treatments either this friday or next and I am eager to get it started so it can end. I have been to several appts every week getting to know my team and them to know me and of course more tests but I feel like nothing is happening. I know that this is all important for my overall wellbeing...the tests, the meetings and all of it, I just feel like it has been 8 months and it has only been one. Did anyone else feel like that? I am very hopeful as I know that my team specializes in this and my friends and family have been very good but I am scared as hell too! I just don't know exactly what to expect...side effects, reactions, costs, ongoing support, all of it. Any replies would be great! My heart goes out to all of you who are on this board because you wouldn't be here if this wasn't something that has had an impact on your life personally. Thanks for letting me vent Shag",

      "Content": "Hi Shag..I hope your treatments go well. Everyone is different. I do not know what regiment they are giving you but some are worse on your body than others. Do you know what your staging criteria are ? ..OTHER THAN 3C. If you stop by carepages.com you can read more about what all I went through during my treatments. I hope you will. I hope you will start your own page there. I would love to read your progress. I wish you the best as your journey begins. I went to my Oncologist today. He told me I should try not worry so much as he looked at my mamo and it was not at all like the one for my right breast last year before they started my treatments. So, I am just waiting to have ti biopsied at the Breast surgeons next week or as soon as they get me in. GOD BLESS YOU. Sincerely, Mary Anne HUGS Originally Posted by shag Hi, I finally started treatments today and it will just be the standard 8 rounds of chemo, surgery then radiation. I won't qualify for the clinical trial because it is a lilttle more advanced than they want for it. Oh well! At least now I feel like I am doing something about this. I'm not feeling any side effects like nausea yet and I don't know when that is going to happen so I am just going to hope that it doesn't especially since they gave me a full arsenal of stuff to ward it off. I have become one of those people that picks up batches of perscriptions at a time...I hate taking pills too so this will be new to me also. It was just over one month since I found out but it felt like it had been forever. Stage IIIC Breast Cancer - Diagnosed 5-16-08 Treatment date started TODAY 6-20-08!!!",
