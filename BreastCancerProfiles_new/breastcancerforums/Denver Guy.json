      "Content": "Sorry about repeating some information posted earlier, but there have been some new developments. My girlfriend (50, never smoked), had breast cancer 2 years ago. She takes an anti-cancer medication every week. Last fall her oncologist said she was fine. We went to Peru (where she is from) last month. In photos of her, we didn't notice anything. But last Sunday we noticed a large, hard, non-moveable lump on he lower left side of her neck. She had back pain, headaches, was tired, and had soreness in swallowing. It also hurt to touch the lump. We went to a walk-in clinic the next day (6/24), and the doctor immediately said that it looks like cancer - without running any tests. A few days later, the pain went away, she could swallow without pain, etc. A CAT scan and ultrasound saw the mass, but they couldn't identify it. A day later, a PET scan found a mass between her lungs. That's really scary. The oncologist was out of the office on Friday, so we had to deal with the anxiety all weekend. She did talk briefly with another oncologist, and when my girlfriend asked if it had metastasized, and the doctor said \"that is what we are afraid of.\" She then asked how long she had, and the doctor said that depends on the treatment plan with her doctor, and what the neck lump biopsy shows (Wednesday). We don't know if the doctor knew more than she let on, and if we should be really worried, or if she really didn't know much. I'm terrified. I don't think a neck cancer can grow that much in 3 weeks. I think it's also a good sign that the swallowing pain and other pain went away. We're trying to reach her original oncologist this morning. The waiting isn't fun.",

Hopefully you'll hear something soon and, if it does turn out to be a metastis, get a plan of action in place soon. By the way, since your girlfriend was actually diagnosed with breast cancer, feel free to post in that forum. Would you like me to move your post there? Thanks! If you don't mind, please do.",

      "Content": "Well, here's the latest. We met with the head and neck surgeon last Tuesday, and she said that she had never seen a neck lesion like my girlfriend's NOT be cancer. She also said that the small mass in her check is very hard to get to. They did a needle biopsy, and we will get the results today or tomorrow. We are anxious to get them, but at the same time are nervous about what they will say. If the sample wasn't good, she will do a regular biopsy on Thursday. She (surgeon) thinks it's either recurrent breast cancer or lymphoma. We've been on pins and needles for two weeks now. If it's beast cancer, I won't how they can target the lesion in her chest. They won't cut out the neck lesion. I guess that would mean chemo and/or radiation. We still don't know for sure, though, but I don't know what else it could be. I am already reading up on Sun's Soup and other natural remedies.",

      "Content": "My girlfriend is dealing with stage 4 HER- breast cancer (neck tumor) and kidney disease. She had been taking Afinator, but then she was changed to some other oral chemo which I can't remember the name of. Her kidneys shut down and they don't know why. Long story, but they are working again, although she has two tubes in her back. The oncologist now has her on gemcitabine. It's chemo once a week for three weeks, and then off for a week, indefinitely. She is basically on the couch all day. She gets feverish a lot, and has to knock it down with Tylenol. What worries her (and everyone) is the quality of life. It sucks. And I guess I am in denial, but I was hoping that the gemcitabine would get rid of her tumor or at least shrink it down so that they could use something else instead of constant chemo. Does anyone have any experience or thoughts on this? Thanks.",
