    "Content": "Hi Lisa I have just read your email and just want to say that my mum had her first chemo last Tuesday and I have been scanning this forum quite often as I have found it really helpful. Mum is on the AC/T combination chemo that the lovely lady emailed you about. She did go and buy a wig as everyone advised her too before hand just so you've got it if you want it! She also decided that the cold cap was too uncomfortable to do particularly as it may not do anything. After her first session she was a bit exhausted but that is because it is a very long day. She lives nr St Albans and is travelling to the Marsden. As yet she still has all her hair and looks unbelieveably good. She is tired and a bit frustrated that she can't do as much as she wants to! I do hope that the oncologist was very helpful to you and that everything was explained to you. I always go with mum with a host of questions (I think he positively sighs when he sees me with his note pad!!) I do hope your first course goes ok and good luck. I can keep you informed what happens to mum as she will prob be one ahead of you. But everyone reacts differently as no doubt a billion people have told you. Debsx",
