    "Content": "My mom has breast cancer. I am wondering how you know or when they tell you what stage it is? She also has COPD and I don't know if that would change her treatment options. She has a mental illness and is doing very well on meds but doesn't think she can make any decisions on her own . The choice is whether to get a lumpectomy or mastectomy. She does have one mass on her right breast that is invasive . They are going to perform another core biopsy for 2 other supicious lesions on the same breast. Now they want to do an MRI on her left left as well. We originally found the right breast mass through a PET Scan. How can we possibly make a decison for her when it comes to such an intimate choice. Could the Doctor just make it for us, based on her expertise.",
