    "Content": "I am only 17 and i know breast cancer is rare in people my age but I'm still concerned. I've had this lump under my armpit for 2 years and I've been to two different doctors in that time who've felt it. I just get the impression because of my age they didn't take it seriously but maybe I'm just be paranoid and they felt the 'wrong type of lump'. When i got a second diagnosis that it was just a fatty lump I was happy again. However in the last 3 days my breasts have started to REALLY hurt and are so painful. Plus my last period was about 6 weeks ago, and the space between that one and the one before was about 6 weeks. So I'm not on my period now and I dont know why theyre hurting so much. I'm really worried as I read up that the later stages of cancer would involve breast pains and I'm just so scared that it's all too late now. Advice?",
