      "Content": "Hi Kristina, I know exactly what you are going through. I had a mammogram & ultrasound three days ago. The radiologist suggested there was an area of interest. I went home worried, and said to my husband \"well lets see what happens, if I get a call from the doctor tomorrow we'll know it is serious\". Well the next day the doctors surgery rang, and I had an appointment straight away. This is what my ultrasound found: \"a irregularly marginated heterogeneously hypoechoic lesion, measuring at least 12 x 11 x 7mm. It is taller than wide and shows angular borders with variable acoustic shadowing\" and also that \"one of the node in the right axilla shows slight asymmetric thickening of its cortex\". The doctor booked me in for a core biopsy of the mass, and a fine needle aspiration biopsy of the lymph node. I had that appointment today and they did the core biopsy, but not the lymph node one (I've actually just posted a thread trying to find out why). I have an appointment with an specialist surgeon in three days (it's going to be the longest three days of my life). But these forums seem like a good way to find out more info, and talk to people with similiar concerns - I've been googling and that is really doing my head in ! All the best, and let me know how you go. Cheers, Julie.",

This morning I have started taking cold & flu tablets, hoping to ward it off. Will they cancel my surgery if I still have the cold next week??

      "Content": "Hi, This is my first post. Three days ago I had a mammogram and ultrasound, which stated that I had a lesion in my right breast which is consistent with a breast carcinoma, it also showed slight asymmetrical thicking of the cortex of a lymph node. The report suggested that I get a core biopsy of the mass, and fine needle aspiration of the node. I've just got home from that appointment, where they did the core biopsy of the mass. What has confused me is that they did not do a fine needle aspiration biopsy on my lymph node??? When the radiologist looked at the lymph node she said that it looked fine to her. The doctor then had a look and then moved the ultrasound probe underneath my armpit. The radiologist made a comment like \"How did you know to go there\". The Doctor then stated that instead of a fine needle aspiration he would do a core biopsy and the nurse went to get the equipment. He kept looking in the area for a while (under my armpit), and then he and the radiologist made some comments to each other (which I couldn't understand). Then he got up and left, and the radiologist said that was it, and I would only need the one biopsy today. I asked the radiologist why only 1 biopsy, and she said there were 3 or 4 nodes close together, and biopsy and be difficult and very painful. She suggested we get the results of the other biopsy and see what the results are first. What are the reasons why he would decide not to worry about a biopsy, when it seemed like he definately saw something there? I've read on the internet about lymph nodes that are 'stuck together', can you biopsy those nodes? Any suggestions would be appreciated, I've got two days of worrying before I see the surgeon. Thanks, Julie.",
