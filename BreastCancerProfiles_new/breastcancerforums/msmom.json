    "Content": "Five years ago I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer (lumpectomy/chemo/radiation), no cancer in the lymph nodes. A few years later breast cancer was found in the lymph nodes under the sternum and collarbone (same side as breast cancer). The tumors under the collarbone were removed (under sternum remained) and I received chemo/radiation. It has been a year and I have a small bump on the lower neck/upper back region (same side) as well as at the base of the skull. Could this be the same cancer as before (I have not had any infections or felt bad)? I have notified my oncologist and they are waiting until next month when I have an annual CT scan done. Just wondering if this could be a possible recurrence of the breast cancer.",
