      "Content": "Sue, Me too!? I was diagnosed a year ago after a prophylactic mastectomy. I went with one (similar to you) after 2 excisional, 3 core and 1 fine needle biopsy. This over a period of 15 months. They found LCIS on 3 occasions and aytipical hyperplaia each time. I, like you, said the heck with this and said mastectomy please! The pathology at that point came back with a highgrade DCIS with calcifications, necrosis and it was 2.9 cm. I was really surprised that this could be hiding. I am not a big person, about 5'7 & 127 lbs & was a size 34B. Also ,I am not in any small backwater town. I live in a major metropolitan area with access to great medical care. My surgeon, like yours, advised me to visit him annually and reccomened no other follow-up. YES, that makes me nervous. Advise is as follows: I would assume that you had to have been under an oncologists care to receive the tamoxifin. He should be part of your follow-up care. He is a great person to do blood work that can signal a reoccurance. Also, try schedule your regular ob/gyn appointments between your surgical & oncologist visits. This will increase the times you are seen by a medical professional. Find out and be very clear on what reocurrance feels like, that way you know what to look for. Consider enrolling in a cancer research study; this would be more opportunty for follow-up. Remeber, DCIS is not considered to be invasive. Overall the medical community beleives that it does not have the capability of spreading. However, they will never say never. You will hear that the risks are very low. There are still so many unknowns about cancer and how it spreads, there are at this point no guarantees. Since I did not have any lynph nodes removed or biopsied, I am planning on being vigilant. There is such thing as micrometastasis. Not usually found with DCIS, but I have been told it can happen. Sorry about the long message and probable misspellings; but being in the same boat, I sure feel for you!! Good Luck, Lane",

      "Content": "Hi, Okay..double mastectomy 12 months ago. Diagnosis: Hi grade DCIS, comedo type, 2.7cm. No sentinel node done because this was only to be a prophylactic measure. Of course, no adjuvunct therapy. Now I have a VERY tender spot on my rib cage just below the reconstructed left breast. I noticed this because my bra was rubbing against it. I can't feel a lump (I think) Just a really sore spot about the size of a dime on my rib? Sore for about 2 weeks. No clue as to what to look for as it relates to mets. I realize that DCIS should not spread, but I guess I am in the paranoid camp. Lane",
