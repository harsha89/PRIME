    "Content": "Clinical Laser Thermia Systems has a laser ablation method that activates the body's immune system. You can read more about the company at www.clinicallaser.com An optical laser fiber is introduced into the tumor. Laser light warms, gentle and controlled. This causes the tumor to die slowly, usually within a few days. The cells in the tumor leak anti-genes that stimulate the body's immune system, whereupon the immune system also attacks other tumors and metastases in the body of the same cancer type. The immunological effect occurs by the treatment of the tumor at such a low temperature that the antigen's antigenic egg white substances are preserved. These substances interact with the immune system and stimulate an immunological defense against tumor disease. I think Dr. Walser is one of the doctors in the United States who is involved in and testing the method. The advantage of the method is that by treating a tumor or metastasis, other metastases are also attacked. CLS laser treatment method can also be used on BPH and PCa.",
