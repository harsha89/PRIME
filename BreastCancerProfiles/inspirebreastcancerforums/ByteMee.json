      "Content": "I took care of my mother through my 20s and 30s. It wrecked my life. After she died I tried and tried in my 40s to rebuild my life with minimal success. Oh do you bring back all those bad memories. I carry the guilt. I have deep deep scars. I had done so many challenging things but being a caregiver was the most overwhelming. You were lucky to have help. I had none. Somehow I kept money rolling in but it was a challenge. Work all day to come home to the catastrophe du jour. Spending so many evenings at the ER after working all day. Every Saturday was another doctor appointment. Only to be called a mama's boy. Accused by fellow workers and friends my mother cooks and cleans for me. That was my Sundays cooking and cleaning for the week. Hobbies, recreation, me time no way in hell. The final straw was after working all day I needed to get her to the ER again. She was wrestless when I wheeled her in. The admitting clerk heard the frustration in my voice. She started criticizing me. Wrong day. Wrong time. Wrong place. By the time I walked out that clerk was in tears. Being a safe place I left my mother there. When contacted to come get her I made it clear to the hospital that if they did not want to be on the news over what went on along with being sued they better find an appropriate facility for her. They tried to trick her into signing a paper to have me arrested and she would not. 30 days later she died in the care facility. As if all that was not enough she wanted to be cremated. Before they would do it I had to run several obituaries. Finally one night I had the nightmare she was banging on the door of the freezer to let her out she was cold. The next day I made a few calls to get her body released and the deed done. What family was around was mad she was cremated and turned their backs on me after I said \"you took so much time helping to care for her you tell me what her final wishes were\". All they would say \"that is not what I want\". They got one last \"screw you\" as I walked away and never looked back. I hope they all rot in hell.",

      "Content": "Sorry to drone on. Here is another good one. The one late night mom got real sick and I could not get her Dow to the first floor and in the car. So I called 911 for help and rescue and a cop came to help. It was 2AM ish. As me ad the rescue person were getting her down the steps he turns to the cop and says \"doesn't he have any relatives to help\". The cop just snickered. Oh god how I have learned to hate and detest the human race. Any other time I would have beat the ignorant piece of garbage within an inch of his life.",
