    "Content": "Thank you so much for asking about this. My biggest wish for healthcare at hospitals is for all staff to be more educated about mental illness and mental health problems. It has been the case more often than not for me that emergency room doctors and nurses treat you differently if you have mental illness in the present or past. I've never had the sense that these people have any kind of understanding about the true nature of these health problems, and more often than not I have felt negatively judged. It's just so sad that even at hospitals mental health stuff is taboo (shameful/misunderstood). I have often considered preparing a talk for one of my local hospitals to address this issue, but I am not up to doing that any time soon. Thank you again for asking about this. It's a real problem, I feel.",
