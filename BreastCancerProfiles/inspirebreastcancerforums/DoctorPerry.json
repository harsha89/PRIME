    "Content": "I want to encourage you to stay positive. I, too, experienced the trials and tribulations of dealing with confused doctors. But, you must stay positive and persistent. Otherwise, you will surely experience defeat. Make up your mind that in God's timing you will discover the medical guidance for which you deeply desire. It has been my life's lesson that positive outcomes tend to eventually take place in the lives of those who remain hopeful and positive.

Your friend, Dr. Perry Roman's 8:28",
