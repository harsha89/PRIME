      "Content": "When friends ask what they can do, don\u2019t be afraid to ask neighbors to share their dinners with an occasional plate of food. When I was struggling with the fatigue and side effects of chemo ... and not hungry enough to make the effort to cook, I was most thankful for those who took time to make and deliver small meals that were easy to eat and could be refrigerated and/or warmed up. Comfort foods, such as soups, pasta dishes, pasta salads, rice dishes, chicken, pot roast, mashed potatoes and gravy, etc. A nice variety of rolls, quick breads, coffee cake, puddings, custard and slices of pie or cake was welcome, too! I was very lucky to have generous and thoughtful friends and neighbors who took turns delivering 3 or 4 times a week! Their assistance was SO appreciated! Balance2Win",
