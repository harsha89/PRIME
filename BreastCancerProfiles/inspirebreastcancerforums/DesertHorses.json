      "Content": "For me, it was the loan (which has become kind of permanent) of a golf cart so I could get to the barn and at least supervise the care of my horses when I couldn't do it myself. For people with animals, whether they are ranchers with livestock or household companion dogs and kitties, one of the foremost worries is that they will be taken care and help is so appreciated. For example, someone undergoing chemo can not safely clean the litter box - a daily chore Patti in AZ",

I was also fortunate that my nursing was mainly done in collaborative environments where everyone on the healthcare team was respected and their input encouraged, which has shaped my expectations for my own care. I refuse to be treated by an arrogant care provider while also understanding the obstacles faced by providers in busy cancer centers. I have to say, however, that oncology nurses have been my salvation by allowing me to be \u201cjust a patient\u201d and teaching me how to accept the caregiving from others. Patti in AZ",
