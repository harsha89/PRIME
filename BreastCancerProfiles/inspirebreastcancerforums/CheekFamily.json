    "Content": "Since my daughter has a complicated medical situation (AE, Hashimotos and Coffin-Lowry Syndrome), I learned to scan in all medical records and label files carefully, sorted by date, and label folders, sorted by subject, also very carefully. I find that I am always adding new ways to get organized. For prescriptions, I need not only a current list of meds, but a historical listing, including who prescribed, for what reason and when medication was started and when stopped. Beginning this year, we now have a daily diary of symptoms, which my daughter is now well enough to maintain herself. She emails me her daily entries. I keep finding more and more summary lists that seem to be needed: listing of all doctors (current and historical)...listing of all surgeries, summary listing of all medical events, listing of fax numbers for all regular doctors, etc. I have an excel spreadsheet for labs, which enables doctors and myself to see trends and trouble spots at a glance. I keep a hard copy of everything also, but I find that it is easier to find things on the computer (if files are labeled well), then to flip through the many binders I have accumulated for my daughter's records (and also for the other 6 people in our family!!). Also, if I know that when going to a new doctor (and there always seem to be new doctors we need to see), that I can look on her computerized records and see what things I might need to take with me from which notebook. She has so many medical records now, that I have a new notebook each year (some things such as POA, historical summaries, etc, are brought forward each year) She became sick in 2013. At that time I also began a diary (emails to prayer partners), usually containing weekly entries. I have printed out all of these diaries and I have 2 notebooks filled with just my diaries. I have a total of eleven 3 ring binders now, accumulated just in the past 5 years. Everything in these binders is also scanned into the computer, and when we see a new doctor I make a CD of all of her medical records, so that if the doctor wants to see a specific test from a few years ago, they can go directly to the folder (for example, imaging), and search on the date, and see the imaging report. I like to keep the hard copies though, as it is easier to look at when I take the most recent year's information to the doctor's office. I found it easier to do paperwork, if I have the hard copies handy. For example, a few weeks ago, we finally filed for disability benefits. My daughter sat at the computer while I sat on her bed and looked at five different notebooks (one from each of the previous 5 years), finding the answers to all of the various questions that the SS office required. All of the various doctors have patient portals, but since my daughter regularly sees ten different doctors (all at different facilities), relying on the portals is troublesome...though the portals are wonderful for communication with the various doctors. In addtion to the ten regular doctors that she sees, in the past 5 years we have seen 26 other doctors (yes, it took a while to get a proper diagnosis!!), so you can imagine that I can't rely just on the portals to keep organized. Happily I enjoy organizing things, but even I have been amazed at the level of organization I have had to create to manage her complicated medical condition. I haven't even worked very hard at organizing the medical bills, just have a pile on my desk for that. Reading these posts makes me think that I should probably do a better job at organizing the medical bills...since I do the bill paying for my daughter at the moment, I have been able to keep on top of it all, but I can see now, that I should make a system for that also. Thanks for everyone's suggestions. I think it is an excellent suggestion to ask a trusted family member to help with this area of keeping records, if the caregiver is feeling overwhelmed with all of the tasks of caring for the patient. For everyone with chronic medical issues, it is very important to be organized enough (or let someone help you)...so that if you can't take care of your paperwork yourself due to illness, then the family member can easily find the records they need to find to help you.",
