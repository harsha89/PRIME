    "Content": "Thanks for sharing the article written by Kari Ulrich. My oncology surgeon for Ampullary adensquamous carcinoma is a superb MD and an amazing human being. He helped my husband and I through the most difficult times we had been faced with with his humanity, skill and sincere caring. Normally, I would gather a surgeon, though having an important impact for an intervention, would be less likely to make a difference on how a person sees life and serves as a role model for how to live it. About 1 1/2 years after my cancer treatment ended, he and his family moved to a different State to serve at another cancer center. I also grieved at the loss of this relationship even though I wasn't scheduled to see him on a regular basis at that point anyway. My resolution was to send him a quick email a couple of times a year with updates on our lives (grandkids, travels, volunteer work, etc.) and send him an \"anniversary\" thank you card on the date of my Whipple surgery.",
