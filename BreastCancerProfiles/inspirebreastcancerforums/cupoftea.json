    "Content": "I went to Dr. Donat also. She did do a cystoscopy and we could see the scab from where my tumor was, as well as the location- in the top of the dome of my bladder. My visit to her (3 years ago) was about a month after my TURBT. Even though my local uro was supposed to send my path slides to MSK for their evaluation, the office did not. I travelled into NY for my very important first appointment with Dr. Donat, and she didn\u2019t have the slides as a reference point. Still in all, she proceeded to tell me what the gold standards of treatment were based on my original pathology report, but wouldn\u2019t make her recommendation until MSK performed a pathology. I went to my uro\u2019s Office and picked up the slides myself and had them over-nighted to MSK. MSK pathology confirmed the initial report. In that first meeting, Dr. D. mentioned the possibility of bladder sparing surgery. At that time, I was frantic after getting my diagnosis and clung to the idea that I wouldn\u2019t have to lose my bladder. However, during my pre-surgical consultation, she explained allll the options and the statistics that came with each one. After that, I knew I was no longer interested in Bladder sparing surgery. I opted for radical cystectomy. 2 1/2 years later, I can say I\u2019ve lived to tell the tale. Good luck with your journey.",
