    "Content": "I am so sorry about your experiences and words cannot express how much this has touched me. Life can be most challenging and sometimes it feels as if we have nothing left. I have found that my faith and beliefs as a Christian provides me with the comfort and refuge that I require. I know that God is my refuge and fortress at all times. He promises to hold and sustain us and He has fulfilled that through our Lord Jesus Christ. Place your burdens on God through prayers and thanksgiving then see how your situation will change for goodü§ó. Finally, remember your life is a gift and He Who gave it will give you all the support you need to have a fulfilling life in Jesus name Amenüôè . **By the way, I am a survivor of viral encephalitis which I contracted in October 2017. I had an absolutely challenging time. Prior to that in September 2015, I had a procedure that went wrong. I developed sepsis and was seriously sick and was hospitalised for almost 2 months. So no matter the situation you are in now, all will be well. Much blessingsü§óü§ó",
