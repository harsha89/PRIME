    "Content": "My PCP of 32 years just retired. It was very hard, we had grown old together. I had seen her children grow from little tykes to smart, capable, professional women. She had educated and learned me inside out. She went to the great effort to spend extra time in her practice to find a wonderful, competent young woman to fill her shoes-she is a good fit. My doc took the time to fill her in completely on her difficult patients. It wasn't easy but it was bearable. What makes it good is that we are going to keep in touch and have. When I had a stroke two weeks ago, she slipped on her white coat and visited me in ICU. What a lady. I did grieve but that was before she left, and had the time to come to terms with it.",
