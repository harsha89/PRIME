      "Content": "I have just finished 6 cycles of carbplatin, docetaxel and Herceptin and am now continuing with the Herceptin for another 8 months. Starting 4 weeks of radiation next week. I have experienced excessive tearing which I have reported on several occasion to my oncologist. This past week she referred me to an ophthalmologist. Turns out I have blocked tear ducts caused by the docetaxel. Had I seen the ophthalmologist much sooner complete blockage may not have occurred. I now have an appointment with the ophthalmic plastic surgeon. Has anyone experienced this and what has the outcome been. Thanks.",

My oncologist suggested there would not be any testing prior to radiation and that follow up would be mammograms. This seems limited given my sentinel node biopsy had 2 of 3 nodes positive for cancer.",

      "Content": "I have triple positive breast cancer with node involvement. I have had a partial mastectomy with sentinel node biopsy. I started chemo this week. I met with the oncology pharmacist and got a lot of push back on taking supplements. I belong to Kaiser, who have been great, but they do not have an integrative medicine department, though they are now offering acupuncture to their chemo patients at the infusion center. They will not recommend any supplement that isn't supported by scientific research and clinical trials. Does anyone have recommendations for good resources about what supplements are OK to take? I've checked out the Prolon website that was founded by Valter Longo from USC. Has anyone tried this as an alternative to complete fasting? I've also read about studies of Apigenin, drink lots of chamomile tea!! Has anyone tried this as a supplement? Thanks for any suggestions or resources.",

      "Content": "Has anyone had PET scans or MRI's post surgery or post chemotherapy? My oncologist is telling me the standard practice is only routine mammograms and further testing if any symptoms arise. This seems to me to be closing the gate after the horse has bolted! Most early stage cancers are typically asymptomatic, such as my breast cancer. By the time symptoms appear the metastases will have been there for quite some time most likely. I have triple positive breast cancer, which is very aggressive, with positive lymph node involvement. I would be interested in hearing others experiences with testing. Also, what about blood tests or bio marker testing? Thanks",
