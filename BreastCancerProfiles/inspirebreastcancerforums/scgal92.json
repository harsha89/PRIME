I know that Dr. Donat and her team are somemof the best so I just have to put my trust in them. It is hard to give up the bladder. Although I know that if it was a breast, I would have no hesitation. Wish we didn\u2019t need a bladder! :-)",

      "Content": "I think I\u2019m tired, because I\u2019m having trouble making sense of the article. I\u2019m going for my first chemo infusion next Tuesday, gem/cis for T2. Should I not get chemo? Go straight to RC. I met with my local doctors, who gave me the original diagnosis. My second opinion was Dr. Donat and Dr. Teo at MSKCC. My husband is wondering if we should go to Columbia? I have kids so temporary moving to Johns Hopkins or Cleveland Clinic would be too much. I have a consultation at MKS with a radiologist to discuss bladder preservation. Problem is the consult is 3 weeks away. I was diagnosed on July 12 so I\u2019d rather not wait another 3+ weeks. Why don\u2019t they try to save our bladders? I know it\u2019s not the \u201cgold standard\u201d, but why can\u2019t it be?",

      "Content": "Jzpage, Thank you! As always, you give a clear reply that I can understand. I want to live! While I\u2019m not thrilled with the options of urinary divergent, I need to adapt to what will be my new normal. My husband has a hard time with the fact that no one has really explained WHY I\u2019m not eligible for bladder sparring. You have and I have read the Mass General study. He is afraid that I will sink into a depression and not want to leave the house. I\u2019ve told him that it will be a period of adjustment but I\u2019ll be alive! My one concern is that I had the TUR with the local urologist when I was first diagnosed. The doc said he got about 90-95% of the tumor. Dr. Donat never did her own cystoscopy. My CT scan with contrast of the abdomen and chest area are almost 7 weeks old. I asked to have another before the start of chemo next week but Dr. Teo said anything within 8 weeks is okay and he didn\u2019t want me to have the contrast again so close to chemo. IF the chemo doesn\u2019t work, it will be 3 more months that this tumor could grow. I know I will get a CT and PET scan at the end of chemo and before surgery...what if it shows another huge tumor? Thank you again for taking the time to answer. I really appreciate your knowledge. Kathy",
