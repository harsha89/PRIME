      "Content": "Thanks! : ) I agree This is a new primary doctor. He is wonderful. He picked up on my post traumatic stress without me having to spell it out. I do think i need to have a discussion with him about being hyper vigilant. In other words, if there is an over zealous radiologist who looks at something that is 98% benign, but my \"history\" nudges them to \"explore further\" ...I want him to understand my emotional well being must be factored into this equation.",
