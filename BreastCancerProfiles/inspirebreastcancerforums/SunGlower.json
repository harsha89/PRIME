      "Content": "I was recently diagnosed with DCIS in my right breast. Stage zero. Noninvasive. Intermediate grade. 1.5cm. The biopsy removed all of the calcifications. Also, when the titanium clip was placed, it migrated 4 cm. I am scheduled for a lumpectomy on March 6. I met with the surgeon yesterday who feels confident about locating the area where the calcifications were. A scout device would be placed at least 72 hours prior to surgery. I have some concerns about that migrating also! I consider myself a middle-of-the-road person. I am trying to gather all information to make an educated decision about surgery versus starting on tamoxifen. I am told I do not require radiation. I would like to look into doing the oncotype test for chance of recurrence \u2013 I do not know if they will do this if I do not have surgery. I am open to all perspectives and experience if anyone would like to share. Thank you!",

      "Content": "memoryless, thank you for the local connection. I hope to find confidence in the medical team as you have. I feel fortunate to have some time to consider treatment options... Anastrozole is out for me as I've also been recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. I don't want to risk taking anything that causes further bone loss. I will meet with the medical oncologist this week to hear her take on surgery vs. tamoxifen and regular screening. I wish you all the best as well in continuing your healing journey. I do believe that Mission is a good place to be treated when it's clear that more aggressive treatment is necessary.",
