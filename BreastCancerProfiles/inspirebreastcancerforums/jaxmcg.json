    "Content": "Hi Dr Lim I'm writing on behalf of my partner who was diagnosed in March 2015 with secondary breast cancer (ER pos) - mets to the bone and now liver. Initially treated with Exemestane, followed by a trial of Palbociclib, AZD2014 and Fulvestrant combination and then Capecitabine. Since September 2018 the current treatment is weekly Paclitaxel. What is your opinion on the next best treatment? And is there a trial drug we should look out for? She is about to have a biopsy but it has to be of the bone so the results make take a while. Many thanks",
