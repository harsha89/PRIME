      "Content": "At the start of being ill I tossed bills in a draw. I was ill and the insurance paid. Seeing 6 Drs. Got to be to much. Then the draw became plastic bags. I'd always been an organized paper person, but I was avoiding. One day I decided to face my envelopes. It took two full days to organize day to night. A full week to do everything Am retired. So one shot was possible bI felt in control. Today I open envelopes immediately. I read and file. So if I go back in the hospital there is no built up. Yes the timely stuff is talking to the insurance company. But TALK to insurance first before paying bills. I paid & insurance paid no refund, the extra was kept as in paid monies. I take old paper out and rubber band it. I shred papers as need be. I get rid of envopes diplicates etc. stay ahead of sickness. U will feel so much better I promise.",
