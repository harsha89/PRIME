      "Content": "Boomer, I too have lost family members to cancer. My younger brother being one of them. I have also been waging my own battle against bladder cancer that has cost me my bladder, prostate and 2 kidneys. I firmly believe conventional science is what is keeping me alive. In my mind, alternative treatments are a form of Russian Roulette. Eventually you will hit a chamber with a live round. All of the research I have done, and it\u2019s been substantial, points to main stream medicine as the only option with fact based positive results. Granted, these results are not positive often enough. I have heard of people injecting mistletoe juice into their bladders as well as a whole host of other concoctions. None works even though they are touted by their marketers as the holy grail. They will tell you their cure works and that the conspiracy between the big pharma manufacturers is the only thing keeping their product from being mainstream. This is BS. There is no conspiracy. In my experience conspiracy theories are primarily believed by the simple minded. Please do as much research as you can, get to an NCI hospital and find an expert doctor you have faith in. Dean",

      "Content": "I agree with on the mark. Alternative medicine is an oxymoron. These supposed cures are invariably pushed by unscrupulous snake oil salesmen. Yes,as fight term said, there are spontaneous remissions. These are what the snake oil salesmen pounce on to prove their snake oil is effective. It is in your best interest to stay with treatments that have real scientific research as their basis. Your life literally depends on it. Dean",

      "Content": "Boomer, my comments were not intended as a smack down to you personally. Any time I see anyone espouse positive comments about alternative treatments (ie snake oil) I respond. Alternative treatments are, in fact, a form of suicide. I don\u2019t care how positive they may make you feel. To say nothing is equivalent to endorsing them. I do not believe in suicide and cannot endorse it. Using supplements may improve your confidence and moral and that would be a good thing. To use an alternative treatment in leu of accepted mainstream is suicidal. If you believe in conspiracy theories then no rational argument will change your mind. Dean",
