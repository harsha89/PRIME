    "Content": "I have been a cancer patient since 2012. I've seen many different specialists and been to multiple cancer centers. One thing that is consistent is the medical providers DO NOT listen to the patient. I feel like people have been trying to force me into a box that I don't fit in for 6 years. There is no wonder my case is such a mystery to them. Financially, I wouldn't even want to being to wonder what the sum total of my medical expenses would be. It makes me angry when I think of how many meds I didn't need, tests I didn't need or were duplicate. Its a waste of resources. Both money (mine and my insurance, if I even had it at the time). Also physical resources, its very difficult and draining for me to get to unnecessary appts and tests just because that's \"protocol\". I have no hope in our medical community at this point, and no hope I will ever improve. I just wish on top of e everything else that they would not make my existence even more intolerable.",
