    "Content": "I had breast cancer 20 years ago and have been cancer free until yesterday when I was once again diagnosed with breast cancer. This time I will be undergoing a mastectomy (maybe a double.) For the last 12 years I have been a paraplegic. I am paralyzed from the waist down. I am very concerned about the recovery. I cannot do anything without putting pressure on my pectoralis. I need both my hands and arms to do the most simple movements. I can't even turn to the side in bed without a struggle. Has anyone had this problem?",
