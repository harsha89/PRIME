    "Content": "The the potential for legal and ethical abuse and our ability to handle advances in science from a moral perspective cannot evolve as fast as the science itself. The specter of abuse, especially in prenatal genetics to allow us to abort a boy whose genetics will prevent him from competing in sports, or terminate a girl with the obesity gene because she would be better off not being born than suffering from fat shaming in high school? Or for being homosexual? Or, a prospective husband who wants to know if he is going to be saddled with watching her struggle with rheumatoid arthritis or require bilateral mastectomies, disuse to find someone else? Maybe this is a genie best left in the bottle.",
