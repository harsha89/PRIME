      "Content": "Thank you Jennifer. From Dr. Lim: Dear Jennifer. Thankfully with HER2 positive breast cancer, you still have many standard care and clinical trial options. I have patients who enjoy their lives to the max, with some minor changes in their treatment. I am not free here to talk about the actual names of drugs, but herceptin can be combined with many other chemotherapy drugs, and you have not met pertuzumab, which is a cousin of herceptin yet either. Best of luck on your treatment.",

      "Content": "Greetings! I\u2019d like to introduce a new resource for all of us in the Inspire community - a glossary. We believe this will be a helpful resource that will improve your experience on Inspire. Thanks to the many, many of you who suggested this feature and helped make it a priority. Inspire\u2019s glossary includes common terms and acronyms that reflect the shorthand that patients, caregivers, and others who seek support here use to talk about their conditions and experiences. For example, you would find 6MWT (6-minute walking test) but we also included LWASA (let\u2019s wait and see approach). In creating the glossary, we began with a list of terms compiled by Inspire\u2019s community team from around the site and solicited further suggestions from a few large communities in order to have a baseline group of terms. You can access the glossary via the drop down menu next to your Inspire username at the top left of the page. Here is the direct link: https://www.inspire.com/about/glossary This glossary is very much a work in progress and we would love your help in growing it. So, please visit the page, use the resource, and if you don\u2019t see the term you are looking for or you would like to suggest one, leave it as a comment in response to this post or email glossary@inspire.com. Remember to include the following details: - Term, abbreviation, or acronym - If an abbreviation or acronym, a fully spelled out version - If applicable, a definition Thank you!

      "Content": "Thank you pamcollier. From Dr. Lim: Dear Pam, I am glad to know that you are doing well with stage IV cancer, and did not have to change therapy too many times since the beginning of metastasis. Pseudocirrhosis, is something actually happening more commonly than we think - but the actual way to diagnose it and follow the condition can involve the actual biopsy of the liver, and checking right sided heart\u2019s health condition by conducting multiple complicated test. Therefore, it adds more complexity and anxiety to our patients who already undergo tough challenges. However, if your liver seems to have changes already - I would at least consider few things. First, I would try to avoid things that can be burdensome to the liver - this includes alcohol, large amount of tylenol, and believe it or not, large amount or herbal supplements. Second, I would see if there is an expert of liver health (we call hepatologist), and see them once every 6 months to a year, and check basic items to ensure your liver health remains to be healthy. Third, when you get a regular scan with your oncologist, you can also have a short discussion to go over the shape of the liver. If your pseudocirrhosis continues to get worse, it can lead to the symptoms you will experience with long term sleep apnea, so in the end the cardiologist\u2019s help might be needed. All together, it might be something we may not be able to avoid and hard to diagnose and follow, but careful monitoring and healthy life style can help reduce the risk of complication from it. Take care.",

      "Content": "Thank you Ann1999. From Dr. Lim: Dear Ann, PIK3 pathway is associated with many vital mechanisms how cancer cells survive. When PIK3CA or other members of the same pathway genes are mutated, the PI3K -Akt proteins get activated and also activate the downstream molecules to alert cells to grow and survive. Recent study showed that this pathway is related to metabolism (including blood glucose), however no clear study has shown that it directly regulates the immune cells or immune system. Less common form of PI3K family members however, has a direct interaction of modulating the cells that suppress healthy immune cells. Therefore, the inhibitor of that specific member of PI3K protein can enhance the strength of healthy immune cells. This type of PI3K activity is less well studied than the ones that are more commonly mutated - so the actual outcome is to be seen.",

      "Content": "Thank you DianaUK. From Dr. Lim: Dear Diana, of course there is a lot of debate about the intake of sugar. However, cancer cells are really smart - and sometimes if you block all the sugar, they can find the way to generate another form of sugar as their energy source. Therefore, as long as you take only certain amount, it should not be a big issue. I would rather have you being happy with the food you love, than being miserable by cutting all the sugar. I am thinking your bone pain may actually come from the lowering the estrogen in your body by endocrine therapy treatment - yoga, pilates, acupuncture can also help you manage these symptoms. Hope this answer helps!",

      "Content": "Thank you sirppi. From Dr. Lim: Dear Sirppi As you pointed out, the role, or the effect of either ibrance, kisqali, or verzinio (abemaciclib) in cancer without proper RB1 function is questionable. Especially these drugs have target that needs the Rb to work well, to have a good result, so it is almost a key factor to have for these drugs to work. I would take a caution though - how was your RB1 deletion determined? There are so many different types of tests out there, and we have to make sure this was diagnosed properly. And how did you get determined that ibrance + faslodex was not working for you? Hope this helps.",
