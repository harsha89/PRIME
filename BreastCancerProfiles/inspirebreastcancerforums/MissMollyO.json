    "Content": "All: - Yes, it is generally an outpatient procedure. - Your surgeon will give you a prescription for pain, but it is minimal. - You will be advised \u201cno heavy lifting\u201d, but can generally resume all of your normal activities with two weeks. - a surgical drain is used to make sure no lymphatic fluid accumulates in the sutured area. Not all surgeons use them. You will be instructed on how to use and drain it. Sounds scary, but no biggie. - ask in advance, or check your hospital\u2019s or your surgeon\u2019s website. You should see discharge instructions that will tell you what to expect. You\u2019ll get a follow up plan designed for your specific cancer. Trust your doctors, ask lots of questions to be sure you understand. Good Luck!",
