    "Content": "Kathy the article tells that chemotherapy before surgery is a must. Do not get sidetracked by the radiation oncologist. He will recommend that because that is his bread and butter. The bladder is trying to kill you. Do not spare the killer. Radiation will make it difficult to do cystectomy later on and reconstruct neobladder. Most important is to start chemo right away. Do not do Cat scan with contrasts. It will weaken your kidneys further and will make chemo difficult and will delay surgery. Do not do scans even after chemo and proceed to surgery once four rounds of chemo are over. Spend your energies finding the best bladder cancer surgeon at Sloan Kettering who does neobladder. If done right neobladder is almost as good as your regular bladder. BCAN site will help you find the best surgeon there. If you choose robotics they will steer you to ileal conduit. So find somebody who does neobladder",
