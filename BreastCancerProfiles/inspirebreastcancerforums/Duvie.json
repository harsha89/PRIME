      "Content": "Hello Mandymuff, Thanks for the nice reply reassuring members that it becomes easier and eventually second nature. I remember your user name when we have commented on posts before and your a long time member of this amazing site. I'm sure you remember when Inspire had different things across the top such as \"Discussions\" and \"Journals\" where one would just click on either to post. If clicking on Journals it brought you to a page where one would write whatever they to talk about, scroll down and one's list of groups were showing which all one had to do was click in the box in front of each group they wanted, then choose Public, members, or Friends before posting. I find that was much easier and didn't require a longer explanation. Now it has tabs at the top left that could be over looked as I did. One's list of groups don't appear until after one clicks in the box. Then the list disappears each time a group is selected making it more confusing for those just starting to post in multiple groups. <@>... Hello Destiny, Welcome to Inspire. It took me over a year to eventually have to ask how to share to multiple groups, so I know how difficult it can be to navigate through certain sites. Hope you get the information and support you need for improved health. <@>... Hello Philadelphian, Sometimes we all may be absent at times. Glad your back sorry for the long post. All you really have to remember is to notice the tabs at the top left corner in order to post under Discussions or Journals. Remember to keep clicking in the box for your list of groups to appear each time you choose a group and share choose Public, Members, or Inspire Friends, then post. This is much easier to read than having to reread my long post. Like Mandymuff said, it will become second nature to all who use their Journals.

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, For all the new members regardless of just how new and may not be aware of Inspire's ability to join multiple groups. What separates Inspire from all other support networks or groups is the ability for its members to join multiple groups and to share their posts to the multiple groups relevant to their medical needs. Inspire has over 200 support communities with just about any type of diagnosis one may have. Many of us have multiple medical issues and from time to time may need help from some or all their groups they have joined. Navigating through this amazing network may be awkward for those who don't know. I know it was for me many years ago. I had already joined multiple groups but eventually had to ask someone how to share to multiple groups. There are two ways to post which I find a little trickier since Inspire's upgrade. When clicking in the box for posting it will bring you to what looks much like a file folder with tabs at the top left corner. There you will see \"Discussion Entry\" and \"Journal Entry.\" I didn't notice these tabs in the top left corner at first my eyes just caught the large print. That's one reason I mentioned that its a little trickier because members may not notice the tabs like me. \"Discussion Entry\" only allows a member to post in one group at a time regardless of how many groups one belongs to. \"Journal Entry\" provided a member has joined more than one group then \"Journals\" allows someone to choose from their groups they would like their post to be shared in. They can choose ALL or some of their groups. Here's the other tricky part for new members. It used to be we had a box before each group where we click on to share in which was not confusing. Now there is a large box that a member needs click in for their list of groups to show up below the box. Then click on the group which will be transferred into the box while causing your list of groups to disappear. Each time you want to add another group you have to click in the box to show your list of groups, then choose another group to be added to the box. Keep repeating until all the groups you desire have been placed into the box. Remember there is a tiny box above the big box that allows one to click on \"ALL\" groups. If for some reason the \"ALL\" button disappears then you will have to do it manually with the click and choose method. It's very important to notice and decide how you want your post to be shared Public, Members, or Inspire Friends. By clicking in the box that says Public it will display \"shared with\" and displays Public, Members, and Inspire friends. If you Don't want to share with the public then you have to choose either Members or Inspire friends which are eventually acquired as time goes on. Sometimes a post may be very sensitive and to be able to receive more comments then you should choose \"Shared with Members.\" There are some members who do not like their comments shared with the Public so make sure to click in the small box and choose \"Members\" otherwise it will automatically be shared with public. If you decide later to change your post from Public to Members then it's easy, just click on \"edit\" at the top just above your writing , scroll down until you see the small box with public and change itto members, then hit \"save.\" However, some posts such as this one which has no sensitive points is OK to \"Share with Public.\" I often think about how I found this site which would not have been possible on the internet if someone hadn't posted \"Public.\" Inspire also offers the ability to share up to 4 pictures at a time by clicking on the camera and browse your photos to share with Inspire. Then you can scroll down to \"Post.\" Forgot to share in a single group and had to edit to do it manually. Click & choose, Click & choose until all done, HeHeHe. Sorry for the long post. Hope This helps Errol Edited October 8, 2018 at 2:04 am",

      "Content": "Hello Joy, Thanks for the excellent info provided in regards to changing from the Public default to Members option. It becomes easy once someone has clicked in the little box with Public inside. By clicking in it, it gives a pop-up that shows Public, Members, and Inspire friends. Choose one then post. If someone forgets they can always edit and change to members as Joy mentioned above. Thanks again Joy. <@>...aaaaaaa, It's easy to post especially if you post in just one group under Discussions. Just click where it says to post, then write your info on what you would to talk about, scroll down to choose if you want it to be public or Members, then click on post and your all done. No multiple groups to worry about sharing in. Have fun posting and receiving comments. <@>...Hello Linda, Sounds like you and Gutsy have been busy with providing humor along with the help that might be needed by others. I nor any family members have an ostomy that I know of yet. Maybe their hiding it from me. Keep up the good work!! <@>...Hello Michelle, Thanks for the kind words. I know your a pro at sharing in multiple groups. It has been awhile since my last post. Some times I feel like broken record repeating the same info but I also realize their are always new members who might need some help. Duvie and I are about the same. He's drinking water which I can't seem to get him to stop. He is losing weight. Hope you and your family are doing well. Thanks for the Replies Errol",
