      "Content": "You'll also get the full path about 10 days after surgery. My niece's is poorly differentiated, which is more aggressive. She met today with radiation and medical oncology. They have to wait so long to send the tissue in for genomic testing, something to do with insurance. So this treatment they recommended could change depending on that outcome. She will also likely still take Tamoxifen for 5 years or more. Take care, Judy",

      "Content": "My 38 y.o. niece just had a lumpectomy 2 weeks ago.It was an outpatient procedure. She was sore about a week and keep forgetting about her arm, as she's right handed. They removed a few lymph nodes from the armpit. You can lift your arm, but you can't throw it up or out, which she kept doing. Her path came back, clean margins and no lymph node involvement. She'll still have to do radiation to the tumor bed and likely Tamoxifen for 5 years. She has invasive ductal carcinoma. Good luck! Take care, Judy",
