    "Content": "The biggest problem we have in the world to today is IGNORANCE, everybody has to put their opinion on what we have and how we got it. And you know what they say about opinion's, I will let you put what you want as to not offend some one. We all have cancer cell's in our body, some will get cancer while others will not. All it will take is stress or a shock to the system, and the next doctors visit you find out you have something that is found here on 212 sites. Here we don't judge you for what you have or who you are, that is part of your makeup and the only judge and jury is the man up stairs. I have NF1 which one of the things is tumors all over the body, I had people who I thought were friends tell me their is a lotion out there. When I go to doctors offices I get people stare and make comments, my thing is if I want your opinion I would beat it out of you. I let a person tell me first about what they have, but do not try and tell them how they should live.",
