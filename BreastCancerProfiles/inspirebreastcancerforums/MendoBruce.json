      "Content": "I listen to the doctors, then go home and use the internet to research peer reviewed published articles related to my problem, I may post a few questions on a patient board to ask others who have the condition. I will then try to get a clear picture of the pros and cons of the decision and the odds of each occurring As a gambler and a bit of a risk taker, I will try to find the solution that offers the best odds of a good outcome with the minimal amount of medical intervention. I will then go back to the doctor and discuss my findings and the decision I am leaning towards. I will get their opinion and then either get a second opinion if it is a very major surgery or else just make a decision myself if it is less major. REPLY",

      "Content": "I really wish Inspire would give us warning in the heading on posts made to multiple groups. I go to my group for information specific to my disease. A solution for a symptom of one disease is rarely an applicable solution to the same symptom for my disease and in fact, is often contra-indicated! We then have to let the others with our disease know NOT to do what works for the other diseases! Personally, I really dislike that feature. Inspire should at the very least give us a warning before we have to open it and find it does not apply.",
