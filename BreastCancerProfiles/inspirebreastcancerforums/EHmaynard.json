Whenever I remind someone about my poor memory, I'm reminded that at our age this is \"normal.\" I read a comeback: so has your brain been fried by radiation too? of something like that.

My sister laughed and noted that I have a \"celebrity cancer' - GBM (Beau Biden; Ted Kennedy). I deallt with infertility many years ago, and would tell people that in my previous life I had 10 children and no husband, so in this life I was going for 10 husbands.
