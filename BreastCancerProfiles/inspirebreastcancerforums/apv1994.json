    "Content": "The doctor that most of my family went to in a small Maine town passed away unexpectedly this winter of a heart attack after a day of skiing. He had been my parents Dr, my brothers and my sister. I went to him for awhile when my children were small but left to go to a pay on a scale clinic as there were no copays then. Everyone that went to him has had a hard time being with this loss. He had been in the area since just beforemy middle one was born so about 34 years. My brother stayed with the practice and recently saw his new Dr for the first time. He said it's just not the same. I believe a lot of the deceased Dr's patients will feel like that for a long time.",
