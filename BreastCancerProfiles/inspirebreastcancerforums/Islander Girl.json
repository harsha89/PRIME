    "Content": "I started out my journey with a friend making me a three-ring binder notebook with tabbed sections for reports: blood counts,, CT scan,genetic testing, pathology reports, etc., I keep everything in that notebook and take it to every oncology appointment. I also ask for copies of all of my testing, so I have a hard copy, not just what the doctor reports to me. I can't tell you how many medical providers have commented on my notebook over the past few years. I come to appointments fully prepared and when the doctor can't find something, I can produce it! I also carry a small notebook that I write my questions and concerns in. That way I can make sure all of my questions are answered before I let the doctor leave the room. It's worked well for the past 2+ years that I have been dealing with my cancer. ~ Donna",
