    "Content": "I recently had my RC done at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville....I am lucky enough to live in Florida and am only 1 1/2 hrs. away...it was the best experience that I have ever had. Mayo Clinic is definitely at the top of the list of hospitals, with experts in every field. The caring and dedication was so comforting to somebody like me who had never heard the word \"bladder cancer\" before. The shock of hearing this sent my mind reeling. As I returned to Mayo on many occasions before the operation, I became more and more comfortable. The knowledge and expertise that every single person showed me helped me overcome my fear and led me to the acceptance that I needed to face. I am only three weeks out of surgery and am still on the road to recovery....neverless, Mayo has been there and is still there whenever I need them. I owe my life to them.",
