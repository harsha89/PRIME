    "Content": "With the normal rate they push the Taxol you should plan on 1 1/2 hours for sure. I kept having allergic reactions so they slowed it down and it took 2 1/2 hours. Other than being bald the side effects were not bad for me at all. If you post a response back and I don't answer it's because Inspire locks up when I try to go back and reread posts. All the Best, Lisa",
