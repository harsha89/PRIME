    "Content": "Just know you did everything you could do for your husband and don't ever think you did not do enough. Cancer is a very destroying disease and a fickle one at that. One treatment may work for one and not someone else. But being a caregiver is sometimes harder than having cancer. Take great care of your children and yourself. Enjoy the good memories and one day the bad ones will fade. Sorrentofran",
