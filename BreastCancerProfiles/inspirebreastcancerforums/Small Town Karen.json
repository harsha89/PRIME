      "Content": "JCU1111, There is no way to tell on your own if the breast cancer has spread. Back in 2015 I had a mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy on Friday, was told the results would be given to my family doctor on Monday, and thought there was no way I could survive the stress of not knowing all weekend. Waiting is scary, but it may help to keep your thoughts occupied with other matters. LIsten to favorite music, pray (if that's part of your regular routine) -- whatever gives you comfort and peace. I learned that my cancer had spread to my lymph nodes, but after a portion of my breast and some lymph nodes were removed I'm cancer free, though I need regular checkups. Is there a friend or relative you can confide in before you tell your mother? Everyone is different, but it helped me to tell others about my diagnosis, because I felt that something that can be said out loud is something that I can get through. But as I already stated, everyone is different, so it's okay if you decide to make your Cancer Journey by going another route than what's suggested by others.",

      "Content": "Jcu1111, If your cancer has spread, that doesn't automatically mean a death sentence, it may just mean that your treatment will be a little more complicated or more prolonged. Before 2015 I barely knew lymph nodes existed. When a needle biopsy showed that a few renegade cancer cells had migrated to a lymph node in my upper right arm I did a bit of research and learned that the wonderful system of filters I have throughout my body catches most of the nasty germs -- and cancer cells -- that try to invade other organs. When my surgeon removed a portion of my breast, plus three lymph nodes, I thought of those lymph nodes as heroes who sacrificed their lives to save mine. (That may seem silly, but the thought gave me comfort.) Maybe your cancer spread, and maybe it didn't. When the appointment time finally comes, and you get your diagnosis, you may think you can't manage everything that will be coming your way. Well \"everything\" is beyond your ability to handle, but you can make one decision, then take a rest. In a day or two decide on something else. You'll get through your Cancer Journey by taking one step at a time.",

      "Content": "(I wrote this during the time Denzie was posting her reply.) Jcu1111, I am no cancer expert, just someone who learned a little about what I was facing at any given time. All I can tell you is that many rounds of chemotherapy reduced my breast tumor so that I could have my preferred treatment of a lumpectomy instead of breast removal. (My decision was based on having a couple of part time jobs and no paid sick days. Smaller surgery meant a shorter time that I'd be without income, which is important since I live alone and need my rent money.) Lymph nodes were removed, a biopsy was done, and I was informed the lymph nodes had no cancer, so I was cancer free. I'm assuming chemotherapy had killed off the cancer cells that had been in my lymph nodes, but I didn't ask. I didn't ask if cancer can spread without going through lymph nodes, just trusted the experts who told me my estrogen-based breast cancer was gone. I'm sorry I can't ease all of your worries. There are different types of breast cancer, and I don't know all possible scenarios. Write down questions about cancer spreading, and ask the doctors who will be treating you. Waiting is scary, and all I can suggest is that you try to do something you enjoy that will help keep your mind off your worries. When life is \"mean\" to me I reread children's books I've loved since I was a girl, and spend a few hours with my \"book friends.\" You may want to listen to music, watch comedy movies -- whatever will make you happy, and help remind you that life is much more than the cancer cells in one part of your body.

(For more info you can read my journal \"Cancer and Cowering Poverty.\" ) I'm now finishing my 3rd year of Anastrozole, an estrogen blocker I'm to take for 5 years. My treatment went well, every six months I get a mamogram, and there's no sign of returning cancer. Unfortunately I still feel tired all the time. Not can't-get-out-of-bed exhaustion, but take-a-lot-of-work-breaks tired. At home I sit in my chair and think how I really need to do some cleaning, but keep feeling too tired to do so. (Ironically most of my part-time work income is from cleaning jobs.) Is this normal for people who had breast cancer treatment 3 years ago? Is it caused by Anastrole? Though I'm tired all the time I tend to stay up too late because I don't feel sleepy -- just tired. I never had a great deal of energy, but I used to be able to work full time, but now I have trouble getting through a few hours of work. (I do cleaning 19 hours a week, sometimes get some freelance sewing work hemming pants or replacing zippers, and April - November I work at a museum 6 hours on Saturdays.) I'd appreciate some feedback about the energy level of others who had breast cancer treatment a few years ago.",

      "Content": "Dextergirl, I'm sure your advice is excellent, but I don't have the courage to follow it. Though I have the best shoes and innersoles I can afford there are times when the ball of my left foot begins to hurt when I'm walking. There was a time last winter when I was without a car and would walk a little over a mile to and from one of my cleaning jobs. I recall walking home and wanting to sit down on the cold sidewalk and cry because my foot hurt so much. Most of the time my foot doesn't bother me, but I'm afraid of walking for more than a few minutes. If I'm at work and my foot bothers me I sit down, take off my shoe, rub my foot for a few minutes, and then put my shoe back on and tell myself to just deal with it. I looked up SAM-e and it seems to have good reviews, but the price frightens me. Perhaps in the spring, when I return to working at my Saturday museum job, I can try to get a bottle of SAM-e. Thank you for taking the time to reply to my post.",

I first joined so that I could write a journal about my experience going through cancer treatment while living in poverty. It was important for me to tell my story, and it helped in my emotional healing. But that was my way of dealing with a stressful time in my life -- all people are different and everyone needs to make their own decisions about what to do or not do. You may want to ask herself why you got on the Internet and joined Inspire, if you were feeling great after surgery. If joining Inspire was just a whim, and you are receiving nothing but grief from the site, then I'm sure there's a way to quit the site.",

Though I keep \"backsliding\" on my good intentions, I do want to push myself a little more to tidy up my little one room efficiency (converted motel room) because this is my home and I want be in a \"prettier\" place. But I also want a little confirmation that I'm not just being lazy for not doing as much as a \"grownup\" should. I live alone in a little home with Wi-Fi included in the modest rent. Right now I'm using my aging Kindle to write this. Part of my troubles may be stress, or perhaps even depression. My siblings & other relatives don't set out to attack me personally, but at every family gathering the general conversation leads to declarations that people who aren't working full-time, and who are accepting any government aid, are basically stealing from hard-working people, who have to pay too much taxes to pay for freeloaders. I've found the best option is to keep my mouth shut & think my own thoughts until the conversation shifts to other topics. I try to be a peace with myself, and remind my brain that I did try to find a full-time job back in 2009, when the place I'd worked at closed down, and ended up taking whatever I could get to pay the rent. And now I'm doing my best with a small income. When the government decided everyone without health insurance had to pay IRS penalties I applied for and got a low-income exemption to avoid the penalty -- until I got an expensive health problem, and started using taxpayer funded Medicaid. (I also get a monthly food box, but don't have an Access card for today's version of Food Stamps.) Sometimes I get down on myself and wonder if I'm being lazy for not finding a full-time job with benefits, and letting cancer treatments, my age & recent work history keep me from improving my earnings. Sorry -- I'm going on a rant and \"venting.\" I just wanted to know if I do have a legitimate reason for feeling tired, to give myself permission to be content with setting small goals for improvement. Thanks again for your input.",
