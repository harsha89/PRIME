    "Content": "I've been involved with the Answer Cancer prostate cancer support group for about 3 years. It is great to talk to others that are in the same situation as I am. While the main discussion group leans heavily toward medical and scientific topics for those with prostate cancer, the other component that often sorely needs to be discussed is that of emotions and feelings about what is happening in your life when you face cancer. These things are discussed on the support groups anyway but having a call dedicated specifically to this aspect of dealing with cancer, in my opinion, will prove invaluable to many individuals. I'm looking forward to it.",
