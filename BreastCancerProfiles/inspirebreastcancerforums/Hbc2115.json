      "Content": "I could not agree more! It's hard to remember what was being told at appointments and updated patient portals with all of the information would be helpful. My obgyn oncologist makes voice notes and there should be some sort of app that puts it into your patient portal. Going off this point, I think it's important for doctors to help/encourage patients to be their own advocate. My oncologist has done a lot of things without even letting me know. After my debulking surgery, I was told I had an extensive surgery but that's about it. I had to get my surgical report to see what was done. I was given a game plan for treatment and that was that. I just kind of went along with the flow and felt like I had no control of my situation. My rheumatologist has a totally different take. She told me to educate myself on my illness, gave me resources to do so, and allows me to be involved in treatment choices. She makes me feel like a member of my treatment team and not like a blind follower. It's empowering and it helps doctor-patient relationship. Having a sense of control over my treatment truly helps give me confidence and helps to alleviate anxiety. I know what is going on and have such respect for my doctor due to the open communication.

      "Content": "Throughout my surgeries and chemo, I had very good experiences with the exception of testing before my surgeries. Getting bloodwork and xrays was very stressful. I was there for almost four hours because the nurses weren't properly trained to find and print the labels for the lab work. As a cancer patient I was under a lot of stress and anxiety, and it was very frustrating and unnecessary. Employees should be properly trained for basic tasks so appointments run smoothly for the patients. Edited March 13, 2019 at 11:05 am",
