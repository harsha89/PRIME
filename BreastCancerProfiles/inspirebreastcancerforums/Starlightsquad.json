      "Content": "Hello, my story is one of a nightmare. To summarize December 2015 I had a breast MRI due to high risk of 2 sisters having breast cancer. At that time they found 2 masses, both suspicious BI-RAD 4, recommended biopsy on both. During biopsy they decided to only biopsy one. It came back benign. So they decided to call the other one benign. HA! 3 years later the one they didn\u2019t biopsy is now invasive breast cancer. I am broca negative. Tumor characteristics are ER +, PR -, HER2 +. Since 2015, I have had 2 MRI\u2019s, 3 mammograms and 2 ultrasounds. All referring to both masses as benign and benign. The surgeon I have chosen tells me the mass didn\u2019t go rogue, that had it been biopsied in 2015, it would have shown malignancy and still been insitu. Has this ever happened to anyone else?",

      "Content": "I am choosing a bilateral mastectomy with staged reconstruction because I am family high risk for breast cancer. 2 out of 4 sisters have had breast cancer and now I am the third with ER+, PR -, HER2 +. Invasive ductal carcinoma. Due to being misdiagnosed for 3 years I am scared that if I go for a lumpectomy, there are no guarantees they won\u2019t miss another one. I have a right bundle block in my heart, so I don\u2019t want to chance radiation. I had lung cancer in 2008 and I couldn\u2019t even complete all 6 rounds of chemo due to the effects it caused. I am also scared of the taxol and Herceptin they want to give me for 12 weeks, and then Herceptin totaling a year. Added is the aromataise therapy for lord only knows how long. Any suggestions on a cancer treatment center? I was misdiagnosed by Seattle Cancer Care for 3 years. They are considered the #5 in the nation.",

      "Content": "The whole thing upsets me. Here is the thing that shocks me. The masses were both in the same breast! 10 o\u2019clock and 11 o\u2019clock. They biopsied the 10 o\u2019clock which means they went right over the 11 o\u2019clock mass to get to the 10 o\u2019clock. It\u2019s difficult for me to understand. Know one at the clinic that I ask can tell me why. I think that frustrates me the most. I keep getting told to focus on the forward and treat the cancer.",

      "Content": "Hi Rosemary, I was just recently diagnosed as well and my report reads pretty close to yours. The tumor in my breast is invasive as well as insitu. It means that part of the tumor is still in the duct and part of it has expanded out into the other breast tissue. I believe the tumor that has manifested in my left breast is Stage 1, Grade 2. Estrogen positive, progestrone negative and HER2 positive.",
