    "Content": "Hello Dr. Lim HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY I was 33 when diagnosed with Breastcancer in 2010 estr +, prog+, her2 positive, stage 2 recurrence in 2016 with mets in lungs, 8 rounds of toxetaxel plus ongoing 3 weekly traduzamab and pertuzamab. Lung mets shrank to tiny and haven't changed since 2 years. After getting my menses back I decided to remove ovaries rather than ongoing Zoladex injections, which took place in May 2018. Ovaries had BC, now they are out and I'm on Aromasin (since 1 October, I found out about my thyroid) Biopsy on Thyroid came back with BC. Now Im wondering if my Hyperbaric oxygen chamber might increase my VEGF Im having a inflatable hyperbaric, which goes to 1.3 ATA, doing sessions about 4 times a week for 90 minutes. Do I need to be more conservative and worry about this growth factor? Kind regards Angelina",
