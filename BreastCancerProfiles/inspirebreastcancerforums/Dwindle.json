    "Content": "Dear Brian and Inspire Friends, I surely mean not an iota of disrespect, but the timing of this Journal Post, amidst the anguish and intensely distracting worry of being able to afford Health Care in the US, seems *tone deaf* and insensitive. While discussion, debate and a sharing of ideas is the cornerstone of Inspire, it cannot be left unsaid that it is also a place where we gather to hold one another up with compassionate and empathic hearts, minds and souls. And, at this time of the jagged edges of uncertainty, fear and harsh rhetoric across the US regarding affordable Health Care and its availability to its citizens, I am left to wonder when and where, upon the pages of all Inspire Communities, there be allowed discussions to take place which to not denigrate and divide; rather those that, as Inspire Moderators often write often, \"Generate light rather than heat\". Perhaps providing a separate set of Guidelines, to be used specifically for the present crisis in US Health Care, may go a long way in allowing a meaningful dialogue and the chance to promote a sense that Inspire Executives are also monitoring the present crisis. I encourage you or another of Inspire's Executive level employees, to devote meaningful time to this topic and, the very real chance of *generating light* might be realized by each and every person, who may well feel very much in shadow. The most unkind and unwelcome of intrusions, which can accompany a threatening health condition, is very much due to the countless unknowns of continuing to live their lives, in the face of critical illness, as best and as hopeful in ways that matter utterly to their qualitative choices. I envision these as initiated by the leadership of Inspire Executives, so that a knowledge base is shared, by those who are in higher levels of health management and from the members of Inspire who come here each night and day, whose aim and mission is the same, quite rightly ... \"Together, we're better\". As a Canadian, perhaps I run the risk of being perceived as an interloper by others who will read this note. Simply put, if we matter to each other, there exist no borders, nor separations of spirit, when it is accepted that, collectively, every voice counts when a fellow human being is wounded ... both seen and unseen. Best Regards, Louise in Montreal",
