      "Content": "Bravo to the honorable Doctors, but for 5 decades we\u2019ve heard this story, five years quickly turns to ten years then nothing is ever heard again. With President Trump initiating a country wide \u201cright to try\u201d we now are getting some of the FDA out of our way so we can pursue cures(if Dr\u2019s will share data!). Right now we have a favorable trial(in Sweden) that we had to crowd fund ourselves(zebras) only to find the researchers had slowed it down so the completion will likely be ten years from now if it works. And in the USA something is structurally wrong with big Pharma controlled research(it\u2019s simply too expensive). In Europe our highly successful PRRT treatment, after positive outcomes on thousands for 20 years has now finally arrived at USA hospitals sadly much too late for many. I don\u2019t know what the PRRT thing was about but it wasn\u2019t a \u201ctrial\u201d it would be interesting to \u201cfollow the money\u201d to learn what\u2019s going on but all of us are deathly ill.",

      "Content": "Brian your bosses are barking up the gene therapy tree since these modified genes can be patented and therefore profits sky high. Our group(and many others) already has a proven and effective treatment but the FDA will not push it through nor will trials be funded(USA) due to lack of profits. The Europeans however are moving along very well. We don't need Joe Biden's moon shot, since everyone knows clinical research is guarded by intellectual property rights and can't be shared. It's every clinic for themselves since to show your cards defeats the chase for profits, and stops the game. I don't know if theres a kitty hat for cancer site monitors but do a Google you might find one. It's a shame to see so many people passing away that can't make it to Europe, but such is life. Scientist say 2 to 300 new cancer drugs must be approved a year for gene mapping to be effective, that's a ten fold increase from today. ..... just saying",
