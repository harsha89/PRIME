We invite you to read and share, \"The Little Voice in my Head \u2013 Escaping My Biggest Enemy,\" by advocate Alisha Bridges, who lives with psoriasis . In struggling to manage the stigma of psoriasis, Bridges, noted, \"I know the hurtful, negative things I hear are not true, but come out of internal insecurity\u2014it\u2019s what anxiety feeds on.\" Also, please see a new caregiving self-care column as part of the Mayo/Inspire series, \"A Nothing Day: Self-Care for Caregivers,\" by Harriet Hodgson. \"You may wish to make a sign that says Nothing Day, with the day of the week, and date on it; circle the day on a calendar as well,\" Hodgson wrote. \"Allow enough lead time to give your loved one opportunity to process the thought. Most importantly, assure your loved one that her or his basic health needs will be met.\" Last but not least, we invite you to read an opinion piece, \"Opioid stigma is keeping many cancer patients from getting the pain control they need,\" published just today on the Boston Globe's STAT healthcare news site, and written by two Inspire colleagues here, Sara Ray and Kathleen Hoffman.

      "Content": "Dear members, I'm writing to share with you a new column, \"Chronic Disease Management And The Need For Control,\" written by patient advocate Kristina Figueroa as part of Inspire's collaboration with the magazine Life Science Leader. Kristina, who lives with Type 1 Diabetes, wrote, \"What if we changed the way we delivered our diabetes education? What if we used an existing mobile app to develop new habits over time? Or better yet, what if we started asking more specific questions in the review of systems during medical exams? This could allow for us to track thought patterns and identify risks for greater outcomes and comorbidities.\" Also, please see another new column, \"Straight from the Doctor\u2019s Mouth \u2013 My Cancer Diagnosis,\" by testicular cancer survivor Justin Birckbichler. Lastly, we invite you to read \"Stories Matter: Why You Should Embed Patient Stories at the Heart of What You Do,\" (https://socialmedia.mayoclinic.org/2018/11/02/stories-matter-why...) by breast cancer survivor and communications consultant Marie Ennis O'Connor. These are part of the twice-monthly series of \u201cExperts by Experience\u201d columns, as part of a collaboration between Inspire and Mayo Clinic.
