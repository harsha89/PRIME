      "Content": "O have been my husband's care giver for 8 years. He had encephalitis which was MISDIAGNOSEd for several days until he coded on the strike unit and was resuscitated and put on life support. He was 52 and a Rice educated architect. We had been married 30 years. I knew he had not had a stroke but was dismissed repeatedly until he nearly died and the truth was discovered on MRI. The doctors missed The triad for what he had on admission which was headache,fever,confusion. This was in the world famous Houston medical center. Only 30% survive. Then another 2\\3eds succumb within a year. It is so rare most doctors have not treated it. I was basically told his life was over but I refused a DNT and I refused nursing home. Five months later he came home in a wheelchair, hallucinating, no memories, yelled all night, chewed on everything...And a complete stranger to me. I thought we would both die. Eight years later our life is totally different than the first thirty years of our marriage. But we are still here. I have been left to figure out all complications and complexities. I have to be his eyes and ears and more. The brain damage was pervasive and his emotions are blunted. He does not perceive pain or fear . Still through all of our trials and battling memory deficits, infections,a broken hip, personality changes I have never regretted being his caregiver. The grief at first was stunning. I could not eat not could I barely breathe. I was heartbroken.I went in my closet and screamed into a pillow. I screamed at the stars in the middle of the night into a canyon. Eventually what I learned was O had to use that grief as fuel for burning. And that is what got us through. Dgattis",
