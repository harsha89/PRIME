      "Content": "JCU, The fact you missed a mammogram - cancer caused cancer not your lack of testing. It could be a benign tumor (every radiologist in my life has been wrong - it is not as exact a science as a biopsy.) Many, dare I say most of the women in Inspire, can attest to having yearly (or more frequent) mammograms and still being diagnosed. Cancer can show up in minuscule amounts and look like normal cells - it did for me. My mother and two aunts were breast cancer patients, so the radiologist cautiously called me in for an ultrasound and biopsy. Breast cancer does not come in 1 size fits all. Virtually everyone who is not a cancer patient believes cancer is a single disease. It is not. Its hormone status, size, appearance, location, and evidence found in surrounding cells are just a few of the factors that determine what the disease actually is for you. Your family history plays a role. And the presence of certain genetic factors helps determine treatment. I did not have chemo, a PET scan, or lymph nodes tested; I stopped hormone blockers (I was severely allergic) and had but now regret having radiation. (Radiation is not indicated for people my age with the level of cancer I have; it causes permanent damage.) Get yourself a surgeon you trust. Ask your gynecologist or internist or another doctor you trust to recommend someone. Opt, if you can, for a surgeon that specializes in breast surgery. Work with a teaching hospital - one where the newest research and techniques are used. Read reputable material (online works) on current treatments and their pros and cons. If you have any sense that you are panicking or know you do not understand what docs tell you, take someone with you who can listen and interpret if need be. Trust your instincts - if what the docs say sounds outrageous or does not fit how you are feeling, speak up and sort it all out. Find a practice as SmallTown already recommended - running, exercise, meditation, walking, play an instrument, reading the Bible, tea with friends, baking cookies - that brings you peace. KNOW that INSPIRE is here for you. There is a wealth of knowledge and experience. Edited February 14, 2019 at 1:21 pm",

      "Content": "It would be wonderful if cancer science was simple - and that the tests would give all the information needed to treat and succeed in eliminating cancer. The tests and historical data move doctors towards good decisions. Nevertheless, the tests are guides, the decisions best guesses. Suggest you work with a teaching hospital's cancer center if you are not already doing so. Even if you have the best of the best, your body acts and reacts uniquely. You have a role - making decisions on treatments and tests. Inspire discussions are potentially a source of information - pointing you to new research, trials, ideas. Wish you escaped malignancy and treatment started earlier. As that was not what happened, may you find great doctors and a community to support you.",

      "Content": "I had a lumpectomy, did not have chemo, stopped taking Tamoxifen and Aromatase (Exemestane) due to serious side effects. I experienced sharp, take-your-breathe-away pain in my radiated breast at about 3 months. I never was told this was a potential side effect. I reported the pain to my surgeon. She said it was to be expected - perhaps for a year, perhaps for my lifetime. She added that I likely would develop arthritis in my rib cage. She explained to an intern that pain was likely to be worse during dramatic weather changes. At 4 years out, the sharp pain is less frequent. I avoid the positions that kick off the twinges. Changes in weather cause general upper body aches. I do not take anything for the sharp pain. The general ache leads me to take one ibuprofen if sleep alludes me. Lying on that side induces a dry cough. My sense is there is more than one condition brought on by radiation. For a woman my age with early-stage BC, no lymph node involvement, and menopausal, radiation rarely impacts longevity. Wish I researched the treatment more carefully. The surgeon had recommended double mastectomy with radiation and possible chemo with my family history. I opted for a more gradual treatment. Disappointed that my due diligence to find my BC team did not avoid radiation",

A number of trusted websites explain.

      "Content": "JOYInvincible is marked as inactive. I expect she is no longer following replies. I took my diagnosis matter-of-factly. It was strangely a relief - when I would be diagnosed was no longer in question. My mom and her two sisters had BC. All the siblings and their mother died of some form of cancer. I joined Inspire to research reactions to Tamoxifen - with severe side effects I could not get through the nursing staff to get to my oncologist. Convinced the reactions were real, I sought patient first hand reports. (By the time I staged a mini-sit-in at the oncology office and saw the doctor, I was dosed with emergency level steroids to stop the reactions. The nurse who denied me access was not only required to escort me to oncology, she was there to hear the alarmed \"why didn't you come in sooner?) My allergic reactions continued on other inhibitors. I quit taking them as death by blood clot or asphyxiation was more eminent than be BC. Friends of decades disappeared as if they would catch BC by having lunch or returning email. There are those who seek to distance themselves from cancer by telling you they avoid such and such - i.e. you did such and such to catch to cause cancer. Random ideas that are not known carcinogens. I helps well being to know being abandoned is frequently a \"side-effect.\" Survivors go through stages of denial, why me, acceptance, and action. On any given day this \"grieving\" process is moving - not always to the goal of recovery. Denial and why me stages are very likely to raise anger and fear. Inspire may or may not help. A role in advocacy, support and comfort is valuable. Making research-informed responses, as so many here do, broadens our collective knowledge. Sometimes someone who understands experiencing cancer helps immensely when cancer isolates you. I want to know as much as possible about the disease and my options - and advocate for my care. I know there are just as many or more who wish to hand the decisions over. Many folks are somewhere else mentally. All are valid places to be. Many folks can't imagine a day when they will stop battling to live. I want to seek a balance between quality of life and how long I live. I have known women who chose hospice when still relatively well and others who expire from the toxicity of one last treatment experiment. Their choice is as correct for them (and their loved ones) as mine is for me.",

      "Content": "Small Town, I read your story months ago. It is inspiring, sad, interesting and informative. Decades ago in graduate school I wrote a paper on the Economics of Poverty - including a discussion on the practice of cutting benefits as people went to work. My mother suggested I hire my cousin, a single parent of 2, to type the paper. I learned more from my cousin than through my research. She was living in poverty, trying to hold a decent job and raise kids in a tough neighborhood while she saw welfare recipients cheat the system in what she considered blatant, \"why are you giving aid to them\" fashion. At 20, having graduated from college and enrolled in grad school, I had so much to learn from her, a high school drop out. I love the make it through poverty story as much as the next person and admire those who manage day to day on very little resource. But putting poverty on a pedestal - as in you are so lucky to have something other than cancer to worry about - is romanticizing. Life has challenges, cancer is life threatening, no one needs poverty slathered on top. I am glad you write...we can rarely understand each other if we do not. I forgive the oncology nurse. She (mistakenly in my opinion) thought her job was to protect the oncologist rather than serve the patients. She thought talking to a patient meant she understood their disease. She had also failed to listen to my report that the automated blood pressure reading device was off - or it did not accurately read my BP. The doc \"heard\" me and ordered a manual reading - what do you know, 30 points less. The docs are top in their fields locally and are very receptive of my input. The techs are caring and advocated for the patients. The nursing staff, not so much. I go for the docs I astound myself when standing up to medical folks telling me how I feel and what treatments I MUST have. I am not confrontational by nature. Thanks for being you!",
