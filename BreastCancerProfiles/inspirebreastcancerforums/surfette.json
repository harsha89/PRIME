    "Content": "I don't trust portals which frequently have incorrect information. Trying to get a drug I took 3 years ago for a colonoscopy removed from my \"Daily Medications\" list has been downright impossible. I also despise filling out online questionnaires that don't allow for nuances such as taking medications \"as needed\" rather than on a daily basis. And there's nothing worse than logging in and seeing symptoms you've never complained about as part of your medical record because there was no adequate way of fitting your triangular symptom into their rectangular box. I'm fed up with computerized everything; it's just part of the dumbing down of society.",
