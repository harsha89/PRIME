      "Content": "C4, Karin, Steven, Spitfire. I have pain but because of all the up and down talk about steroids, and they may be these be banned in the future. I elected to stay off opioids, I elected to not get them. I am allergic to all medications doctors have put me on. also, gluten, histamine releasing foods, acidic foods, joint inflammation foods, etc. a long list when you add all up. I cannot take even aspirin or Ibporforn. so, what can I do to cut cost and pain level? I had acupuncture but don't last long, the treatments that are used. I studied a Japanese procedure called Shiatsu. another called pressure therapy. I bought books, studied them then uses them on pains areas. also, use cold or heat pacs. you can find books online or at used items stores, etc. for most things there is a way ought though sometimes it takes years to find out. hugs, love, grandpa Walt.",
