      "Content": "\"....The Point that I have been trying to make is that if BIG PHARMA Researchers (and they are the only ones who have the Money and are Advocated by our Corrupt Governments) would have been Researching to find \"CURES\", instead of Drugs, we would have Far Less Diseases Today and Much Healthier People. ......... there is More Disease today than decades ago! \" ****************************** Pharmaceutical companies' research has to do with the development of drugs -- not scientific research. The largest funding source for biomedical research in the world, is the U.S. medical research agency - the National Institutes of Health. To see areas of NIH funded research and how they've led to improvements in treatment, diagnosis and prevention, see: https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/impact-nih-research/our-health I don't think there is \"more disease today than decades ago\" as you claim -- at least not in the U.S. Because of vaccines, diseases like polio no longer occur in the U.S. and smallpox has been completely eradicated. In the U.S. people are living longer. With NIH funded research and advances in prevention and treatment, deaths from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, have declined in the U.S.",

To do so, when making a post, go down to the bottom of that page and click on members only. If a post has inadvertently been posted as public and the poster wants to change it to member, click on 'edit' at the top of the original post. I prefer to share my personal experiences on a members only discussion and have asked members to change a public discussion to members. Most are agreeable to make the change.",
