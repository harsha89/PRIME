    "Content": "THank you for sharing your story. I too am in the role of husband/caregiver to my wife who was diagnosed with BC in October 2017 and is on chemo currently. I relate to alot of what you are going thru as a caregiver. It is clear that the workplace needs to change its perspective in order to keep good employees, attract employees, and be a supportive member of the fight. When work does not consider the fact that employees can't just separate family life from work so easily, it becomes an even greater burden and worry for an already immensely difficult situation. Bosses out there, employers out there, please change the paradigm of the workplace you can control, be more supportive and the rules can be changed; there needs to be more flexibility for family issues; the job is very important for benefits and income and can break a person's already fragile mind who is caring for a loved one. BE THE CHANGE YOU WISH TO SEE IN THE WORLD! be more empathetic to people , knowing that your support as an employer and boss could mean the difference in keeping a great worker , and helping save the life of another human being. I am very sorry to hear that your boss fired you after all the years you gave to the company. Keep you faith, and God Bless You and your situation.",
