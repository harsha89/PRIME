    "Content": "Hello Dr.Lim, Thank you so much for taking the time from your busy schedule to answer questions. Would you consider abemaciclib as a mono therapy for someone with ER +, PR/HER2 - disease with an RB1 deletion for whom Ibrance/faslodex didn\u2019t work at all? It seems that there are differing opinions on this and I am wondering whether abemaciclib might still be an option for me under the circumstances. Best wishes",
