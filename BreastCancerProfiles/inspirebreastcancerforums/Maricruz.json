    "Content": "I'm really missing my rheumatology Dr who took care of me for over 12 years, she was calling me every 3 months, giving me information on new meds and asking if I was interested in trying, she was out sick for about 9 months, but when she returned things changed, I don't think she was feeling well, because she left last month. Is very hard not to have a good Dr to trust and feel comfortable with.",
