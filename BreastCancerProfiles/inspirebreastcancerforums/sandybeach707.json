    "Content": "I have had a kind of opposite situation, and its not so rare, but it left me feeling very uneasy and angry actually. My PCP has been my Dr for 6 years. I didn't use her so much for EDS related stuff as just for flu, strep, and that sort of thing as I already had my specialists that I see. I filed for disability though in 2014 and am still trying to get approved so that situation has been hell! I also kept being told that I needed more input from my PCP, even though she wasn't the one to give me regular treatments etc. Anyway, when I tried to have a conversation with her that I needed her to write me a letter for SSDI court and just explain some how all these things affect me and tie it all together, she flat out told me that she didn't want to be my Dr anymore and just gave me the last appts's notes. That its obvious that I am uncomfortable with her, and need to look elsewhere. Well, she is right that I am uncomfortable with her, because twice she had me crying because I couldn't afford to come in and do all the things that she wanted me to because of the SSDI case, and no income, and we had just talked about my depression, but she still yelled at me and made me cry for goodness sake! I was ill at the time too! But, I needed her desperately to let the courts know just what a living hell I have been through trying to get approved, and nowhere else to turn. Can't get medical care if you don't have money! Anyway, I grieve that she was my Dr for so long, but just because it was going to involve her actually spending more than 5 minutes with me, and maybe even caring a little bit about me, that she could just dismiss me like that. The government ( and other Drs ) do that all too well as it is. Sorry, I know that's not the gist of this question, but its grieving none the less. We all need someone to champion for us, and I just have never found that person for me except my geneticist. I have just yesterday been turned away by my therapist after 2 years too because of insurance stuff that is happening to another client of hers, but has her worried it will happen in my case too, even though I really need her help, and what she fears may not even happen! I understand that position she is in as far as needing to be paid, but also don't understand what the insurance company gets away with in cheating their customers either! Its all grieving.....I surely would rather be healthy and working than going through this stuff :(",
