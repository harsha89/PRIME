    "Content": "John The article focused on the financial aspect of healthcare but will this collaboration also focus on changing the patient/doctor/caregiver relationship? My biggest health challenges have been doctors still taking on a god complex. I\u2019ve been an advocate for my health and have found a health team who are partners in my health but it took 4 years to get here. What about the patient who no longer has that voice? My oldest son has a severe affliction with schizophrenia and can not be an advocate for himself. HIPPA stalls many of my efforts. So my ultimate concern is changing the dynamic between practitioner and client. Is this one goal for this partnership? Thank you for your time, have a wonderful day",
