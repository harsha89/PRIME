    "Content": "Hi, Dr. Lim I have a question about pseudocirrhosis. The short story is that 2 months ago, I had a new liver nodule on CT scan, possibly fibrosis or steatosis, but metastatic CA could not be ruled out. Three days ago, I had a follow-up CT scan, the report of which is: \u201cThe diffuse nodular appearance of the liver is unchanged in appearance from the prior study. Findings represent pseudocirrhosis. No focal mass is identified.\u201d The impression: \u201cNo CT evidence of metastatic disease within the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Stable osseous sclerotic lesions within the thoracic vertebral bodies.\u201d My oncologist appeared relieved. She continued me on my current treatment (Ibrance 125 mg, Faslodex 500 mg) with plan for routine CT follow up in Jan 2019. I should know better than to do this, but when I got home I googled \u201cpseudocirrhosis.\u201d OMG, I\u2019m ordinarily a calm, level-headed person who gets high marks for grace and equanimity, but what I read about pseudocirrhosis blew me away. For instance, Dr. Jame Abraham of Cleveland Clinic said this: \u201cSo this is about 82 patients we looked at, again metastatic patients with breast cancer, and so the striking things are once a patient has a diagnosis of hepatic pseudocirrhosis the overall survival is really short. In 3 months or so, 3.6 months, the patients die.\u201d (https://www.practiceupdate.com/content/sabcs-2017-an-update-on-h...) I have never had any kind of catastrophic response to my diagnosis of breast cancer. Even when it became metastatic and my (sweet and compassionate) oncologist got teary-eyed while giving me the news, I was fine. I told her I regarded it as just another crappy chronic condition that I\u2019d have to try to stay ahead of. And then I had my first dose of Faslodex while waiting on insurance authorization of Ibrance. This was in August 2017. I\u2019ve done well and I\u2019d probably still be doing well if I hadn\u2019t gone to the Internet in search of information on pseudocirrhosis. Dr. Lim, I already know that I\u2019m not going to die in 3.6 months, but is pseudocirrhosis really the serious, life-threatening complication as suggested in the literature? Thank you so much for being here to answer our questions! Pam This is my backgound info: General: Per my rheumatologist, \u201cThis is a very nice 60-year-old female with history complicated by PBC, Sjogren\u2019s, adrenal insufficiency, RA/psoriatic arthritis and metastatic breast cancer.\u201d I also have steroid-induced hyperglycemia (stable on metformin) and paroxysmal complete heart block, asymptomatic s/p dual chamber pacemaker. Re. my PBC (primary biliary cholangitis): Jan 2003: liver biopsy, stage 3 fibrosis, grade 4 inflammation. Partial treatment response to Urso. Over time, alk phos consistently 2-3x normal with mildly to moderately elevated transaminases. Most recent Fibroscan in 2017 suggested (stable) stage 3 disease. Began obeticholic acid (Ocaliva 5 mg daily) in August 2017. Most recent LFTs terrific for me: ALP 85, ALT 38, AST 47, total bili 0.6, albumin 3.4, platelets 136K. Re. my breast cancer: July 2014: invasive ductal carcinoma with micropapillary features; right breast, 2.5 cm, ER 100%, PR 20%, Her2-. Pathology: lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, micrometastasis in 1 of 3 right axillary lymph nodes. August 2014: Bilateral mastectomy with tissue necrosis on the right. 7 weeks of daily dressing changes with apparent slow but steady healing before development of seroma. Interventional radiology drained 150 cc of fluid that cultured MRSA. Treated with oral antibiotics, referred for chemo in November 2014. First chemo cancelled when baseline labs showed alk phos of 801 with transaminases 4-5 times normal. Alk phos down to 600 a week later and hepatologist gave OK for chemo. Four cycles of Taxotere and Cytoxan complicated by SIRS necessitating hospitalization after 1st infusion, pneumonia after 3rd infusion, hand-foot syndrome, neuropathy, etc. I was a \"trooper\" and plowed through chemo without dose reductions. Subsequently started on letrozole. Re. pneumonia after 3rd cycle of chemo: CT scan obtained 01/21/2015 showed 1 cm opacity in right middle lobe, ground glass nodules in right upper and lower lobe. Follow up CT scan in 2016 stable. Subsequent CT scan in June 2017 showed interval increase in mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Bronchoscopy with lymph node biopsy: metastatic breast cancer, ER 100%, PR 20%, Her2-. PET scan clear despite biopsy proven mets to intrathoracic lymph nodes. Started Ibrance and Faslodex in August 2017. Labs stable, no dose reductions. Currently on day 3 of 15th cycle. CT scan results pertinent to the liver 1/21/2016: The liver is upper limits of normal in size. The left hepatic lobe is asymmetrically enlarged. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. No focal hepatic lesions are identified. The hepatic vasculature is patent. Findings compatible with mild cirrhosis without evidence of biliary ductal dilatation. 6/26/2017: The liver is normal in size and nodular in contour, similar to prior. No focal hepatic lesions are seen. 11/08/2017: Nodular contour of the liver consistent with cirrhosis of the liver. Heterogeneous enhancement of the liver most notable in the right lobe could represent underlying metastatic disease versus secondary to cirrhosis and abnormal perfusion. The portal and hepatic veins are patent. 02/20/2018: Stable nodular liver contours, no suspicious lesion identified; differential considerations include cirrhosis (related to known PBC) versus pseudocirrhosis in the setting of treated liver metastases. No changes of portal hypertension. 05/16/2018: The liver is diffusely nodular in appearance and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement within the right hepatic lobe, unchanged from prior. The hepatic vessels are patent. 08/08/2018: There is redemonstration of a nodular liver surface contour. There is a newly appreciated focal hypoattenuating nodule within segment IVb (axial 123). Ill-defined area of peripheral hyperattenuation inferiorly within segment 6 is likely perfusional. There are no distinct focal liver lesions. 10/10/2018: The diffuse nodular appearance of the liver is unchanged in appearance from the prior study. Findings represent pseudocirrhosis. No focal mass is identified.",
