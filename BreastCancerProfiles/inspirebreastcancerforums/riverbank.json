    "Content": "I can add the healthy diet advice. My diarrhea is so bad that a small handful of grapes can set up hours of running to the bathroom. Yes I would love to eat the way I did before Tarceva and Avastin but I can't. I go really easy on veggies, nuts and fruit, and often eat bread and cheese .People love to tell me how I should eat or ask if I'm doing the Paleo diet.I can't tell them the truth unless I am really close to them. Also someone that I know asked when I got my crazy perm? I told him it grew that way when I lost my long straight hair.He did not get it and really didn't care but I felt sad because I think it's cute and not crazy.",
