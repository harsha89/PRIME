    "Content": "While on chemo I could not concentrate long to read so I had audiobooks which can be put on phone with an app or can get the CD versions. Headphones are good to take for long waits in hospitals or doctors. Giving bottles of water is good because they are so heavy to lift & get into house & or get from a store. Handy to have next to bed through the night. Also straws so to get more fluids down! Offer to help someone start a blog site or a fund start online, through community or church. Errands can be hard to finish and drivers needed for surgery. Offer to help while letting patient take a nap from visitors or answer calls for them while he/she sleeps. Shower/bath chair is good for some though the suction cup handles help getting in and out. I only needed a handle on wall while I showered. They make great gifts. A husband pillow or support pillow to elevate upper torso/head for lung cancer patients. Acid reflux is common effect from many therapies. Gifts of massages or gentle yoga or acupuncture therapies can bring relief fo some but ask first.",
