      "Content": "\"Last August/early September the guillotine was dropped and suddenly, after 18 years being on the same dosage except up on pill after 6 years, I am having my pain meds cut back and they can no longer see me after next visit [get another doctor if you can find one]\" This happened to me after 6 years on time-release Oxycontin. Just one day they closed the office, no longer in business. The nearest pain clinic is over an hour away and is not taking new patients. So I took it as a sign and got off Oxycontin. Very interesting and painful journey, to say the least. Much will be written about getting off opioids, much will be said about doctors and pain management but the bottom line is, we seem to have lost control of our own treatment because of government regulations. The bad guys seem to have won this fight. Tapering off of opioids is a hellish endeavor, to say the least and to those of us who have done it! I say \"congratulations, you are stronger than you believe!\" Meanwhile, we still have our pain to deal with and to conquer. And now without meds. Thank you for writing your column, I look forward to reading more from you in the future.",
