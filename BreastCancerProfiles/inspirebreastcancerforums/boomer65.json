      "Content": "So sad to hear the negative comments concerning other forms of treatments. My family has had 3 members fight cancer without victory and one is fighting colon cancer as you speak. All the wonderful statements about advances in fighting cancer really don't truly say outcomes are still very poor but with additional money and years of trials a cure can be found. If any type of hope gives one the strength to keep fighting that can be a good thing and should not be so put down as these comments have done.",

      "Content": "Onthemark, Dnwlke and fighterm thanks so much for the smack down COMMENTS, where do you find my family has not done research, spoken with and investigated more than a second opinion in developing a course of treatment and utilized two teaching centers and a specialized cancer center in our fight. I am very happy our doctors have always been open minded and supportive of actions which bring hope into the treatment, not quack or voodoo medicine. Advances in medicine does come from good research but ideas are formed from observation, insight and treating patients with hope and respect. Hope your journey is successful .",
