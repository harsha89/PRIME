      "Content": "That surgery does sound like it's not very promising. Thank you, CCT, for all the info. JZ, When you were at therapy did the idea of raising the foot of the bed come up? There are ready made \"risers\" that elevate it about 5 or 6 inches so your legs are above your heart. I would sort of like to try that but I'd need to get a car jack to lift the bed up. I don't want to get a hernia in the process of mattress juggling.",
