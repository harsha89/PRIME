    "Content": "My partner also does not want any unsolicited advice and he feels overwhelmed with all the suggestions of what healthy food to eat etc etc. He also wants to switch off and not talk about cancer all the time. Like Josisgoing180 I felt INFURIATED when an insensitive close friend not so subtly implied that our healthy lifestyle (mostly vegetarian plus my partner is active he loves activities-biking, running, hiking to name a few) is for nothing because he got cancer!!! The thing is, my partner loves doing these things. It relaxes him. It's not for nothing!!!",
