    "Content": "I think security should be tighter. One thing I observed in Portsmouth, Ohio was that anyone could walk in off the streets and go straight to a patient\u2019s room. Where I get treated in Florida, there is only one way in and visitors must show ID\u2019s and get a new one made for that day, only. All other doors remain locked and you can\u2019t just wonder in off the street without getting stopped. Guards will stop you without a hospital ID. As a patient, I like that.",
