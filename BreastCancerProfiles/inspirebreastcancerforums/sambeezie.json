      "Content": "We did twelve rounds of weekly Taxol. We practiced a modified fasting diet based on USC/Longo protocols to mitigate side effects. In the end, my wife had some cognitive setbacks, two-day diarrhea (infusion day and day after) each week, and massive hair loss. She was not sure at onset whether she wanted to do the whole three months, so she declined the port; we had no problems with IV site complications. The main thing I wish they'd emphasized in teaching is that the side effects are CUMULATIVE. Even if you sail through the first few sessions, plan on managing (or enduring) some significant (and personally inconvenient) side effects before you're done. Wishing you safe passage and NED, Sam",

      "Content": "1)Our oncologist suggested the Longo diet to mitigate side effects during my wife's industrial-grade chemo. It seems like she was not as sick as some friends during the course of infusions. Still, our goal was to dodge \"chemo brain\", and it's not clear that happened.. 2)The initial phase of tx for us was \"targeted therapy\", a comination of Letrozole and Kisqali. Six months later, we did not (nor did our surgeon) see any benefits from that (expensive) course of drugs. I'll always wonder if the boatload of supplements we took concurrently somehow sabotaged things. Sam",
