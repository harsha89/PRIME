      "Content": "Dear Sunflower, I live in the Asheville area. I am 5 years out from a double mastectomy, chemo, and radiation. My treatment was through Mission hospital. They provided me with copies of the pathology reports immediately following surgery. I have blood work every six months that includes tumor markers. My onocologist reviews the results and relays the information to me. This tracks the possibility of recurrence. I trust my oncologist and team to provide me with the most updated information available to make informed decisions. They have not failed me so far. I hope you can seek the same confidence in your onocologist and medical team. I am on anastrozole for ten years with minimal side effects. Waiting for answers is the hardest thing to go through. Hang in there. This site is a great resouce for any answer you are seeking. The Mission Cancer Center can provide you with multiple resources also. I wish you the best. My thoughts are with you.",

      "Content": "The fear of it all and having to wait can be quite consuming. Just take a deep breath and hit this head on. You can do this! Take one day at a time and continue to move forward. Small preparations like having a comfortable chair to relax in after surgery, easy meal preps, and books or movies on hand to help you relax. I am keeping you in my prayers. This site will add much comfort. Please post updates.",
