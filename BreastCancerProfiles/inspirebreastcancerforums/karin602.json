    "Content": "I recently fell and shattered my left femur neck requiring a partial hip replacement. The pain was severe and needed opioid pain meds every 4 hours for a couple weeks. In the nursing home for rehabilitation one of the nurses was so adversarial about giving me a pill. Mind you I was allowed 2 pills but only asked for 1. Then after getting back home my primary prescribed an opioid so I could get relief at night. Said to take 3 tylenol morning and noon and 2 with the opioid at night. Getting thr prescription filled was s nightmare. The insurance had to have documentation from the doctor and then said it had to be reviewed. Fortunately I had some from the nursing home. After waiting a week and still no word from insurance I talked the pharmacist into letting me just pay for them. He originally said no but then relented. I no longer take them, still have some pain at night but can manage without them. When will these people realize we're not dope fiends but have legitimate reasons for taking these opiods.",
