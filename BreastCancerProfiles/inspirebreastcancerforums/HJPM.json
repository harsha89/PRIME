    "Content": "Hello, I was diagnosed with Stage 1 BC 13 1/2 years ago(2005), had a modified radical mastectomy on the left side only and followed with 5 yrs of Tamoxifen and did very well. After the 5 years, I stopped Tamoxifen and did not do Arimidex because the risks did not out way the benefits at the time. Then 3 years later(2010), I was diagnosed with a reoccurrence of the original cancer and was treated with radiation and started Arimidex. All were ER+ HER2-. Then in 2013, my CA27-29 levels increased, I had scans and they found one very small lesion in my pelvis which they were barely able to biopsy but it came back positive but unable to accurately type. I was started on Ibrance/Faslodex and Xgeva. I did 15 months of this but my levels did not go down. I was switched to Verzenio which I did not tolerate after 2 weeks. Repeat scans before the change still had the location \"lighting up\". I was then placed on Afinitor and Exemestane (and Xgeva) which caused my CA27-29 levels to almost go to normal (52) but now they are going back up (slightly over 100 last month). My oncologist wants to change to Xeloda now. The newest scans are not totally back to normal but are better (it took over 2 years for a rib I broke in an bathroom slip accident to almost disappear from the scans. I feel like I am chasing a number. I am still active, work 40 hours a week and feel almost normal. I don't want IV chemo but I am willing to do oral, IM or SQ. I don't have too much of a support system at home since it is only my disabled husband and me and I care for him (he isn't able to care for me). Any suggestions on what to do next or new drugs that might help or new protocols. (PS I am a pharmacist so nothing scares me other than not being able to function.) Harriet",
