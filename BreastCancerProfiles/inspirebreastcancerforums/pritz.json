    "Content": "Starlightsqad, I am so sorry! I wonder the same about my diagnoses. In October 2010, I found a peach pit sized mass, that did not show up on mammogram since I had dence breast tissue. I went in for an ultrasound and they said it was a cyst, come back in 6 months to see if it changes in size. In April 2011, I felt a small, pea sized lump right next to the \"peach pit\" sized lump. I called to schedule the ultrasound and was told I had to wait 4 weeks (insurance wouldn't cover if it was less than 6 mo) and scheduled appt for May. Turns out the ultrasound tech found the small pea sized cyst, and did not detect the peach pit. I had microscopic envasion of my lymph nodes, so they recommended chemo. Had they caught this 6 mo earlier, it may not have spread to my lymph nodes and I wouldn't have needed chemo. Today I am thankful to be cancer free, but am frustrated with the after affects of treatment I am living with today. I know it \"could be worse\", but that's doesn't make it go away. Wishing you all the best. Pam",
