    "Content": "The way many doctors tell a patient that they have cancer has angered me. As a two time cancer survivor I have experience both good and bad. I feel that it is wrong to tell a patient his diagnosis over the phone, it should be done face to face, in a medical setting, in the most compassionate way so the doctor can explain your condition and how they plan to treat it. You can not predict how a person will react to this type of news. Many people when they hear the work \"cancer\" see it as a death sentence. Many people blame the patient for their disease, you should have done this, you should have done that, you should have not done this, it's your own fault. Personally I have kept my cancer diagnoses to myself or to people who are close to me and have a need to know. I do not need pity or sadness from uninformed people who see you as the walking dead. These people will often avoid you because you make them aware of their own mortality.",
