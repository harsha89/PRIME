      "Content": "I recently felt a lump in my right breast. I went to the gyno and he thought it was a cyst. I got a mammo and then a ultrasound. The radiologist came in and said there is a 2cm suspicious mass and it needs a biopsy but she said she wanted to prepare me because it was going to come back as cancer. She said it is very deep and cant tell if it is hitting the muscle. I am currently waiting for an apt to get a biopsy. I normally have a mammo every year but last year I did not because of other family issues. I'm so scared it spread. Are there any ways to tell if it spread? I know I have to wait but it is driving me crazy. I cant even tell my mom because she is going through chemo for lung cancer and this would devastate her.",
