    "Content": "Hello Everyone I am new to posting but I really feel I need advice from someone who has had this same or similar diagnosis. My original Breast Cancer diagnosis was intracystic papillary carcinoma low grade. I had a lumpectomy 2 cm it came back clean except underneath the sample there was DCIS non cancerous lesions. So my surgeon wanted to go back in and take a little more out so we did and it came back again with a lot more non cancerous lesions. Now they want me to consider a mastectomy and they want to test to see how likely it is the cancer will come back, and at that point I may want to consider chemo. Originally I did not want any rad, meds or chemo my surgeon tells me all the time your not going to die from this cancer and it's very slow growing but just in case we left any cancerous cells behind you may want to consider it. I am thankful it's not worse but I feel it doesn't matter what stage you are (except maybe 0) they still treat all the same rad, meds and chemo. I can't have a 3rd lump. because he wants me to have rad. and if I did, that will deform my breast even more then they said it's is extremely hard to have reconstruction after that. I feel like I don't have a choice other than do nothing and watch things carefully or go radical and have a mastectomy. I go to the Oncologist tomorrow I can almost predict what she's going to say. I wish the surgeon would have told me that before I had the second surgery that there is a possibility that they may have to go in 2 or 3 times to get everything and radiation can at that point deform your breast I probably would not have opted for the 2nd, surgery. I would probably have asked for radiation after the first lump then my breast wouldn't have been so deformed and I wouldn't have to have a mastectomy! CRAZY they are not giving enough info to the patients upfront. I did a lot of research but that was the first time I had heard that. And why are they not letting you sit down with the oncologist and plastic surgeon to get all options before they start surgeries and treatments? Hope someone has some advice. Thanks",
