    "Content": "In order to cure any disease, you will need to know the root cause, just ask you oncologist about it, you will know how much luck is on your side. Also your body, your internal being, is a reflection of your external world, aka your life. There is no way to cure cancer if you live the same life before and after you cancer diagnosis, eat a different diet, exercise, quit the stressful job, divorce the spouse who make you unhappy, move into the nature if you can afford... change is the only way to survive, plus detoxification...
