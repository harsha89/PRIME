For instance, those with diseased livers produce much more lymph and can have lymphedema symptoms. I understand how diuretics can cause a flare up of swelling and as such alcohol and caffeine can be triggers, but it is not thought that alcohol plays a role in lymphedema progression (at least within the moderate drinking range). What do you think about alcohols contribution and the contribution of the liver? Specifically, after drinking and while the liver is busy metabolizing alcohol, what is the livers contribution to lymphatic production and flow? Less or more than normal?",

Compared with patients who performed no/less exercise, patients who exercised following a diagnosis of cancer were observed to have a lower relative risk of cancer mortality and recurrence and experienced fewer/less severe adverse effects. https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article-abstract/39/1/71/3760392 2 Physical activity, risk of death and recurrence in breast cancer survivors: A systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies meeting recommended physical activity guidelines (i.e. ≥ 8 MET-h/wk) post-diagnosis (HR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.38\u20130.76, p < 0.01; and HR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.50\u20130.90, p < 0.01, respectively). http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/0284186X.2014.998275 3 Exercise and Prognosis on the Basis of Clinicopathologic and Molecular Features in Early Stage Breast Cancer: The LACE and Pathways Studies Overall, our data indicate that the benefit of exercise on breast cancer-specific outcomes differs on the basis of tumor characteristics. http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/early/2016/08/0... 4 Dose-response Effects of Aerobic Exercise Among Colon Cancer Survivors: A Randomized Phase II Trial Conclusion Higher volumes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, up to 300 minutes per week, are feasible, safe, and elicit favorable changes in prognostic biomarkers among patients recently treated for stage I to III colon cancer. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1533002816301682 Organ-Specific Physiological Responses to Acute Physical Exercise and Long-Term Training in Humans Liver, Pancreas, and Gut The Effects of Acute Exercise Blood flow can, however, be reduced to as low as 20% of its resting value http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/29/6/421 Effect of aerobic exercise on tumor physiology in an animal model of human breast cancer We hypothesized that exercise would inhibit breast cancer growth and progression. In contrast to existing clinical epidemiological data, we found breast tumors grew at comparable rates in exercising and sedentary animals. An intriguing finding in our study was that exercise significantly increased intratumoral perfusion/vascularization and hypoxia relative to sedentary control counterparts. It is well-established that the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in solid tumor progression and metastatic dissemination (37) It is also noteworthy that the abnormal vasculature and resulting hypoxia also pose a formidable barrier to the delivery and efficacy of systemic (e.g., chemotherapy) and locoregional (i.e., radiotherapy) anticancer therapies (29). As such, the application of exercise to improve the therapeutic index of these treatments (i.e., a therapy sensitizer) may also be plausible. In summary, aerobic exercise can significantly increase intratumoral vascularization, leading to \u201cnormalization\u201d of the tissue microenvironment in human breast xenografts implanted in animals fed a high-fat diet. Although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not known, such findings may have important implications for inhibiting tumor metastasis and improving the efficacy of conventional cancer therapies. http://jap.physiology.org/content/108/2/343 Blood flow responses to mild-intensity exercise in ectopic vs. orthotopic prostate tumors; dependence upon host tissue hemodynamics and vascular reactivity In this study, we investigated the location effects of exercise on tumor blood flow, vascular reactivity, and host tissue interactions in two commonly used models of prostate cancer, ectopic and orthotopic. Given the advancing field of exercise oncology and the prescription of aerobic exercise therapy in cancer patients, this study will establish several key facets of the tumor environment at rest and during exercise. During exercise an enhanced sympathetic nerve activity elicits local release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which can bind to α-adrenergic receptors on the vascular smooth muscle and, subsequently, induce a vasoconstriction in inactive tissues (e.g., splanchnic organs, skin, adipose, etc.). The degree of vasoconstriction in these tissues depends largely upon autonomic innervation, α-adrenergic receptor density, and the magnitude of sympathetic outflow, which is nonuniform at the onset of exercise (18). Thus the extent of vasoconstriction is tissue specific [i.e., different responses in skin, muscle, and viscera (3, 18)] and collectively \u201cshunts\u201d blood flow to metabolically active tissues (e.g., heart, brain, bone, respiratory and skeletal muscles). Conclusion Exercise oncology is a rapidly developing field with many studies using preclinical animal models to characterize treatment outcomes and alterations in the tumor microenvironment, with the majority of studies using ectopic models (8). In addition to the potential inability of ectopic models to recapitulate tumor/stroma interactions of the original host, the present results clearly demonstrate altered hemodynamics during rest and mild-intensity exercise, with directionally opposed results between the same tumor type grown at different anatomical sites. Specifically, we observed a net hyperemic response in the orthotopic tumor and a reduction in blood flow to the ectopic tumor with exercise. These differences in flow were not dependent upon the tumor arteriolar responses to NE as this was severely diminished in tumor vessels from either location. Such substantial changes in blood flow during exercise (and daily O2 delivery from differences at rest) may partly explain why orthotopic models, in general, are better predictors of clinical success with experimental treatments than ectopic models (10, 31). http://jap.physiology.org/content/121/1/15 5 Survival Benefit of Exercise Differs by Tumor IRS1 Expression Status in Colorectal Cancer In conclusion, the positive association of post-diagnosis physical activity with CRC patient survival may be stronger for tumors with IRS1-negative/low expression than for tumors with IRS1-high expression. http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4747829 6 Exercise Decreases and Smoking Increases Bladder Cancer Mortality individuals who reported any exercise were 47% less likely to die of bladder cancer than \u201cno exercise\u201d. Compared with never-smokers, current and former (HRadj, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.50-5.79; P = .002) smokers were 4 and 3 times more likely, respectively, to die of bladder cancer. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1558767316303421 6 Lifetime physical activity and cancer incidence\u2014A cohort study of male former elite athletes in Finland The overall cancer incidence was lower in athletes, 50% lower among middle-distance runners The incident rate of lung cancer among athletes was 60% lower and kidney cancer 80% lower. Hazard ratio for former athletes for lung cancer was 0.29 and after adjusting for smoking 0.61. Conclusions Former male elite athletes evidently have less cancer than men on the average. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1440244013004702 Is immunosenescence influenced by our lifetime \u201cdose\u201d of exercise? Best guess is that there is a u-shaped curve where 1 to 3 times the recommended exercise dose is thought to provide optimum immunosenescence protection and much less gain for training at volume level of elite aerobic athlete and extreme exercises are no better off than sedentary people. https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-016-9642-z \u201cThe limited evidence to date for exercise preventing, delaying or restoring T cell immunosenescence suggests there is a U-shaped relationship with categories of exercise behaviour (e.g., sedentary, inactive, active, very active, and extremely active; see Fig. 1). In addition, it is likely that in the context of ageing, it is the cumulative effect of behaviour, over a substantial period of the lifespan, which influences the rate or degree of immunosenescence.\u201d Recovery of the immune system after exercise Some data. Looks like intense exercise results in temporary neutrophilia and can result in lymphopenia with NK cells, γδ T cells, and CD8+ T cells preferentially relocated out of the blood into peripheral sites of potential antigen encounter, such as the lungs or the gut. \u201cThe general trend during exercise recovery is that short bouts of moderate-intensity exercise have little effect on (or might even enhance) cellular immune function, whereas prolonged bouts (>1.5 h) of heavy exertion appear to reduce the normal functioning of all major immune cell subtypes.\u201d http://jap.physiology.org/content/122/5/1077 Frequent participation in high volume exercise throughout life is associated with a more differentiated adaptive immune response This abstract I think says high volume exercises exacerbates immunosenescence, but at the same time says may result in higher frequencies of killer NK cells \u201cIn the lymphocyte compartment, athletes had higher frequencies of NK-cells and CD8+ T-lymphocytes\u201d http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159113005990 EFFECTS OF MAINTAINED INTENSE EXERCISE THROUGHOUT THE LIFE ON THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE IN ELDERLY AND YOUNG ATHLETES found that \"Exercise induced higher frequencies of NK, B lymphocytes and CD8+ T cells, whereas CD4+ T lymphocytes showed significant lower levels in the elderly athletes\" http://bjsm.bmj.com/content/47/10/e3.16.short Two FOXP3+CD4+ T cell subpopulations distinctly control the prognosis of colorectal cancers find that CD4+ T cells that express the forkhead box P3 cells and hinder effective immune responses against cancer cells. https://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v22/n6/abs/nm.4086.html Habitual physical activity is associated with the maintenance of neutrophil migratory dynamics in healthy older adults http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159116300447",

All of us have had some exposure to stories, people who have gone through chemo, and we cannot separate this from the decision process. In our effort to avoid chemo therapy (if there is more than one option) because of fear it ravaging our bodies, even if we make data driven decisions, we may unknowingly not have a benefit of chemo therapy not yet well defined. For instance, we all know chemo temporarily crushes the immune system. So that is one reason to not have chemo. But it is well known, for bladder cancer, that downstaging prior to radical cystectomy with neo adjuvant chemo improves survival to the level seen in those with much less invasive cancer. Research is indicating that a reason for this is that it stimulates a anti tumoral induction of the immune system. But if we chose to avoid chemo because of concern we have on it's effect on our body, then we we miss this benefit.

I know your husband wants what is best for you, but I believe he is guilty of what this post is about - personal bias with unintended consequence. You posted earlier that he is researching bladder sparing heavily. Some of this, if not all, I covered in previous responses. Trimodal therapy is pretty well understood and for oncological effectiveness, patient selection is key. The mass. hospital landmark study clearly defines candidates who can have excellent results, but even oncological radiologists who advocate TMT say that patient with compromised renal function ARE NOT candidates. If I am wrong starting chemo should not jeopardize a bladder sparing approach, if the MKS radiologist thinks it is oncologically effective (the agents are similar, can transition). As I mentioned above you posted earlier that your husband has been researching bladder sparing heavily. I am going to be critical here cause I am biased towards life and against cancer. Your husbands quest ends up sowing doubt which you don't need right now. If your husband is a good, unbiased researcher, he should have found by now the landmark study by massachussettes hospital, very heavily cited, which is a near bible, and studies showing renal insufficiency to be a contraindication. Do you have the mass. hospital study in hand to take to the appointment with you? Let me try to explain the article - it is well known that, for muscle invasive bladder cancer, neo adjuvant chemo therapy can reduce residual tumor size prior to radical cystectomy, and for those who have downstaging (lower tumor status from turbt to post cystectomy specimen) survival chances are significantly improved - the reason for this has been thought to be less tumor bulk during surgery, less chance of cell spillage or tumor cells released into bloodstream, and that if the primary tumor responds to tumor any distant occult tumors (not yet detectable) will also - but what this study says is that your immune cells are modified by the chemo and become efficient at killing any residual cancer. so my point with this study is those T2 patients who make a conscious decision to avoid chemo and go straight to surgery, unknowingly then also decide against boosting their immune system and changing their t cells such that they become cancer killers.
