      "Content": "Thank you for your response. I\u2019m glad to hear that your side effects were not to bad. I hope I\u2019m able to say the same. I\u2019m planning on getting a wig prior to losing my hair. I wish I was fortunate to look alright without hair but unfortunately I don\u2019t. I think I\u2019m going to get a synthetic wig this time. I got one with real hair with my prior chemo and I hated the maintenance so I\u2019m hoping this will be a better choice. I guess time will tell with everything. I wish you the best. Susan",

      "Content": "I am 44 and have recently been diagnosed with invasive ductal breast cancer. This is my second primary cancer. I was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma in 2014 and did chemo for a year as part of that treatment. It was a horrible year and nervous, scared and angry that I am going to have to do chemo again. I had a bilateral mastectomy on August 30th and met with my oncologist yesterday to discuss my treatment plan. The plan is for me to do Taxol weekly for 12 weeks and then Herceptin for a year followed by hormone therapy. I just don\u2019t know what to expect and I know that chemo reacts differently for everyone. I have a wonderful oncologist and he took the time to answer questions but now I have more questions since I have had time for it all to sink in. I was wondering how long the infusion time is typically? I am a teacher and would like to continue to work because it is a lot more work to be gone and I had to use so many days for my melanoma treatment and I have to take 4 weeks for my mastectomy surgery that I will have to start to take days without pay. I\u2019m nervous about not being effective at home and work. I\u2019m really nervous about throwing up? Just plain scared. What should I expect with this chemo regimen? Does anyone have any tips.",
