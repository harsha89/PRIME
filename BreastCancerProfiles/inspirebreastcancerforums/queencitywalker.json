      "Content": "Patient centered, not dollar centered. Smaller staff to patient ratio. As rural hospitals disappear, what's to replace local emergency, local wound care, local education, local rehab? As more rural hospitals are the only employers for all the local doctors, where's the focus? I can tell you, from my experience, it's not on prevention, it's not on wellness. Even hospice is run from the local \"health center\" used to be hospital. At a minimum compare your (each) to a COE and see where you could move money around within each to better aid the patient. We all want to have a COE in our neighborhood, but they, for lots of reasons, go to the population density areas. All budgets have flexibility...if someone is looking.",

      "Content": "Well, I don't trust digital record keeping...YET. I can remember the upgrades to technology that left me with stored items I can no longer recover. Yes, the \"cloud\" is a great option with my BUTS. 1) If you live alone as I do and your paperwork is password protected then, in an emergency, for my legal Health Care Power of Attorney(s), a paper file is essential. It's there, no need for a copy to be found, printed. They don't need to keep up with my changes, if there's a file. 2) Hard copy paperwork should, absolutely, come with an index, a table of contents (different) and a summary page updated with only a note (monthly) that there's no change. This insures all KNOW the latest. 3) The table of contents should indicate PAGE # for specific information. All pages should be numbered for easy reference. 4) I agree all digital reports should be kept. I just would \"back them up\" with hard copies so there's ONE complete file. 5) Legal \"stuff\" should also be hard copied. Health Care Power of Attorney(s), Living Wills, DNR, estate (WILL), Insurance paperwork, pre-planned OR NOT burial info, etc. An addendum to the medical needs/reports/prescriptions, etc., and or reference to this legal \"stuff\" should be included. This comprehensive file is, of course, probably not done very often. It's too daunting a project to contemplate unless, as you state you're a \"paper person\" your entire life. But the essentials are possible. Hard copy list of doctor(s) with phone #'s. Hard copy of latest reports. Hard copies of prescription(s) AND pharmacy (including address/phone #). Hard copies of contact list: POA's, family members, etc. A copy of your Health Care Power of Attorney and these contact name/numbers should be in the fridge. Safe place and most first responders have been trained to check the fridge. IF you have a DNR, it should be on the outside of the fridge.",

      "Content": "Thanks for bringing this up for discussion. I, too, agree that if you \"follow the money\" you get to the reason for this testing. I, too, agree that the opportunity for abuse is rampart, even if - technically - not yet fully developed. This will be a divisive discussion as, unfortunately, lots of subjects are these days. I urge civility. I urge all to read to learn, to form, perhaps, multiple views...views dependent on specific situations. Once this bell is rung, it cannot be unrung.",
