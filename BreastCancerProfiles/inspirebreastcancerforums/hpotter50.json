    "Content": "Hello. My name is Herman and I had it done at the University of Chicago by Dr Chen, I think. Been a few years. My right leg would swell so bad that I could not bend it at the knee. He did the transplant as well as some micro surgery on weak vessels in the leg and foot. Mine was so bad as my nurse would say, \"your leg sells up as soon as I take off the wraps\" Since the surgery, I now wear a compression on my right leg and it keeps the swelling down, unless I have been on it and walking a lot that day. It will swell but not near as bad as it did before.It was a long surgery, around 7 to 8 hours. Hope that helps. Let know if you want to discuss further",
