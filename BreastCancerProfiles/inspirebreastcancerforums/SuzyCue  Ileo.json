      "Content": "Is this collaboration going to be limited to this post? The only way I see the collaboration as OK is if people opt INTO it. What are the financial stakes in the agreement? Who would be making money from the arrangement? If our information is used, I think it needs to be made clear if someone profits. I frankly don't want research done on posts I make that I limit to \"members only\". While research is helpful and necessary, I would really like to determine how my info is used. Sorry to sound so negative, but I've been bitten before. Full transparency is a good thing.",

      "Content": "I don't think I would want comprehensive genetics testing--too great a chance for \"mishandling\" of the results. This said, after several sets of iron labs that were high, I had genetic testing for hemochromatosis. I discovered I had a double mutation, so now my relatives know to be tested. It's a pre-existing condition, though. Should my kids have to decide to be tested or not based upon proposed US health care legislation; e.g. do they want the chance of having a \"pre-existing\" condition in their records? Lots of questions around genetic testing.",
