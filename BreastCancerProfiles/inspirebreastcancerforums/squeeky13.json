      "Content": "I am a very private person and have shared my diagnosis with only immediate family and a few friends. My husband, on the other hand feels the need to share everything down to the last hair. I've asked him to not share my personal medical info with anyone so when complete strangers ask me how I'm feeling I am none to pleased. This has caused many disagreements. I have come to understand that he will never get it. I deal with cancer day in and day out. I don't want it to be the main topic of conversation with everyone! Anyone who has not dealt with cancer can not possibly understand so why should I waste my breath? I think the most insensitive thing said to me was after some one asked me how I felt and I truthfully answered \"tired\" was, \"well it could always be worse\". My answer to that question is always \"great\" now.",

      "Content": "I did patient home hospice care for 20 yrs. My first early stage dx, surgery n chemo went smoothly and I continued working but I retired after my stg4 dx also. My onco has always respected my knowledge and we can dicuss treatment options freely. My palliative care doc is an ex co worker so we make a great team when deciding my care. It has been difficult becoming the patient. I don't like it but I have excepted it. I wouldn't stay with an onco who disrespected me. I call the shots and my team knows it. But, I respect my teams knowledge.",
