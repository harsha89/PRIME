I think if you go into your profile, it gives you options to choose how to post: public, members, or Inspire friends...you set up your whole profile and can set up your settings to your specifications...but, I am no expert on any of this...someone else, please share what YOU know...ox",

      "Content": "Errol, I don't think what we write is called a blog, per se because it is not exclusively online...We write monthly columns, Gutsy's Gab that ties ostomy to monthly events humorously and makes stomas STARS...and Gutsy's FAB Gab-About that prints \"stories of ostomy 'glories/gories'!\" almost exclusively shared by Inspire.com \"friends\"...so, how do you or anyone else who may be interested receive these columns, as well as 2 US Phoenix ostomy mag articles on empowerment and naming stoma?...my near 11.11 year old ileostomy Gutsy says to friend us/request we friend you...to exchange emails...to receive these columns/articles... Did YOU name YOUR stoma?...if so, let us know, and he/she could become stoma STAR...or share YOUR story?...once we exchange emails, Gutsy will send you representative sampling of her stuff, including \"Shock\"-tober columns, recently sent to Gutsy's ever-expanding readership...so, whaddya say???...are you in?...ox Linda and Gutsy 8{}...always here for everyone everywhere!...",
