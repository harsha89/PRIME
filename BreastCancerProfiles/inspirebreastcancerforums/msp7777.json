    "Content": "After 6 years of battling TnBC, my mom had 6 months of clear pet scans...only to be diagnosed with Leptomeningeal carcinoma in Jan of this year. She has had 8 treatments intrathcally of methotrexate. She finished treatments two weeks ago. She is currently in rehab, but sleeping most the day. When awake, she is lucid, can talk, express opinions. After being bed ridden for 6 weeks, she is very week. Pt seems uninterested in working with her...several medical staff members continue with the poor prognosis mantra. Her csf did not clear malignant cells from the treatments, but the cells are \u201crare.\u201d She is uninterested in hospital food, so I supplement with smoothies made with avocado,chia seeds, asparagus, spinach, papaya, berries, sweet potato, banana, prune, almond butter, peanut butter, premiere protein shake, and vitamin c powders. Her apetite is good...breathing good, heart good, gi tract is good...but she just seems so sleepy. Any suggestions? Help?",
