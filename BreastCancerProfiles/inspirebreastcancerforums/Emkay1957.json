    "Content": "Small- town Karen, I have been on Anastrozole since 2/17 and have been very tired, also. I did not have chemo or radiation, as I chose to have bilateral mastectomies. My nodes were negative and Mammoprint testing indicated no other treatment was necessary. Except for the Anastrozole. As a full time surgical nurse, I get more than enough exercise in my day. I usually take an hour nap when I get home. Depending on how hard my day was, I might have enough energy to cook a simple meal and/ or do some laundry. My husband is very understanding and helpful. On the weekends, I usually sleep in. He never complains. He such a jewel! But as far as having the energy to clean my house, work in my yard or getting the bathroom painted, it ain't happening! It's frustrating to think about all the things I did and the energy I had prior to my diagnosis. And yes, I do know how blessed I am! I'm also 60, have a beautiful one year old granddaughter and another on the way. I have the best husband ever who loves me dearly. And I'm still here! I will tell you I am taking B 12 injections, which have helped. So, I guess I'll keep doing what I'm doing until my oncologist tells me otherwise. Hang in there. Take naps. As my momma used to say, the dirt will be there when you get around to it!",
