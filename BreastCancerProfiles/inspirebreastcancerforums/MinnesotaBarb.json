    "Content": "I had lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation in 2010. In 2018, I redid genetic testing (now they test for 19 mutations versus 2) and found I have PALB2 mutation. I was told this could increase chance of recurrence or new breast cancer to as much as 50-60%, so I now opted for double mastectomy with reconstruction. Now I am worried about stirring up a recurrence because of the scar tissue from this recent procedure. Anyone else's thoughts or experiences?",
