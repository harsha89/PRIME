      "Content": "Hi Jcu1111, Just wondering if you have any news yet. I certainly recall how excruciating the waiting was. I didn\u2019t have to wait long for the biopsy results but had to wait many weeks for a decision to be reached as to whether I would need chemo. I finally learned that I did need it on Christmas Eve 3 yrs ago. I think Owlgram\u2019s comment about breast cancer not coming in one size fits all is very important to remember. That was certainly news to me when I went through the initial phases of diagnosis, surgery, & treatment. I felt overwhelmingly confused for months with all the options, details, etc. Things will settle down and make more sense to you as time goes by no matter what direction your journey takes you. Despite the challenges and discomforts of chemo, I think those first few weeks post- diagnosis were the hardest. You will most likely learn that there is much cause for hope/optimism and a great deal of encouraging support from the people who provide your medical care. And we are here for you, so let us know how you are doing.",

      "Content": "What day is your appt? It\u2019s totally normal to feel anxious & expecting the worst. If you are like a lot of us, it will be hard to absorb the information you get on that first appt with the surgeon, so be sure to take someone with you who could take some notes and also ask questions. Ask for clarification of anything you don\u2019t understand. Even if you have cancer and even if there has been some spread to lymph nodes, there is still every reason to be optimistic. I have a number of friends who have had some spread to node(s) and after treatment are doing very well years later. I did not have spread to nodes but had a large tumor in a small breast which put me into Stage 2. I\u2019m doing well 3 yrs after diagnosis. Sending encouraging thoughts your way!",

      "Content": "I don\u2019t think it is the norm to have scans or MRIs immediately after surgery and chemo. I had a mastectomy for a large tumor and then chemo but had no positive nodes. I did not have radiation and had no scans or MRIs at the completion of chemo. I was scheduled for a breast study every 6 months, with a mammogram alternating with a breast MRI. Make sure you get the breast MRI at least once a year if at all possible. My understanding is that mammograms are not as effective as breast MRIs in finding any spread, but insurances and Medicare won\u2019t normally pay for more than 1 breast MRI/yr due to cost. At least that was the situation in my case. I\u2019d encourage you to pose your question to your Oncologist and see what she/he says about this important issue. Your situation might be different because of your positive nodes. Best wishes to you!",

      "Content": "When I was diagnosed 3 yrs ago at age 69, I knew next to nothing about BC even though I had had a few friends with it and have a # of drs in my family. I thought BC was BC was BC and had not a clue about all the different types, stages, treatments, etc. After my mastectomy, in our 1st app\u2019t with my oncologist, I was so overwhelmed and confused I didn\u2019t absorb anything! So I started to educate myself through reading and, more importantly, also did what Small-Town-Karen suggested: wrote down my multitude of questions and underlined everything in my surgical & initial diagnostic reports I didn\u2019t understand (which was a ton!!). My subsequent appts w/ my drs and oncology nurse practitioner went MUCH better as my understanding improved. I have Lobular BC, Stage 2 and now actually get what that means! Not that I don\u2019t still sometimes get anxious and fearful as I proceed through my journey, but the information and the great support I get from so many people at my cancer center (and my family/friends) goes a long way in getting me through the challenging times. So just keep asking away !! My very best wishes to you ☮️.",

      "Content": "Hi Neela13, I was diagnosed with Stage 2 lobular (vs ductal) breast cancer in Oct 2015. I was totally asymptomatic, and it was found on routine mammogram. I underwent a right mastectomy and chose to do no reconstruction. I had no lymph node involvement but had a large tumor which necessitated the surgery. I went through 4 cycles of chemo with quite a few side effects. On general principle my wonderful oncologist does not use the term \u201cin remission\u201d for patients only 3.5 yrs out from diagnosis; she prefers \u201ccancer free.\u201d I am on an estrogen blocker, also called aromatose inhibitor, named Exemastane, for at least 10 years because my particular tumor still carries a fairly high chance of recurrence even with surgery, chemo, and the long term treatment. I was also in a clinical study for 8 months but had to be dropped from that due to complications with my blood counts. In regard to follow-up testing: I have 1 mammogram and 1 breast MRI on my remaining breast per year, alternating every 6 months. I have complete blood work every 6 months. I see my oncologist only once a year now and my oncology nurse practitioner halfway through that period. One year after completion of my chemo, I had a scare with some pulmonary symptoms and had lung scans every 3 mos for a year until it was determined that it was not cancer but rather scarring from earlier infections that was being seen on the scans. That was a scary time! Of course I don\u2019t really know enough about your individual case, but I think if I were in your boots (with Stage 2?) I might get a 2nd opinion as to the need for a little closer monitoring. Most competent, caring doctors aren\u2019t offended by that. I don\u2019t know what that would look like since you don\u2019t have a remaining breast to image, but I would at least wonder about having bloodwork. I, like you, really would have liked more aggressive follow-up, but I suspect much of the hesitancy comes from the fact that even insurance plans with good coverage and Medicare won\u2019t cover such testing. I have read about bio-marker tests, but my doctor did not think that was indicated. Wishing you the very best!",
