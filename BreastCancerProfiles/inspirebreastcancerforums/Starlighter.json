      "Content": "I'm very excited about this webinar on the basics of cancer genetics. We can't possibly understand the future of cancer therapies without a basic understanding of the genetics and this applies especially to men with advanced and recurrent prostate cancer. Professor Bill Burhans is a highly experienced lecturer on this topic and he knows how to present his material in an easily understood fashion to those who have little or no scientific background. I'm really looking forward to this!",

      "Content": "Biiru and No5 have both eloquently expressed the need for this type of private, virtual, online call, serving the emotional needs of guys trying to cope with the stigma, the isolation and the side effects of prostate cancer. I know Rich Jackson personally and I couldn't think of a more qualified, compassionate and honest man to moderate this Call. Thank you, Rich, for initiating this service!",
