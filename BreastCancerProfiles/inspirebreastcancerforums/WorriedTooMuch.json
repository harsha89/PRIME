    "Content": "Thank you! During my first bout with cancer, my MD said nothing could be done to improve my counts naturally; she was mistaken. This time, my platelets are unreliable on Ibrance, so I did my own research on platelet-rich foods and was pleased to get some insight. Physicians do not always agree that nutrition and healthy choices can make or break a struggling patient. I live in an underserved area; they didn't even HAVE nutritional counseling. I asked for it many times during my occurrence, remission and recurrence. Thank you for your no-nonsense approach.",
