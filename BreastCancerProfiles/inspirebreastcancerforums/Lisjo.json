    "Content": "Hello, I am currently on carbogem and it seems to be working on my liver mets. I do have bone mets, but they have never bothered me.

I also have morphed into triple negative according to a liver biopsy I had in the spring. I was first diagnosed in 1998. I also had a tram flap done.",
