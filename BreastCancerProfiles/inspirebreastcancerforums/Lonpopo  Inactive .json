    "Content": "I guess we all have our pet peeves about what someone says/does that ticked us off. Mine is, when I said to my sister and brother-in-law that my prognosis is very poor, they responded, \"Well, no one knows when they are going to die.\" Knowing that I most likely will die a not very pleasant death within 5 years (triple negative metastatic breast cancer) is not nearly the same as their not knowing when they will die. I constantly am saddened by the knowledge that I will not be here to see my grandchildren grow up, never mind graduate from elementary school, and about all the things I need to, should and want to do in the very near future. They can think and plan about the future without such limitations and they do. I can't. In no way is it the same. It diminishes our sadness about one of the worst things about cancer-dying from it.",
