      "Content": "Hi Joe, There is a surgeon at MD Anderson who has great success with this surgery and I cannot remember his name but will find out for you. The surgery can work only for the limbs...legs and arms and not for the groin or trunk area. The Physio department at MDA had contacted this doctor on my behalf and since my swelling is in the pubic and trunk area I am not a candidate for the surgery I was also told that if you had the surgery you would have to wear a compression garment for life, but of course without surgery a person would still need to wear a garment Tammy",
