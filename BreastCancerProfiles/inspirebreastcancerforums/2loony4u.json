    "Content": "Thanks for the tips. I am brand new to Inspire and while I am thrilled to have found this site, I do find certain things about it a bit confusing. One question off the top of my head is whether or not we get some sort of notification if someone replies to a comment we make on someone else\u2019s post. If so, where would we find it? For example, you posted the main comment on this topic. I am replying here. If someone chooses to answer my question, how am I notified (so I can be sure to find the response)? Does that make sense? I haven\u2019t posted anything myself yet. I\u2019ve just been reading the posts people write that interest me, along with the various responses. I\u2019ve actually learned a great deal already and have gotten some good advice through the grapevine. I\u2019m in the process of writing a bit about myself right now so that if people go to my main page they can find out a little bit about me. I\u2019m thinking of starting a journal of my own here as well. I like the sense of community here, and the level of support everyone seems to get. Having an invisible disease can be very isolating and it\u2019s wonderful to be connected with others that can relate to what I\u2019m going through. Peace & love, Christine",
