    "Content": "My wife has lost 9 female friends and one sister to cancer so she is the one with experience on how to behave. She never asks the; How are you, What is your prognosis, etc. etc. She asks things like; What is your doctor recommending at this time? for example. Then she visits and feeds the cats and cleans the litter boxes (just an example in one case), runs errands to the grocery store and the dry cleaners and the pharmacy, brings edible treats specific to that friend and then, when the prognosis is the final one, discusses the idea of home hospice & other options based on her experience from earlier friend's situations. She never ever suggests trying this or that treatment and does not assume her friends have become six year olds overnight!",
