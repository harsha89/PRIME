    "Content": "Brian I applaud this initiative. Sharing patient stories offers opportunities for institutions and the people who work in them to improve healthcare and how, and how well, it is delivered to the public. The title \"Experts by Experience\" irks me terribly, however. In this age of the democratization of expertise, where anyone with an opinion or access to Google is an expert in their own mind, legitimizing this foolishness is dangerous, especially in the world of medicine. You need look no further than on this website to see the impact, as experts by experience warn others about the sometimes rare or fictitious side effects, or false dangers, of the drugs prescribed by general practitioners and specialists. I believe my legs ache because of the atorvastatin I'm taking and I'm telling anyone who wants to listen that statins are dangerous, overlooking the fact that I had partial meniscectomies in both knees 10 years ago, I'm 66 years old and I just ran 10km this morning in minimalist shoes. That's expertise by experience. As patients stop taking their medications and physicians shy away from prescribing those mired in specious controversy, such expertise is becoming a public health issue. Like the celebrities-cum-experts in the Hollywood Hills who influenced public opinion about the safety of vaccines, experts by experience have the capacity to harm. Opinions do not represent expertise nor does having an experience, no matter how profound and deep, make one an expert. I'm no expert. This is just my opinion. Ted",
