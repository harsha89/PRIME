      "Content": "I take info from many sources. My husband and I listen to the doctor and do research and then make a choice, if I am well enough to make a choice. In dire circumstances, it is usually a hospitalist I am working with in addition to my husband. I have been especially impressed with all 4 of the hospitalists I have had experience with. Two saved my mother's life and 2 have had a major impact in my survival. The opinions of my 3 children are also very high on my list, but they are very careful about giving advice and rarely do. I appreciate the opinions of many on Inspire and often follow the threads they attach to various research articles.- KLee.",

      "Content": "My oncologist just retired and I will miss him. I only knew him for a year but I really came to like him and he understood my desire to be part of the choices being made in my care. He learned that I like to do research, but also wanted his opinion. My oncologist that retired 9 years ago is back as his substitute, so we are getting to know one another again. I didn't have him long 9 years ago because my treatment was fairly short and he retired after about a year also. My treatment was also divided between surgeon, oncologist , P.A., and radiologist, compared to now, when I see the doctor every month because my cancer has returned.",
