    "Content": "Brian , my mom is on the middle of this decision making process right now. Her small cell lung cancer has progressed. Does she try more treatment or let nature take its course? This decision is so hard on her. She is scared of possible side effects of the treatment as she has some other health issues. When she was first diagnosed last year she was not even sure she wanted to treat but she did end up doing chemo, radiation and pci. I on the other hand wanted treatment ASAP after I got my ovarian cancer diagnosis earlier this year. I wanted that cancer out of me. My only big decision was what doctor to go with and even that was pretty easy as one doctor just made me really comfortable.",
