    "Content": "The more research you do on your own, the more the truth, misinformation and corruption are exposed. Follow big money and the organizations behind decision making and you better understand why our health and health care is not improving. Do you really think you have bad genes? What else do we pass along to out children besides genes? Toxins. What if you had the information to detox, heal, rebuild, would you? Do you think your genes somehow slow nerve transmission? What about toxins in our bodies building up and blocking/slowing nerve function? How does big pharma, AMA, AHA, ACS, govt profit from curing people? It is not profitable to cure so they instead spread misinformation and medicate. What is in your food supply (GMOs, petrochemicals, pesticides, etc), in your medication, vaccines (petrochemicals, metals), on your lawn (glyphosphate) in your water (floride, medications, chlorine..), on your clothes (formaldehyde), cleaning products, air ... And what does your doctor do to remove these from your system? Nothing. Is it a coincidence that animals living in our same environment are dying of all the same illnesses that we are? After thousands of years, suddenly since the industrial revolution everyone has bad genes??? Genetic manipulation sounds like old science, marketing ploy and good way to reap in billions and never have to be accountable for curing anything. Information is out there to cure diseases but you must seek it, take action and commit to a healthy life style:)",
