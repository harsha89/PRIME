    "Content": "#1 is QUIET! I see signs posted such as \"Quiet! Our patients are recovering!\", yet I never hear anyone actually trying to quell the noise in the hallways. Nurses come in with lights blazing, walking 100 MPH, and talking as if it's unusual that the pt would actually be sleeping at 1am. I understand their impatience (lots to do, for sure!) but please try to temper your enthusiasm. A little goes a long way. For my part, I try very hard to always be kind and understanding whenever you give me a little consideration. It's hard when Bouncing Betty yells from 30' outside my door that \"I'M COMING IN, MR STARK! GET READY!\". Sheesh. (Okay, that was a bit of an exaggeration, but that's what it sounds like at 1am!). Otherwise, generally, I love my nurses, cleaning crew, and doctors! They are God's chosen people, for sure!",
