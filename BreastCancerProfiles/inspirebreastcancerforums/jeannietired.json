    "Content": "I so appreciate each of you being so forthright and honest about your feelings and the difficulties of being a caregiver. I have just entered this phase of my life with my husband and you have put to words all of the feelings and concerns that I am experiencing. This is not the life I had planned in our retirement years, yet here we are. I have experienced anger, self pity, and yet I love my husband with all my heart and will be his greatest advocate. It is okay to feel whatever you are feeling.",
