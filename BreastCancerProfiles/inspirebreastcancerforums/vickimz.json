      "Content": "Hi Denzie, TY for replying to my share. My oncologist insists I do not need radiation and I had so much it is highly dangerous. I'll bring it up again when I see her in about 3 weeks. I also fear I have been so stressed I know I am not doing all I can to help myself and I will benefit by more exercise and meditation. Still the void of people in my life is my greatest obstacle. I would benefit by pushing myself to connect with others yet having a tough time. I know no one can help me unless I choose to help myself. This is hard yet again hearing from you truly helped me feel less alone and more inspired. Vicki",

When I am tired I give in versus getting involved which most likely will help boost my ebergy. I just Today switched Hormone blockers from Arimedex to Letrazole. The side effects from Arimedex especially the insomnia and joint, muscle and bone pain became too overwhelming. We all need sleep. Has anyobe else experienced insomnia from Arimedex?",

      "Content": "I developed severe insomnia about 1 year on Arimidex. I was only able to get very little sleep and was therefore exhausted all the time. The quality of my life was vanishing as I had no energy for even small tasks. I shared my problem with my oncologist and she recommended I see a psychiatrist as sleep deprivation is considered a brain disorder requiring psychiatric treatment. I finally saw a great psychiatrist last Friday and have been sleeping throughout the night. I feel like a new woman! Gosh sleep is absolutely vital for quality of life. I suggest you speak with your oncologist as i did and see what they recommend. Best wishes...",

      "Content": "I am not very good at doing positive things for me. When I had 2 other cancers 25 years ago I was just about to give birth(so I had my son 1 month early and he was fine) and my ex husband was still with me I fought like heck and the stage lll b Hodgkin's Lymphoma was cured and thus far the surgically removed malignant melanoma has not reoccurred. I never rebuilt a solid support network after my husband left and then my son. Coping with breast cancer in isolation I am having a tough time pushing myself to do and get involved in alternative healthy activities. I know no one can do this for me yet I stand up and then flop. I have been told my fighting spirit is still within me and keep using the excuse because I am divorced and my only son lives 18,000 miles away I have no reason to go on, a very poor attitude. I feel torn as I realize life is a precious gift and I am choosing to give it up. Struggling between the choice of life and death. I had a bi lateral mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The mastectomy went well yet there was a micromastasis in my sentinel node. I can not have radiation as a site that was previously given radiation can not receive radiation again. My oncologist says hormonal therapy is enough. I was told by my medical oncologist to see if my severe insomnia is caused by the Arimedex and indeed it is. When I say severe with powerful sleep med's I would be awake for 35 or more hours then sleep out of pure exhaustion. (every other day). Now without the Arimedex I have slept for 6 nights in a row. I also noted mood swings I never experienced in my life. Looking for peace, the ability to connect and love others unconditionally and carry on with LIFE. I have joined inspired to listen and learn and hopefully get \"inspired\"to LIVE!!! Edited November 3, 2018 at 1:26 pm",
