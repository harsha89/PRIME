      "Content": "By Radha_Inspire Digital Editor, Inspire Inspire members sometimes poll their communities seeking suggestions for items to include in a care package for someone they know who has cancer. A brief scan of such posts showed revealed some items that members regularly suggest in response. These varied depending on the condition (and personal preferences, of course), but frequent inclusions were: \u2022 A notebook and pencil \u2013 good for journaling, taking notes during doctor visits, keeping a list of questions and concerns to discuss with healthcare professionals, and tracking symptoms, treatments, and side effects \u2022 Comfortable, warm clothes \u2013 pajamas that are easy to put on and take off, socks, fingerless gloves, blankets \u2022 Head covering \u2013 a cap, scarf, or even a wig \u2022 A good hot water bottle or heating pad with a comfortable cover \u2022 Light dressing gown and earplugs for staying in a hospital \u2022 Skin care \u2013 body lotion and lip balm, and note that sensitive people might prefer unscented items \u2022 Cough drops and mints \u2022 An inexpensive chair or stool for the shower \u2022 A list of support groups in their area or online Coffee gift certificates, food, house cleaning, and fun items to pass time like crossword puzzles or magazines also appeared often. If you\u2019d like, please share in a comment what items you have given or would like to receive in a care package. Are any items specific to a certain type of cancer?

      "Content": "By Radha_Inspire Digital Editor, Inspire Dr. James P. Allison of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston Texas and Dr. Tasuku Honjo of Kyoto University in Japan were awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine this morning for their work illuminating how the immune system can be harnessed to attack cancer. Both scientists discovered the importance of blocking certain proteins that keep T-cells from doing their jobs as part of the immune system, including identifying and eliminating diseased cells. Allison\u2019s work focused on CTLA-4 proteins while Honjo\u2019s work involved PD-1 proteins, both of which impede normal T-cell activity. Their work had a direct impact on the addition of immunotherapy to the existing pillars of cancer treatment \u2013 radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. \u201cI was just trying to understand the immune system,\u201d Allison said during a press conference today at the Fourth International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference in New York. The prize \u201cshould give patients hope because we\u2019ve got things that we know work. If this didn\u2019t work there would have been no prize.\u201d \u201cWhen Jim discovered CTLA-4 nobody thought that immunotherapy would be the fourth pillar of how you treat cancer,\u201d said Dr. Jill O\u2019Donnell-Tormey, CEO and Director of Scientific Affairs at the Cancer Research Institute, during the same press conference. This discovery represented a fundamental change in immunology that brought focus not just to the importance of immune system activation but to immunosuppression to combat cancer growth. With enough time and work, \u201cyou can take a basic discovery into the clinic to benefit patients,\u201d she said. Allison also highlighted the importance of careful patient samples stewardship, recalling a graduate school mentor who insisted there is something to be learned from every patient, especially given the scarcity of patients who can participate in trials. \u201cIf you start doing a trial\u2026 whether you get a clinical signal or not, get those samples and study them,\u201d Allison said. \u201cYou can understand something about a [drug combination] by knowing what didn\u2019t happen rather than just discarding it.\u201d The most dramatic impacts of immunotherapy \u2013 less disease and increased survival \u2013 thus far have been in melanoma but promising research and trials in lung, bladder, kidney, head and neck, liver cancers and more are ongoing. Allison said that while radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery treatments are often siloed, immunotherapy can be used in combination with any of those. \u201c[You] can quit worrying about killing every last tumor cell and just kill enough to let the immune system take [the rest] out,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the next five years or so, we\u2019re going to approach 100% in some cancers of patients responding by doing the right [drug] combinations \u2013 not all but at least a few.\u201d Read more about the Nobel Prize here: The New York Times; Vox; NPR; BBC If you'd like to share your thoughts about the 2018 Nobel Prize, please do so in a comment below.

      "Content": "By Radha_Inspire Digital Editor, Inspire Laura Pole, RN, MSN, is the Director of Nourishment Programs at the Smith Center for Healing and the Arts in Washington, D.C., a non-profit health, education, and arts organization, and senior researcher for Beyond Conventional Cancer Therapies, an open access, evidence-based resource for those interested in integrative cancer care. Pole trained and practiced as an oncology nurse before pursuing an interest in the science of food and nutrition to support cancer patients. We spoke with Pole about her work as a health-supportive chef. How would you describe what you do? I am a culinary translator. If someone has been told \u201cthis is the diet you need to eat\u201d, or they\u2019ve done their research and decided [how they] want to eat, I help them translate it in all the practical ways to get it to their plate and it tastes good. Whether it\u2019s teaching them to cook or shop or plan menus, working with someone else who\u2019s going to cook for them, or teaching them how to go out and eat if they aren\u2019t up for cooking. Nourishment is everything about food, from selecting and preparing it, to enjoying it, to digesting it, to it working with your body to take care of you. At what point do people come to you to address diet as part of cancer care? Sometimes we\u2019ll have people who from the get-go know they want to take an integrative approach to their care and they\u2019ll ask for help. But in the shock of a diagnosis and trying to do everything you can to figure out your treatment and get through it, we don\u2019t see too many seriously looking at diet until after [that]. I mostly get people who are done with treatment and now they want to know what they can do related to eating that will reduce the risk of recurrence. I like to help people understand [how to use] food and other healing practices to make the body inhospitable to cancer. The kind of eating pattern we\u2019re talking about is a primarily plant-based, whole foods diet \u2013 like eating apples with the skin vs drinking apple juice. How can food make the body inhospitable to cancer? We\u2019re now pretty sure that obesity is connected to at least 13 different cancers \u2013 it\u2019s getting as clear as smoking is clear[ly] related to cancer. The fat that accumulates is active, causing inflammation and interfering with the insulin system. Insulin resistance, which a lot of people with obesity have \u2013 but you can have it even if you\u2019re not obese \u2013 happens when you eat high glycemic load foods (refined flours, white pasta, white bread). Consider insulin like a real estate agent taking glucose into [cellular] homes\u2026 When you have more glucose than cells want to take up, cells become resistant to the insulin \u2013 that\u2019s insulin resistance \u2013 yet the pancreas is still kicking out insulin. Cancer cells will take the glucose, and the insulin says, \u201cI\u2019ll give you some growth factor while we\u2019re at it.\u201d That\u2019s the last thing you want! What questions could patients and caregivers ask of their primary caregivers or oncologists in order to get them to a nutrition-related resource? They could say something like: \u201cI feel like food and diet is going to be important to my healing. I plan to look into that. I wonder what your thoughts are on it?\u201d Whether your doctor knows about what you\u2019re exploring, it\u2019s important to let them know that you\u2019re doing it or you\u2019re thinking about it so they can flag concerns. There are a lot of sources and videos on the Internet that are out of date. You need to look for reliable sources. A lot of people don\u2019t know about the culinary translation piece. You can ask for a referral to an oncology dietician. There are doctors who practice integrative or more holistic medicine and we talk about how to find them [at the Smith Center]. You might want to work with a navigator who\u2019s trained in understanding integrative cancer care. There are a subgroup of naturopaths called naturopathic oncologists. If they are true to their profession, they will work cooperatively with your conventional medicine doctors\u2026 to help people with lifestyle practices, maybe supplements, complementary therapies, natural approaches, that will complement your conventional cancer treatment. How can eating well for cancer accommodate different cultures and food traditions? One thing you do is you go back to the roots of the food for that culture... what were the traditional foods? If you look at Latin American cuisine, if you look at African cuisine, there\u2019s a lot of health supportive foods in it. If you think about the Mediterranean diet, [which is] based on the cultures and ethnicities of the people who live on the Mediterranean, that\u2019s one of the most evidence-based diets for good health outcomes, including for cancer, heart disease, cardiovascular disease. I like [the writer] Michael Pollan\u2019s advice \u2013 eat real food, not too much, mostly plants. Is there anything else important to mention? I was getting to the end of a lecture when I talk about \u201cdelicious\u201d being a very important principle. [A French student] couldn\u2019t contain herself and she said: \u201cYou keep talking about the science but in my country, we love food, we enjoy it, it\u2019s pleasure! And that has to be good for you.\u201d I said you\u2019re right and maybe I should talk about that first. [Food] doesn\u2019t have to be like taking a bad medicine and it doesn\u2019t have to be complicated. And pleasure should be part of it. What resources help you stay updated on the latest thinking about cancer and diet? The American Institute for Cancer Research\u2019s Continuous Update Project (CUP) reports review literature for several cancers. I listen to [Five to Thrive Live!] on iThrive Radio where they interview an expert in some topic related to cancer, quite often related to diet. The Center for Mind-Body Medicine does trainings twice a year on food as medicine, and I have done that training and was on the faculty for some time.

      "Content": "By Radha_Inspire Digital Editor, Inspire Laura Long (laurainboston) was always interested in healthcare, which she thought combined the medical and emotional aspects of caregiving. As a nurse, Long focused on supporting patients being cared for at home and steered her career in that direction as a visiting home nurse and eventually as a home-to-hospice liaison. \u201cI was doing that up until I became a patient myself,\u201d Long said. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012, for which she had a mastectomy and chemotherapy. The first diagnosis and treatment went smoothly but a subsequent stage IV diagnosis left her feeling differently. \u201cInstead of being a patient, getting care, and recovering, now I\u2019m in this long-term patient role where I\u2019ve had to stop working and really focus on the care needs that I have,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been a harder transition because it\u2019s a permanent role reversal.\u201d A cancer diagnosis means significant changes in a person\u2019s role within their family, job, community, and more. These changes can feel particularly stark when someone has made a career out of caregiving and then finds themselves in need of care. After her metastatic diagnosis, the chemotherapy treatments and narcotics made it too difficult to continue working. Long\u2019s focus shifted to her own care needs. Learning how to accept help from others presented both practical and emotional challenges. \u201cI found people so appreciated being asked to do something specific,\u201d Long said, like planting flowers in her window box. \u201cI think it\u2019s hard for women in particular, who are used to caring for other people as mothers, spouses, daughters, and so forth. Learning to be direct\u2026 I needed to appreciate how helpful that was.\u201d But the kind of support Long needed and wanted evolved after her metastatic diagnosis. For example, she involved palliative care early in her treatment and sought out local advanced breast cancer support groups. \u201cBecause this feels more permanent\u2026 I\u2019ve been a little more private about it,\u201d Long said. She also had insight into what would help her care team care for her. She keeps a detailed pain log \u2013 a color chart \u2013 to track how she feels between doctor visits and brings her husband or a nurse friend to appointments to help remember discussion details. The emotional support Long gets from her friends, husband, and 13-year-old son does help her prioritize her goals and activities and keeps her feeling positive about accepting help when she feels limited. \u201cI\u2019m putting things on my calendar that are meaningful to me\u2026 I want to invest as much as I can in [my son],\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t need a lot, I just can\u2019t do all I want to do. When I give in to let people help me, I end up feeling good about it.\u201d If have your own story of transition, please do share it in a comment below.

      "Content": "By Radha_Inspire Digital Editor, Inspire A Personal Health column at the New York Times today discussed what to say and, crucially, what not to say, to cancer patients based on a book called Loving, Supporting and Caring for the Cancer Patient by Dr. Stan Goldberg, a prostate cancer patient and communications specialist at San Francisco State University. Any type of discussion about cancer can be fraught. Columnist Jane Brody, who was treated for cancer herself, described how an everyday query like \u201chow are you?\u201d can drum up conflicting feelings when responding \u201cfine\u201d would gloss over physical and emotional turbulence: \u201cWould I have wanted to launch into a description of bad medical news at what was supposed to be a fun event? Would I have wanted even to be reminded of a bout with cancer? Although my relative undoubtedly meant well, the way her concern was expressed struck me as intrusive.\u201d Among the \u201cdo\u2019s\u201d recommended were more listening, open ended questions that empower patients with choice (Do you want to tell me about your cancer and what you\u2019re going through?), and actions that lift the patient\u2019s burden, making sure to follow up. Goldberg suggested offering to bring dinner on a convenient night rather than asking \u201chow can I help?\u201d Among the \u201cdon\u2019ts\u201d were preaching, unsolicited advice or recommendations, judgement and blame, uninvited discussions about prognosis, information about unproven treatments, and your own feelings of distress. Rather than saying nothing or something potentially insensitive, Goldberg said it would be better to admit you simply don\u2019t know what to say.
