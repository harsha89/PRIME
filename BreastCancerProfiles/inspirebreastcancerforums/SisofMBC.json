    "Content": "Hi All, This is my first post. My sister was just diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer after being \"cancer-free\" for 3 years (s/p radiation & chemo, was stage 2 at original dx). We are reeling at HOW her regular check-ups missed her expanding cancer. I am amazed that they don't do scans to check if cancer is anywhere else?! They only ran blood tests with each check-up. That's for another discussion, I guess.... I am in healthcare (dietitian) so I'm tasked at looking at her medical options as she gets overwhelmed very easy with all the medical talk. The question is this: do you know if there is precision medicine for MBC HER2+? We are looking at joining a trial that does molecular testing, but my question is whether or not there would be targeted treatment options other than the standard protocol if we had this testing done? I know they have it with the BRCA cancers, but haven't seen it with HER2+. Thanks you for any guidance, and God Bless you all.",
