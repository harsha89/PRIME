    "Content": "I created a file system years ago when diagnosed with a chronic yet terminal illness. As a nurse, I understand the need of having important medical information easily accessible, as concise as possible. During the critical diagnostic phase (which was a long & winding road) I used a 1\" ring binder....on the FIRST page of any medical file should be your current medical profile with name, allergies, diagnoses and date of each diagnosis, your primary physician with address & phone number, followed by specialists you've seen with their phone numbers. The SECOND page should be a medication list of your CURRENT drugs, supplements you take, and the \"as needed\" drugs you take at least monthly.....this page should be reviewed and updated at least yearly, if not more often. This second page can be amended quickly and easily as a Word document and printed out. Those two pages are of primary importance for unforeseen medical emergencies & family or trusted friends need to know where these are in case of emergency to \"grab & go\". If you have a Medical Power of Attorney, and a Do Not Resuscitate form completed, these forms should be available with the first 2 pages. Now as my file has grown, indexed with tabs for Physician Notes, Lab results, Surgical/Procedure reports, IT IS TIME TO MODIFY THE MAIN FILE TO A MORE COMPACT VERSION as a \"grab n go\".... NO medical professional is going to look at a bulging file, or bulky big binder, in an emergency, or on a consulting visit. So, keep reports & lab/X-rays that were done initially and the most recent; Progress notes from the first and last visits only, along with discs of any CT's or MRI's, and the first two pages as described above. All the in-between notes, results, should be kept in a secondary file that will/can be utilized more effectively if you are admitted to the hospital (but still organized by file tabs for notes, labs, X-rays, specialists reports, etc...) Each page of my file is in a sleeve protector as pages will get lost...copies can be made with the sleeve on and no confusion about what I got back, and what I didn't get back. Simply having this file can eliminate, or at least reduce, having repeat testing done that is timely and expensive, and in an emergency direct the care & decisions an emergency physician will need. In a nutshell, have a compact \"grab n go\" binder, and a secondary main binder/file. Each binder is a different color, and the binding states in large letters, \"emergency file\" and \"main medical file\".",
