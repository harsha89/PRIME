    "Content": "My mom is 2 weeks into her treatment. She did a round of herceptin and taxol her first week, and just did the taxol her second week. She knows symptoms could change, but the only thing she has experienced so far was a bout of constipation, and a mild case of diarrhea. And she thinks it was more from what she ate, than the Chemo itself. Good luck to you.",
