      "Content": "I am 4 years post breast augmentation. My right breast has had issues with sensitivity and numbness from nerve damage. Recently the upper outer quadrant of my right breast has started itching and at times the entire your portion itches. It is a deep itch that I can't scratch and no rash is present. My plastic surgeon said it isn't associated with nerve damage or related to the implant stretching out the tissue. Has anyone else had this deep itch I'm talking about?",
