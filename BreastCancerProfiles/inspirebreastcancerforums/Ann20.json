    "Content": "I Guess I Know the Feeling when Teachers who try Hard to Teach Students, but they just don't get the Point. The Point that I have been trying to make is that if BIG PHARMA Researchers (and they are the only ones who have the Money and are Advocated by our Corrupt Governments) would have been Researching to find \"CURES\", instead of Drugs, we would have Far Less Diseases Today and Much Healthier People. We have much more Knowledge, Technology and Resources Today and NO Cures. What is \"Wrong\" with this Picture?? They have only come up with Bandaid Solutions, so People are \"Stuck\" and it is \"Shameful\" that there is More Disease today than decades ago! It is ALL ABOUT GREED AND MONEY!",
