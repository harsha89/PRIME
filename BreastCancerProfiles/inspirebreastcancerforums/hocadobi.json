    "Content": "I am compelled to reply here to ITGuy because his first paragraph tells all. His has been my conclusion over the past 4 years in my study of bone health. My bone loss was treated for too many years with bisphosphonates, when at the beginning of treatment, the bone loss called osteopenia and measured as such, was actually normal for my age. The excessive time of bone drug use set up my bones for some serious and debilitating fractures which then put me on a course of Forteo to heal those fractures. After the use of Forteo, my own research proved that I had had parathyroid disease for years and even prior to the initial drug \u2018therapy.\u2019 Had this been diagnosed early on, a good deal of agony could have been avoided. Hyperparathyroid disease is a sure path to bone loss. It has been both my experience and observation that in the world of bones, doctors fail to address and work with us to fix our unique and individual causes for bone loss, they go directly to the Rx pad and write the prescription and in many cases, the drug may not work, because the causative factors are still in force. They also refuse, for the most part, to follow up with bone marker studies to monitor effectiveness of the drug(s) and bone response. It was only through my own research, study, insistence and self-referral that my parathyroid diagnosis was uncovered and confirmed with surgery being done 2,000 miles from home at Norman Parathyroid Center this past April, 2016. I am happy to report that I have come out on top despite the parathyroid issue going unnoticed and undiagnosed by at least 5 doctors for nearly 15 years. It is fairly certain in my mind that we can apply this paradigm to many conditions, diseases and illnesses, and that treating the symptoms far exceeds discovering and addressing the causes. Health blessings to all, hocadobi",
