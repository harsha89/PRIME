      "Content": "Dear members, I\u2019m pleased to share with you \u201cExperts by Experience: Patient stories that teach,\u201d a compilation of columns we created in collaboration with Mayo Clinic. In the foreword, which I co-authored with Lee Aase, Director of Mayo Clinic Social Media Network, we noted that it is our hope that \"these stories will become a powerful tool for patients, to give voice to their experiences, and a resource for healthcare providers, to turn knowledge into action.\" We invite you to read and share this compilation, which you can download here. We call the compilation \"stories that teach\" because patients and caregivers are educators. Every day on Inspire, we learn how patients and caregivers are teaching one another, and sharing how they educate others around them, including medical professionals. We invite you to comment here on the compilation, and we thank you for being Inspire members. Together we\u2019re better, Brian Loew Founder, Inspire Edited April 24, 2019 at 10:02 am",

      "Content": "Dear members, As patients and caregivers, we have more sources of medical information available to us than ever before to help us make the best decisions possible for our health. Advice from our doctors is sometimes not the same as the information we learn from the experiences of our peers, and there are often other sources of information available as well. Some of our decisions feel like big or serious decisions, while others do not. And sometimes, medical decisions have to be made quickly or under pressure. When the stakes are high \u2013 life and death, even \u2013 it could be scary to think you might make the wrong decision even if there is no clear \u2018right\u2019 one. We\u2019d like to hear how you made medical decisions in your life. Did some sources of information or advice figure more prominently in the process than others? Were some decisions easy, and others hard? How do you know who or what to trust? In retrospect, did you feel you made the right choice, or would you have chosen differently? Could you have chosen differently? Making medical decisions is a unique and individual process, and sharing your story could help others who are trying to decide what to do. Together we\u2019re better, Brian Inspire",

      "Content": "Dear members, How should we be thinking about our genetic information when it comes to disease? It\u2019s a question many of us are asking here on Inspire, sometimes very intensely, depending on the nature of the disease. The information we get from our genome can have a direct impact on so much, including how, or if, we can be treated for certain types of disease -- that is the nature of precision (or personalized) medicine. Precision medicine\u2019s appeal is reflected in the way many drugs are developed and which ones work well enough for government approval. In May, the FDA made its first drug approval based on how well the drug targeted a tumor\u2019s genetic features (one kind of \u201cbiomarker\u201d) rather than the type of organ tissue the tumor came from. Last year, over a quarter of all the drugs approved by the FDA included biomarker information. Inspire\u2019s 2016 Annual Survey of members revealed how much genetic testing and precision medicine are on our minds. Of 10,000 respondents, 18% already had their genes tested, 29% had heard of precision medicine, and 58% were interested in finding out more about their genetic makeup. What is more, many respondents expressed enthusiasm to share their genetic data to help scientific research. Almost 70% said they would share this information and/or their health records for a clinical research project. We expect that figure will climb in the 2017 Inspire Annual Survey, which we plan to publish soon. Patients\u2019 genetic information could also help answer the question of when we might benefit from advances in precision medicine. Could a breakthrough treatment help someone now? Their children? Many of us want to be involved in medical innovation and drive decisions that will affect us. Offering access to the intricacies of our genomes is a powerful way to be involved. I feel strongly that if any of us do contribute in this way, researchers must respect our wishes about the ways in which our personal information is used. But even if sharing genetic information doesn\u2019t appeal to you, sharing your experience with a treatment, asking for more information about a condition, or supporting one another as caregivers helps us learn more about what our genes can tell us. Each of us can help move medicine forward. I would love to know your thoughts about gene testing, precision medicine, and what it means to share this type of information. Has genetic information factored into your or someone you know\u2019s care in some way? If you\u2019d like, please share your experiences in the comments section below. Together, we\u2019re better.

      "Content": "Dear members, Many of us, including myself, have spent a good bit of time in hospitals, as a patient or a caregiver or both, and have ideas about how hospitals can improve. Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist, healthcare scientist, and health care improvement expert at Yale University, recently asked the following questions on Twitter: \u201cI am curious to know from patients, especially those recently in the hospital: What do you wish we did better? What were the most obvious ways that quality could be improved throughout hospitalization and in the transition to home? We should all really want to know. What should we improve?\u201d Harlan\u2019s tweet generated many good replies, and several days ago I asked Harlan what he would think about me posing this question on his behalf here in Inspire. As Harlan is, I\u2019m proud to say, a fan of Inspire, he readily agreed. I invite you to reply to this discussion with answers to the questions he posed, so that we can help to drive positive change in hospitals. We would like to create a summary from your answers and share them, in an anonymous fashion (no Inspire username), as an essay in a publication, or present the combined insights at a conference. We will let you know of any publication or presentation of this information. Your perspectives matter, and together we can make an impact. I look forward to reading your thoughts and ideas, and if for any reason you would prefer that we not include your answer in our summary, just write, \u201cDon\u2019t share\u201d in your reply. Together we're better, Brian Loew Founder, Inspire",

Slight nausea here an there but easily controlled, some constipation, lost taste buds but they are back, lost hair, now back. Have had colds an flues that would have left chemo in the dust. Others mileage may vary, maybe depends on age and general health going in ? While not typically a complete remedy by itself (although that is advancing with immunotherapy) I feel it is always good to additionally treat the whole body systemically as well ( scans can only see down to approx 4mm and much can go undetected ).",
