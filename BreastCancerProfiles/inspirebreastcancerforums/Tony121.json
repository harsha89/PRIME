Thank God for the strength and courage she has found to face her struggles with psoriasis, as I have with bipolar II, and be an advocate for it! You go girl!",

      "Content": "I commend Harriet Hodgson for her article on \"Nothing Days\" for caregivers. They need a day \"off\" from care-giving on a regular basis to do whatever makes them happy and to rejuvinate themselves. Of course, she says she still provides the basic care for her loved one, but takes some time for herself on that day. That is well-deserved and needed. Self-care is very important for caregivers if they are to survive in the long-haul mentally, emotionally, spiritually and physically. So, caregivers put a \"Nothing Day\" on the calendar, at least once a month and don't feel gui;ty about it. You've earned it! Take a little time out for yourself! and enjoy doing something just for YOU on that day!",
