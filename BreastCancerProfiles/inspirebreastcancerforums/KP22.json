    "Content": "I would like to know options (menu) for people like me that have had all their teeth extracted and dentures that just don't work properly due to complications in their mouth such as tender gums, toris and other obstructions that make dentures impossible to use. Sometimes I so much miss the taste of melted butter on toast that went with my eggs. The occasional hamburger and fries at the fast food joint, the fish and chips. the onion ring appetisers, the blooming onion and tender steak and even a grilled cheese sandwich. I am getting tired of oatmeal almost every morning and soup in the afternoon, ice cream and fruit are starting to get old, I need some new ideas! K.P.",
