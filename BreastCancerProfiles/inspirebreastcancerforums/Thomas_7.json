    "Content": "Very good article on the Opioid stigma among cancer patients. To be clear, not all cancer patients are in the type of pain that requires Opium Therapy, but a vast number do; the stigma and even worse this now \"Opioid Crisis\" which has caused doctors to scale back prescribing Opioid pain medication is a travesty. The government agencies clearly missed the boat here. This is tantamount to taking guns away from all law abiding gun owner's and letting the criminals keep their guns. It doesn't make any sense. However, it can be quantitative and they'll be able to show the President and America how well they have done cutting prescriptions and over-prescribing, which should be handled on a case by case basis, not across the board. I don't have cancer, but just a couple things that changed my life, career, marriage, and pain was a motor neuropathy & CMT disease, then extensive joint disease from degenerative arthritis and Hemachromatosis, on top of that extensive bi-lateral joint hip replacement and femoral stems, needed back, neck and urinary surgery. After living several years in pain, pain management changed my life with Extended Release Opioids which made me more functional. Last August/early September the guillotine was dropped and suddenly, after 18 years being on the same dosage except up on pill after 6 years, I am having my pain meds cut back and they can no longer see me after next visit [get another doctor if you can find one] Once I found out who the major culprit was, confirming what my prior doctor said, I decided right there I was no longer going to be beholden to government agencies intimidating doctors and infringing on my rights as an American. I tapered off Oxycontin voluntarily, even told my new pain doctor I wanted to get off Opioids, am now I am off the ER release pills, totally for the last 36 days. Not my choice, but am sick of the stigma, problems, being controlled by others.........I am in much worse pain; not sure how long I'll be around, but I am flat out disgusted with the people who did this. I realize it takes more than just federal agencies. Big pharma, lawsuits, it all plays in to this mess. All I gotta say is: Thanks a lot. You made my day. [sarcasm] Thomas",
