    "Content": "Understanding genetics is almost a requirement in today's medical community. Our treatment options are expanding daily, with custom medicine no longer on the horizon but being used for pinpoint treatment. Having a basic knowledge of the the terms will allow us to be more involved in selecting the path we are going to use to treat our disease. Finding the mutations we may have can prolong our lives by selecting the appropriate treatment OR bypassing a treatment because it is ineffective. This webinar will help by giving us the basis for understanding what the doctor is saying and participating in the decision making process. Looking forward to this.",
