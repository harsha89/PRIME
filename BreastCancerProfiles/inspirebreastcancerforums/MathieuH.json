    "Content": "Hello everybody, For my part I would be totally in favor of the sharing of information (under the opinion of the patient) in genetic testing. Indeed, within a disease, several, and different, mutations for the same gene may exist. Thus inducing the same disease but may be with different symptoms and forms. There are mutations that are not easy to diagnose, and some molecular biology techniques can not detect them. On the other hand, if, following a sharing of information, it is thought to seek a mutation with a particular technique, this can help the diagnosis. I do not know the regulations for the sharing of information, medical secrecy, etc .... what can be a brake? I do not know . Mat France",
