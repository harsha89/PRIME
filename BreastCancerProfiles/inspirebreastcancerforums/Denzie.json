      "Content": "Until you get the results of a biopsy there\u2019s no way to tell if you\u2019ve had spread or not unless organs start shutting down. If the biopsy says cancer they will also be genomic testing to determine how aggressive it is. There will also likely be a PET scan and a bone scan to to for cancerous lesions once they have a positive biopsy. Please let us know the biopsy results.",

      "Content": "Cancer spreads 3 ways: 1-growing into an adjacent organ 2-spreading through lymph system 3-spread through vascular (blood) system The first two are easily tested, the third is the reason they use adjuvant chemotherapy. If this turns out to be cancer they will do genomic testing to learn what they can about the cancer. They will be looking to test the grade of the cancer and to learn if it is fed by 3 different hormones: estrogen, progesterone and HER2. The information they get from this testing will tell them how aggressive the cancer is. It will also give them an idea of how often cells like yours (IF it\u2019s cancer) metastasize and which chemotherapy drugs it will or will not respond to. It also informs long term maintenance and follow up. They will know if you can benefit from a treatment like tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. At this point there are more questions than answers. Take a friend or family member with you to take. notes. Get copies of your reports and put them in an accordion file to organize them. Another excellent resource you will find helpful is breast cancer.org",

Also reach out to your local American Cancer Society and inquire about the look good feel better program. The radiation you had used X-rays. It's possible to have proton radiation to a spot that has already had traditional radiation. If your hospital doesn\u2019t offer it they may not suggest it. I\u2019ve asked three different radiologists if that would be possible as I\u2019ve had radiation for lung and breast cancers. I wanted to know if I can use it when I experience progression. Things look their bleakest when going through treatment because we get so fatigued. As you recover you might look into rescuing an older dog or cat from a shelter. An animal that\u2019s 2-3 years or older likely has been housebroken. Our pets have meant so much to my recovery.",

Our doctors/oncologists/radiologists know a great deal about the treatment they are administering but do not have a good understanding of the issues surrounding side effects, especially long term side effects. In a case like this I would follow the recommendations of the lymphedema specialist. This is what they deal with, the only thing they deal with, and their knowledge base about it is far more extensive. Also this was reinforced in an Ask the Specialist session at a recent educational seminar. The upshot was as they had no clue about long term side effect management and the need for physical therapy and other interventions. I hope this helps.",
