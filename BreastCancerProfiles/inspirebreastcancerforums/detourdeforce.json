      "Content": "I understand your concern (and the potential anxiety about results of further testing) but believe that your health care professionals are acting in your best interest, especially given your past medical history. If you haven't already asked, it may be helpful to have a conversation with the physician coordinating your care about the risks and benefits of further testing/treatment if indicated with an important factor being whether you would pursue treatment or not if the results reveal a problem that requires additional treatment. If health insurance or finances are a concern, there are often health system, state, and/or local programs that can help with that too. I hope this helps! It's hard to be a patient again when you've already been down the cancer path twice!",
