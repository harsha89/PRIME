    "Content": "Kari -- I'm sorry for the end of your PCP relationship; it sounds like she was with you through a lot of key decisions and medical care transitions. I'm relating to your experience as my PCP of nearly 20 years just left to pursue other interests, and like yours, she'd been with me through years of social, emotional and medical turning points. With stage 4 cancer, it's not easy to find a new PCP and I've resolved not to anticipate a replacement to fill her shoes. What I'm realizing going forward, is that what I need from my PCP has changed from what it was 20 years ago. For me, my oncologist is now my \"go-to\" for what I need most, and my new PCP will sort of be the back-up. If she's daunted by the weight of my medical history, I'm reminding myself that much of that is \"history\" now. We'll get to know each other moving forward. I hope she and I, and you and your new PCP, will see your health challenges in the light of the present and a vision of the future from \"now\" Old is familiar, feels secure and is good. New, I remind myself, can be refreshing, enlightening and positive. Well wishes!",
