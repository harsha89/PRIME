    "Content": "I have lymphedema in my left arm as a result of axillary lymphnodes being removed during my breast cancer surgery. It developed because I had non- cancer related infections(sinus/UTI), repeated 102 temp, and swelling in hands and feet. Have been \"fitted\" with a compression garment with velcro straps. It has been adjusted multiple times but continues to slide down my arm! Result is fluid accumulates at the elbow and upper arm (above the sleeve). I have been doing self massage also. Now with radiation starting next week, my therapist says compression is not recommended during treatment. My radiation oncologist said it is not a problem! But how do I do the self massage over the radiated area (neck lymph nodes) and my right arm crossing over my left breast to reach my arm? And the bulky sleeve constantly rubs along my left side? Any advice? Would like to move to a regular compression sleeve, but was advised by my lymphedema therapist to wait until my arm swelling was closer to normal - so that I wouldn't have to buy more than one size!",
