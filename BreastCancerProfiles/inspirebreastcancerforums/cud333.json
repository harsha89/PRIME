    "Content": "I hate it, when people all for a sudden take this patronizing tone: How are you feeling? I don't like it when the tone of their voice is as if they speak to a 90 year old. I keep my cancer pretty private. One of the reasons is, that I need time to get away from it. I also very much dislike it, when I tell someone, that my cancer has spread to my liver, and my liver isn't doing well and their answer is: Yeah but you are strong. So dying of cancer is a sign of weakness? Did I not fight hard enough? If I fought harder, would I have more time with my family? I am fighting my butt off but I am slipping backwards. I hate it when people hint that you get cancer because you don't take care of yourself. Had your diet been better.... like they don't want to think about it can happen to them. When I hear something like that, I point out that my friend's brother was a marathoner who never smoked. He died of lung cancer.",
