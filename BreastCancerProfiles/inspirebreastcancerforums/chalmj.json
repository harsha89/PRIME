      "Content": "As a head and neck cancer patient currently on Keytruda I must say that these scientists may have saved my life but only four injections so far so hopeful. So thank you, thank you, thank you Dr. Tasuku Honjo. I read teamcc's comment and find I am total agreement with his frustration that the government/ FDA has shown many examples of slowing or outright eliminating treatment therapies that might compete with the current money maker therapies because it is the current money makers that actually control the FDA. In my opinion the government should establish a new government agency that would be responsible to bring diet, herbs and natural therapies into the war on cancer. How many times have we heard natural therapies can't be patented so they can't be included in cancer treatment. So ridiculous to let that stop progress. It should be done for free with government taxes for the good of all tax paying citizens. So foolish to think the only thing useful against cancer is a pharmaceutical drug. So many times we hear no cure for a condition but it really should be stated no cure for the condition in conventional medicine because the drug companies haven't found a way to make big bucks on it yet. Take diabetes for example - this is a diet related disease but instead of changing the patients diet they give them insulin which they know will never cure the patient because it was high insulin due to diet that causes diabetes in the first place.

      "Content": "fighterm, After all the posts I put out urging other cancer patients to check out what so many doctors are saying about the benefits of a ketogenic diet for cancer patients it actually failed at least in the sense it mimics fasting. I found that after being on the diet for a few years I ended up with high glucose levels. Its called the dawn phenomenon. I still eat a high fat diet but I now try to cycle in and out of ketosis. Apparently, if you drive insulin too low for too long you raise cortisol levels which raises blood sugar and with low insulin the levels stay high. Its like all my normal cells prefer to burn fat now leaving all the glucose for the cancer cells. I agree most drugs come from natural sources but I was referring to the actual natural sources. Most conventional doctors today are not urging patients to change diet or suggesting things like tumeric or green tea, B17, wormwood - the list is endless because the definitive trials on these substances is never done. They say, who would pay for these studies - I say it should be the government with our taxes to the good of all citizens. Yes, I am hopeful the immunotherapy will work. In the last few months my swollen lymph nodes on my face and neck, the ones on the left have been swollen for years, the ones on the right only started swelling in 2018, look like they are shrinking. However, the large tumor lump I can see on the front/top of my tongue does not look smaller and my mouth continues to close such that now I can't even put my fingers in between my teeth. It is becoming difficult to brush my teeth. I do lots of things to try to help out the immunotherapy like probiotic and prebiotic foods and immune system boosters like beta glucan, fucoidan, goldenseal and echinacea, various fibers like larch tree arabinogalactan etc. With the lymph nodes shrinking I am very hopeful. I think one of the key things they are finding is there is a link to the response rate to immunotherapy drugs and the condition of the microbiome. I have commented in many posts patients should take into consideration their microbiome may have been seriously degraded after some chemotherapies and immunotherapies may not work unless something is done to restore the microbiome prior to starting immunotherapy. I think about that every time I read a post from a patient who was on chemotherapy and then went directly to immunotherapy only to have progression which is more likely due to stopping the chemotherapy than due to starting the immunotherapy. Isn't it a hallmark of platinum based chemotherapies that they only get 80% of the tumor and after stopping the 20% left will grow more aggressively? John",

      "Content": "fighterm, I can't believe a platinum based chemotherapy would be synergistic with an immunotherapy. They are finding in a recent melanoma trial that patients with an intact microbiome respond better to immunotherapy and we know chemotherapy devastates the microbiome. Still, I have been following posts from patients on this type of combined therapy and many seem to feel the therapy is working. We'll have to stay tuned and see what happens. Maybe the therapy does work. I am so negative and distrustful of the conventional cancer treatment industry that all I can see is a frenzy of trials combining every drug out there with immunotherapy in hopes of getting on the ever growing immunotherapy bandwagon. I think we need to be careful because they will combine the drug that doesn't work drug with the drug that does work to achieve the key objective which is making more money. It's funny we mention this. Recently I had a bizarre meeting with my oncologist. The oncologist I had for years left the practice and I was moved to another doctor at the practice. I see him for the first time, he is 1.5 hrs late, he knows I won't do radiation, then he starts telling me about breast cancer treatment, 3 chemotherapies and hes calling it immunotherapy, I listen politely wondering where hes going, next thing I know he gets up leaves the room to come back in a few minutes to say he has ordered tests to start the treatment, never asked me if I agreed to do it and then immediately left saying he had to hurry to another patient who had been waiting over 1.5 hrs to see him. i never went to see that idiot again. So important to be knowledgeable when meeting with your oncologist - else they would have put me on breast cancer treatment for HNSCC. Unreal. I have not seen any negative articles on turmeric or green tea in relation to cancer. I have seen information that cancers need glutathione and other antioxidants to thrive and I remember you had a post on this. I decided to stop specific antioxidant supplements but continued with herbs, minerals, vitamins (D, K, active B vitamins (I have to make sure not to take synthetic folic acid as I have to copies of the MTHFR gene), immune modulators, etc. I have posted this before - I wonder if you could comment. All these years of research and I think this one short video says it all - the cause and cure of cancer, chronic lactic acidosis. This makes sense why juicing which raises PH or why the ketogenic diet are both effective at preventing and reversing cancer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uehft13Nl2g&t=3s John",
