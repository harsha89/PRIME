      "Content": "There's a dissertation in this. Right now my global priority would be to keep healthcare accessible. The trend of hospitals in rural and under served areas closing is alarming. Everyone should have at least an Emergency/family practice facility with basics within 45 minutes of their home with a way to get to higher-acuity treatment quickly. Patient-focused facilities. The patient should always be the focus of the encounter, be it inpatient or outpatient. This should carry through to facility design, communications, privacy, wait times, courtesy of staff. Infection Control. Hand washing, sufficient time for housekeeping to thoroughly clean rooms, staff staying home when sick. As someone who has worked in facilities design of academic medical centers for three decades, it is a fine line and all too many who dream up projects put patients behind cost, staff convenience and space constraints. I try to always keep patients at the fore, and then make sure that staff (particularly nursing staff in inpatient settings) has input into their work environment. Beth",

      "Content": "Thanks for the post. I have all of Jane Brody's cookbooks, so the name and reputation are quite familiar. My husband gets annoyed when the response to \"my wife has lung cancer\" is \"I didn't know she smoked\". I quit a quarter century before I was diagnosed. Don't prattle on about the little inconveniences and problems in your life. Compared to what I'm going through, Junior's not getting into AP Calculus in his senior year of high school isn't worth tears at work. As the years have progressed, I've gotten a little better at giving folks slack on the insensitive questions. Dealing with cancer patients is not in most peoples wheelhouse. I do hate *the look*. That look of pity mixed with sadness mixed with loss of words.",
