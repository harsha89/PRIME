    "Content": "I received two care packages from dear friends and family. The first was a warm shawl and a book that I had wanted to read. The shawl was wonderful during the times I had to sit for hours during my IV hydration infusions. The second was a box containing many different items, each wrapped with a note of encouragement. I was encouraged to open one small gift any time I felt like I needed a lift There was a pen, a book of quotations, warm socks, lip balm, a puzzle book to play when my grandkids came over, hand lotion, and many other small items. It was a really wonderful gift. My sister also came over once a week with dinners that could be eaten over the course of several days. The support of friends and family really helped me to get through my first diagnosis.",
