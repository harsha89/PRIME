      "Content": "The ability to discuss 'taboo' items like feelings and fears with other men that have cancer has helped me in ways I never imagined. Just listening to them talk about their issues with emotions gives me different ways to look at my situation and allows me to improve my mental outlook. Well worth the time, you will leave with more than when you arrived. Please stop by.",

      "Content": "Being able to talk to other men that were experiencing the same things I was experiencing helped me. I learned I was not the only man that thought and felt these feelings. Speaking freely with the other men eased my mind and allowed me to regain a prespective I had lost. I have found that something said out loud carries much more weight that the same thought being allowed to stay in my head. Hearing someone say it gives it power. We need to share our power to help ourselves and help others. Being in a 'judgement free' zone allowed me to say things I could not say in other situations but needed to be said. We have that zone available at 8pm EST on January 17th. Please join us.",
