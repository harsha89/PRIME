    "Content": "Back in the early 60s when I was diagnosed with WILM's tumor; the tumor was the size of a basketball in a three year old. They did everything to shrink it before they removed this. Finally they got it to the size of a football. My parents decided after doing Chemo and watching me slowly get worse, they stopped it. Unfortunately it metastasized and my parents felt guilty for the longest time. My doctors at that time told my parents that they did the correct choice by stopping it, it would have killed me. So yes there are great doctors out there and then there are not so good ones. You just have to trust and get that second opinion if you do not understand. THIS IS ONLY MY EXPERIENCE AND OPINION. Thank you for letting me put my 2 cents in",
