      "Content": "This fits together with the recent thread I posted on 'complementary medicine' decreasing survival in curable solid cancers. One difference there is that all people in both arms had at least one conventional intervention, whereas the alternative group here I guess had no conventional treatment. Is that right? I also agree that 'alternative medicine' is an oxymoron that describes the false hope that is offered. That there is something on the equivalent of medicine in the arena of life and death treatment in cancer is obviously false. There is no alternative, period, that gives the same survival benefits.",

      "Content": "There's also this study on complementary medicine \"Complementary Medicine, Refusal of Conventional Cancer Therapy, and Survival Among Patients With Curable Cancers\" https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/268797... It's been posted a lot on twitter recently by scientific or medical societies. It is important to look at where information comes from in addition to just the information. Also when people say science is only a way of thinking and belief system, putting it on par with other belief systems like religion, they are forgetting that we have cell phones because of science, or treatments to extend life in lung cancer because of medicine and science. People who put their own beliefs on par with scientific knowledge don't understand the scientific method.",

      "Content": "It's sad that so many people with curable cancers die because they postpone or refuse conventional treatment, and for that reason alone. That is what the recent studies posted in this thread have shown. The problem is when the weight of independently verified scientific evidence painstakingly accumulated, and published in peer review publications, is put on the same scale as quack medicine. It sounds harsh but how else do you describe something that literally kills 10s of thousands of people around the world each year.",

It's a real breakthrough even among Nobel prizes. They've already turned 100% fatal cancers into long term survival for some. probably cure. Some of those in the long survival tail of the PACIFIC trial announced at #WCLC2018 are likely cured. The only question at this point is how many.
