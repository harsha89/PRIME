    "Content": "Hi, I've offered to have my genes tested to help others understand why I might have had the \"one in a thousand\" reaction to common T/C chemo for breast cancer (I experienced respiratory failure, renal failure, and then a ruptured colon with sepsis from ONE treatment; my lifesaving ileostomy brought me to Inspire's Ostomy group after \"40 days and 40 nights\" in the hospital)--so far, two inquiries have returned polite declines. MyTrials at BreastCancerTrials.org is one, and BCRF (Breast Cancer Research Foundation) is the other. I thought these were good targets, but no. I think the problem is that I don't really have a clue who is currently doing specific research on Taxotere or Cyclophosphamide and would want this information. So, if you have any ideas, great. I may be one of many who are in the predicament of wanting to share but not knowing who wants to hear me. Thanks for running a great, great website! Barbara (Babby12-5)",
