    "Content": "Can anyone give me advice please as my gp is not very helpful. 5 years ago a had a terrible lower back spasm or two that were so painful I couldn't move for hours. I had a couple of weeks of work, returning when things had calmed down. I was prescribed 2mg of diazepam. Since then, about once a year, I get a very bad back episode, with accompanying lower back spasms which are excruciatingly painful. I am careful with my back and don't really know why I keep getting them. Last week the gp did a quick examination and found nothing 'untoward' and gave me painkillers. I have since had to go back for diazepam again due to spasms. My questions are-can anyone else relate to this experience? Is my back somehow weakened by my first experience? And mainly- should I take to 2mg of diazepam three times a day, as prescribed, or just take one every now and then when I have a spasm? [bearing in mind their addictive qualities.] He has given me 10 pills altogether. Thank you in advance for any replies. I feel very down as I this is affecting things I want to do. I'm 59.",
