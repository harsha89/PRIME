      "Content": "Chemo was not the preconceived horror show I thought it might be going in (cisplatin, carboplatin, taxol). Slight nausea here an there but easily controlled, some constipation, lost taste buds but they are back, lost hair, now back. Have had colds an flues that would have left chemo in the dust. Others mileage may vary, maybe depends on age and general health going in ? While not typically a complete remedy by itself (although that is advancing with immunotherapy) I feel it is always good to additionally treat the whole body systemically as well ( scans can only see down to approx 4mm and much can go undetected ).",

      "Content": "\" no one has really explained WHY I\u2019m not eligible for bladder sparring \" Did you ever ask to directly speak with a Radiation Oncologist. Radiation supplants surgery if you will, you would be advised to consult with a Radiation Oncologist and not rely solely on others to tell you what is and is not possible with radiation.advise you only (hear it from a Radiation Oncologist directly, why not). I would never tell any one not to have RC (you surest bet), just make your decisions form the best informed position possible without any lingering question. https://www.inspire.com/groups/bladder-cancer-advocacy-network/d... Do not confuse Radiation Oncologist for Radiologist (radiologist just take-read xrays and scans). Radiation Oncologists are a completely different group",
