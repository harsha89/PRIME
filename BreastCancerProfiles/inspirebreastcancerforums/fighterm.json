      "Content": "boomer, it's not comments. It's studies that have looked at different forms of treatments. I am sorry that you family got a huge loss. Cancer is a great challenge. It's sneaky, relentless, persistent. I believe that the best way to treat cancer is to participate in clinical trials. If your wife is fighting CRC did she do genomic testing for Lynch syndrome or for MSI (microsatellite instability). In such cases immunotherapy works very well.",

      "Content": "Actually the root cause is known pretty much. They are mutations in our DNA. Every cell in our body is mutated. If you compare cells when you were born with any cell in your body there are plenty of mutations. I am not talking about cancer, but about our normal cells. That's why we are getting!thing old. Our cells, our DNA, our proteins are all getting old and have diminished functions. Our DNA repair system is also getting old and it is overwhelmed with the increasing amount of DNA repair needed. Ultimately we get cancerous mutations due to inability to repair all DNA damage. Look at our chromosomes. They are in poor shape, multiple defects. Mutagenesis and getting old are natural things. Well, we can help to slow down these things by good lifestyle habits, but only partially. Most mutations are absolutely random.",

The cancer transformed from low grade to high grade at that time. The spontaneous remissions are known for Follicular lymphoma. If I was using some woodoo treatment I could ascribe my spontaneous remission to it.",

      "Content": "Interesting thing about patients going for alternative treatments is that they think they are doing great. One recent example. An Inspire member thought that he was doing great, even doctors were impressed, he was doing a very complicated diet and supplement regimen. When he finally decided to do RC, his CT scan showed no cancer anywhere except a small cancer in the bladder, but then the actual RC could not have been done due to a huge cancer spread. He died soon after his enthusiastic post. I know several cases like that when people think they are having success with their alternative treatment when in fact their cancer is progressing. And then they don't report anymore and then they are dead. The frequent mindset to do alternative treatments is a belief in the big pharma conspiracy. The multi billion supplement industry encourages people to do alternative treatments via many videos and websites. Most of their notions are based on Petri dish research, but not proven in clinical trials in the human body. There is no big pharma conspiracy. If you look at the international cancer research China is making a huge progress there. They are on par with the US in the number of clinical trials. They do their research independently from the USA big pharma. They want to be number one in cancer treatment. And I don't see them focusing on diets and supplements. The other thing that proponents of alternative treatments don't understand is that the cancer research is done mostly at universities. The pd1/pd-l1 pathway was discovered at universities, the car T cell method was developed at universities, the first antibodies were developed at universities, etc. The first ever antibody to treat blood cancers was developed at Stanford. (I was treated with it). Big pharma joins when a large scale drug production is needed. They buy licenses etc.",

This discussion is to help people make better choices based on scientific studies. They are not our personal experiences, they are published clinical studies. There are many people who don't do any recommended conventional treatments and do only alternative treatments. The studies compared results of alternative vs conventional treatments. It does not mean that you should not have multivitamins or other supplements recommended by your doctors. Many people have vitamin deficiencies etc. BTW, my father and grandmother died of cancer. I have 2 cancers. We are all in the same boat. I mentioned the Lynch syndrome because 15% of crc is caused by inherited mutations in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system which constitute Lynch syndrome. I hope they checked her for those mutations.",

Some examples are doxorubocin, vincristin, etoposide, paclitaxel (Taxol), docetaxel, topotecan, irinotecan etc. When something is good and effective it will be approved. Actually every plant has something anti-cancer. I tried every plant that I know to google for anticancer compounds and I found them in all of them. Even tobacco has them. It's a completely another story if they would work ina human body against cancer. 99% of them dont. I am glad that you use immunotherapy now. Will your methods be synergistic with immunotherapy? Top scientists are working on this exact issue. I am on a ketogenic diet also. But my lymphoma recurs no matter what diet I use.",

      "Content": "John, it was previously thought that chemo drugs suppress the immune system. New data show that many chemo drugs actually activate the immune system, especially in combination with immunotherapy. Cells normally die off every day by apoptosis and the immune system does not get activated by that process. But if cells die in a specific, immunogenic way, they send signals that activate the immune system. Four signals are discovered that activate the immune system. When doxorubicin or cyclohosphamide kill cells they die by immunogenic cell death (ICD). These dead or dying cells send out all 4 signals that activate the immune system. https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00187/full Radiation and other physical methods of destroying cancer cells can also cause ICD. About tumeric and green tea and other anti-oxidants. Some cancers benefit from them so they might do more harm then good.",

      "Content": "John, cisplatin chemo might activate the immune system. Cells dying from cisplatin send out 2 signals to dendritic cells, not all 4 signals like other chemos. There is a table in the paper \"Combinatorial strategies for the induction of immunogenic cell death\" in which all agents that cause immunogenic cell death are listed and for each of them there is information which signals are sent. The reason they use cisplatin with immunotherapy instead of other agents is that cisplatin is very effective at shrinking the tumors by itself. A big problem in cancer is that solid tumors have poor blood supply and many agents don't reach tumor cells in concentrations to kill them. If you don't want radiation there are other methods like lasers or cryoablation that also kill cells supposedly imunogenically. But they are less studied. Sorry, I don't listen to videos. But from you mentioning lactic acidosis I can guess what they are talking about. It's a complete garbage. About alkalization for cancer treatment. Again, the main problem here is a poor blood supply. To achieve pharmacological doses high enough to alkalize the tumor microenvironment you need about 40 g of baking soda a day, which is very toxic. There is (was) an alternative private clinic that used this high dose for cancer treatment. They reported side effects like vomiting, nausea and more. One teaspoon of baking soda does nothing for cancer. There is no acidosis before cancer in most cases. Cancer creates acidosis by switching to glycolysis. When cancer starts it is growing in normal conditions untill it overgrows its blood supply. Then it switches to glycolysis. Keep in mind that blood pH is always constant. Any extra alkalinity will be filtered by your kidneys. You just create a big job for your kidneys. It's interesting that you got high blood glucose from your ketogenic diet. My blood sugar is ok, in normal range. About tumeric. It has very low bioavailability, its concentration in the blood almost non-existent. I say it useless. I think green tea is ok. It has no effect on your cancer. The major redox systems in our bodies are glutathione and thioredoxin. They provide the constant slightly reducive environment in our bodies, our blood, our cells.",
