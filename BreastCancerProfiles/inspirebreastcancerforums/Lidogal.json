      "Content": "The entire process from diagnosis to treatment is fraught with bias. But until there are clear cut guidelines that all urologic oncologists follow diligently, treatment options will be biased, and patients will find themselves getting several opinions until they find one that feels right. How about the people who can\u2019t get another opinion, or don\u2019t realize they should? I really feel for those who fall into the wrong office initially and are swayed the wrong way by doctors whose egos exceed their skill level. Sorry went off on a tangent. Yes, bias is real and I for one was glad to avoid chemo.",

Not what you wanted to hear. It stinks. Just feel sure of your choices whatever they are. It\u2019s hard to look back with regrets.",

      "Content": "BCAN offers a survivor to survivor program where you can be matched with someone going through same thing as yourself. Perhaps your husband can be matched with another male caregiver which might better able him to understand and process this diagnosis. You have stage 2, you are going to be treated for this one way or another. It\u2019s not going away, but the good news is you will be able to live your life after RC, if you have one, and frankly no one will know unless you tell them. Regardless of diversion choice you will both adapt, because that\u2019s what we humans do. It seems big and unwieldy now because it\u2019s foreign and scary. But many of us responding to you have been through it and here we are, telling our tale. There are many fears associated with this journey from pre treatment to post op, and we can all benefit from some help to figure it out. There is a support group at MSK that might be helpful for both of you. I encourage you to check it out. It\u2019s really quite helpful and reassuring to meet people who understand what you are going through.",
