    "Content": "Dr Lim, In your research and studies what have you found to be the most effective treatment in treating Triple negative MBC? I am BRCA1. I had TNBC 2012 stage 3a. Had chemo and later radiation. Went on with my life never thinking that it would be back. Was dx with MBC 2017. Since then I have been through several treatments. Most effective one was lynparza which only lasted 4 months as recent liver Mets did not respond to the lynparza. Liver Mets grew double the size in 4 months. Currently on gem/carbo. Not sure if it\u2019s working as scan are due November. I feel that there really is no effective treatment for TNBC especially MBC. It seems like there is always experimenting in trying to find something that works.....and nothing long term for my type of cancer. Any current treatments you recommend or clinical trials that are proving effective for TNBC MBC?",
