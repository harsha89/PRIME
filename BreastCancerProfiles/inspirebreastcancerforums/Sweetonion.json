    "Content": "I bought a large accordion type file from office store. It is divided into various Items. Lab values Correspondence with Dr\u2019s, Hospitals, Etc. Insurance and insurance related items. It is pretty big so I have plenty of room so far. I also have a second opinion section. And a section for print outs of studies I like. I also set my iPad folders to hold emails from various people. Studies. Etc. I create a new folder when needed. I also keep two diaries. One, a running, perpetual diary of anything related to PCa. The place, date, time and person Who did whatever. And a phone number. Everything. And I mean everything goes in this log. A second log for PSA trends, date of any Medical done to me ( X-ray, blood drawn, dental, vision, etc. ). If it is medical in nature, it\u2019s in this log. I have the place, Date, time, person(s) doing it, phone and alternate phone, email. Problems or positives, and a small narrative of what occurred. It was a bear to set up. But now is second nature. It\u2019s clean, up to date and info is findable. I don\u2019t have one for each year. It all goes in this file and logs until they fill up. When that happens, I will start a second. This may seem anal. I don\u2019t care. I have had arguments with Uro and my filing was in better shape than his. Information is indeed power. I like my iPad for all internet or email. But still print some of that out. I think just like Diet change, exercise change, you should treat records just as important. SO",
