    "Content": "Loved the \"Little Voice in My Head...\" article. What a strong young woman she is. I'm learning to live with the cosmetic awkwardness of using supplemental oxygen in public. I'm at a stage where I can get away without using it if I don't walk much, but it's a lot healthier and a lot less tiring when I do use it for walking. So the attitude and strength of the young, pretty writer, who has lived almost all her life with psoriasis over most of her body, is a great role model. Thank you for publishing her article.",
