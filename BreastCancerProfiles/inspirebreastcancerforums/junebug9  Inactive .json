      "Content": "I believe that some doctors are threatened by patients who have a medical background. My first oncologist, who I only saw once, asked me where I was getting my information from when I asked him questions during my first appointment. I was a dialysis nurse, not an oncology nurse, but had a boss who was an oncology nurse before going in to administration and a breast cancer survivor, a good friend who was an oncology nurse, several nurse friends who were breast cancer survivors and a best friend who is also a survivor. He told me that I was not to talk to them and to get all my information from him, but he would not answer any of my questions. Nurses always consult other nurses. Even my husband told him that his approach was \"not going to fly\" with me. I also refused radiation at first because I did not want the effects of it on my lung and heart. Eventually, I received radiation in the prone position. In other words, I don't do \"what the doctor says\" because I know the long term effects. My PCP and current oncologist both think they are the head of the team. I tell then that no, I am. I now I am a challenge to care for but I want to be treated as a college in my care and have discussions before decisions are made and my decisions respected. My old PCP did this since the time I entered nursing school. Unfortunately, he has died. As far as asking for help, I feel people want to help and don't know how. Letting them know how helps both them and you. Don't be afraid to ask. As a caregiver when I was a nurse, I found this very helpful.",
