    "Content": "That\u2019s very interesting. I finished 4 cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide in June 1 for my TNBC. Ultrasound on June 7 still suggested tumor was about 5 cm in the left breast. I started adding mistletoe (heluxor M) to my naturopathic IVs, and actually felt the tumor in both the breast and lymph nodes shrinking. It was like a buzzing in the area of the tumor. During the mastectomy on June 28th, pathology came back as dead tumor with no evidence of disease. Mistletoe works by stimulating the immune system, so your comments around doxorubicin now make sense. Thanks for that info!",
