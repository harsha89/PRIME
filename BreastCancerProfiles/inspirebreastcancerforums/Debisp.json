    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy and 1 lymph node removed and am considered stage 1B HER2 positive. I also have COPD and am on 2 liters oxygen. Decision was going to be made in recovery whether I would be hospitalized for a day(pulmonologist recommendation) or outpatient (breast surgeon recommendation). Was able to go home after recovery and was off pain meds in 2 days and felt fine. I did not have drainage tube. I had 20 radiation treatments, no problems, and have 1 infusion left of Herceptin, no problems. Have to have an echo cardio every 3 months along with blood work and see my chemo Dr. every 3 months until Herceptin infusions are done. I opted out of Taxol chemo due to my other health issues. I am on Exemestane for hormonal therapy to reduce my estrogen and that has been my biggest problem with side effect issues and have been working with my Dr. on best solutions as I did not tolerate the first med. You are your best advocate. My advice is be positive and talk to others and you will get through this. I was also given the advice to keep a journal which I have done. It makes it so much easier to go back and see dates, times, issues, etc. You Got This!",
