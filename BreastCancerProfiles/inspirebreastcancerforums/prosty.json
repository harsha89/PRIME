    "Content": "There is an old saying, \"If it tastes good don't eat it.\" Listening to this one and that one about what not to eat, there is nothing left to eat but the grass in your yard. I have always considered my diet as healthy. However, through life I have enjoyed a New York steak and prime rib but never had it very often. I no longer eat red meat. I haven't been one for fast food but I enjoy a piece of pizza once in awhile. I love eggs and could eat them every morning but I don't. I have them once a week or at most twice a week. Ice cream is probably my favorite food and I could eat three large bowls full daily but I don't. I haven't purchased ice cream probably for six or seven years. I do not eat refined sugar and feel it is a death sentence. Exercise plays a major part in good health. What's it all mean--is it worth depriving yourself of all the enjoyments of food to live a few days or perhaps if lucky a year or two longer? I am not so sure. I was diagnosed with having aggressive prostate cancer 10 years ago and decided to not have any procedure done. Of course, the urologist said I had my head in my butt with my decision. Reading all the posts of guys that have had procedures done and the problems they are having from having them done is heartbreaking. To lose all control of body functions to me couldn't be worse, along with all the post treatments needed from having the procedure done. It certainly has to play a major part in your social life. Personally, I would rather be dead.",
