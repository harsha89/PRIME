    "Content": "The disease I have, sarcoidosis, is systemic and I have quite a few different specialists on my medical team: rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, hematology, dermatology, ophthalmology, pulmonology, ENT.... you get the idea. It is not unusual to get conflicting treatment advice, it happens quite often. So far, I have not had to make an emergency decision so I've had time to get additional input and make the decision. My primary care doctor, while not a specialist in my disease, has always been willing to listen to my thoughts and help me sort out options so I can make the decision that is best for me. If I do have an emergency? I suspect I'll take the advice of the specialist treating me for the emergency condition.",
