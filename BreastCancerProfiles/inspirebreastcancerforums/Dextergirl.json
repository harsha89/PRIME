    "Content": "Often with breast cancer treatment we get de conditioned and depressed. I have a couple of suggestions that might be helpful. Start a walking program - even just 20 minutes a day and there is a OTC supplement called SAMe which is great for energy, depression and joint pain that I have been taking since my breast cancer treatment. It really helps especially with depression/ energy. To avoid insomnia take in the morning 400 to 800 mgs daily.",
