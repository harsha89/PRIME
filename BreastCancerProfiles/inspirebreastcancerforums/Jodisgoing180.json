    "Content": "I think my biggest pet peeves are: - giving me unsolicited advice. If I want your opinion I will ask for it. - telling me that you are going to help, and then not follow through on it. My MIL came to visit, she was insistent that she was here to help with house work. She did nothing. On one of the last days of her visit, I was feeling OK, so I cleaned the house. After I was done, she decried that had cleaned the house, and then proceeded to eat a roast beef sandwich without a plate, and got juice all over the floor I just cleaned. - sending me links on diets, miracle cures, etc. - before cancer I was a marathoner, and the implication that all that time I spent working out was for nothing. Umm no, I enjoyed every minute of my running, it was not for nothing. - or not listening when I say I do not want to talk about it. I put it on my caring bridge site that I didn't want to talk about cancer constantly, and I get a 5 page text from my MIL stating that it's good for me to talk about it. I have finally got to the point where I will delete and block anyone who does not listen to my wishes anymore.",
