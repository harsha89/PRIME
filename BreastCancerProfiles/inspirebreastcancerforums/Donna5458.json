    "Content": "I am the caregiver for my husband of 52 years. He has been my strength since I met him at 15. He was so healthy till 2 and 1/2 years ago. Now he has esophagus cancer stage 4 copd and now is nearing having to go on dialysis. I try to take as good care of him as he has always taken care if me but sometimes it is o hard. A lot to do but just as hard is seeing him this way. When things get really bad I think how much harder it will be when he is no longer here. I work part time but have a wonderful boss who let's me call off whenever I need to. I find that if I can occasionally get out to lunch with friends it makes It a little easier. I have pushed him to do all the doctors say to try but with the dialysis i have decided to let him make this decision i have come to the conclusion that it is his life and he has endured so much already he is on a feeding tube since he can hardly eat anything and is on oxygen 24 7 he is weak and spends a lot of time sleeping. I pray for every caregiver that God gives us the strength we need to handle whatever he has in store for us.",
