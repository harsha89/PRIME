    "Content": "I was diagnosed with bladder cancer in May, and my urologist said the same thing to me! After the surgery, he minimized it even further. As cancers go, however, I'd rather hear the above than being told that I had stage 4 lung cancer, as my brother was told when he was diagnosed with cancer four days before I was diagnosed. You know what everyone is thinking about his cancer (which is not responding to treatment) but is afraid to say out loud. Living in the shadow of my brother's grave illness, my family has forgotten all about my recent bout with \"the best kind of cancer.\" That's fine with me! All things considered - and bearing in mind that not all bladder cancer patients have the \"best\" outcome - I'd still rather have the \"best kind of cancer\" and forgive comments from people who may just be trying to be encouraging, optimistic and probably relieved that you're expected to recover. I just had my second follow-up cystoscopy. It's been over 6 months since my TURBT, and still no recurrence. I'm starting to think that \"maybe I'll be one of the lucky ones.\" You might consider responding with something like that when someone informs you that you have the \"best kind of cancer.\" I wish you all the best, bsinger1207.",
