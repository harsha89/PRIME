    "Content": "My gastroenterologist just retired 3 months ago, and he had been my primary physician since 1982. The dozens of surgeries, the extended hospitalizations, the years of TPN, the central line nightmares...he was there EVERY step along my journey. My husband died of brain cancer, and my doctor would stop by to visit my husband whenever he was in the hospital. Yes, I have a huge family network of support. But my GI doctor really coached me through a hell of a lot. My final appointment with him was humorous, reflective, yet sad at the same time. We both shed a few tears. I was amazed that he remembered more about my entire medical history over 3 decades than I did. He. Knew. Me. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m grieving. It\u2019s more like I\u2019m rattled to the core. His partner (who saw me when on weekend call) took over the practice. They are completely different in every way. But I wasted no time in scheduling with him. I now feel better about the continuity of my care, as the appointment was long and thorough. We all have fostered our own relationships with our doctors, and I know others will have a different reaction. I\u2019m just grateful that my now retired GI doctor had the knowledge, bedside manner, and patience to help me get this far. Sheryl",
