      "Content": "Speaking Freely Virtual Support Group - Thursday, April 18 8 pm Eastern; 7 pm Central; 6 pm Mountain; 5 pm Pacific; 2 pm Hawaii Thursday evening, April 18th at 8pm EST, we discuss 'time' and other important subjects in a men-only environment. The format is informal, the conversation enlightening and encouraging. Speaking Freely is a support group for men with cancer, any cancer. It is a place for us to open up without being judged. Every man there has cancer and every man there has fears. You will be among friends that want to help. The perception of time is very subjective. A month has passed since our last gathering, but it feels like just last week. We face this paradox while waiting for labs or the results of labs or our next treatment. At times it seems as if our lives are out of control and spinning wildly only to be followed by a turtle, slowly crawling across the ground and the day will never end. How has your perception of time changed since you heard those life changing words \"You have cancer\"? The requirement to make a decision, the rush of trying to find information that applies to your circumstances and determine your best course of action while waiting for tests and their results. Hurry up and Wait. Please join us at 8pm EST on the 3rd Thursday of each month and let your voice support your brothers.

People who responded &/or lived and worked in Lower Manhattan during and after the Towers collapsed may be entitled to assistance with their medical costs and compensation. Many of these folks were diagnosed several years later and may have moved away, while First Responders visited from all parts of the country. Since only 90,000 claims have been processed and some 450,000 were impacted, a large number remain and many are unaware of their benefits. And many are men living with prostate cancer - unless their medical team were sharp enough to pick it up in the intake, they would never know their rights.

In the absence of our fearless leader, Renata Louwers , who is swishing her grass skirt and sipping mai-tai's on tropical Maui, her trusty co-moderators Debra Swiderslki and Susan Lahaie will selflessly step-in from the Eastern cold - actually Susan may be 'swishing' in the S. Pacific too so Rick Davis may be required from recently warmer Deep Southern Arizona! If you are a caregiver for someone with advanced cancer, or you know anyone who is, please let them know about this group. And we welcome the recently bereaved. Our peer moderators have both lived as caregivers to advanced cancer patients and also lost partners to cancer. Answer Cancer's Advanced Cancer Caregiver Virtual Support Group meets 8 p.m. Eastern time (5p Pacific) on both the first and third Tuesdays of the month. In March, we will meet on Tuesday, March 5 and March 19. The group is FREE & DROP-IN; join online or by telephone - you can find the instructions for joining at the end of the message. AnCan's caregiver meeting is a gentle, supportive, upbeat, peer-led space to talk - or just listen - about caregiving for any type of advanced cancer. We talk about whatever you wish to discuss - it is your time and space to talk about any- and everything caregiver related. We also welcome those who have recently lost loved one to discuss coping strategies. Renata Louwers, Debra Swiderski and Susan Lahaie co-moderate. Joining instructions are below; you can phone in or join via computer with just audio or audio plus video. All are welcome - it's free and drop-in! Whilst free & drop-in, we do encourage you to make a tax-deductible donation if you are able to; or to sign up to donate to the Answer Cancer Foundation when you shop on Amazon. You can sign up here Amazon Smile - it costs you nothing! We hope to talk with you soon; please e-mail us with any questions. For more information please visit our website www.ancan.org.

      "Content": "FREE & DROP-IN The question for the evening is \"How would you describe your mental health?\". Looking in a mirror is one of the hardest things we have to do. Sometimes the scariest thing we have to deal with is what is looking back from that mirror. Being honest with what we see is vital to our moving forward and prospering. Let's take a few minutes before the call and give ourselves a good look. We have been challenged by our doctors, insurance companies and our own bodies. Lets make sure our heads are screwed on straight and in our corner. When we discuss our experiences, we empower ourselves and help other men with the issues they face. Our shared knowledge makes us more powerful, more informed and better able to face the day. You will have time talk if you wish. I found talking about the things bothering me allowed the other men on the call to help me with their knowledge and wisdom. You will hear stories and questions from other men as well. Some of us just want to listen and comment once in a while. Please join us on Wednesday night on a call with men just like you. Men with cancer, any cancer. Only men on the call, no judgement, no hiding. You maybe newly diagnosed or a survivor with years under your belt, you are welcome to join us. We want to hear your voice. You are not alone. John Teisberg Founder, The Reluctant Brotherhood email: john@thereluctantbrotherhood.org website: thereluctantbrotherhood.org PS. Please let other men with cancer know about this, they are not alone. They can check us out and there\u2019s no commitment. PPS. Check out the technical calls at: ancan.org ; there are a whole bunch of cool calls you can join there. JOINING INSTRUCTIONS Use your preferred method: ONLINE Click here or paste the link below into your browser: https://www.gotomeet.me/AnswerCancer You will be using your microphone and speakers (VoIP). A USB headset is recommended for the best sound quality. To minimize background noise, please mute your mic when not speaking PHONE You can also dial in using your phone. United States +1 (646) 749-3129 Canada +1 (647) 497-9353 Australia +61 2 8355 1020 Access Code: 222-583-973 ................ About the call: This is a simple conference call where we learn, talk about ideas, give and get opinions and figure out how to support each other. We are not doctors, we are the men who are in the game for real. We are the ones who are actually living with the cancer. This is not a very technical call because we talk about what is going on inside our hearts and minds. We poke around with our emotional lives, the unmeasurable stuff. We work with things 'men' are not supposed to talk about. We discuss emotions, those raw feelings we all have and usually keep to ourselves. All of them are on the table. Speaking about feelings and emotions is not in the comfort zone of most American men. Although it seems risky, these are the conversations most of us are dying to have. The guys on the call are friendly survivors who are ready to talk with men in the same boat. .............. What happens on the call? Usually there is a lot of laughing on the call because we tease each other and enjoy each others company. Humor is one way to approach the anger, fear, joy and sadness we all carry. We talk about pain, good reports, our families, death, sex, stupid things we do, money, fun things we have done, death and dying, tell crappy jokes and more. We do, however, stay away from politics. Although there is a fair amount of laughing the call is tempered with deadly serious conversations. We are all dealing with changes we do not want. We\u2019ve been dealt a crappy hand and you know there are powerful repercussions for that. There are not many people a guy can really talk to about what\u2019s happening inside. Often a guy simply wants advice about how to handle stuff. You will get good opinions from other men who are going through the same kind of mischief. You might pick up an idea that works for you, for where you are on your journey, from the call. Sometimes a good rant makes your troubles get more \u2018right sized\u2019. Everybody enjoys a well crafted rant. At the end of those we are all usually smiling because we\u2019ve all run into the same sort of problems. Anger, sadness, fear, confusion, joy, discoveries and frustration are all welcome here. These conversations are rich and sometimes very dark. You don\u2019t have to talk, you can simply listen if you want. Talking about numbers and procedures is kept to a minimum. We also know these things are going to be part of our conversation because they are important. The moderator\u2019s job is to keep us on track talking about the unmeasurable things, our feelings. ................... When exactly is the call? Every Wednesday evening.Start time: 8 pm EST, 7 pm CST, 6 pm MST, 5 pm PST.",
