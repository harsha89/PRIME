    "Content": "Hello mjlon, I don't elevate the foot of my bed - I feel like you do - impossible! I purchased a wedge from Amazon for about $40. I used it for a time...elevating my LE leg during the night. I then found a better version, a Lounge Doctor Leg Rest. It was more expensive (about $100) but contoured to fit my leg at the calf better and was a lot less stiff. I bought it at Ames Walker and have used it for more than a year. I love it! I often put both legs on it and when I wake up at night, my leg is still positioned on it. I think it helps the swelling of my foot and ankle. I now use the Amazon wedge in my recliner to give a bit of extra elevation to my LE leg. Belinda",
