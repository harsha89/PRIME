    "Content": "If they have young children, then coloring books/crayons, or a small toy. The few times I had to bring our kids with us to appointments, the staff gave them something to play with. It was super helpful because I often didn\u2019t remember that stuff. Also, offers to watch kids or take them to do something special. My Mom lived with us during my husband\u2019s radiation treatment, but she wasn\u2019t up to taking my kids on outings. So I was very grateful for friends who picked my older daughter up for an occasional play date. Also, particularly once a cancer patient is home from the hospital, visits are nice. We had many visitors in the hospital, which was lovely for me (my husband doesn\u2019t remember most of it, though he appreciated it at the time). But once we were home, no one came to visit and as he got better, he was pretty lonely.",
