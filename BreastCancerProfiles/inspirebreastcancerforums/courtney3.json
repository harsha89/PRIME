    "Content": "I now shred my lab work reports and all explanation of benefits that are over 2 years old. They are simply landfill and my complete history is on My Chart. I keep all medical related stuff in one big folder. I will sort and file at the end of the year. Filing each month was unnecessary and tedious. I pay the invoices as they arrive. I used to keep all the scan reports, but they are shredded too, after about two scan periods. My hospital is very digital so I don\u2019t need to keep it all, it is redundant.",
