      "Content": "Another great resource for help in interpreting your path reports is at breastcancer.org. I heartily second the suggestion to mark up your reports and ask a ton of questions of your team (and ask if there\u2019s a nurse navigator too!). I went through this just before Christmas 5 years ago and I\u2019ll admit one of the biggest scares was the word \u201cinvasive\u201d. In this context it just means that the cancer has started to grow through the duct wall, which is where the vast majority of cancers start. It means you really do need treatment- there is some debate whether DCIS even needs treatment - but it doesn\u2019t necessarily signal a particularly aggressive form of cancer, which is what I wrongly assumed. Those other tumor characteristics in your path report relate that. Tumor aggressiveness is something to discuss with your doctor but don\u2019t assume it the way I did. And yes I\u2019m 5 years NED - No Evidence of Disease",

      "Content": "Do not take ANY supplements. You\u2019d think it would be a good idea to help your body along during the stress of chemo, right? Well years back most docs thought so too and recommended supplementation- until it was found out there were higher rates of recurrences among those supplementing. Turns out those supplements helped those cancer cells hang on and fight the chemo. (This is true for radiation too). Which is why it is recommended to forgo all supplements for until, I think, 3 months after active treatment ends, which is how long it takes for the cancer cells to finish dying. I personally wouldn\u2019t want to go through this again, particularly as cells that survive chemo tend to be more immune to it and harder to treat. It\u2019s hard to wait, I know, to do something active that\u2019s good for your body. Eat healthy (that\u2019s encouraged), exercise if you can and stay hydrated and wait until you get an all clear from your onc team before starting supplements. A site I find very useful is from Sloan Kettering aboutherbs.com First fight, then heal",
