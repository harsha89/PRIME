    "Content": "It is hard to tell you what to expect because each person reacts differently but i\u2019d Like to share my reaction. I had 3 months of weekly Taxol and Herceptin. I am 63 years old and I have moderate COPD. I think age and general health has a lot to do with your reaction. I kept my taste and was able to eat well through my treatment. I was on high protein diet of 60 grams daily at least and gained 15 pounds. I had bowel movements every hour with severe cramping. This turned into diarrhea the last month of chemo. I had shakes and muscle spasms and twitches in my extremities and eyes. I had neuropathy in my fingers and toes and that continues 3 months out. I lost my hair in a month and it didn\u2019t start to grow back until one month past chemo. I experienced extreme fatigue and had to just stay in bed some days and just sleep. I had to go on oxygen for my COPD within one month of starting chemo and I\u2019m still fighting to get off of it. I had nausea the last month of treatment. Fortunately I had Imodium and Zofran for nausea to take immediately for any symptom and my oncologist was very honest and upfront about everything that was going to happen to me. The most important thing to do is make sure you drink at least 72 ounces of water daily! You will feel so much better! Premeds take 30 minutes to infuse. Herceptin takes 30 minutes. Taxol takes 1 hour. The worst side effect for me is chemo brain. I can\u2019t remember things just told to me. I have a very difficult time recalling names of things or people. I have to write everything down. It doesn\u2019t appear to be improving over time. I had a great support group of friends that provided meals on infusion days and provided transportation to and from infusions. I couldnt clean my house so I think it is important to have someone that will clean your bathrooms and kitchen etc and keep everything bleached and germ free. My husband, who hardly did anything prior, made all of my meals and had to take on household duties as well as going out and driving Uber on the weekends to try and recoup some of my missed wages. I guess I\u2019ve rambled long enough! I feel that being forewarned is being forearmed. It allows you to face everything with strength instead of fear! Good luck and please ask any other questions you may have at any time.",
