    "Content": "I was Dx MBC in September 2016 and am ER+ HER-. I am on cycle 27 of I/L plus Xgeva for very extensive bone mets. My original Dx of bc was in 2004. I am a long time vegetarian, active and feel well although my bones do hurt but I try to avoid painkillers as much as possible. Now to my question - I read all the time about fasting and cutting out sugar and using supplements etc. As a veggie I eat lots of carbs and I love chocolate and all things sugar. I think my basic diet is good but I really like my food and eat a lot of things that appear to suggest are feeding my cancer. I do not take any supplements or other meds. I would welcome your advice on diet, fasting, supplements etc. in this context?",
