      "Content": "I don't know about grieving, but when you get a doctor that you like and respect, its a tough day when they retire or move on. My PCP just retired a few weeks ago. I didn't have him very long, but he was a good old fashioned country doctor and he was someone I had respect and confidence that he had my best interest in. The doctor I'm going to really miss will be the day my neurologist moves on or retires. She is one of the best in her field and just an amazing lady to know. That day will be tough.",

      "Content": "Doctors have always played an important role in our lives. The old family doctors cared for grandparents, parents, brought children into the world and attended many a funeral. In smaller communities, the doctor is more than just a doctor, he's a friend, a mentor, an advice giver as well as being that caregiver we turn to when we are sick. I think its a normal reaction to form a bond with doctors and it goes with it, that when the bond is broken, there is a sense of loss or grief. Its a good subject. It got me thinking back to my families long time doctor who worked into my late twenties, early thirties and knew so much of my families history.",
