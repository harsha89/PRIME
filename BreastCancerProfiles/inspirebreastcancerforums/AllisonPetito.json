    "Content": "Just looking for side effects and/or experiences of anyone who has had CMF chemo. I was recently diagnosed with ER positive, stage 1 breast cancer and had a lumpectomy to remove the tumor. My oncotype test came back and it turns out that I need chemo, which I just started. I was wondering if anyone else is currently on CMF chemo, or has been in the past, and could share their experiences with me. Thanks so much! Edited March 30, 2019 at 8:14 pm",
