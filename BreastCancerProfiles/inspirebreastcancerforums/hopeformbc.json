    "Content": "Dear Dr. Lim, I was diagnosed with Stage 0 DCIS in 2013. Had a lumpectomy and radiation and then 5 years of clear mammograms. In May 2018 was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer stage 4 when my femur broke. Have been on Ibrance and Letrozole since August. Several days ago, I was informed that I am triple negative. What is your recommended treatment for a patient who is triple negative with bone mets? Best regards, hope4mbc",
