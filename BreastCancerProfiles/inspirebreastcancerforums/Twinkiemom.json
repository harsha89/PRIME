      "Content": "I don't recall anyone saying anything upsetting or infuriating when I was ill with cancer. But we didn't tell anyone except a few close friends at first, because we really didn't know much. When I went in for surgery, where I got a definite diagnosis, I decided to tell family because surgery always carries some risk. Everyone was worried for me, but I didn't really get any comments I didn't like. I got lots of support from real and virtual friends. Susan",
