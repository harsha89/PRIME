    "Content": "Hi SisofMBC, my condolences & frustrations with your sister's experience. If you haven't come across it yet, there are quite a few therapeutic options for HER2+ MBC patients, and many of them have far fewer side-effects than traditional chemo. Most of the big cancer centers can provide \"Next Generation Sequencing\" (molecular testing) for her tumor, and make a recommendation for a clinical trial with a next-generation targeted agent. There are antibody therapies (biologics), and more targeted therapies to choose from (in clinical trials). My best wishes, and I'll try to monitor the post if you have any future questions",
