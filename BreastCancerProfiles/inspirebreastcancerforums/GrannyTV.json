I do know that if I take OTC meds without alcohol, the success rate not that good. But if I take an OTC med with alcohol....most of the time it works (and if I tried the non-alcohol first, then tried the alcohol one....success -- no more cold symptoms. Usually. I was reading about thyrotoxicosis and it can be transferred to the newborn (the effects etc.). I did a post about it called Buyer Beware. Hepatic toxicity....hepatitis.... But the article said \"rarely\". One lady said one child of hers got hepc, but the other child didn't. Another post I did was on genotype. The genome concerns the DNA of a cell or an organism. I heard about testing to see if a current hepc med will not be effective...if you are resistant. Lots to be learned.",
