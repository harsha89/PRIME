      "Content": "Greetings! Inspire\u2019s Research Team recently completed a project exploring diversity in clinical trials. Research Manager Marina Shayevich presented the results during a webinar and the team would like to share more details about the research with the community! You may listen to a recording of the presentation here: Inspire members who indicated an interest in breast cancer were invited to participate in this project and lend their insights about clinical trial perceptions, understanding, and decision-making. The research team interviewed thirty people by phone - 15 patients and 15 caregivers. Among the key findings: Patients and caregivers who identify as non-Caucasian struggle to trust medical care teams. Care coordination and support services were an unmet need for all participants. Transparency from physicians is critical for fostering trust. Patients said they would appreciate advice on how diet and exercise can support a healthy lifestyle as part of a holistic treatment plan. Patients and caregivers said they would like more information about clinical trial options sooner in the treatment journey. These findings may be used to help design clinical trials in the future. The Research Team collaborated with a sponsoring partner for this project and, per the contract, both the partner and the participants remain anonymous from each other. Many thanks to the participants for their insights and to those who expressed interest in participating. If you have further questions, feedback, or would like to know more about being involved in research projects, please send a message to team@inspire.com.
