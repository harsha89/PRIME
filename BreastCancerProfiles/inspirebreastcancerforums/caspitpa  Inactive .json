    "Content": "The sense of loss of my PCP was not due to his retirement or death but to his small, but caring, practice being swallowed by a monopolistic local medical facility. Dr. B came into my life in the ER (I had suffered a stroke). I had no physician at the time--totally distrusted them (my Mom had been in a nursing home for six years and it was a never-ending fight-to-the-finish with doctors to ensure Mom's care). But Dr. B seemed kinder, gentler--he assured me he didn't practice medicine like the \"other doctors\" I had met along the way. Over a period of eight years, he walked with me through a stroke, two cancers and a permanent colostomy. Then one day in May 2016 he suddenly became one of the \"other doctors.\" I noticed he was distracted as soon as he walked into the exam room. When I asked him about knee pain, he sharply retorted: \"Do you want a shot?\" I was stunned and said \"no.\" His cell phone rang. He reached into his pocket and answered the phone. He turned to me and said: \"I have to take this call--the 'boss' is calling\" and immediately left the room. I sat there for 10 minutes. When he returned, he tossed a sample bottle of Celebrex my way, told me to take them and if they helped with the pain he'd give me a prescription. Before I could say that following my stroke he told me not to take any pain med other than Tylenol Regular, he left the exam room. My appointment was over. Several days after my appointment the mega-medical provider announced Dr. B's practice was being absorbed by a larger practice and that Dr. B would be assuming an administrative role in the medical provider (but would keep a \"select group\" of patients). I didn't stick around to find out whether I was one of his \"select group.\" I moved on to Dr. B's associate who had previously treated me. From the frying pan into the fire: she doesn't do a cursory exam or even a blood pressure reading--she spends the appointment at the computer. With her back to me, she'll ask if I have any questions/complaints. If I did, I wouldn't share--she, like the \"other doctors\" has no interest in her patients. Yes, I should move on but, at this point, I no longer care. As long as she'll renew my blood pressure/heart meds and sign the script for my colostomy supplies, I will not \"troll the waters\" for a caring doctor. There are none. And as long as these mega-medical facilities are allowed to keep swallowing up the few docs who do (or, at one time, did) care, we, the patients, are tossed aside like used Kleenex. I am, once again, grieving a loss of trust in the medical profession--a trust which I will NEVER allow myself to rebuild. To mega-medical organizations, I'm nothing more than a walking dollar sign--go along with its \"life-changing medicine\" BS and all will be fine--just keep lots of cash flowing their way. For those of us having to deal with medical professionals and organizations in today's world, Kenny Rogers' song \"The Gambler\" sums it up nicely: \"... and the best that you can hope for is to die in your sleep.\" Carol",
