    "Content": "I lost my pcp. It was like loosing a family member. I cried forever. I have found another but I still cry for him. He is not dead he is practicing somewhere else. I\u2019d love to see him but I think it\u2019s best to let go. I\u2019m sure where he is my insurance doesn\u2019t allow. I also lost my 2nd pcp after about a year. I now have another I really like she\u2019s young but so nice and caring. I lost 4 other doctors who were great. I get to move with one she takes my insurance. Having a lot of trouble finding replacements for the others. Soon I\u2019m afraid we will have a shortage of doctors and nurses. I keep loosing them every year. Scary!!!!!",
