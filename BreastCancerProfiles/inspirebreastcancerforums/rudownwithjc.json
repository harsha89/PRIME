    "Content": "Definitely grieved my cardiologist and probably still grieving him. We had a close bond he saved my life many times and we got to know each other pretty well and when he retired he picked his replacement with his business partner who helped start the cardiologist clinic here in town. My new cardio always mentions my old cardiologist so I think their still communicating maybe even in a consulting capacity but I've never seen him again. Still building my trust with my current cardiologist but he's nice enough can't complain except he's not my old cardiologist. My endocrinologist recently retired and I know he's stayed on as consulting with my new one. He also picked out my new Dr. So maybe they all do that and I never realized it before. While it hurts when they retire I wouldn't trade not getting to know them so I guess it's just life.",
