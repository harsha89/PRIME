    "Content": "Oh, my! I can't even imagine! No, this did not happen to me, and I am so very sorry it happened to you. I don't understand the thinking to only biopsy one. I had masses in both breasts - only one side malignant. I don't think I'm unique. When they found the larger mass on the right, the radiologist identified a small mass on the left - which she said she was 99% certain just a fibroadenema, but she also said \"once the results come back from the right, they will want to biopsy the left. want to go ahead and do it today?\" To which I replied YES. It did, indeed, come back benign, but of course I would want to know that. Boggles the mind that they would only biopsy one side on you. I cannot express my shock or sympathy enough. How are you doing?",
