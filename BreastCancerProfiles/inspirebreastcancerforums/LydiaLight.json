    "Content": "Each one of us is in that phase of our treatment where we have decisions to make with almost every visit to our doctor. Yes some are easy and others we agonize over but most seem to be those we have to make right away. My doctor put me on Xgeva about a year ago after my having been on, then off Zometa for several years. As in the side effects reported I did have necrosis in the jaw area after five years on Zometa and after a year am having similar symptoms with Xgeva. What to do? When I came to the cancer center I was assigned a doctor and have trusted her with my life for the past almost eight years. She has always looked for the best treatments for me, listened to my questions and, when appropriate, let me try a medication I've read about here on Inspire and researched. I feel I'm coming to the end of my journey (in a year or two) but will trust her to take me there. For others just starting I would definitely suggest finding a doctor they can trust fully. One who listens and responds and even thinks about their best interest not only when they are sitting in front of that doctor. Stay cheerful and upbeat and trust the doctor and God to know what's best.",
