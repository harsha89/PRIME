    "Content": "Ever try to get a medical record CORRECTED? I've been trying for over a year to get one of the two major groups where I live (I access the whole network on line) to correct my ALLERGIES. This is IMPORTANT. They have me allergic to meds I'm not because I long ago listed my allergies when going to dr(s) & their NEW program broke my allergies into their COMPONENTS and listed me as allergic to all ingredients. This is like my saying I'm allergic to German Chocolate Cake & they're saying I'm allergic to chocolate (yes), nuts (yes), and EGGS (NO!) Was told, \"We got the information from your DOCTOR,\" & I said, \"AND WHO DO YOU THINK THE DOCTOR GOT THE INFORMATION FROM?! I FILL OUT A FORM WHEN I GO TO A NEW DR AND THEY ALWAYS ASK FOR ALLERGIES -- OF WHICH I HAVE MANY!\"",
