    "Content": "I was wife/caregiver for my husband who was DX with lung cancer Jan 2017. I had just lost my Mom in December 1 month before he was diagnosed. I had also been with her through her symptoms as well, but with her being so independent, not really a caregiver. I didn\u2019t have time to mourn her, I was thrown into my new role. Yes, I was mad, guilty, and felt cheated. The wonderful man that he was had the insight to talk with me daily. About his pain, his future (ours) and told me he would fight it. I know he did it for me. We planned funerals, got headstone, and all other issues together. In the end, I had 6 months left with him. I don\u2019t know how I would have felt if it was 10 years, but I sure wish I had the opportunity to find out. I am half the person I was now, because he took half with him. I know all circumstances differ and all treatments work differently. I have joy for all that are 2, 4 even 10 years out with NED. I\u2019m not bitter...just wish I could have done more for him. I feel guilty that I am here without him, and guilty that I led his lead his treatment, in the end when he said no more because he couldn\u2019t breathe, I wonder if I had pushed if he would have had more time. I told him I would support him and I did, I didn\u2019t necessarily like it! To all the caregivers...there is no right or wrong way or beliefs. Just trust that you are giving the best care you can for as long as you can. Deb",
