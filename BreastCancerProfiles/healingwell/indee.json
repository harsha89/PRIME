      "Content": " Amazing how the imagination can get away from you (me!). \nThank God my 2nd mammo turned out fine! They said more than likely my symptoms/CT findings along with the 1st mammo wouldn't have been related anyway. I was picturing wide spread cancer...boy, am I a nut! \nI still have to address the CT findings, but I am feeling so much better!\nGod's best blessings to those waiting for their results! ",

      "Content": " I'm 51 and really scared! Had a mammogram call back for changes seen since last mammo. I go back for the repeat mammo tomorrow.\nHad a CT scan which showed \"enlarged, slightly modular uterus to 12 cm with a cyst on my left ovary. Also, a \"probably benign\" 1 cm indeterminate sclerotic focus in the T8 vertebral body, may be a bone island or related Schmorl's node type irregularity.\" It also noted \"early lung base emphysema\" and a \"small non-obstructing kidney stone.\"\nMy fear is that this is breast cancer that has spread all over. My lymph nodes frequently feel enlarged and are a uncomfortable from time to time (underarms, left breast and neck). \n25 yrs ago I had a needle biopsy for some fiber type cysts of my left breast. They said it was benign. 20 years ago I had to have my right ovary removed due to a very large cyst (orange sized). It was benign. Also, a cone biopsy for some per-cancerous cells. Paps have been fine ever since. most recent 1 month ago. \nAgain, I am really scared. Waiting for information from the dr's is driving me crazy. Dr. wants me to go in for a colon endoscopy as I've had some blood in my stool (most likely due to a first time hemorrhoid that was discovered.)\nIt this too much or too coincidental? Is it painting a picture of someone with late stage cancer that has spread to many areas? Am I simply jumping to conclusions? \nPlease, someone tell me if you have a gut level feeling about\n this. Please!\nThanks, and sorry to be a so long winded and such a baby. ",
