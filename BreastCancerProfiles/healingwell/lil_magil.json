      "Content": " Thanks Elizabeth,\nThe doctor said there is a local type procedure they do for it and it differs depending on if it is cancer. Still i am a bit numb over all this. Since it is behind the nipple i can imagine it wont be fun. I have arthritis and fibromyalgia. If i were to have chemo or radiation it would destroy what little quality of life i have right now. This is my main concern. Ya know i hope they are close to finding out what causes it. Or a real cure that dont destroy you immune system. ",

      "Content": " WOW! That was amazing. Support is everything hu? Thank you for the quick response. No discharge this morning. I spoke with my sister and she reminded me that my breasts always had stabbing pains when i was pregnant. I quickly reminded her that my morning sickness was my real clue and i am not feeling any nausea. I have never had one single menopause symptom. My mother never did -her periods just tapered down to a stop. No hormone drugs or hot flashes. Must have been her reward for having 6 babies. Thanks again for the support. I will let u know.\nlil ",
