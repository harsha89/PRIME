      "Content": " Bev, \nThank you for your response.... I do know how rare it would be for a 21 year old male, haha, but I'm just worrying myself to death, and I keep touching it which I'm sure doesn't help. Idk if I'm expecting to touch it one day and it be gone or what haha... but it is getting to the point where if I take my shirt off I can see the difference from one side and the other, and I already have the scars from surgery, so this doesn't help. I'm in good shape which also makes me see the difference more.\nI am going to set up another appointment as if I'm just sitting around, I'll look down or touch it and thoughts just fly through my head about\n the worst case scenario.\n21 Year Old Male\nDiagnosed with Moderate/Severe Ulcerative Colitis May 2008\n3 Flair ups (first flair- 2 months/Second Flair- 2 months/ Third flair- One week, then surgery)\n-Full Ileostomy surgery done on july 22! \n-J pouch DONE--January 6th\nLiving a COMPLETELY normal and active life with a J pouch!

      "Content": " Hey everyone.. I've been on the ostomies board for the past couple years as I suffered through 3 years of ulcerative colitis and finally got all surgeries done, and finally am done with that!\nWell now I am freaking myself out.... A while ago I found a small lump right under my left nipple. I am a 21 year old male and HAVE been on tons of medicine dealing with UC and have gone through a LOT of stress and hospital visits. I went to my doctor when I first felt it a while ago and he though it was (I forget the name) basically, acne under the skin from bacteria or a small cyst or just a fatty tissue. It was pretty small then and he gave me some antibiotic and it seemed to go down. \nWell, I feel like it is definitely bigger then it was before and now my left nipple is noticeably larger/pushed out more then my right. It is a tender lump (I've read cancer is usually painless) and it basically takes up the left half of my left nipple.... If I pull up my nipple/skin the bump feels like it's connected and comes up with it. \nAnyways of course in the back of my mind I am thinking breast cancer. I asked my doctor, \"so not cancer right?\" and he was very confident that it definitely wasn't cancer, but it does seem to be getting bigger (maybe it's in my head) but it seems bigger then it was I'm also really leaning towards that it is gynecomastia. I've read that some medications can cause the onset of this, one of those meds being meds for ulers! \n \nplease help me out because I'm freaking myself out, and I have gone through enough stress at 21.\n21 Year Old Male\nDiagnosed with Moderate/Severe Ulcerative Colitis May 2008\n3 Flair ups (first flair- 2 months/Second Flair- 2 months/ Third flair- One week, then surgery)\n-Full Ileostomy surgery done on july 22! \n-J pouch DONE--January 6th\nLiving a COMPLETELY normal and active life with a J pouch!\n ",
