      "Content": " Hi everybody -- I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts on my current situation.  I'm 36 years old and have 3 children (ages 2 - 8), each of whom I breastfed 18 months.  I had my 1st mammo last week (a \"baseline\") and have been called back in for a second (tomorrow morning).  From what I understand, I have a cluster of 20 microcalcifications in my left breast.  This also happens to be the same spot where I have been feeling tenderness.  In addition, I have been feeling \"twinges\" in my left armpit.  One more thought I have is that I took a few rounds of Accutane (strong acne med) when I was younger.  I know I'll be getting more info tomorrow, but I'd love to know what your thoughts are on this scenario.  Any advice on questions I should ask the radiologist?  Should I insist on a biopsy and copies of my records?\n ",

      "Content": " Hi! Thank you so much for replying. I had the second mammo done today and the radiologist recommended a needle biopsy. Although the microcalcs are \"predominantly punctate\" (benign), some are not, so they need to check it out. Although she told me 80 - 85% are benign in this situation, she said if they are malignant, due to my age, it would most likely be fast growing. Anyone on the board in their mid 30's ? Any thoughts on needle vs surgical biopsies in this scenario? ",
