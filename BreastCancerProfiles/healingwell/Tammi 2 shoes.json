    "Content": " I recently had a mammogram & have to go back due to some micro calcifications that showed up that we're not there on my last mammo. I have been through breast cancer 5 yrs ago had chemo & radiation but I also had the HER2 + gene. I am scared that I have a recurrence in the same breast. My first diagnosis was found because of microcars. Is there anybody else out there have the same thing or has had give me any advice on what to think. \nThank you. \nTammi 2 shoes \n ",
