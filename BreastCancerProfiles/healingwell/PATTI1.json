    "Content": " Patti, 55 yrs old, dianosed April 2005, chemo, surgery, radiation. As my husband says on my second life. Surgery showed no cancer. Still going through reconstruction surgeries. Walked in The 3 Day last year, Walking again this year. Have a Daughter, 2 sons, 2 grandsons and a granddaughter... I walk for them and all future generations. Sure would like to see this gone. \nOne benefit from walking, showed me I was back. Not that I ever did this before, but in some ways I am better than before. Every day is a blessing and I try to enjoy them all. God bless you all in you struggles. ",
