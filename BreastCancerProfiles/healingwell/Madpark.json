      "Content": " Hi Bev...\nThats too funny but also so true ! And of course now my one knee is shot and we can blame it on the extra weight gain along with the bone density loss due to the Tamoxifen... Now I get to have some shots of Synvisc to help with the knee pain and lubercation. I need a knee replacement but I am too young so I am hoping that this helps !! Just taking things one day at a time !!!\nKeeping fingers crossed for MMC tomorrow !!!\nHugs\nT ",

      "Content": " Hello Everyone,\nFirst, I have to say CONGRATS to everyone who has beaten cancer and for those that are just starting their journey, be strong !!! \nI have never ever joined a \"blog\" before so here it goes, here is part of my story.\nPeople say that they will never forget what they were doing when man first step on the moon, when Kennedy was shot, when Elvis and Marylyn Monroe died, and of course who could forget that dreadful day of Sept. 11th. \nWell, I have my own date, one that I will never forget, Sept 3rd 2010,\nI was sitting in my car on lunch break on a beautiful sunny Friday afternoon, when the call I had been waiting for finally came. It was my doctor and she was explaining to me my results of my mammogram. I remember hearing the traffic flying by, I heard the words, DCIS, non-invasive, invasive, cancer, all these big scary words, I remember looking up at the sky and thinking \" What is she sayin\"? \"Oh my God\", what do I do next? I had a lumpectomy, 2 lymph nodes removed and 6 weeks of radiation. In the beginning of my journey I was scared, scared of the dreaded \"c\" word, scared of the operations,treatments, and medications, scared of what could of happened if everyone didn't act so quickly. With the help of all the doctors and the support from all my loved ones, I have survived, and I have learned. I learned to be strong, believe in others, believe in myself and I feel that I am a better person now !\nThat was just about\n a year ago, and I am cancer free !!\nI am just about\n a year into taking tamoxifen, and yes, I too have gained weight, almost 20 lbs, horrible hot flashes, dryness, sleepless nights, too MUCH sleep sometimes, no energy whats so ever, but my main thing is, has anyone experienced \"temple\" headaches?? Its been about\n 3 months now, everyday!! Dr. sent me for cat scans and I am going for MRI next week....cat scan is fine. There will always be that thought of cancer but I think it might be the meds I am on, Lorazepam, zoloft, and tamoxifen. Please someone let me know if they are having this problem.\nHope everyone has a great Thanksgiving, I know I am thankful !!\nTracey ",

      "Content": " \n  MMC you can do it ! You HAVE to do it.  I was really scared as well but ask your Doctor lots of questions and learn of the cancer that you have.  Sorry to hear that you don't have the support from some family members but I am sure you have \"some\" support, lean on them. Also, they have great support groups out there, free and normally held at the hospital or cancer center that you are going to, if not check your local churches.  Everyone is always frightened when they hear the \"C\" word.  But you can do it.  It wasn't as bad as it sounds.  The 6 weeks of radiation flew by and its already been a year, sure there are side effects, but isn't there always with any meds we take?  I will ***** everyday about\n the weight I have gained and the loss of energy BUT, I am also thankful and blessed that my chances or it returning  are lowered.  I can always lose the weight.....I will be thinking of you this friday, my prayers will be with you.\n \n \n ",
