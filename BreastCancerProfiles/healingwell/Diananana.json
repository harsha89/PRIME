    "Content": " Question: I'm new here just looking for answers. Maybe i'm overreacting but just want your take on it. \nJust went for mammogram. Came back abnormal, dense breasts, wanted additional views and \n. I'm 48 yrs. Old. Had additional views and ultrasound. \nShowed the following on ultrasound: \nright breast: \n9 o'clock - 11 cm from nipple, 11x3x9 mm ovoid, hypoechoic mass with central echogenicity compatible with intramammary lymph node. \n9 o'clock - 5 cm from nipple, 8x3x8 mm intramammary lymph node. \nLeft breast: \n3 o'clock - 11 cm from nipple, 8x2x4 mm intramammary lymph node. \n2o'clock - 4 cm from nipple, 6x3x6 mm intramammary lymph node. \n3 o'clock - 4x3x4 mm intramammary lymph node. \nImpression: \nbenign appearing bilateral intramammary lymph nodes, three on left, two on right. \nBirads assessment: category 3 - probably benign \nrecommendations: advise 6 month sonographic follow-up of both breasts. \nI'm a wreck! I don't like the \"probably\" benign finding. To me that's not definitive enough for my peace of mind. I don't know why biopsy is not recommended to get that \"definitely\" benign finding. I've read that any lymph nodes larger than 1 cm should be biopsied which is the case with the one measuring 11x3x9mm. Isn't that 1.1 cm? \nDoes anyone know if \"benign appearing\" lymph nodes can one day become malignant? \nWhat do you think? Take their recommendation or pursue further. I need peace of mind. I have no breast cancer history in my family. Although there is history of cancer of maternal and paternal grandparents. I think the reason this scares me the most is that my mother-in-law was diagnosed in march with metatastic breast cancer (she was feeling okay but just didn't feel 100% so she went for check up). She sadly passed away 3 weeks later. \nThanks, \n ",
