    "Content": " Hello, I've never posted on this forum...My Mother-In-Law just had a lumpectomy Tuesday 1/10/12 and she's having some issues with her drain. My wife & my sister-in-law have been taking care of her during her post-op period. Her drain got clogged with blood clots and she had to return to the hospital to have it looked at. They are now going to leave the drain in longer than they had planned. Is this somewhat common following a lumpectomy? Another question I have is she's supposed to start 5 weeks of radiation therapy shortly after the surgery. What can she expect during the radiation therapy? Could she get sick? Will she have pain from the radiation? Will she lose her appetite? What precautions does she need to take? Thank you for any information you're able to give me.\nHerniated Lumbar Disks L5 S1, L2 L3\nHerniated Cervical Disks C6 C7\nSpinal Stenosis\nDegenerative Arthritis Left Knee...11 Surgeries\n \nPes Planus Both Feet\nMultiple Neuropathies\nBrachial Plexus/Thoracic Outlet Syndrome\nNerve Pain in Arms, Hands, Back, Legs, Feet, Groin, Testicles...11 Surgeries for Nerve Damage in Upper Extremities...27 Operations Total ",
