      "Content": " Thank you all so much...\nRather than retype it alll.... here is the email I sent to my family yesterday... kind of says it all and gives you a flavor for who we are:\nHello all,\nI know that sending an email is not the best way to disseminate information like this, but it seems to work pretty well for our family, so here goes.\nLinda had an abnormal mammogram and ultrasound last week and had to have a needle biopsy of a suspicious lump in her breast. They were also concerned about the lymph node under her arm so they biopsied that too.\nWe got the results yesterday and it is a good news/bad news thing. The bad news is that they did find malignant cancer cells in the breast lump. But the good news is that there is no sign of it spreading to the lymph nodes.\nWe also caught it early, which makes a difference. \nWe are going to speak to a surgeon on Monday to get more information, but from what we surmise so far, it will mean having a lumpectomy to remove the lump and perhaps some chemotherapy and other pharmaceuticals to bolster that. But again, we don't really have all the information yet and I will certainly keep everyone posted (or as Linda says, keeping everyone abreast of it...).\nNo, we haven't lost our sense of humor. Last night for dinner we had boob-shaped pasta with chicken breasts. As her Cousin Florence (in her 90's) was fond of saying whenever chicken was served, \"Each part strengthens a part\". We can only be grateful it wasn't rectal cancer.\nWe also got the results from our cat's urine test on the same day, and unless there was a cosmic screwup, we're pretty sure it's Calvin whose kidney's are functioning normally and Linda has the breast cancer diagnosis.\nAlso, we have not told Caitlin and Justin [bc folks: my kids, 14 and 16, living across the country] yet as we want to have more information before we speak to them personally.\nLove,\nFrank\n ",

      "Content": " OK, we just got back from the doctor.... he was very nice (Dr. Minami in Bellevue, WA). He answered all our questions and really seemed to listen to our concerns and he offered up a lot of suggestions and alternatives.\nSo here's what we have:\n- Ductal Carcinoma In Situ and Invasive (correction)\n- 1.3 cm, close to surface\n- Histologic Pattern: Solid\n- Bloom-Richardson Grade 2/3 (Intermediate Grade)\n- Tubule formation score: 3/3 (poorly differentiated)\n- Nuclear Pleomorphism score: 2/3\n- Mitotic Rate: 7 per 10 HPF (400X) (score 1/3)\n- No lymphatic or blood vascular invasion\n- No microcalcification (but the Dr. thinks there might actually be some)\n- No malignant cells seen in Axiallary node.\nPlan is to have a MRI this week, since her breasts are \"dense\" and he wants to make sure he has all the information. Then we will have the surgery on tuesday. It will be a lumpectomy, unless he gets in there and things are very different from what he expects.\nThey will try and do something with a balloon to make the radiation easier, but he wasn't 100% on whether or not that would work and he won't know until he gets in there. He said that chemo will also be recommended, but when and what course it will be is yet to be determined.\nThe desk people were great, and gave me copies of all the charts and papers... I even have the films to take with us to the MRI place. Being a photographer, you can bet they will be on a light table this afternoon getting copied!\nAnyways. that's all the news from here.\nYour comments and generous support is always welcome.\nFrank\n ",

      "Content": " Frank the husband here....Trying so hard to be strong. But tonight it's just crashing in on me. Reading about the upcoming battle we are facing.\nThere were already upcoming battles BEFORE this... a custody battle with my ex... wanting to change jobs... finances.... now I feel like I can't even begin to face them until there is something that feels like resolution with where this is going... and everything I read says you don't get that for a long time, if ever.\nIs it selfish to even THINK about taking this new job? It's more creative, more technically interesting, no suits and ties... but it's starting all over at a new place with none of the support group that being at a place a few years gives you. I have friends.\nWhat about Justin? He wants to come out for high school.... Ann is fighting it and we will certainly end up in court if I pursue it. What will that mean now? I wouldn't put it past Ann to try and use the breast cancer against us in court if she could. But is it something that we should even be undertaking this year? Will Justin understand if we don't/can't? All I want to do is cry right now.\nAll this reading about chemotherapy is making me sick, no irony intended. Linda always says how much she HATES doctors and puking. Great, welcome to your life for the next year. And we don't even know yet if that's the worst of it. We meet with the doctor for the first time on monday to talk about everything.\nThen next saturday, Caitlin and Justin will be here for the holidays. Whether she wil be pre-op or post-op or even what that will mean is completely unknown.\nUgh.\nFrank ",
