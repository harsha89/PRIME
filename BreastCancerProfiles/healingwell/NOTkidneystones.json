Today however there was something on NBC national news about\n it. If you Google NBC news ribociclib you can watch the video and read the written narrative.

      "Content": " Hi ladies,\nI will be entering a Clinical Trial soon. The objective of the trial is to test the effectiveness of adding Ribociclib to XTANDI, a hormonal treatment already in use for castrate-resistant metastatic Prostate Cancer. I qualify for the trial due to the dubious distinction of being castrate-resistant. \nMy MO says Ribociclib is pretty effective in treating breast cancer.(She\u2019s not connected to the trial)\nMy search for ribocyclib on these forums hasn\u2019t yielded anything. Do any of you have any experience with ribocyclib? I\u2019m wondering about\n effectiveness, SEs, etc...\nThx,\nPaul ",
