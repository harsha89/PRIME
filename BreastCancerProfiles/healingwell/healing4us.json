I have had extensive chest wall surgery so I have more pain and tenderness than most. Mine was also deep into the breast and close to the chest wall but not one issue. I am pretty sore today but IBU has helped me a lot. They were so kind and compasionate and helped me a ton. I know how scary it is and I am here to say the biopsy is pretty easy stuff. Good luck I hope it goes good for you. ",

I found out last night we have a massive amount of cancer in our family and my mom just lost a cousin to cancer last week. They don't see this massive amounts of family cancer very often so they have offered some genetic research and consultation but then they said we would wait until the biopsy comes back tomorrow. I am hopefully that it isn't benine. ",

      "Content": " Thank you I appreciated. I feel like it isn't real sometimes but here is the latest. I'm in a bit of a fog I guess but will stay strong. Today they talked me into a mamogram and one breast came back the one is questioned she said had some thickining in it so then we were on to the ultrasound. They found 4 masses one bigger than the other 3 and they are going to biopsy the bigger one tomorrow morning at 10:30. He feels it will give them the answers they need and doing all 4 would be to painfull as I had my previous surgery. He said that sometimes an injury can mimic cancer on an ultra sound. It was a 4 hour apt and the doctor came and looked through the ultra sound pictures and talked to me at the same time. It was a little shocking when a doctor I didn't know came into the room. I have a lot of different feelings but I am confident that no matter the outcome I will overcome this obstacle and I just need to feel blessed that I am young and they will have caught it early. I have overcome so many obstacles and this I will also overcome. ",
