      "Content": " thanks for the reply.  the positive talk means alot.  surgery is today.  super scared and nervous.  didnt sleep hardly at all last night.  cant help but be scared.  cancer has been attacking everyone i love lately, family and friends.  i will let everyone know how it went and again when i get the results.  im going to hate waiting to find out. i wish there was a way i could find out today.  and the other bad part is how starving and thirsty i am.  thankfully the surgery is only a couple hours away.  thanks again for the encouragement.

      "Content": " I have a 2 inch lump in my right breast.  I am having surgery tomorrow to have it removed and have a biopsy done to test for cancer.  I have done the needle biopsy and it is not a fluid cyst.  They couldn't get anything out and said it needs to come out immediately.  It moves around but is really big.  Doesn't hurt at all.  It is the only symptom I have.   Besides the painless lump, has anyone ended up with breast cancer with a big moveable lump but none of the other symptoms?
