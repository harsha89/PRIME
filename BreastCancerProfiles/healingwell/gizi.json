      "Content": " Hi Everybody,\nI want to share with you an unusual personal experience.\nFew months ago I was diagnosed with cancer. My doctor told me that I have pancreatic carcinoma that cannot be operated and that I need to start chemotherapy ASAP! I was stressed, are there no other options? I was afraid of the side effects of this treatment.\nI started chemo. Few weeks later I felt worse. The doctors told me that my tumor was resistant to the chemo. They changed the drug, but in the meantime I was also looking for an alternative treatment\u2026 and I found it (I think\u2026). It\u2019s called Gene-Eden and it is based on a scientific research of chronic viruses that cause cancers. I said to myself, this supplement is not going to kill you, but the cancer is \u2013 give it a try. I called them up and they offered me a nice discount and ask me to let them know about\n any progress or side effects I have. After using it for few days, I had no bad side effects, but I was still in pain and felt no improvement. I called them again and we decided to double the dose. Five weeks later I felt much better, pain was gone, the tumor got smaller and I even had more white blood cells.\nI am done now with my chemo treatment, and I still take Gene-Eden. I am so happy now. I am feeling very good about\n my decision to go ahead and use a supplement. I know others that suffer from cancer, so I wanted to share my story with you.\nAlthough I had no breast cancer, I thought it might be interesting to know. Maybe this is what you need\u2026 give it a try!\nall the best,\nGizi ",
