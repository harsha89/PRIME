      "Content": " I found out last summer that i have a cyst in my breast (confirmed by mammo and ultrasound). the radiologist said that it could be left alone unless it gave me problems or pain, which it wasnt, so i left it alone. I recently scheduled the procedure to have breast implants, and a few weeks later, the cyst is noticably larger and is sore when i touch it.  Now im wondering if i need to postpone the breast implant surgery, or if they can just remove it while they are in there anyway.  I dont want to go into the situation with a known problem and make it worse by getting the implants or causing more complications because of. My initial consult with the plastic surgeon was that the cyst was not an issue, but at that time, it also was not sore to touch and was smaller (6 months ago). Has anyone had any experience/answers regarding the situation with implants.?? ",
