I guess the reason I was thinking about\n the speed of an appointment is that if it is IBC (burning, no lump), it is so fast, aggressive and deadly versus other forms of breast cancer. Does this influence your thoughts?\nAgain thanks to you and the kind service that you provide.\nHugs back at you. ",

      "Content": " I asked, but based upon what the oncologist said yesterday, I did not move up the mammo. He said if I was having trouble sleeping move the date up, but he felt that there was no other reason to. However, I am keeping careful vigilance of any changes whatsoever. Right now, we are waiting for the application, review, and approval process with the insurance company for the breast MRI with plans to have everything done the same day. The thing is since I have no redness, no orange peel skin, no skin thickening, and no inverted nipple, there is nothing there for a visual diagnosis. Based upon what I have been reading, the only thing that a mammo or ultrasound will pick up is possible skin thickening as there are no specific tumors with this condition. And, sometimes MRIs provide false positives. Besides visual queues, the only thing that sounds definitive in terms of diagnosis is biopsy, but without visual clues and with the breast feeling (i.e., the itching and occasional stabbing pain) jumping around, it is going to be interesting to see how they figure out where to biopsy unless the MRI shows something. I just have to believe there is a such thing as early IBC and you shouldn't have to wait until it is Stage IIIB or IV for a diagnosis. I keep searching the web for early diagnosis and can't find anything. But, here I sit with something in my breast not feeling right. I wonder if there is a female IBC expert out there?\nThanks again. The \"conversation\" helps. ",

      "Content": " Thanks again Bev. No, my former oncologist who I spoke to today does not think that it is IBC. I do not have redness, heat, thickening of the skin, or nipple inversion, just itching and an occassional stabbing sensation. He said that he believes that what I am feeling is related to the lumpectomy I had 11 years ago. (He said that he has patients who had surgery 20 years ago and still have sensations in the breast. I would be interested if anyone else has the same experience?) He has added an MRI to the mammo and ultrasound I have scheduled for August 10th. \nI spoke to him rather than the breast surgeon because the breast surgeon resigned and the new one is not coming on until the end of August. \nI feel somewhat better about\n things, but not completely better. At this point I don't know if I am catching something early or if it is really nothing. I am going to keep careful villigence and pray alot.\nI am always \nopen to further input.\nMany thanks! ",
