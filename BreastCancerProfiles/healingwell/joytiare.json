My mother was diagnosed today and I am surfing through the Internet to numb the shock and sickness of this news. \nI want to know how to best support her... I want a miracle to reverse time... I want to be strong and hope for the best, but expect the worst. I guess I'm just reaching out, in desperation, in sadness, in seeking strength. Any stage IV survivors out there who can spare a pep talk? ",

I've since moved into a space of solace that every breath we take is precious and it is important to support and love each other through our life's journey. \nThank you for your story. Hang in there, have faith and be well.\nIn solidarity, \nJoy ",
