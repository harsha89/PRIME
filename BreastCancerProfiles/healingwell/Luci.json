It's hard to believe I've been posting on this board since 2001.\nI still miss Susan tremendously; I think of her often. Cathi's struggle was so long and so painful to watch. \nBut in July of this year, I passed my 11th anniversary. To quote Martha \"that's a good thing.\" Also in July I finished my 5 year course of Femara. Yippee, that was a cause to celebrate. The onc tells me he only needs to see me once a year now. Who knew in 1998 when I was first dx'd that there would be an 11th anniversary??\nI know, I know, everyone's body is different, but I think the above news is encouraging for all of us. Be strong and think positive. The CURE is coming.\nThere is no doubt that painful as it sometimes has been to read, this Board has been a tremendous source of knowledge and support. Thank you, MK, Bev, and Lori for your good thoughts. It's funny that under our names there is a designation \"veteran member,\" is that ever true.\nAs ever, Luci\n ",

Sometimes, life is so incredibly unfair.\nRight now, it seems like the news keeps getting worse and worse for you and your family.\nSounds like the idea of getting add'l hospice help is a good one. Is there any way that someone from hospice can help out at night? Sleep deprivation is a terrible thing, especially when you're already coping with so much. \nI'm glad that your leg problem is manageable. Hopefully there will be a clincal trial or study which Carolyn can get into.\nNow, if we can just find a way to take care of YOU long-distance. I find myself thinking about\n you often. I keep hoping that life will become easier for you. \nBig hugs and many positive thoughts coming from me to you. Luci\n ",

October was also the month of our St. Louis Reunion (my first) at that \"dumpy\" motel as Lori so kindly described it.\nI remember on the shuttle ride in from the airport in STL, Becky Phelps and I sat together. We'd never met, but started talking as soon as the shuttle left the airport. Becky was wearing her Halloween sweater and sharing her antibacterial hand sanitizer. \nI wish I had pictures of the look we both exchanged when the shuttle arrived at the \"Bates\" hotel; it was priceless. BUT, we had a wonderful time that weekend inspite of the surroundings. It is a precious memory which helped me through so many difficult days dealing with this wretched disease. \nSo many gone, but so many of us still here living with a chronic disease and doing just fine. We are all of us, old and new BC survivors so very special. Keep being tough because that's what it takes to keep this \"bad boy\" in line. \nHugs from here, Luci\n ",

Glad your dr. recognized it and put you in the hospital immediately. \nA couple of summers ago I was stung by a bee on my right arm (that's the dx'd side). I went to the emergency room immediately because I was on vacation and w/out meds. Anyway, the dr. there \"blew me off\" with nonsense about\n a simple bee sting, not being allergic to bee stings, yada, yada, yada. PS - the next morning I had angry red tracks going out from the site of the sting. There was also considerable swelling further down the arm toward the wrist.\nI cut my vacation short, headed home to NY and went to my dr. there. Before I knew what was happening I was getting IV meds. DX was cellulitis complicated by developing phlebitis. So it's a nasty condition that can make one very sick.\nGlad you're getting what you need. I'm thinking of you. Go slowly and feel better soon. Hugs, Luci\n ",

(rad, breast surgeon, onc., whoever will listen) that you want a biopsy ASAP. After this past year you deserve peace of mind. I promise you that your drs. are not losing sleep over this. You need to be your own advocate. Be very specific about\n what you want, why you want it done and the time factor. Hopefully, the drs. will pay attention and you'll get exactly what you want. If not, it's time to find a new team, one that is more in sync. with YOUR wishes and welfare. Hugs from here, Luci\n ",

Today is already Friday and Wednesday will be here quickly.\nMy point is you're doing the right things. Just keep at it. I'm sure there will be some answers for you this week, but if there aren't or you don't agree just keep making phone calls. Don't think about\n past things, look ahead to getting information and answers and hopefully peace of mind. \nYou can request a bx immediately. In fact, that's what I'd probably do. The only way to really know whether or not it's BC is through BX. That will definitely give you an answer and then you can go on from there. \nI'm glad you came here BUT I'd be really HAPPY if you didn't join this group. We're all very nice but our common denominator is BC. We'll all help you as much as we can, even hold you up when you can't do it yourself as you pursue this thing and wait for answers. Once there IS an answer we'll go on from there. Sending you gentle hugs for strength and prayers for peace of mind. Luci\n ",

During MY rant, Dr.Amy's BC Wall of Courage popped into my head and I thought if only, Julie, Peggy, Pat, Melanie, Leah, Becky, etc. had gotten out those cross-trainers they'd still be here with us. Pleeez, give me a break. FYI, before I was dx'd I walked every day 1-11/2 miles. That didn't seem to protect me from being dx'd with BC. Maybe all of these researchers should interview those of us who are out here battling this wretched disease every day of our lives about\n what we think will bring a cure. Maybe we would tell them to put their money where their mouths are and spend, spend, spend on more research or maybe some of us might be really honest and tell them what our true thoughts are about\n their silly hypotheses.

      "Content": " You know, I've been thinking about\n this thread for 2 days. I can't understand why the hospital would even consider sending a patient home before 48 hrs. In my mind discharging 48 hrs. after major surgery and a mast. surely is MAJOR, is ridiculous, but sending someone home the next day is barbaric. The 1998 Women's Health Care Act is a national law. Doesn't that mean that every state has to follow it? That law guarantees at least a 48 hr hospital stay AND mandates that reconstruction be covered by health insurors.\nJan, that fact that you had a pre-existing, dx'd heart situation even more clearly indicates the need for at least the 48 hr stay. What's happened to you is cruel and disrespectful of you. I'd think real hard about\n pursuing this further when you're feeling up to it. Sounds like someone read your chart with both eyes wide-SHUT. \nabout\n your O-negative blood: with a blood type like yours, why didn't the hospital send out an SOS to area blood banks BEFORE your surgery? All right, they didn't know you were going to need add'l blood, but whatever happened to being prepared??? Gosh, do we have to think of everything ourselves??? \nI'm so disgusted with the medical profession in general, but this story literally makes me sick to my stomach. I'm sending you my prayers and gentle hugs. Hoping you start to feel better soon. Hugs, Luci\n ",

      "Content": " Lori, I feel your pain. I have always loved Farina, it's a hot wheat cereal. I never had a problem getting it when we lived in the east. When we moved out here in Oct., I arrived with one un\nopened box which disappeared pretty quiickly. Off I went to Vons, Albertson's, Smith's, etc. Not a box to be had any place. Desperate for sustinence, I called DS who lives in NJ. He sent 2 boxes. Of course, there the cereal is on every shelf in every supermarket. In March DH had to go to CT for the closing on our country house. He brought back 3 boxes which will take us through to the end of June. By then we'll be going to NJ for DS's wedding and this time will probably come back with a case. The same thing has happened with teabags. I love an Irish breakfast tea called Barry's. Can't get it here, but I DID find it online. But then I wonder if the web supplier discontinues carrying it what I'll do. Oh, the stress!!! L&H's, Luci\n ",

There really isn't a whole lot to tell you except to try to be patient and to keep them pinned to whatever you're wearing. At the time safety pins worked fine. I was happy for that idea because mine took a good long time to get to the right amt. of fluid with the correct color for the recon. surgeon to even consider removing them. But eventually they ALL came out and the first thing I did was jump in the shower and just let the water run all over me. Here's a picture. When the drains were in I used to TRY to balance them on the top of the soap dish; they almost never stayed there, kept rolling off, so it became a game. How much of me could I soap up and wash off before the first drain fell off, followed by all the others. It was too ridiculous. Of course, they've been out for a long time now, but I still smile when I think of the acrobatics in the shower just so I could be a \"clean machine.\" Try to be patient. They'll be out before you know it. Hugs, Luci\n ",

I'm not going into details about chemo.; others have covered that area. Just know that everything you're feeling is normal. Know too that we're all here thinking of you and urging you on. New things, especially events of this magnitude, are always scary. Hang in there. After my first tx, I kept wondering why I had been so afraid. The next time was not exactly a lark, but I went knowing exactly what to expect and that made it a whole lot easier. Sending hugs from NV. Luci\n ",

It's done on the mammogram machine but they use different plates and take 4 views (2 of each reconst'd breast).\nThe procedure came out of the U of Mich., but like all things new and innovative (I remember when sentinel node bx. was raising eyebrows among breast surgeons) it's taking some time to get radiologists on the bandwagon. There is still the prevailing theory that there's ONLY 3-5% of breast tissue remaining so the chances of a recurrence are slim. To which I say \"Pooh!\" What can a physician who sees a tramflap patient tell that patient if, heaven forbid, there is a recurrence??? Tramogram is a procedure that can actually find a recurrence in its very early stages. Who wouldn't want to have it done if can possibly prevent add'l physical pain and emotional torture?? \nI'll look for U of Mich. article and post the website. My gyn. in NY had never heard of it when I first brought him all of the info. I left it with him. A week later he called to tell me he'd actually gotten on the phone to the U of Mich and discussed the procedure with a physician there. 2 weeks later I was having my first Tramogram. Thanks heavens, there ARE some physicians who are open-minded and receptive to new info. brought to them by their patients. My dr. actually thanked me when I saw him again. He told me he has a number of Tramflap patients and he was now encouraging THEM to go for the procedure. \nOh, FYI, it's also covered by health insurance, so it's really a \"win\" for everyone involved. Hope this helps. Luci\n ",

Urologists only do \"cystoscopes\", gastroenterologists do \"colonoscopies.\" Maybe you should give your dr. a call and have him clarify the tests you're going to have. If you've never had a colonscopy, the preparation is pretty rigorous. There is NO preparation for a cystoscope because it's done under a local anesthetic. I'm thinking if you're having recurrent UTI's that the urologist is the type of dr. you need to see now. Hope this helps. Good luck and keep us informed. Hugs, Luci\n ",

Are you drinking lots of water, before, during and the day after the tx's? That will help a lot; it's so impt. to stay well-hydrated. Re: low blood counts: you may need neupogen or procrit to boost those those counts, ask your onc. about them.\nI'm thinking that a scarf may not be enough to keep you head warm in the winter weather, especially if you live some place where it's very cold or the wind blows hard. The scarves look so pretty when you're inside and it's warm, but you do need to think of something to websar with it when you're outdoors. I remember that my head was always cold (my chemo went through the fall and winter) and ended up looking for cute hats. I liked the kind with the brims that could be turned up or down and looked nice either way. The ACS has a website with links to places that sell hats specially designed for people in the midst of chemotherapy.\nYou're a brave girl; just keep doing what you're doing. We're all here pulling for you. Luci\n ",

Glad you found us and happier still that you've decided to seek professional help in dealing with this emotional rollercoaster ride.\nRe: multi-focal microcalcifications: You're in luck, my new friend, I had them too. Maybe unusual for Providence Hospital, but not for Westchester, NY. So you relax, you're not so out of the ordinary. I also had bi-lateral mastectomies. Yup, it was hard and sad and I grieved A LOT. But I had reconstruction (tramflap) 5 and 1/2 yrs. ago. The scars on my body are fading, the scars in my head and heart may not disappear so quickly, but I will tell you this. All of the misery will pass just as time does. You keep coming here to this board, we'll love and hold you up when you feel you can't go on. The day WILL come, I promise you, when you'll be the one writing and supporting another woman (or man) struggling with this wretched disease. In the meantime, you've taken the first steps toward healing. You've admitted you're in pain and you've decided to get help. You're on your way. Sending you hugs for strength from my new home in Henderson, NV. Luci\n ",

Wishing someone happy six yrs. of cancer-free life; it's almost weird, but the impt. thing is you are HERE to receive those wishes. \nPersonally, I try hard not to think of how carefree I was when I went for the mammography that found my cancer. It was the most gorgeous summer day with the sky a blue that we usually only see in the fall in NY. My friend, Linda and I had were both schoolteachers at the time. Every summer we'd make those appts., drive each other there and then go out for lunch to celebrate. Linda's appt. was the week before mine; hers was uneventful, thanks heavens. Mine was a whole other story. I didn't have to say a word when I finally came out of the dr's. office (I went directly from the mammo room to the u/s room). Linda stood up, put her arms around me and said \"I know, I know.\" That was the end me, I started to cry and pretty much cried for the whole next month, right up until I had the first mastectomy. Somewhere in there I realized I needed to fight hard. That's when I started \"soldiering on\" because BC is a war. Now, it's six yrs. later and thankfully you and I are both here to hug and support each other. Love, Luci\n ",

The more you know, the easier it will be for you when dealing with the medical community.\nI have only one piece of advice - do only what is best for YOU. You're going to hear lots of different opinions about a plan of attack. Your surgeon will be a big source of good advice, but can only recommend procedures, not make decisions for you. A medical oncologist appt. is a necessity. Someone else mentioned this above. Radiation oncs. can really only help you with radiation protocols if that's what you opt for. It's a medical onc. who has tons of knowledge about chemotherapy protocols, side effects, etc. Take your time making yourself aware about what's out there for you. Take that deep breath I mentioned in my first post to you and get ready to go on the attack. \nWhile you're doing that know how much we are here for you, urging you on and encouraging you to make YOU your first priority. You're starting the battle for the rest of your life. I know it sounds hard-hearted, but think only of what YOU need, not what your think will make another happy. I'm hugging you from here. Luci\n ",

I had those every 6 mos while on tamoxifen. Tamoxifen is a very good drug, but you need to evaluate personally whether it is the right drug for you. There are other effective drugs besides tamoxifen, so don't be disheartened if down the road aways, you decide you may need a different hormonal to keep fighting the battle. Hope this helps, Luci\n ",

Families have disagreements, sometimes act hurtfully or are overly emotional. But our foundation is strong and we take care of each other. It was BC which brought us all together, but that is NOT what keeps us together. It is love and caring. It is support when difficult times come our way and laughter and happiness when all is well.

I know it seems scary, like there's now an elephant sitting on the couch next to you, but hang in there. One minute, one hour, one day at a time and before you realize it you'll be managing very well. You need to begin to think of things in terms of a different kind of normal. Nothing will be as it was before your dx, but that isn't necessarily bad. I'm not crazy, but I will tell you that being dx's with BC made me look at life a whole lot differently. Take your time, you've just had bi-lateral masts. (I had them too), so give yourself a chance to recoup some strength. In the meantime, come here often and pour out your heart. We've heard it all; I promise you that. We'll hold you and love you until you can stand on your own once again. We're a pretty special group here. Now you're one of us and we DO take care of our own.

      "Content": " (((Ellen))), There is a risk of endometrial cancer with tamoxifen. While I was on it, my gyn ordered pelvic u/s AND vaginal u/s's every 6 mos. To this day I believe it was those repeated u/s's which saved me from dealing with another type of cancer. The uterine lining thickens markedly while on tamoxifen. Did you have a baseline u/s when you first began tamoxifen??? Ask you dr. what the u/s showed in millemeters re: the uterine lining. If it's in the 7.5 - 9 mm. span you need to address this issue now. For me once it passed 7 mms. I had to start thinking about whether or not I'd continue the drug. The gyn. agreed with my decision to discontinue taking it once it passed 7.5 mms. My onc., however, got very huffy when I told him I wouldn't be taking it any longer. He told me that \"we don't worry about anything until it's at 9 mms. and then you'll have a hysterectomy.\" We parted ways after that appt.; I felt he was crass and disrespectful of my needs. His mantra about tamoxifen was \"but it's a good drug.\" It IS a good drug, just not for me. Hope this helps. Hugs, Luci\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Everyone, MK, you're exactly right. My MRI finished at 6:45, I went back to the hotel and fell into bed. I couldn't do one more thing. It was a very long day.\nDH had the endoscopy, his gastro. dr. says everything looks really good. I'm happy for that news, but will wait for the pathology report. Apparently, the dr. decided to bx around the area that has been most effected by the acid reflux. DH is a real trooper. Got him back to the hotel around 1:00 and since my MRI was not until 3:45 I thought I would rest a bit. NOT!! I couldn't sleep at all. Took my klonopins around 2:00, so I would be mellow (yellow, thank you, Donovan, for those old enough to remember) when I got back to the hospital. Got my cab and voila, there I was.\nMRI started on time. The only way I can stand being in there even with the anxiety meds is to keep my eyes closed. If I moved my elbows just one inch out from my body I could feel the sides of the tube. Yikes, too creepy!!! I did remember to buy ear putty for the noise and with the ear phones and the music it wasn't too bad. Now, comes the annoying part. I was in there for a whole half hour when the techs. stopped the test completely, rolled me out and said they were not getting clear pix. So, they changed these pad things they had placed over my hip, pushed me back inside and started all over. By then, the klonopins were really working their magic. I just kept my eyes closed and thought about the PCE and chocolate m&m peanut candies. It took a almost another hour and a half, and I actually think I may have fallen asleep. If I did it was wonderful and I didn't make a fool of myself by going berserk and begging them to get me out. I was out - cold.\nThis morning I saw my PCP and told her about the MRI. She got on the phone to the orthopedist who was \"unavailable\". Even she was not happy. So, she said that she'd keep on him until she got some answers. In the meantime, I haven't heard from the ortho. at all. PCP also told me there wouldn't be any flu vaccines available through her group at all. That they had been notified just this morning.\nFrom there I went to the onc. for my 3 mos check-up. That was fine, got my Femara, hugged him on the birth of his new daughter and left. Oh, no flu vaccines available through the onc. either. Now, I'm going to organize my clothes, put them into my little roll-aboard and get on that plane tomorrow. Thank you all for coming; I knew you were there. In fact, I thought I saw a pink feather floating in front of me. You all are the BEST, BEST, BEST in the whole world. Love, Luci\n ",
