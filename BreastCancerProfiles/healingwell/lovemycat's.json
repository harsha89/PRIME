    "Content": " I am 52 years old, I experienced discharge from my nipple in the rt breast in November 2009, I delayed seeing a Doctor because I didn't have any medical coverage..Recently I contacted the American Cancer society for help, I was giving information on where I could go in my area for treatment. They were very helpful. Today I had a Mamogram followed by and Ultra-sound after the Ultrasound Dr. came in and discussed my possible diagnosis but could not rule out either way. He diagnosed my condition as a complex cyst rt nipple. He immediately requested a biopsy. He advised me that Complex breast cyst have a 4 percent chance of being cancerous. He was very re-assuring and assured me that he would make sure I was taken care of.. ",
