    "Content": " i have been on Femara for a week today and the muscle pains started 3 days ago.They are manageable while moving but turning over in bed is horrid ..it wakes me up.Apparently this is a fantastic drug for preventing breast cancer cells attacking other parts of the body.I think the femara is reducing the oestrogen and this is causing the pain.So I guess that when the oestrogen levels are reduced the pain might stop.Hot flushes are an indication that oestrogen is in the body.I thought mine had long gone because i went through menopause at 47 and am now 55.I have never been keen to take pain killers stronger than the odd panodol but I am going to now.Must not stop taking the oestrogen blockers as they have been proven to work.\nDaily walks, lots of water and pain killers.We have to do it .I remind myself of all the women who have died because they didn't have the drugs we have today.Soldier on for the people who love us.
