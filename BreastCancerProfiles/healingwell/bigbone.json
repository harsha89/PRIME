      "Content": " Good day all. I guess I may be in the wrong thread as I am a male, but I will explain. My name is Allen, 36, and currently reside in Northern California. The main reason that I am here is due to the fact that I am seeking information for my ex-wife who is 33 years old. She disclosed to me about\n a month to a month-and-a-half ago that she had discovered a lump in her chest and made me promise not to let any family members know. There is one thing that I immediately thought, she probably should NOT have gotten that breast enhancement surgery as it might have increased her risk for breast cancer. As far as my knowledge goes, breast cancer does not run in her family and she has not gotten a formal mammogram because according to her, the saline implant would present false readings. She stated to me that the mammogram will take place but in a few months in the future. What really worries me is that she's taking this so nonchalantly and I am the one who is deathly afraid for myself, her, and our two boys (5 and 3). I want them to grow up and when (or if) they have kids, their kids will be able to know their grandmother. ",
