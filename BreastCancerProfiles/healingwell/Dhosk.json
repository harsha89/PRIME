    "Content": " Denise. 61. Ohio. First time in this forum. Just had second mammogram for magnification. Result is .8 cm pleomorphic calcifications. Birad 4. I have had a different type of calcification and in a different area in this same breast in 2013 and had a biopsy and all was benign. The word pleomorphic is what is concerning me this time. How many of these are malignant? I realize this small would be very early. Thank you. I'm a little worried ",
