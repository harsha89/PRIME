I've been reading through this forum and the amount of comfort and caring is amazing!\nI did have a biopsy and will have the results back tomorrow. My surgeon said it was more than evident by what she saw that this was cancer. As you said, we don't know what type or how bad yet so we're really being positive. We've had a wonderful weekend, just relaxing and being together as a family. I feel strong enough to deal with whatever this may be. \nI'm sure I'll be back to ask a gazillion questions once I know more. \nThanks again for you words of encouragement!\nLaurie ",

      "Content": " Thanks again for all the kind words and your good healing thoughts. They've worked because surgery was a breeze and very successful. Although the cancer was invasive, it did not reach any lymph nodes and my surgeon is confident that she got it all. My tumor was estrogen and progesterone + and I was on HRT. I'm sure most of you already know how dangerous HRT is, but please, please, please tell every woman in your life to stay away from estrogen and/or progesterone....period! Deal with hot flashes and anything else your body is going through. I did a lot of research on HRT prior to going on it, but because cancer doesn't run in my family, I was confident that the scewed information I was provided was accurate. This is one thing I am very angry about\n, but that's for another post. \nI will begin chemo treatments (8 over a 16 week period) and 35 treatments of radiation right after. I already consider myself a 'survivor' because it's no longer in my body. I am focused on the treatments and the fact that it's all preventative maintenance. By next spring this will all be behind me!!\nI'm sure I'll be back with a million questions during the next 6 months or so, but thanks again for allowing me to vent here.\nMy thoughts and prayers are with you all.\nLaurie xxoo ",
