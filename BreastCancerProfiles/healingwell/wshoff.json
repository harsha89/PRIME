    "Content": " Hello. Four nights ago, I woke up in the middle of the night to a stabbing, burning pain in my right breast. Every night since, the same has happened. The pain goes away within five minutes. I had a routine mammogram 2 months ago and all clear. I have no history of breast cancer in my family. I have no pain during the day, only at night. Does anyone know why? Thank you so much. ",
