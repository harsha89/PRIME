      "Content": " Hi curiousi,\nI know where you are coming from. It's hard to get information sometimes without sounding like a hypochondriac. I've gone through that with every doctor. I'm paranoid by nature and whenver there is any risk involved, I get nervous. I was also very worried about\n my fibroadenoma being painful. Some medical websites say they are always painless but I have seen some credible sites say that they can hurt with your cycle. Mine is tender always but hurts really bad around and during my cycle. I haven't gone through my cycle yet since my biopsy. This breast pain better not be permanent. \nI actually took the time to ask my breast surgeon about\n the pain and she said fibroadenomas are commonly painful. I don't know what to believe but she's supposedly an expert on breasts. I guess we can trust her over WebMD. She's been a general surgeon for years and is a certified breast specialist. \nI've also seen what breast can do. I've seen the most negative side of it and I'm not ready to handle it myself... especially at this age. I feel too young but now I'm very afraid. I understand you and am here if you want to talk.\nIt does sound like you are in good shape though. I'd go with the biopsy if you can stomach it. It's really not bad at all and it's supposed to give definitive results. Relying on imaging only when you are scared is probably a bad idea... unless you have cysts. Unfortunately, I had no imaging so that really sucks. I hope that doesn't mean she will try to do an MRI on me. I honeslty don't think I could handle that.\nAnyway, good luck, god bless.... it sounds like you will be okay!!!!! Make sure you also ask your breast doc about\n the pain. I'm not sure if my surgeon was blowing smoke or not but she said fibroadenoma are known to have pain. I don't know if she knew how bad my pain has been though. From my experience so far, it hurts most a week or so before my cycle and then gets much better.\nhugs ",

      "Content": " I was recently diagnosed with a fibroadenoma which apparently never showed up on ultrasound. I can't reason why but I'm trying to trust what I've been told. Fibroadenomas are known to show up on screening. I hope this is not something I should be worried about\n. It sucks because the biopsy had to be done without imaging. Translation: she stuck the needle in my lump with only her hand for guidance. I'm 27 with a family history also. My mother had it before menopause and my mat.grandmother had ovarian. \nMy breast surgeon doesn't want to see me for 6 months. I don't know if I should be demanding a second opionion. Not only did my fibro not show up on imaging, but it's also very painful which I heard was not typical for fibro's. It's also more long than round. It's smooth and the pain seems to align with my period... but still. Can and should I trust my pathology??\n ",
