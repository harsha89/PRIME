      "Content": " THIS IS BEING POSTED WITH PERMISSION FROM PETER WAITE- MODERATORS PLEASE DO NOT DELETE\nHi Ladies (and any gentlemen out there), \nI'm conducting a study to provide us with more information about\n differences in relationship and occupational functioning following a breast cancer diagnosis. I hope that you don't find this post as an intrusion. The purpose of my research is truly to help breast cancer survivors with an important issue- I don't profit from it in any way. \nBelow is the flyer for the study. This is a university sponsored, institutional review board approved, ethical and legitimate study. I can provide anyone who emails me with an approval letter from my institutional review board, as well as a list of publications that either I or my research lab authored. Any information you choose to give us will be kept confidential and won't be used for anything other than scientific research. Thanks for your consideration! \nAre You a Working Woman in a Committed Relationship? \nPlease join us in a study to learn more about\n romantic relationships and their impact on quality of life, in women who have or have not had breast cancer \n \nIn order to participate, you must be: \n \n1) A female breast cancer survivor who is between 18 months and five years after initial diagnosis, and who is currently cancer-free \nOR A female between 21 and 75 years of age, who has never had cancer \n \n2) In a committed, monogamous relationship of 2 or more continuous years \n \n3) Be currently working (25+ hours per week, in a formal work environment, i.e., not as a freelancer or stay at home parent) \n \n4) In the past seven years, both you and your partner must be without a history of life-threatening or chronic disabling condition other than breast cancer. For more information and specifics, please visit us at https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/romanceandwork \n \nWe will ask you to complete a short online questionnaire that will require approximately 30 minutes of your time. The study is 100% online, completely private, and can be completed from any computer with an internet connection. \n \nTo see if you are eligible for our study, please go to: \nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/s/romanceandwork \n \nFor more information, you may contact Lynn Breckenridge at (301) 295-9660 or via email at: bcsdyadstudy@gmail.com \n \nThis research project is being run by the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD ",
