      "Content": " Hi all. I normally post on the crohns forum but I am scheduled for a prophylactic double mastectomy due to severe fibrocystic breast disease. I have hundreds of cysts in each breast combined with extremely dense breast tissue. My mammograms and ultrasounds always list as multiple masses believed to be cysts which always worried me. I have had plenty of aspirations of cysts over the years and recently had a core biopsy on an area that was also just a cyst. My mother died of breast cancer and since I never knew my grandmother or her medical history, I don't know who else in my family may have had breast cancer also. \nTo be honest, I am tired of the constant worry about\n if or when they will find something that is not a cyst. \nI am going with a nipple/skin saving double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. I have large breasts now but want to go small. I am 50 and would love not to always have to wear a bra! \nI am concerned about\n pain and not being able to pick myself up out of a bathtub. I am very independent and don't want to have to rely on my hubby to help me do everything. How long will it be before I should be able to function on my own? ",

My surgery to remove the expander tubes was pushed back due to insurance reasons but it should happen within the next month. I am going to let him change out my implants to the high profile and also have a tummy tuck at the same time. Why not, right?! \nTake care everyone! ",

      "Content": " Update. My recovery has been a piece of cake. My reconstructed breasts are beautiful and much better than I used to have. I will have surgery to remove the expander tube next month and during that surgery, my plastic surgeon offered to change my implants to the \"high profile\" if I want. Still debating that. \nI am so relieved to have my old breasts gone and hope I have managed to out-wit any breast cancer .
