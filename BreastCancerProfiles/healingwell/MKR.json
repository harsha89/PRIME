    "Content": " Hi I am 51 yrs of age, and today went for my six month mamogram.  Nothing was found there, but because of the density of my breast and my family history (mother, aunts) had breast cancer, he recommended a ultrasound.  After speaking with the radiologist he then recommended a breast biopsy in both breasts.  He said if he knew for sure it was malignant (cancer) he would tell me today, he said he did not know and that is why he was recommending biopsies.  He said the areas of interest are very small.  I am scheduled for a consultation mid July, but of course I am anxious and wonder if anyone else went thru a similar situation.  MKR ",
