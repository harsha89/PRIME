      "Content": " Hi.\nI'm almost 17, and I have recently found myself extremely worried about\n my breasts.\nI'm a 34D, and I feel like every time I press down on my breast there is some solid lumpiness. I know cancer is typically one lump on one breast, but this is on both, and its everywhere. (beside, beneath, and over the nipples). \nOn this \"solid\" there are a million little lumps that are each about\n a centimeter in diameter. They have been there since I was about\n 13. It usually hurts more during my period. \ni do have a doctors appointment next week, but even now I can't sleep because I'm worried. \nI guess what I'm trying to ask is:\nIs this normal? I know that some tissue is needed for breast feeding if I were ever to have children, but are you even supposed to feel anything massive under your nipple? And how massive?\nThank You\nHorteccla ",

      "Content": " hey\nSo basically i'm 15, and i think there is something wrong.\nwhen i was 11, i found lumps in my very small breasts at the time. and they were like right under my nipples. Like a grape. kind of. And my mom was kind of worried, so she called the doctor. THe doctor said it was normal, but then the lumps got bigger. And so whenever I feel my breasts, there is like a huge lumpy thing under. I've never exactly held someones breasts lol so i dont know if its abnormal. I mean when people say they found a lump in thier breast, I dont understnad because I have lumps everywhere! I'm kind of worried. Is there something wrong with me? ",
