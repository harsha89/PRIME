      "Content": " I have had a stereotactic core needle biopsy of my left breast. I have to say first that I'm a wimp when it comes to needles and med procedures! So I hope you're relieved when I say the anxiety was the worse part. As I was laying there on my belly (in a darkened room) with my ta-ta hanging down through an \nopening the nurse told me I'd feel a little sting, which was what was going to numb me before the radiologist's needle was inserted to extract some tissue. That little bee sting was the worse part, really. Bottomline, it wasn't a difficult deal to go through. Looking back, I remember how odd it was to smell the burning flesh (again no pain, no big deal) as the area was cauterized.\nBut as far as itching is concerned? All areas that have been pierced, sliced or diced seem to itch now and then. It's one of the things that frequently happens when you heal. I don't know if it explains what is happening with your itchiness, but it always seemed to me like what happens after blood returns to a cold part of your body after skating or skiing. I always associate it with healing blood flow, and I don't worry unless there's a rash.

      "Content": " A few things helped me when I was on tamoxifen for 5 years. Time (the hot flashes evened out after awhile, although they never disappeared), initially cutting the single daily dose into 2 per day, half in the am, half in the pm for a few months til my body got use to it, then taking it once a day (easier to remember a single pill). Last - exericse really helped with the severity of the flashes. Red wine in the evening, btw, was brutal - always triggererd bad ones. \nI also used mental imaging - turned the flashes in my mind to curative heat that was burning any cancer cells trying to form.

      "Content": " That blank mind is common to all of us. It's one of the reasons why it's a great idea to have a good friend or competent family member with you when you have any informational consults with physicians. All the questions that occur after we're out of that office could fill a book! And as far as risk factors are concerned, Dr. Susan Love's 4th edition (the latest one I own) has chapter 10 titled \"Risk Factors: Genetic\". Basically it says anyone is up for grabs. You just have to live long enough and the cells in your ta-tas may go wonky. Is it still one out of eight? \nI know advice like \"don't worry til you have reason to\" is pretty weak. Easier said than done, and it's not advice that I heeded all that well when I was running panicked, screaming, from one room to another when a doc was late calling me with what I thought was my death sentence. I was a frightened idiot nearly 10 years ago, but I'm still here, worrying about\n my hubby instead of myself, with more dings and divots in my ta-tas than a par 3 public golf course. \n The odds are in your favor, don't forget, and use it as your mantra when you have to go for your visit.

      "Content": " Hi Bev,\nI'm more of lurker here after discovering HW when my husband was diagnosed with PCa this past spring. I decided one night just this past week to look at other sites that listed a disease my loved ones (or myself)\n had to deal with and checked out the BCa group. The PCa site was high-quality with great in-the-trenches experiences and med info. I haven't needed BCa support (thank God) in awhile, but whenever I see someone who is frightened or struggling, my heart goes out to them. \"There but for the grace of God go I\" puts it pretty well. The crazy-fear that \"C\" word can generate...\nAnyway, the prostate cancer group have a \"bible\" - Dr. Walsh's guide to surviving prostate cancer. My own \"bible\" was Dr. Susan Love's breast book. I actually have her autographed copy and went with some survivors to one of her local lectures to meet her. Hope this site frequently recommends her book as a great resource. Dealing with the fear this cancer brings to women is one more item on the lousy list of dealing with breast cancer diagnosis. The book was a great help to me.\nGlad to cyber-meet you. Wish all here a healthy, happy 2011.\nxoNEIrish's wife\nHusband 60yrs., no symptms: PSA 10/04 2.73, 12/06 3.64, 5/09 3.9, 10/09 4.6, 1/10 5.0w/ free PSA 24\n6 core biop 4/1/10 path rept: rt mid: adnocarc.

      "Content": " Sleep disruption, oh boy. I'm in my late '50's, and insomnia with or without hot flashes had already become a problem for me before I was on tamoxifen. I just figured it was peri-menopause in my 40's and \"sucked it up\". I think it's more of a side effect of middle age, not the drug. I also hate taking meds, so the fact that I had to be on a daily one for 5 years was very unsettling, and I never tried sleep aids then (although I have tried ambien twice this year). The moderator would know better there, I'm sure.\nMy tamoxifen days ended some time ago, but I still am an ocasional insomniac. I don't have to be alert\n for employment or a young famiy anymore so I use the time to read, zone out on dvd marathons - anything I choose. The hardest thing was to keep my mind from going to dark places, which seems to be where minds like to roam in a quiet, dark house at 3am.
