      "Content": " Hi barkyboys,\n I appreciate you reply.\n The reason they switched from Tomoxefen to Femara was that in all the studies done they have proof that it works better against the cancer coming back.\n Mum was on Tomoxefen before her surgery and after her surgery sahe took it again and kept on it for another 12 years BC came back. Apparently after being on it for 5 years it can make the cancer return instead of stop it.\n I was told the idea of changing meds was to shock it in case it thought it could grow back. Also that treatments and new ways of using them change much faster these days than they used too.\n Gabapentin is used by people who have epileptic fits and I am able to tolerate it well.\n I have been put on 2 different antidepressants and even vitamin E but by the 3rd day i feel dizzy and sick so they were stopped. If this didn't work they told me all they had left to try was injections into the nerves at the base of my neck to hopefully stop the flushes.\n My husband would understand your husband really well, I was exactly the same.\n I have told my Drs. and I will continue to do so and hopefully there will be new answers and help or the hot flushes wil end forever.\n I wish you good things a long your life's journey too.\n Take Care, Love Elizabeth.
