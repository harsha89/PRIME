      "Content": " Marlyssa here - I am STILL waiting for my Primary Physician - actually a nurse practioner to call me back regarding my desire for a second opinion. So I called around and paid at Kaiser at their Breast Center and had an exam and a consult. No one had done a breast exam on me either! After reading the radiologists report and her exam, and hearing my limitations with medi-cal, she suggested asking for an ultrasound, and then having another mammogram in 6 months. I have to tell you that she was very positive, and said based on the report too that it looks good, but for peace of mind ask for the ultrasound. I have a very little chance of any of this happening, test wise though with this \"Practioner\"...and the 185.00 it's going to cost me for the Kaiser visit is all I can afford. I will keep you posted, and again, thank you so very much for your prayers and help. I appreciate it more than I can say. ",

      "Content": " I had a mammogram last Friday - they called me back, took more pictures and said I have a large dense mass - but the radiologist said given his experience that it looks like a swollen lymph node and looks benign.  I asked him how he could tell....he said that he is 80% sure it's benign so a biopsy is not needed.  Maybe I'm nuts..but I'm worried about the 20%...how can he be so sure?  Can these radiologists know for sure like this?  I'm a single mom of two boys 14, and 12 - My oldest is autistic and I've had to quit work to care for him full time so I only have medical.  Could this be an issue  Has anyone else had only a swollen lymph node that's okay?\n ",

I was told that this nurse is going on vacation in a week, and to try with someone else. So that is what I am going to do. I was in the ER last night, I'm suffering from post-concussion syndrome still from my son's last violent outburst on Valentines Night - so I asked them for advise - gave me a list of doctors who take medi-cal - only one office and it's the same one - but a couple new names -so that is now the game plan - thank you again for all your support - ",
