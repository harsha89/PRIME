    "Content": " In April I was diagnosised with LCIS and had a lumpectomy in May. I was put on Tamoxifen as a result although the area around the lump was smooth which they said is a sign on no cancer. I took the Tamoxifen for three weeks and all the side effects of constipation, mild vaginal itch, tired, nausea and weight gain immediately..uuuhg! I usually weight 128 and I'm 40, any pound feels like a ton. I stopped taking the Tamoxifen because of the side effects and I was just honestlt MAD...madder than mad, don't know how to explain it. But I have made a choice to take the Tamoxifen. It has been suggested to change some of my diet and give my body time to adjust. I like the idea of gradually introducing my body to the Tamoxifen. I haven't seen an actual Oncologist and that has been suggested to so that is on my list this week. It's great to hear that I am not alone in this scary time. Thanks to everyone who is responding on here, it gives me encouragement! ",
