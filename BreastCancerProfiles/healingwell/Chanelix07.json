    "Content": " Hello Luckygirl! I mean what courage you have. I'm amazed by your strenght. My sister had breast cancer in 2000, was ok for 8 years, then she had metastases in her bones and lymph nodes, in 2009, and now progressing into her liver and bones. She has 2 kids (16 and 19), it's'such a tragedy. It's'hard to cope. I'm afraid she won't get any further treatments ( she told me) . She just had enough. I just don't know what to do and tell her to make her want to fight some more. Any advice? Thanks +++++ take care ",
