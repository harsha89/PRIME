    "Content": " \nThanks so much Bev, this is exactly what I had happen to me after a bad bee sting. I only learned about\n it through this post. Thank you so much for alert\ning me to go to urgent care and check for this. My regular doctor looked at it and didn't have any concern, when it continue to swell, I called my oncologist but she was not in. I went to urgent care based on your post, and it turned out it was cellulitis. Thanks for your post here or else I would have never known what to be concerned about\n. I'm now on antibiotics and it's starting to subside. The bee sting was on the side where I had six nodes removed 10 years ago.\nThanks again,\nLinda ",
