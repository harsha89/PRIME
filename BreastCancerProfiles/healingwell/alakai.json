    "Content": " Had a mammogram Monday, first in 10 years. Dr felt two lumps in right breast, ordered a diagnostic mammo. Radiologist wanted more pics then ultrasound, said it was a mass not a cyst, the second he did not even mention. I am to wait and come back for another mammogram in 6 months. I did have a swollen milk gland in this breast 10 years ago, but not two. The hospital does not have the film from then, so just going by what was written. My husband thinks maybe I should go for second opinion. I do have some burning or pin sticking pain if pressure is put on breast. I also am cyst prone, had a hysterectomy 22 years ago for cysts. Any thoughts? ",
