      "Content": " I had a redo due to capsular contractures after four years. I had to go to a different PS for this because my original PS didn't take our insurance any longer. I was part of a medical study for silicon implants and just went back to my original PS for the end of the study paperwork. At this appointment, I found out that he takes our new insurance so that was good to know. He asked me what had happened that caused the other surgery to be done. I told him and said that the 'other PS' had fixed whatever needed to be fixed but that she used the same implants again. He then said that they're a one-time use appliance and shouldn't have been put back in again. Grrr! During the exam, he asked if I had noticed that the right side was smaller and I told him that I just thought it had shifted or something. Further testing revealed that it has a small leak, most likely from the other PS putting it back in. I'm scheduled for new implants and a scar revision at the end of May. Insurance has approved everything without a problem. \n \n \n \n ",
