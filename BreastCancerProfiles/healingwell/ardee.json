The only thing that helped was walking. As soon as I stopped it just killed me. My doctor acted like I was quite unique. She said I was really the first person who complained. Vicodin did nothing for me. My back hurt so bad sometimes all I could do is cry. When they wanted me to take some more shots before the next treatment, my son said, \"NO WAY!!!\" I hope whatever they give you works wonders on the pain.\nL&H,\nRita\n ",

Since I haven't seen it in the last 5 or 6 trips to the grocery store, I'm guessing it's discontinued. Maybe they'll bring it back in the fall. Also, I finally bought Calvin Kline's Obsession from Robinson's May, and it was very expensive. It used to be everywhere. My son and I looked all over for it when we were in Mexico two years ago. I might have bought another bottle if I didn't have to take a second mortgage to buy it. Another gripe I have is that they bring out so many different variations of products that sometimes it's difficult to find the original, or I grab the wrong one by mistake.

      "Content": " Hi Tamaralynn,\nI was wondering what was going on with you. Things sound like they're moving along smoothly. That's great! I had baby-fine, stick-straight hair all my life. Losing it was really not that big a deal. Like I told my best friend, losing it could only be an improvement. Well, It's been 18 months since my last chemo, and my hair is still curly. Actually, it has more body than I ever dreamed possible, even tho it's a bit thinner. After the chemo, rads was a walk in the park for me. And the time goes faster than you think it will. So hang in there, kick back, grab that guy's hand, and enjoy looking at the light at the end of the tunnel for a bit. \nL&H,\nRita\n ",

They were tougher than the other treatments, and I did get some burning and ultimately an infection from it. But supposedly it's necessary. They watch you VERY CAREFULLY to make sure they catch any problems as soon as they arise. And breast tissue does heal very quickly. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was almost completely healed within one week. And most women have no problems during their booster series. So just lay back and enjoy, and know the worst is nearly over. Sending prayers your way. \nL&H,\nRita\n ",

If you have to go on chemo, you need to know that it wipes out the immune system and leaves you pretty vulnerable to colds, flu, and infections. But you do bounce back quickly. I guess it depends on whether you have disability insurance and/or work where you come into contact with lots of germs.\nGood luck. I'm sending prayers your way.\nHugs,\nRita\n ",

But they can't see through the skin, so they need to do the ultrasound so they know exactly where they're going. I don't think you'd want them to poke around without the ultrasound. LOL It might take them longer because they have to wait for pathology, I'm guessing, and to make sure they leave clean margins. These are very important things, and not to be rushed. \nI, too, broke off a relationship when I found out I had cancer. Fighting this disease took all my effort, and he was kinda high-maintenance. Yet another reason to hate this freakin cancer. Oh, well. \nGood luck. Hope this helps some.\nHugs,\nRita\n ",

My daughter Theresa left work a little early to avoid some of the heaviest rainfall. She works in a brand new industrial complex, but she has to go through 3 or 4 miles of bad, rural road to get there unless she takes the freeway, which she did. \nThank you all for thinking of us. We have the tail-end of this storm to get through, and then we have sunshine for the next week or so. \nDi, what's going on with you? I loved the card you sent, but didn't get my act together in time to send any out. Give us an update, my friend. \nL&H, Rita\n ",

I used those through my treatment as some of the drugs they prescribe made me hyper. It really worked, and you don't need a prescription. Or a Benadryl capsule may do the same without taking Tylenol.

My breasts are a bit larger, too. But in clothing I doubt that anyone can tell. My kids certainly can't, and they're adults. \nYou should also know that I went into this surgery thinking that I would have a lumpectomy and radiation, and that's IT. After the surgery they offered me chemo because of the size of the tumor and I decided to go for it, even tho my nodes were negative. The plus side is I have the satisfaction of knowing I did everything I could to prevent a recurrence, and I have better hair than I EVER had prior to chemo. \nHang in there, Sherry.
