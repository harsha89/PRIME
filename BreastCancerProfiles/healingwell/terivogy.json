      "Content": " Hi guys. I had my first mammogram last Tuesday (I'm 40) and had a call back Friday to get more images and an US. I did that yesterday. There's no history of BC in my family. After the additional images were done, I was taken to another room for the US. After she was done, I made the mistake of looking at the screen. Now I obviously don't know what I'm looking at but I quickly saw some white clusters around my nipple area. I have severe depression (started yet again on antidepressants yesterday), severe anxiety disorders and severe very frequent panic attacks. So now I'm thinking the absolute worst. Now when they called me for the second mamm and US, she read \"no suspicious activity\". That went in one ear and out the other because I always think the worst. I'm trying not to but its hard. When i spoke to my doctors office, they said they see this all the time. My first results showed fibrocystic tissue, I guess I should have said that earlier. After speaking with my doctors office, I called my mother and she also has that fibrocystic tissue. None of what I'm told makes me feel better. I'm terrified. Constantly shaking and crying that my body hurts from stess and tension. I came here to type this all out and this actually helped a bit.\nWhether you can or can't, you're right.\n#teamchris #fightlikeagirl #teamchrisallsup ",
