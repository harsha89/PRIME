      "Content": " eek is right Les, You and your wife are now everyday in my thoughts and prayers. All the best to your journeys. please keep in touch if you would. Krisha p.s. No apoligies are needed you have peg him, He is not good for my moral or anything. Believe me if I had the means to leave I would have about\n 2-3 years ago, He treats me like a child rather than a wife. EX: I love my job I drive a school bus and I train new trainees to get there cdl license I enjoy it not alot of money though and alls he does is put's it down the jobs not good enough. H esays alls i am is school bus driver, It's a go nowhere job it's p/t ( it works for now we have kids that still need supervision) I've asked him for ten years now to help me financially to go to school to get a good career He told me I should have thought about\n college when I was younger. Can't get loan he makes to much. I feel literally trapped and he wants me to go work in this factory we have here in town because of the benefits which we have through his teamsters job. He wants more coverage and profit sharing after 3 years of employment. its 50 hrs a week we have kids. Maybe it's just me but why should he tell me who, what, when, where, why and how . I thought this was my life too not just his. And alls he does is buy old cars and toys collects them and I keep thinking to my self why can't he make that investment in me? Instead he'd rather not help me and then complain, which I'm so tired of hearing everyday literally! So please no apologies. get back to me soon and thanks for reading. It really does help me. ",

      "Content": " Hello out there I am new to this sight and I'll get right down to it. I have family history of microcalcifications with pre-cancerous cells cluster with my aunt and scatterd with my mother and dense breasts which I know can be hard to read in mammograms. They were also non palpapble in my mothers case. SCAREY! I went in for a baseline mammogram last friday and thought I was good to go Monday, Tuesday morning a phone call asking me to come in for more pictures of the left breast. I'm concerned. my good friend was just diagnosed with stage 3c breast cancer she has had no symptoms and never felt anything until she did a self breast exam and found a pea sized lump. So now i'm nervous. I was webbing info alot last night and wanted to show my husband different things that it can or cannot be and he looked at me and said \"I don't know why your worried it's like you looking for something to wrong with you, Why do you want something to be wrong with you. walked out of the room. he said you have no symptoms your not in pain so I don't understand why you want something wrong?\" I started to get tearry eyed because I feel my partner disregarded my concerns. I know in my heart that there is probably nothing wrong, but should I have not researched info or asked him to care. And this is not the first time he hasn't been there for my worries. also, this friend with terrible cancer is our friend and he stated just last week \" I don't know what I'll do if something happens to her, she doesn't deserve this because she such a good person.\" Please someone tell me what's wrong with him or is it just me! Worried and sickened by my husband\n ",

(Gyn) about\n what she read in the report and she did tell me they did find a suspicious lump in the left breast that is indisquishable (excuse my spelling) I do still have dense breast yes that's part of being young, So they will do the compression mam on that region.
