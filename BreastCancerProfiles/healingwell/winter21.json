      "Content": " I was called back for my mammogram. 3D scans look good, but 2D shows an area that needs further evaluation. Person on the phone said it looks like overlapped tissue so I go back for another mammogram.. I have been called back before for cyst, but this time I am scared to death! Please help me if you can \n ",
