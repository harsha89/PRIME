    "Content": " Hi \nMy dad has been diagnozed with Thymoma cancer and they could not remove it via surgery. He started his first round of chemo this past monday, tuesday and wednesday. He was fine until Friday. Today he said it feels if he is on fire from the inside and then starts to get cold. \nAnyone got this from the red devil chemo? ",
