    "Content": " Hi, have been on tamoxifen for 2years. Until recently I have been having horrifying side effects. I am so moody and I feel out of control. . One minute I am screaming at my family and the next am balling like a baby. I feel so mean and sad and desperate for help. Please can someone help me so I don't feel like I am alone and crazy......\nI have also had bad weight gain and depression. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated. \n ",
