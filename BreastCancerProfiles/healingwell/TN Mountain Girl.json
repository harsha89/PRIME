    "Content": " Anyone out there with a similar diagnosis?  I was diagnosed in April with b/c stage IV, HER-2+ with mets to my liver, lungs, and bones. I have received 10 treatments of Taxotere, Herceptin and Zometa.  The Taxotere was very harsh and the dosage was decreased to 60%,  I was hospitalized twice with MRSA and low white blood cells before being given Neulasta injections.  In addition to this, I have had the shingles.  My last round of tests showed the tumors in my liver are aggressively growing again.  The doc changed my meds and left me on Zometa, Herceptin and an experimental drug called RAD001.  Most of my pain is in my liver.    ",
