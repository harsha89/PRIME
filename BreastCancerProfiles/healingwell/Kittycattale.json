      "Content": " Thank you Janice and Bev...I so appreciate your responses. I am glad that I finally have a wonderful and thorough gyn. However, my head will keep spinning until I have an answer. I'm sure both of you can relate to that one. It sounds like each of you has been through so much, I worry that I may not be able to care for my mother and cats if something is really found. I know that sounds crazy, but responsibilities are many. Please take care and thank you again. ",
