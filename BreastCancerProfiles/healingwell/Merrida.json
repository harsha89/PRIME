Did your doc run blood work to check your WBC before rx'ing you an antibiotic?\nMy only concern with abx is that, in my opinion, some docs rx them out like candy w/o knowing if they're really needed, ..... ergo, we now have super-bugs that our regular run of the mill abx don't work on anymore, and they're having to create more and more powerful strains.\nAs for the aspiration,...again, just my personal chime in,....it's over before you know it. I've always had lumpy breasts and after a while, you just get used to your new normal.\nPlease do not get concerned if after he aspirates it, the lump returns. A cyst is a solid sack, a membrane, and it's attached. The fluid inside that sack gets pierced and the fluid is retrieved through aspiration. But unless the sack is detached and remove, that cyst, all cysts wherever they are (same goes for things like cystic acne, or body cysts), our bodies just fill that cavity back up again over time.

These and the x-rays and \"mock\" scan are done so they can take the measurements and know in advance where to project the rad.\nYou really do get used to it, and since you go 5 days a week, it just becomes routine.\nMy oncos have told me to refrain from having any breast surgery in the breast that had the partial mast. But see, I did something different than you....I had what was considered elective surgery to remove tissue from both breasts that was pre-cancerous and showed significant changes to the tissues via comparison. That is why I had a plastic surgeon brought in on my team.\nHE told me they can do a fat graft if I wanted to try and equal my (now rather quite) asymmetrical breasts. What's left of them.\nTruth is, I'm liking the small one and I'm seeing him to discuss having the \"larger\" one (which is still pretty darn small, think an orange in a sock) reduced. My scars are beautiful, they can hardly be seen unless you look super close.\nYes, the rad made that one breast more dense but from my perspective, it just got a little firmer so it isn't as \"floppy.\" It isn't hard. I still have quite the evidence of the rad burns on my super sensitive skin, so we're waiting.\nBut I like my smaller ta-tas, and I'm looking forward to having the left one reduced to match.\nOh, btw, after all this, my doc has also scheduled a colonoscopy. Oh yay, golly, can't wait for that, yep, that's going to be fun, oh me oh my,.....(sigh)\nBut my pap came back normal, so that's good. Time to weed things out.

When we're stressed, our eating patterns change, our hormones get affected, constipation can contribute to back pain, an unbalanced diet can even fiddle with our menstrual cycles, -- especially if you're under-eating, malnourished, or athletic with low body fat.\nBefore jumping the gun into thinking this may be any type of cancer, it sounds like you've been thoroughly checked out by your physicians. Symptoms too numerous to mention can \"cross over.\" Some symptoms of IBS are the same as if you are dehydrated or ate too much cheese.\nSo before getting worked up, take a deep breath, trust your doctors....and trust that anxiety has a rainbow of symptoms and styles in which it affects our lives!\nIf you do not feel safe, consult another physician if that will help ease your mind.\nM.\n...\n\"My time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War.\" ~~Vickie ",

Mine will not, nor would either of us want them to.....what goes around comes around, and I am leery and questionable about\n practices that do any type of insurance billing in what seems like less than up front ways. MT is so darn expensive though....this is going to be a temporary luxury.\nThis confuses me because we cannot have BP taken, yet we can wear compressive sleeve garments? Yet we can have lymphatic drainage massage? These are mixed signals.\nI see my rad onco next Wednesday (I saw his \"fill in\" today who I perceived wanted nothing more than to spend as little time with each patient as possible and dodging questions right and left, inching out the door). MY onco is way cooler, so I'll ask him next week. Since my MT is trying to work on my right shoulder, it does involve my pec muscle, deltoid, bicep, inner tricep, traps, scalenes,....all the muscles needing \"digging into\" to release the shoulder but I've got sort of mixed messages about\n do's and don'ts.\nThe cancer center allows 2 free 30-minute appointments with their MT, so I'm going to make those appts and pick up tips and pass them along.\nFunny thing. Dana Farber offers massage (and Reiki) to all of their CA patients as part of their \"Living With Cancer\" wellness program. But I called my insurance, and for the first time since I've had my insurance (which I've had forever minus 6 months)....as long as I got a letter of medical necessity, they'd cover massage, and even acupuncture. (For reimbursement, not direct pay).\nThis year, it's a no go. They will not accept any claims from any CMT, even if they are deemed medically necessary. I'm instructed, we all are, to maintain pliability, flexibility and ROM of the arm/s affected by the BC and radiation....something I'm already struggling with.\nBut even though it's all over their papers, pamphlets and posters,.....it must be in my head.

There's a zipper in the front up the middle, and the shoulder straps Velcro close so they're adjustable.

I would imagine tomorrow at the latest.\nThey've taken very good care of me, and they've stayed in touch with me, and I've been receiving calls from social workers and BC support groups (they have a little network going, and I think it might be nice to communicate with others, to learn more about\n this, and to be able to share,...beyond the book and binder they gave me). \nThe Center has been really good at reaching out to me.\nQuite sincerely, my only complaint is that even now, 6 days later, I'm still in considerable pain. Not \"just an ache,\" and not \"just pulling,\" but pain. I hope he sees this and is willing to prescribe something stronger, but to be honest, the impression I get is that I'm not holding out much hope.\nAs I mentioned, I don't think they understand how to prescribe pain medication for someone who's already taking CP meds (which, btw, strangely enough, aren't even touching this pain.....why would that be? I mean other than one is for CP and this is acute pain...Silly me still thought it would help, maybe a little). His RN asked if I could \"just take more\" of the pain med I had on hand. If he doesn't help me today, I will contact my prescribing physician, explain what's going on, and ask. Because this is nuts. I'm expecting him to tell me it \"shouldn't be hurting\" like this a week after surgery. Maybe not, but golly, it does.\nI got that Texas sized bee sting thing!

Due to the nature of progression shown on my scans, my surgeon will be removing these tissues as well as the identified tumor.\nDo you have any info to share? This happened so fast that I think my brain is on delay trying to process everything that has happened.\nM.\nEDIT: My Sx got postponed...

He noted that while both breasts still show \"moderate swelling,\" there is \"obviously more swelling and bruising\" on the right one (where the nodes were taken from).\nNo path report yet. I'm seeing him again in one week. He did comment on the amount of tissue that was removed being remarkable so we both knew going in, that the \"after\" would be dramatic.\nAs far as the pain goes, he did not prescribe anything, he told me there's really nothing more he could do, and all he could recommend at this point was ice, my regular pain meds, more ice, compression,......\nHe DID say that he will not make me wait until my f/u appointment next Monday to find out the path results, and that there's no reason I should be kept waiting for them, and that he will call me immediately when he gets them.\nHe told me that I do not have a fever (which I know, because I've been taking it), there are no signs of infection (such as warmth, redness, and there's only a tiny bit of drainage coming through onto the gauze pads in the bra, nothing remarkable), so as he saw it, everything looked very good, and he was quite pleased. (And with no sign of infection, I made the assumption, I'll admit it, that therefore I somehow \"shouldn't\" be in this much pain?)\nI'll let you guys know when I hear from him with the path report, and I'll check in after I have my follow up in one week. In the meantime, keep the girls wrapped or compressed in this bra with gauze.\nOther than having to just suck it up re: the pain, I came away from today's appointment feeling pleased, as he was pleased with the results. I'm assuming by next Monday, given the path report will be in by then too,....that \n is when I'll have a better idea of what my future looks like with regards to radiation therapy, etc. \n(Now tomorrow I have to go get XRays of my spine because I fell and landed right where my fusions are,--of course,--is there any other way?...so here's hoping I don't get to add \n to my extensively growing list of \"things to do\" in the Health Department here!)\nM.\nMy time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War. ~~Vickie\n ",

      "Content": " Oh, thank you so much Jane! I appreciate every bit of support I get.\nI feel really fortunate that the PS was there to remove all that other precancerous tissue. I am very fortunate and blessed that our insurance company was willing to pay for this as well.\nMy surgeon feels that I am \"probably in more pain\" because this was more involved than a standard lumpectomy. (But evidently, not so sure that's \"worthy\" of stronger pain meds?)\nI don't want to go through any of this ever again, if that was a choice that helped to increase my chances, that I'm happy about\n it. They removed so much tissue, I look like I have the profile of a 12 year old boy now.\nAnd that's okay. As Hubby reminds me,..the most important thing is taking care of, and that is this cancer. I swear, I've married the most wonderful man in the world! (Heck, we've come a long way,...\"working on each other\"....and all for the better).\nAs for the fusions and decompressions, my concern is this: I fell backwards, my T12/L1 landing right against the door knob of one of the drawers in the kitchen island. Then as I slipped, I landed directly on my sacrum.\nWhen I had my back surgery (a year ago) he told me my L5-S1 was very tenuous, and he contemplated fusing that area as well because it was so damaged, but he decided against it to help keep me as mobile as possible.\nSo when he asked me if I was having back pain,...or back and leg pain,...and I told him both,-- things got silent for a bit. Nothing has improved since that fall, but I'm realistic enough to know that so much \"other stuff\" has been going on, that I haven't been able to immerse myself into PT like I normally would, and I've gained weight from sitting around (and I'm at maximum density, so I can really feel these pounds).\nThe bruises were pretty gnarly looking, and as of today, they're mostly dissipated.\nI just fell at the worst time, in such a bad way, hitting the areas of my fusions he told me were not as stable as he'd like, but fusing L1 through L5 was his best choice.\nToo much stuff going on. Too many plates full. Having a hard time juggling.\nM.\nMy time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War. ~~Vickie ",

I used it when I was lifting,...not sure why I forgot about\n it.\nSo now I have UNFLAVOURED protein powder, 24 grams of protein per scoop plus BCAA's. I'm going to mix that up with frozen fruit, water, a capful of vanilla extract as a carrier, flax seed powder, psyllium seed powder, and a tablespoon of flax seed oil....maybe a few ice cubes too. But this will help me get more protein into my diet, more nutrients, and hopefully help lower my cholesterol too. (My body does NOT like statins in the least, so I'd like to try diet and exercise first, especially with all this crappola going on!)\nNot sure why I forgot it. Ohhhh, yeah. Maybe because my darling Husband, in his effort to make the house appear tidy, just puts stuff away I have on the counter (so I can see it and it reminds me to use it),...and stuffs whatever he finds in whatever cabinets are near-by.

I can't explain it but for the past 6-8 weeks, I'm behaving depressed.\nI remember when I \"used to be depressed,\" as in clinically, and this doesn't quite feel the same. But I'm feeling overwhelmed and also empty.\nMy onco explained the surgery removed the tumor and the lymph nodes were taken,...the radiation is to kill off any cancer cells that may still be around the site....but one aspect of my path had her concerned as it pertains to the delivery system of cancer migrating to other places in my body. The chemo, being systemic, would be to minimize that potential.\nI felt like I could handle the surgeries, even the radiation,....and silly me, I thought I was in the clear as far as chemo goes. Yesterday's appointment felt like a good, hard slap to what was just settling down as my reality.\nI'm so thankful for having you here on HW....this truly is my rock of support. I appreciate you reaching out to me, especially now, as I'm feeling more withdrawn.\nM.\nMy time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War. ~~Vickie ",

      "Content": " I wish I could help you out and offer not only information, but also subjective experience.\nIn my case, I got diagnosed in November 2013, had surgery December 2013, and over the last 2 weeks, I had my first meetings with my radiation oncologist, then my medical oncologist.\nMy radiation therapy should start in about\n 3 weeks, and then the hormones.\nMy medical onco sent my tissue out for a test called OncoTypeDX. Of the three markers, there was one negative one which concerned her, and that's why she sent the tissue out, and that will tell me if I need chemo on top of all this.\nNow, as I understand it (remember, I'm speculating, because I'm just stepping into those shoes as we speak). Part of the way the hormones work is to block or reduce estrogen. So that's the opposite of HRT which introduces estrogen to the body.\nWomen I know who went on HRT, and thereby increasing their estrogen levels, one (of the many) side effects was that they noticed their skin improving greatly.\nSo, I'm guessing that in our case, when we're put on meds to lower estrogen even further, one possibility is that it has the opposite effect on our skin, compared to HRT, and unfortunately that may include losing elasticity in our skin.\nRemember, not only am I not a doctor, but I'm several steps behind you with regards to hormone therapy and the side effects.\nDid you mention your concerns to your medical oncologist? Did they discuss any of this with you before you had your hormone therapy? Your onco will have much more information on what's going on.\nPlease post back and let us know how you make out!\nM.\n...\n\"My time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War.\" ~~Vickie ",

      "Content": " Hello there IAS,\nAnd welcome aboard the BC train!\nI read your previous two comments written on a different thread, and would like to pop in with my $ 0.02.\nJust wanted to mention that \"calcifications\" do not always go hand-in-hand with BC, and in-and-of themselves are not always scare-flags.\nSince I was 14, I always had lumpy breasts (fibrocystic breast disease) and around the corner every few years, I'd find out that I had calcification clusters, in both breasts, along with clusters of fibrotic tissue and cysts. These formations maintained, and some changed, for many years.\nI am now 51.\nWhen they put you on your tummy to do these tests, your breasts are,....exposed to hang freely (I can't think of any more delicate way to phrase that, but I know you now get the picture). So it isn't the same as if you're lying prone on a firm surface, like your bed or beach sand.\nIf you feel you'll be anxious, always discuss with your doctor the possibility of being prescribed something for anxiety for that day, that you can take to help quell your nerves a bit and relax you. I do not \n but am not positive, that they would offer any type of injectable sedative. (They didn't for me, anyway).\nAs some of us mentioned, in reality, it isn't as bad of an experience as our imaginations would lead us to believe! I was quite comfortable. They go out of their way to make sure you're propped up in such a way to feel supported. They realize this is an awkward position to be in, and you'll find they really do go out of their way to help you feel as de-stressed as possible! :)\nM.\n...\n\"My time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War.\" ~~Vickie ",

There's a good chance your doc just wants to follow up and make sure. Rather than assume. That's a very good thing!!\nMy guess is if the aspirated fluid/tissue pulled up malignant cells you'd be in there so fast your head would spin. That you're schedule for something generally considered a bit more routine and a follow-up *may* be why your doctor doesn't feel this is an emergency.\nYou can always ask to have the test sooner, express your anxiety and concern, ask to be put on a call list, etc.\nabout\n 10-15 years ago I felt a hard lump in my left breast the size of a quarter that did not feel like one of my regular cysts, and it was at the 4:00 position, not where I usually have my clusters of cycsts,.....and I called Brigham & Women's ....pretty much the magical pioneer caring institute for breast health in my area, explained the situation, and the soonest they could get me in just for an exam was several months later.\nI understand the anxiety, I really do. (BTW: That quarter sized lump turned out to be nothing) But that didn't detract from the sheer panic of waiting and not knowing.\nM.\nModerator Anxiety/Panic Forum\n\"My time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War.\" ~~Vickie ",

      "Content": " Now that you mention it, I do recall seeing your name over on the AP forum. As you've noticed, it's a pretty busy place.\nI know what you mean about\n how all these visits and referrals are burning a hole in your pocket. I've found starting in January of this year, I'm jumping through more fiery hoops of red-tape and denials than I've ever had to (and we have excellent insurance), I'm receiving denials on meds they filled just a month ago,...and this is just the beginning I fear.\nWhy do you feel like they are not listening to you? Because they refer you to another doctor? Are they referring you to specialists who may have more experience in dealing with what your Dx's indicate?\nI understand not getting answers, and I want to ask you: Do you ask questions? Sometimes we expect, (I know my history has been this way and I am in the process of learning to change that),...if we state what our problems/complaints/issues are,....that should be sufficient for the doctor to understand we're concerned and provide feedback on what we're commenting on.\nFor various reasons, it often takes direct and specific questions, many times they have to be repeated over and over, even within the same visit, to get answers. Again, something I'm learning now, standing up for myself when I feel they're dodging me.\nAsking specific questions, and not leaving or being satisfied until you get specific answers, goes a long way. Ask particulars, like what they're ruling out, what they're looking for, what does your Dx mean and how does that translate to your goals of having a family,....why are they referring you to someone else, what do they anticipate these new doctors will detect that they, themselves, aren't able to....\nAll too often they are hard questions to ask, but we must persevere. And heads up, they'll try to make you feel uncomfortable for having the gall to dare ask about\n your very own health (<-- read sarcasm!)....but keep at it. It takes practice, it involves working through lots of nervousness and fear of rejection and judgment, but....don't despair, just keep plugging along. \nThis is your body, and by golly, you have every right to have all your questions answered to your satisfaction. Get a copy of your medical records (COMPLETE) and read them,...see if they are \"accidentally\" omitting information, or see if they're choosing their words a little too carefully, if you know what I mean, when relaying information to you.\nWe say it all the time, we mean it all the time, and yet it remains one of the most challenging things we must do: But we simply must be our own best advocate!\nM.\n...\n\"My time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War.\" ~~Vickie ",

I'm sure the anxiety gets compounded because things are uncertain with your insurance at the moment.\nNow, from what you've written, it sounds like that your \"starting point\" will be a standard mammogram. That's usually the first step, the basic diagnostic tool that helps to give an overall picture of what's going on.\nI've had fibrocystic breasts since I first started my period, so it was not uncommon throughout the years for my doctors to have me repeat mammograms or get ultrasounds. So for now, you get to tuck this away into a little box for later because you have effectively handled it.\nYou felt something wrong, you monitored it, you asked for help and suggestions and input, and you followed up by calling your doc to schedule an appointment for as close to \"immediate\" as anyone could hope for! Gosh, if you think about\n it, it's not that far away. It's less than 4 weeks, so that's great!\nNow, just don't over-think things because you've done a great job of taking care of matters.

I have a neuro who is very direct with me in the moment, but generally speaking, most refrain from saying anything, at all, in any way, to the patient, until the diagnostics are in.

He's always starting some sort of ruckus. Best to let him be.\nIf you've had two separate ultrasounds, why do you think they are lying to you about\n the results? There are no benefits in doing so.\nWhat makes you think they are ignoring your \"signs?\" Did you tell them \"your signs?\" They heard you? Did it occur to you they\n in fact listen, and that's why they did the ultrasounds? \n of them?\nPCOS is very common, so trying to find some secret, magic \"cure\" will only result in frustration.

Has insulin resistance and/or diabetes been ruled out? (Or did Dr. Google scare with you with horror stories? He's quite fond of doing that, and every now and again, we collectively need to give him a good swift kick in the pants!)\nYou did \"research?\" What kind, where, how, and from whom?\nI'm curious why you're latching onto IBS and OC as the only 2 possibilities....

But the diagnostic tests,--which are nothing to fear,--will help your doc get a better picture.\nAt this point, there's so little information to go on.\nI have had fibrocystic breasts since I was 14, so I was used to lumps and bumps. But I recall a time, about\n a decade ago, where I felt a \"new\" lump, and they scheduled me 4 months out!

Given I have anaphylaxis to NSAID's, that's simply not an option for me. She said there's really nothing else they can prescribe for pain.\nHe's seeing me Monday, instead of Tuesday, because I'm having so much pain.\n((sigh))\nI'm frustrated, to be sure. I'm also somewhat used to similar circumstances, given that I've been dealing with chronic pain for (roughly) half of my life... So I know that it makes trying to manage pain more difficult. But I'm just surprised it's become this difficult.\nI expressed,..........again,......(reminded her) that I have quite a history of orthopedic surgeries, and understand recovery, and that I'm not looking to have my post-op pain eliminated. I'm just looking to feel at least somewhat comfortable.\n......just \"somewhat\" would really be fine.\nSounds odd, but it feels like I have a rod in my right breast, (the more painful of the two), that's also acting like a straw and is sucking and tugging at all the tissues inside.\nWithout \"exerting\" myself or \"pushing it,\" they DO want me to move my arms and keep them mobile, (just nothing to stress or strain my chest). I'm nervous to do even that now....\nWell hopefully Monday will shed some light on this....maybe even just \"somewhat....\"\nM.\nMy time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War. ~~Vickie ",

It's the unknown.\nMany women have cystic breasts, and they can occur (like in my case, they started when I got my period and just got lumpier and moved around ever since then). It is not uncommon.\nSometimes if they can identify a particularly hard or painful cyst, they'll aspirate it, or drain the fluid out of it. This doesn't hurt, and afterwards, things feel better because the painful lump isn't there anymore.\nCysts can refill with fluid, which may or may not need to be drained again, but you'll know what to expect\nThe MRI is fun (sarcasm) because you lay on your tummy and your breasts hang down so the machine can capture images.

With all the questionnaires I had to fill out before seeing each doctor, before each diagnostic test, with each health professional I've seen (including my PMC), while they ask about\n things like smoking and drinking,....the only \"food product\" that gets inquired about\n is caffeine consumption.\nI can remember back in the 1980's when I got my first mammogram,...when I first found out how congested my breast tissues were, being told I have fibrocystic breast disease (nothing to worry about\n, as they explained at the time, just lumpy breasts, and in my case, it became quite extensive and very painful)...we also monitored the calcifications in addition to the growing number of cysts and their rate of growth and \nlocations,...\nAs the years progressed, and as the changes were being noted, that was the first time (that I recall) being instructed to reduce my caffeine consumption,--merely citing that \"excessive caffeine intake can exacerbate my breast disease.\"\nI never really questioned it beyond that, but didn't forget it.\nIt was also brought up when I saw my PMD Friday, and (as I'm still feeling in a whirlwind) it never occurred to me to ask what the correlation was.\nBest I can tell, other than that mystery, I think the best any of us can do is common-sense eating as healthy and balanced as possible. And for me, it's been recommended that in addition to getting protein in my diet, to supplement with protein shakes. (Which I make from scratch using unflavoured, unsweetened protein, frozen fruit, flax oil, psyllium husk powder, and flax seeds).\nYou make a good point. Beyond genetics, it isn't like we can link our getting BC to something we did or ate, so it does make sense, we cannot prevent a recurrence along those same lines. Thank you again for replying.

(My point is,....in my opinion, that place scares more people than it helps).\nI'm not a doctor, I'm not a medical professional, and nothing you read here should ever take the place of the advice of your real doctor. So, that's first, right out of the gate.\nI've had dense, or \"lumpy breasts\" for over 30 years. It's much more common that you may realize. Sure, hormones play all kinds of roles in our development,----breasts, and otherwise.\nLet me share something with you: I grew up around horses since I was a kid, and at one point, through my own fault, nothing to do with my horse, I got kicked in the chest. Yes, when you injure an area that is so dense, filled with glands, and nodes, and ducts, and fat, and fibrous tissue,....well heck yeah, you better believe you can bruise the area. (Our lady bits are tender, after all).\nMy doc just kept an eye on me, but it never stopped me from caring for my horses (that was my life, my horses!!)....\nIt doesn't take something that drastic to get a bruise or trauma to the tissue, but my point is, hey, it happens. Learn to trust your doctor. Learn to stay away from trying to read between the misleading lines of Google, and go out and live your life. Stay in touch with your doctor (who will monitor any changes and keep a good eye on you)....\nThat's \n job, you know....looking after you. So,...let them do their job without trying to second to guess them, especially with something as completely unreliable as google!\nM.\nMy time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War. ~~Vickie ",

Mind, I had a fair volume of tissue removed from both breasts, however it was the right one that had the tumor removed and sentinel node biopsies.\nThat right breast is still very red (I see my surgeon and oncologist tomorrow, so I'll discuss this with them then), I have the bruises still, again, which I expect and have been watching. It's a little unsettling to see your nipple change texture and colour though.\nTo me, it looks redder than I recall (subjectively, like the redness is covering a greater surface area than I recall from just a few days ago). Feels warm to my touch, but I'm not running a temp. I was given permission to increase to oxyIR for four days, starting yesterday, but that's it. \nI alternate between wearing my bra and not, I'm still also taking 3 grams of Tylenol every day, but the pain in that breast and arm pit are still above a moderate level.\nSince \"they\" feel I \"should\" be over this by now and that I \"shouldn't\" be experience pain anywhere near this level, I'm feeling frustrated. My questions are about\n wearing bras, about\n what type of material for clothing since it's sensitive to touch and sensitive to pressure.\nAnd tomorrow, with the radiation plan being implemented, it's been explained I may feel sore from that, similar to a sunburn. So with all this, does anyone have any suggestions on possible clothing and bra options to at least not tweak the pain up?\nThanks for any help.\nM.\nMy time for tears will be at my Victory...not at the start of the War. ~~Vickie ",

The RN just said it was \"near the nipple\" and explained about\n the Geiger counter used, and how the radioisotopes travel to the nodes. \nI'm overall pretty okay with injections, (the biopsies weren't too bad)...and I know it should be the least of my concerns. But do they hurt more than that? And does it hurt all those hours I'll be waiting until they prep me and get me into sx?\nThe whole waiting in between will be, I am imagining, stressful enough...

      "Sample": "I was diagnosed with BC in November and had surgery in December. I elected to have the affected breast tissue removed at the same time....Because this is nuts. I'm expecting him to tell me it \"shouldn't be hurting\" like this a week after surgery....Mind you, I had surgery done on both breasts. BC was on the right, but I had what was considered prophylactic elective surgery where I choose to have tissue removed from both breasts that, while not cancerous, presented with significant changes from previous scans....If it were me, especially with your family history, I would be extremely pro-active and get the surgery to remove any questionable tissue. When I had my tumor removed, I also had elected to prophylactically remove any precancerous tissues that were showing changes from previous mammograms....Then as I slipped, I landed directly on my sacrum. When I had my back surgery (a year ago) he told me my L5-S1 was very tenuous, and he contemplated fusing that area as well because it was so damaged, but he decided against it to help keep me as mobile as possible....When I had my back surgery (a year ago) he told me my L5-S1 was very tenuous, and he contemplated fusing that area as well because it was so damaged, but he decided against it to help keep me as mobile as possible. So when he asked me if I was having back pain,...or back and leg pain,...and I told him both,-- things got silent for a bit....BC was on the right, but I had what was considered prophylactic elective surgery where I choose to have tissue removed from both breasts that, while not cancerous, presented with significant changes from previous scans. I wasn't taking any chances....But I'm 3 months to the year before my actual surgery, and 5 months since I finished radiation. I still have to use a numbing cream on my breast because of friction burns....",
