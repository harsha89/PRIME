      "Content": " Susan:\nThanks for the note. The way I understand it, my cancer is in my lymph nodes on my lung, so no surgery for me. But stories of encouragement like yours are most welcome. I did hook up with a woman through the wellness community via phone. Her cancer metatsised to her liver and her drs. were giving her death sentences a few years ago. She is on the same treatment I am on, Flaslodex, and is doing well.\nThanks again for responding to my post and keep doing GREAT!!! ",
