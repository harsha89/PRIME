      "Content": " mk & jo-ann tks so much for being with us on a special day. Let me tell of the grave side service. Again it was friends and family.. We expected the Army to send 2 soliders to fold the flag but when we got there there was a full military honors squad. They did a 21 gun salute, folded the flag played taps and there was a fly over. I was so impressed with how the Army stepped up and did that. The 21 gun salute is reserved for active duty soliders killed in combate or in the line of duty and I have never heard of fly over for a solider, only for top brass and dignataries. It helps to know that everyone loved my Mel and I was glad to share her. What mel showed yall, she showed us everyday. There has been 3 services for mel already and Brook Army Hospital is having one tomrrow....talk about love need I say more.. You ladies stay strong anad spread the love we all need it. ",
