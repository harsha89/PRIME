I found that the ones that resembled my own hair looked horrible on me. I went for a little lighter color with highlights. This way you didnt have that flat all around color. I also ordered one from Paula Young.com. I had to order a petite (it helped going to the wig shop, there she told me I had a small head) When the wig came, it had too much hair. I brought it to my stylist and she trimmed it up and it looked great. Average price for the Paula Young wigs are $30. I got that one so that I could alternate and clean them. Good luck.\n \n ",

With the taxatere the Dr. put me on vitamin B6 100 mg to ward off that neuropathy. I didnt get much of the bone pain that many do get. After each treatment I would get a drippy nose and felt like I had a cold. Some of my nails got black streaks on them (easily covered with nail polish) The xeloda was a breeze. I did not get the diarrhea that many get. My hands and feet turned a brownish color, my kids found that weird. Feet peeled like crazy were so dry. So my advise is to get some udder cream or bag balm or a really great lotion and slather your feet nightly. Email me anytime. Good luck. Good thoughts coming your way.\n ",

You do not want to wait until the symptoms appear. After your first or second treatment, you will know if you need to take anything. Also remember to drink plenty of water.

I find if the stoll gets too hard or I strain, I bleed. Have had colonoscopies and exams. Once it was an internal hemmorrhoid (sp). I had to take metamucil everyday to stay regular (I should be still doing this). There was a suppository the doc (gastro doc) gave me. From then, I have tried to not let myself get constipated. He told me that bright red means it is near the surface and most times not to worry about. But have it checked first. With my navelbine, I get a bit constipated the first two or so days. I try to eat dries apricots and make sure I drink plenty of water. Eat prunes, or whatever makes ya go. I know this one snuck up on you, but if you see yourself getting \"behind\", just increase the fluids and fruits and see if it helps.\n \n ",
