    "Content": " Hi, am also experiencing itch on the left side of my breast. Sometimes it could be intense. No other symptoms too. I went further research about\n itchiness in breasts and found out that it may be the cause of dry skin. They recommend a lot of creams on the net and am not familiar with all of them. Since my skin is very sensitive, I tried putting on petroleum jelly surrounding my left breast and it worked. It minimized the itchiness. I'll try to do it again tomorrow and will tell you about\n further results. \n I don't have burning sensation though. Just plain itch. ",
