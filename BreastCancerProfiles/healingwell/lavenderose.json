    "Content": " The key thing in your post which made me answer was you mention you couldn't feel your feet hitting the edges of your shoes. That sounds more like neuropathy to me than lymphoedema. Not sure how old you are but maybe you could get tested for diabetes. Neuropathy can be a sypmtom which often is ignored in the early stages (I'm a cardiac/diabetes nurse). That said, it could also just be one of those things which comes and goes after treatment. I do agree with \n though, whatever it is, the doctor needs to take a look. I've lost count of the amount of stuff which has had me in a tail spin one moment and is cleared up and gone the next. For me, my onc told me that it's a two week rule. If it's still a problem after two weeks, it's best to get it investigated properly... and reduce your anxiety. For what it's worth though, I've never heard of lymphoedema in the feet - not even from breast secondary cancer... so I think it's probably just one of those odd things our bodies do occasionally! ",
