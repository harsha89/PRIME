    "Content": " I read a great article about\n Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome on this site: \n(link removed by moderator)\nIt discusses the reasons the pain persists such as there being a feedback loop between injured sensory nerves and the emotional pain centers of the brain which results in interpreting pain signals as much worse than they really are. \nIt discusses innovative treatment interventions.\n ",
