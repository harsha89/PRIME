I also had a mammogram the same day and when the doctor saw the mammogram pictures she asked me to stay for a biopsy with ultrasound. She told me she was sure it was cancer and she was right. The thyroid so far is OK, no cancer, but will check on it every six months.\nI don't know what I would have done if I didn't have Healingwell to be able hang out, talk and express my feelings not to mention the expert advice I've gotten.\nYou are not alone talk about\n anything you like. everyone understands how you feel.\nJane\n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " I didn't have a reduction, but did have a breast lift.\nIt was done at the same time as my lumpectomy both surgeons were in the OR a the same time.\nYes, both breasts were done at the same time.\nI spent three days in the hospital and that was because my BP was so low. Usually it's same day surgery. As for pain only had some when I was in the recovery room and was given Dilaudud IV after that my pain was mimimal so when I got home all I needed was extra strength Tylenol. I had a drain in each breast they were removed a week later along with the stitches at the doctors office. \nWhile in the hospital I was given surgical bras and also was given three more for home use when I was released. \nI was delighted with the results and the fact that there was very little pain with the exception of what I felt in the recovery room which was quickly taken care of and it never returned.\nGoing for the reduction is a good thing to do the same time your cousin has her lumpectomy and I'm certain they will do both lumpectomy and reduction at the same time.\nTomorrow I start seven weeks of radiation and will soon be on Arimidex, hormone therapy, for five years.

That I can deal with.\nI'm starting radiation beginning early February, but not sure when I'll be starting Arimidex. I know if I experience the extreme side effects many have I will stop the drug and look for alternatives. I'm not telling you this to give you advice, but to tell you of my decision. Each of us must do what we think is best for ourselves. I cannot imagine living with severe deep bone pain for five years, possible Osteoporosis, broken bones, heart problems, nausea and can only wonder how some women do it. Believe it or not these are some of the common side effects.\nI will say that I'm optimistic about\n side effects, don't expect any. I think both you and I will do well.\nAll we can do is try and I'm very anxious to hear how your doing on Femara and sending positive thoughts to you.\nJane\nThe greatness of a nation is judged by the way it treats its animals.\n \n ",

I read all I could about\n Arimidex and am terrified of the side effects. I know no one gets them all, but many do have the terrible arthritis and suffer agonizing pain sometimes even after quitting the drug.

So far with this exception all my doctors are women.\nSaw my cardiologist yesterday at the hospital...cleared for surgery...as if I had a choice!!!\nWhile waiting for his secretary to type up the report I decided to find the cancer center and talk to someone about\n radiation treatments was told after surgery I would see the radiaologist and treatment would start wnen my surgery healed.

The thyroid gland compensates by enlarging, which usually overcomes mild deficiencies of thyroid hormone.\nIf the thyroid gland is then re-exposed to iodine, the nodules may produce thyroid hormone independently. Occasionally, the nodules may produce too much thyroid hormone, causing thyrotoxicosis. This is called a toxic nodular goiter.\nJeeze does this mean I should avoid iodine...confusing.\nBC doctor didn't call, called her secretary twice and she said the report wasn't back yet......maybe tomorrow. \nYes good news and one more to go.

      "Content": " Hi Michelle,\nNice to hear from you and it helps me to write down my feelings which seem to jump from a high to a low, right now a low.\nFunny thing about\n me I'm upbeat at night when I usually post, but not so much in the daytime. I still wake up thinking none of this is happening and I know it is. Of course this a daytime post.\n \nRight now I'm thinking what happened to me all of a sudden, been healthy for years, never sick and now three biggies within months...Lyme, Thyroid, Breast Cancer. I try to stay positive and if I don't I'll fall into a depression. Right now I feel like saying the hell with it I'm not going to have surgery, rads or possible chemo...all will make me sick and why would I do that even though I know I will.\n \nWhat is really helping me is the support and positive experiences of HW posters and sometimes I feel I am making way too much of it all because most of the people here have gone through their own hell much worse than I.\n \nI know I'm rambling on and on, not making sense and probably because I'm having a bad day thinking about\n what's to come and I know I have to quit it because if you all can do it so can I. \n \nNow about\n my vacation. I know someone who owns a condo in Saint Petersburg, FL it's empty right now that's where I'm going to stay for two weeks....free. I also have a very good friend in Brandon, FL, Carolyn Yoss, who owns a bed & breakfast called Behind The Fence and will spend a few days with her. I love her place it's like stepping back into the 1800's and the most peacfull place I've ever been.\n \nThen I will come home and back to reality and start rads and whatever.\n \nHave to say Michelle your post was good for me just knowing your thinking of me was a very nice thing to see.\nI feel better. \n \nJane ",

      "Content": " Judy, I will not be taking any chemo, just Arimidex. How come you had both chemo and Arimidex and how long were you on chemo?\nIt was the Onco DX test report that decided what I will be taking and I'm not sure it was offered or even available five years ago. I'm HER- er+ pr+ stage llA with an Onco score of 15 out of a possible 100 so am fairly low, in fact low enough that I thought all I would need is radiation.\nI've heard about\n the 'boost' they give you, but didn't realize it might burn even more.\nHave to agree with you that it is a bother that it has to be every day. The good part is it's 'only' seven weeks. I could have it done in a hospital about\n 4 miles from me, but my Oncologist says I have to go where she is and that's about\n 40 miles to and from.\nI wonder if you could share with me how they monitored you during the five years you were taking Arimidex. Also would like to know if they do any mammograms, pet scans, CT scans, blood work, EKG's...etc.\nI've done a lot of reading since diagnosed and it's all running together not to mention how much I've forgotten so talking with you helps a lot if you don't mind. Seems we both have the same kind of cancer and both are on Arimidex. BTW how nice it is to hear your almost finished, five years seems like such a long time.\nI'm relieved to hear you didn't have any of the really debilitating side effects I've been reading about\n and that is the best news I've had so far. I've been reading a lot at breastcancer.org and after reading many pages have found only one seemed to have no problems with Arimidex. Have to think that the ladies who were side effect free just don't post.\nThere were a few that suffered so much they stopped the drug.\nThanks so much for passing on your experiences, getting it first hand is no doubt the best.\nWhat do you mean by \"get some decent\" skin color back\" ???\nJane\nThe greatness of a nation is judged by the way it treats its animals.\n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks for your reply JUJU\nI have read about\n side effects and wondered if anyone on Arimidex was having any other than hot flashes.\nWhat worries me is fatigue, nausea and depression.\nI won't mind the hot flashes too much, recently recovered from Lyme Disease and am cold all the time...so heat will be welcome. \nAs for depression I cannot handle anti drugs.\nWhen I had Lyme I was given Paxil and in just a few days I thought I was losing my mind. I wasn't really depressed, just down about\n being so sick don't even know why it was prescribed and that drug almost pushed me over the edge. Also tried Wellbutrin, same thing happened. \nAs for dry skin you may be right about\n thyroid, common problem it seems.\nThe stinging of nerves and numbness in your little finger is not mentioned in side effects of Arimidex, but who knows it could be a rare one. We surely don't all have the same reactions.\nI so glad you shared your hormome therapy experience with me it took away a lot of my anxiety. I kept thinking how was I going to take a pill everyday for five years if it made me sick I was sure I would give up and take my chances. Even my doctor said the only side effect I will have is hot flashes. I can handle that........\nJane\nThe greatness of a nation is judged by the way it treats its animals.\n \n ",

      "Content": " Aspet, The same day I had my mammogram the doctor looked at the film and said you have BC. \nOf course she needed to confirm it and asked me to stay for both needle plus core biopsy, not a stereotactic. The area was numbed and the needle biopsy did not hurt at all, the core did, but was very bearable. A week later her diagnosis was confirmed.\nLater I had a lumpectomy and restoration, spent three days in the hospital because my BP was too low 80/40. The only real pain I felt was in the recovery room and I was given Dilaudid. When I went home I was practically pain free and took only X-stength Tylenol.\nPlease listen to MK, Bev & Lori they are giving you the very best advice and the small amount of discomfort is worth maybe saving your life.\nJane\nThe greatness of a nation is judged by the way it treats its animals.\n \n ",

I've been putting off radiation, but have decided to set up my appointment and get it over with. It's very difficult to start something that you know is going to make you sick.\nI've done a lot of reading about\n Arimidex which I will start when six weeks radiation is finished and that hormone drug scares the heck out of me. Common side effects are many and severe. I will try it, but if I get any of the 'common' SE, pain, bone loss, nausea, lack of sleep, arthritis, osteoporosis I will stop taking the drug....can't handle five years of any of this.\nMy ONCO score is 15 out of 100 (chance of recurrence) so it's nice and low and I'm looking into alternative treatments.\nWhen I was first diagnosed I was not at all worried, but the more I learned about\n BC and treatment the more worried I became and now I find myself thinking about\n it all the time.\nThanks for your heartfelt concern Bev.

      "Content": " Bev, so sorry I didn't see your question until now.\nThe reason I'was not a good candidate for a tram flap was because I was a recent smoker.....quit about\n 5 months ago. \nThe doctor was afraid I would have trouble healing and if I did it could cause a major problem.\nSmoking constricts blood vessels and without a good blood supply to the surgical site it was a real possibility.\nWould rather have what I got and that was a much needed breast lift. Can now wear a tee shirt without a bra, love it \nSurgery hasn't been scheduled for taking more tissue, but expect a call soon.\nOf course radiation and hormone therapy haven't started and I dread them both. Not sure of the spelling, but I'll be on Arimidex for 5 years to stop me from producing too much estrogen & progesterone. The doctor told me the only side effect may be hot flashes. Did she really think I wouldn't check it out there are many more possible side effects and I'll probably end up with all of them. darn.\nI wish I had just one doctor taking care of everything, but have four and it gets confusing.\nMy Oncotype score is 15 Scores range from 0 to 100 so 15 is good.\nI have stage 2A BC...HER2 minus, ER+ PR+\nI'm told it's very curable...I am so lucky.\nRead an article in Cure Magazine about\n TNBC (Triple negative breast cancer) sounded good to me...triple negative...until I read the article. Wow, it's not good and very aggressive.\nThis is the Fall issue and it's free if you qualify (cancer patients, survivors and care givers qualify) loaded with all kinds of cancer info and what's up and coming in research.\nYou can subscribe on line. You'll probably read it cover to cover like I did. It's a full size magazine\nwww.curetoday.com/\nor call 1-800-210-2873\nReplies I received here made up my mind to go back and get all the tumor and not rely on radiation.

      "Content": " Bev, I don't think I've shared very much, but thank you for for your kind words and you can bet I will share all I can in the future.\nOne thing I will never forget was the minute I was told I had BC and needed a biopsy and a lumpectomy I thought no big deal, didn't even faze me, remove the cancer and I'm done with it. I was not afraid of either procedure.\nI hadn't the slightest idea of what was to come, radiation, hormone therapy five l o n g years of it, pet scan, MRI, SIDE EFFECTS from rads and hormones and ongoing monitoring for life.\nNow you would think I would know this being a nurse, but I didn't. Cancer and treatment was among the many things that are not taught. You will only learn this if you work in a cancer center and it comes from on the job training. I worked in a small hospital mostly on a med surg floor and could take care of a post op patient with my eyes closed. \nSo what I'm saying is just because your in the medical field does not mean you know much about\n anything more than patient care and your immediate duties and even if you did more it is soon forgotten if not used. That's why at every nursing station there is a manual if needed. One exception is Diabetes, studied heavily in nursing, because it is so common and many patients hospitalized for other reasons have it.\nNow what I have has hit home and it hit hard. Knowledge is power and scary as well because most of us tend to learn all we can about\n our disease and find we have to do things we are afraid of. The future seems so uncertain, but because of you and many others on HW I know there is a future, but not without life changing situations and not all bad either.\nAs for newcomers I see some, but many are here today and gone tomorrow. What a loss this is because your right about\n what they have to say, what questions they have contributes so much.\nYou, MK and Tavish who also helped me so much when I first joined are not dinosaurs you are the mentors and veterans and are well loved by all.\nJane\nThe greatness of a nation is judged by the way it treats its animals.\n \n ",

No doubt the doctor saw them because she said she went very close to the muscle fascia,but not close enough.\nI have no doubt you would have had a lumpectomy and am not sure why you didn't because they were doing them then. Oh if we could only go back.\nHave you had reconstruction?\nBEV\nThanks for the vote...clean margins it is and glad we're all in agreement.\nWhat your saying doesn't sound funny at all let me describe my breasts before surgery.\nIf you remember The Golden Girls, Dorothy, played by Bea Arthur had it right when she said when you lay on your back your breasts flatten out...and fall to the side. Well that was me. She also mentioned looking up into a hand mirror....you know Bev...face lift look LOL.\nAs I said my breasts were really hanging down, gravity, 2 children, age, and the nipples were at the end pointing towards the floor. I also lost 80 pounds so they were long and narrow so if the tumor was behind the nipple the spicula had to grow a long way up from the nipple about\n 6 to 8\" to reach my chest wall behind where my breast starts. \nAfter my lift my breasts are exactly where they should be as if you were wearing a bra and when I lay on my back they stay there, don't really flatten at all or fall to the side. I find it unbelievable the work my plastic surgeon did. \nI can understand now how my surgeon can find the remaining cancer since it's on the chest wall.\nJane ",

I'm encouraged.\nAfter my biopsy I was not the least worried, but then found out on HW about\n chemo and radiation that scared me...never expected to hear it would be necessary.\nI have a question and first will give you the reason for it.\nIf I have cancer either breast or thyroid I want to go away by myself for two weeks maybe three. I want to visit two friends in Florida and then on to Kansas and go to the Grand Canyon with my first husband Jack who I'm still and always have been close to. How we both regret the divorce.\nSo what I am thinking I will have the lumpectomy which is most likely cancer and remove my thyroid if necessary (my endo doesn't think my thyroid is cancerous) but would like to hold off on the chemo and radiation. Will two or three weeks matter all that much. \nI'm feeling that this will be my only chance to see these people who I want to spend time with because it may be my last opportunity.\nI have fatigue from Lyme, but can handle it...just don't think I can handle that and chemo/radiation at the same time.\nSo what do you think and I'm hoping most will agree that lets say three weeks will not make a difference. \nI will take the Amtrack Auto train to Florida and driving the rest of the way.\nJane ",

I have recently last a lot of weight (80 lbs, but needed to lose it, but not thw way it happened I am 5'2\" and now 130 lbs, look good, feel lousy \n) total lack of appetite and practically living on Ensure. \nMy metabolic blood tests were OK, just a little low on Vit E-3 so was told to double up and take 2000 IU a day, had been taking 1000. Both my endo and onco are concerned about\n the weight loss.\nI don't know where I got the idea that with a lumpectomy there would be no chemo/radiation so when the doctor said she was very sure it was cancer I wasn't worried at all. Of course there is a chance that she's wrong and we are both hoping.\nI was pleased to get both done on the same day, tried to schedule it, but was told no, too much for me to handle in one...nonsence it wasn't so was pleased when the doctor agreed. \nSo yes Lori I have a very short wait for both answers.\nFor anyone facing a thyroid biopsy it's just about\n painless and less than 5 minutes. Breast longer probably because they have to go deeper, but not all that bad.\nYou'll have some bruising and very little pain if any.\nI think before surgery I will be having an MRI and bone scan...doctor mentioned both.\nAlso want to say my last mamogram was in 2005, very foolish of me, but too late for regrets. Ladies don't do what I did. This is one diagnosis I never saw coming.\nLori, it looks like I can go on my trip and thank you so much for replying and sharing your experience.\nI'm already packing.\nJane ",

      "Content": " Well if it's cancer I am the first in the family with any kind of cancer.\nIt was only a few weeks ago I found the lump in my left breast and it was the size of a large plum, very large and I probably could feel it because of the because of weight loss. I thought it was fibrous tissue and it was but deep inside there was this white spot and there was the tumor little bigger than a dime not completely round.\nType, stage, size will know Monday and I can't wait to hear the results can't wait to get it out.\nAs for the thyroid biopsy it was so much easier because your thyroid is right under the skin. Probably if I had that first I would have thought as you did, but it was after the breast biopsy and much quicker and easier. \nFor the breast bio the doctor used a thick needle and had to go deep and probe around took much longer. Then she told me not to turn and look because she didn't want to scare me and attached a handle that looked like the butt of a gun and told me I would hear a popping sound which was actually aspirating the tumor...did this four times and this part didn't hurt at all. I told her I didn't have to look because while waiting in the room for my biopsy I saw several of these handles with attached tubes in a trash can so knew what she was using. She said I'm going to have to get a lid for that can. \nBoth bios were done during an ultrasound were yours ?\nYour my inspiration Lori giving me hope that I just might not need chemo and that's all I ask for hope and if I do I do and will accept it knowing it's necessary.\nAnother question: how long did you have to be on chemo?\nI'm packing and anxiously waiting for Monday's results.

Have to say again I had no idea BC was so serious.\nI was happy to hear I was HER 2 negative, E P + \nSo I thought I'm not in big trouble, no drugs just radiation and it would be all over....not the case. Yes, better that HER 2 plus, but still not good.\nThen I keep thinking if I had of only had a mammogram even last year instead of way back in 2005 how much smaller would my tumor be. So now am playing the 'what if' game.\nMy vacation will be right after my surgery which is not yet scheduled., but expect to be soon. \nI'm still waiting for the results of my lymph node biopsy which I'm sure will be positive. :-(\nSince I'm having a 'much needed & wanted' breast lift the same time as my biopsy I have no idea how I'll feel, how sore I'll be, but I'm determined to get away....run away from it all, all by myself. Always wanted to do that, never did.\nI do know people near St. Petes in case I don't like being alone. \nWish you could come with me too would be so nice to meet you.\nJane ",

Both my surgeon & plastic surgeon have agreed. He will do the anchor procedure.

      "Content": " I have a copy of the pathology and surgery report.\nMy reconstruction was a breast lift, much needed and delighted with the results, and my cancer is (stage 2A) IDC started in the milk ducts, HER-2 NEU, estrogen + 100% progesterone + 60% \nLeft Sentinel node and one other node-negative.\nReading the operative report I can see that the tumor was near the left nipple so it's confusing to me as to why there was cancer found in the posterior margin on the chest wall. The tumor was 2.2 cm and the specimens taken were 5.5 cm. 3.5x2.1x0.7 cm. 3x2x0.8 cm, 1.5x1x0.3 cm, 5.5x4x1.5 cm.\nMK here's what I don't understand. Before my lift my breasts were sagging very low and now they are back where they would be if you were 20, so if the cancer was near the nipple as noted in the surgical report then how could it be in the muscle which was at least 7 to 8 inches higher???\nProbably more info than needed and I don't really trust radiation or chemo either. \nTalking to another doctor would only confuse me and I think since the decision is surgery or rads & chemo it's a pretty easy one to make. Besides I honestly would rather ask members who have lived with BC than ask a doctor for an opinion. It's not a life or death decision and maybe one is as good as the other, but I'm leaning towards removing it.\nI remember the doctor saying that the tumor had grown finger like tenticals into the muscle and that is the cancer that is still there.

Seems these spicules do not show up on a mammogram.\nI don't think I even care about\n a second opinion since I want the cancer out asap.\nMy doctor said the decision was up to me so what I'm getting is she thinks either way is good, but I think removing it is a head start.\nI also thought about\n 5 out of 6 of your doctors told you to opt for surgery. How could you do otherwise than go for it.\nI expect the results from my Oncotype DX test to be back by my next visit 11/3 and that should tell my onco just what kind of therapy I need and it could even be none at all except radiation. It can also tell if I need hormone and chemo as well as the likelihood of my cancer returning. \nYou can check it out at www.oncotypeDX.com\nEven though I have made my decision with the help of your input and MK's I will ask for the odds.\nThanks so much for your opinions....means the world to me. After I start treatment and become a 'veteran' I hope to be able to share what I've learned with new posters. \nFeeling sorry for BC ladies that don't know about\n HW.com Your opinions have meant everything to me kept me very positive and worry free.\nBTW MK & Tavish are your cancer the same as mine?\nJane ",

I certainly hope that all this gets resolved. Never liked when I hear tissue expanders...sounds painfull.\nHope my choice works out better, lumpectomy, and surgical repair including a much needed breast lift all at the same time. Overnight stay. Forgot probably a lymph node or two for pathology.\nHave no idea what to say to your doc & onc except how can we fix this and soon.\nI'm new at all this BC stuff, just diagnosed Aug. 26th. Maybe someone with experience will post...lots of very savy posters here that can help more than I can.\nIf no answers then start a new topic it will catch someones interest that has been through this or knows something about\n it.\nHow about\n breastcancer.org fantastic site and a message board too...please check it out.\nWill be watching to see if you get help.\nJane ",

      "Sample": "Saw my cardiologist yesterday at the hospital...cleared for surgery...as if I had a choice!!! While waiting for his secretary to type up the report I decided to find the cancer center and talk to someone about\n radiation treatments was told after surgery I would see the radiaologist and treatment would start wnen my surgery healed....How could you do otherwise than go for it. I expect the results from my Oncotype DX test to be back by my next visit 11/3 and that should tell my onco just what kind of therapy I need and it could even be none at all except radiation....He said he will make my left breast larger than the right because radiation will shrink the tissue so when I'm finished my boobs will match up. So far with this exception all my doctors are women....While waiting for his secretary to type up the report I decided to find the cancer center and talk to someone about\n radiation treatments was told after surgery I would see the radiaologist and treatment would start wnen my surgery healed. Picked up lots of pamphlets and business cards....Before my lift my breasts were sagging very low and now they are back where they would be if you were 20, so if the cancer was near the nipple as noted in the surgical report then how could it be in the muscle which was at least 7 to 8 inches higher???\nProbably more info than needed and I don't really trust radiation or chemo either. Talking to another doctor would only confuse me and I think since the decision is surgery or rads & chemo it's a pretty easy one to make....I'm OK, feeling fine, had my surgery October 6th. I've been putting off radiation, but have decided to set up my appointment and get it over with....It was the Onco DX test report that decided what I will be taking and I'm not sure it was offered or even available five years ago. I'm HER- er+ pr+ stage llA with an Onco score of 15 out of a possible 100 so am fairly low, in fact low enough that I thought all I would need is radiation....I'm feeling that this will be my only chance to see these people who I want to spend time with because it may be my last opportunity. I have fatigue from Lyme, but can handle it...just don't think I can handle that and chemo/radiation at the same time....and he will do a breast lift (only thing I'm looking forward to \n sure could use one) same time as my lumpectomy. He said he will make my left breast larger than the right because radiation will shrink the tissue so when I'm finished my boobs will match up....",
