    "Content": " Hello Kelly,\nFrankly it can be related to breast cancer. In some cases, when cancer spreads to the bones it may cause what's known as pathological fracture. \nLet's wait till her appointment and see what will happen. Take care of keeping up psychological support. \nHope everything goes fine.\nRegards\nAhmad\n ",
