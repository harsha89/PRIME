      "Content": " Hi Gretchen, \nThank you for the inputs on breast cancer! \nCan you tell me a little bit more about\n why it is controversial? I've always thought it's a legitimate type of testing and have never thought twice about\n it. Does this mean the results can't be trusted at times? \nBy any chance you know the average fee for the test in your country? \nAgain, many thanks. \n---\nTrieu Nguyen ",

      "Content": " My family has a long history of members having cancer. I have two aunts who passed away because of breast cancers (one on my mother and the other on my father's side). My grandpa also died because of colon cancer. My mom found a small polyp in her colon 4 years back and another one in her stomach just last year. Both lumps were surgically removed and the doctors said that my mom is okay now, just needs to be \"more cautious\". My dad is still going strong but with his smoking, I doubt that he would be alright when he gets a bit older. \nI look at my family and I'm scared, actually. So I've been doing research and am considering genetic testing. But I still don't understand it completely. I mean, hơ can a blood test helps me find my cancer risk? Plz help me clarify on this. ",

      "Content": " Thanks a lot Gretchen! I've never really thought about\n it like that (silly me!) \nWow, $300 is a lot! And not to mention the travel expenses. I still can't live with the potential risk, you know, like I'm hanging from a rope. I guess I'll have to find a trustworthy place in Asia or reconsider the whole thing. \nAgain, thank you everybody for your replies!\n---\nTrieu Nguyen ",

      "Content": " I did discuss with my doctor but this kind of test is still new in Vietnam, where I currently live. There are very few places that have genetic testings. Most of the public (and private) hospitals haven't considered ỏ incorporated the genetic aspect into their operations, so many of what I know is from the internet. Most of the private agencies in my country where I have contacted did not provide me with thorough information. There was only this one place that gave me a \"good enough\" answer but their main goal is still to sell me the test anyway. \nYeah, I guess it would be scary to know that I might have a higher chance of developing cancer but I still want to know so I can do some adjusting to my life and all. I've always been the type who would rather have the bandage ripped off immediately than to endure the unknown forever.\nSo I'm looking for facilities in the Asian region, maybe in Singapore or Japan to be tested. If any one happens to know a good facility in Asia, (Australia is okay, too) I would appreciate the recommendation.\nBest, \nTrieu Nguyen\n-----\nBTW, the place I mentioned is called Asia Genomics\n if anyone has any info. Thanks\n ",
