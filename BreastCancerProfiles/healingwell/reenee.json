I think Arimidex has something to do with that, depleting my hormones, making a mess out of me emotionally. I have never been such a basket case of tears. I am also going to talk to him about\n that.\nI have a wonderful husband. Very supportive. However he doesn't know how to handle the emotional part of me, makes him feel very bad when I cry. I try not to do that in front of him. Sometimes my cup runneth over and out of my eyes. \nThanks again all, I will let you know what I find out. Appreciate your love and concern. \nreenee ",

He spent a very long time looking for other signs and symptoms? \nIs there a blood test to tell if a person has cancer?\nCan they biopsy a node?\nI really am tossing idea of just getting breast off, no simple decision. \nI have had one mastectomy, know what it involves. Regretting not having it done when I had last surgery. I know I do not have the type of cancer that mirrors itself in other breast. \nOne of the dr.s mentioned a P E T SCAN However that was never mentioned again. \nDoes the surgeon or the oncologist usually call the shots with treatment. \nThanks all for your suggestions love and concern\nreenee ",

He said you have fibrocystic disease, I knew that. \nHe read the radiologist report, said Dr. is very thorough and concluded it was a lymphnode just slightly larger than before. He said edges are smooth, and node is in shape that is acceptable for healthy node. \nHe did say IF I WOULD FEEL BETTER I could get a biopsy. He concluded saying he doesn't feel it is anything at all to be concerned with, there are no signs within the breast of calcifications, lumps or anything. \nHe said most surgeons see their patients again throughout first couple years some do not, he felt that is why the oncologist said what she had said.\nI do feel more at ease, than I did. I still may go in after the holidays and get a biopsy to be sure. I am weighing that now.\nThanks for all your kind help, and nice post. \nBe WEll God Bless, Keep smiling. \n \nreenee ",
