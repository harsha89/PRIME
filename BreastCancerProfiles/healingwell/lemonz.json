She was not able to sit at her computer for some time.  I am sorry to say she lost her battle last night and is now another of our angels to be remembered. She fought every inch of the way and left her daughter many cards and pictures and letters to hallmark each and every special event that she would not be there to share. She had her best friend go through every album and explained each and every silly picture to her, so someday Katie will be able to explain them to her daughter. Shells took some silly pictures that she said needed explaining to be funny. I never remember Shells complaining until one treatment took away her taste for chocolate. After all she had been through without a complaint she really let me know about\n that one. Anyone that ever did the chats with Shells knows when she turned up the chat turned to chocolate. I hate this disease and have had a couple of very rough months with watching so many become angels, but she started her  battle when she was 28 and of all the loses, a young mother is the worst. I hope I never have to write another post like this. No one can understand how mean this disease is until they see how mean it can be first hand. Sadly, Joyce \n \n \n ",

My hair came in very fine and perfectly straight. Seems to come in the opposite of what you had. After time almost everyone ended up with the type of hair they started with. I had chemo first that took my hair, then had surgery and then tax and rads. During this time my hair started to slowly come back. It grew very slowly, at first, and now before I know it, it is time for a hair cut again. I noticed I have to \"DO\" my hair \"naturally blonde\" tee hee with Loreal as often as I did before treatment. I remember when my hair started to come in it was very stiff. My granddaughter was not sure about\n this bald head of mine. I asked her to give me her hand and I would introduce her to fuzzy bear. She did and I told her to \nopen her hand and I took it and lightly ran across my head. She giggled and went running saying mom mom had a teddy bear head. Now you know why lemon works for me. I keep trying to make lemonade. LOL\n \n \n \n ",

My treatment was a new trial for IBC and actually they discontinued it when only two of us did well. I can tell you everyone I have ever talked to has ended up with a new perky boob. Without recon surgery if you are any size at all you will be tilted. After surgery make sure you do your exercises so you do not get frozen arm. Radiation in and of itself is nothing more pain wise than an x ray. The only thing, as I can see you are aware of, is the darn burn. If you do start with burning do not be proud beg the burn unit for what ever they use that equals second skin. Its the only thing that helped me. They told me if your big you usually burn more but my sister in law is much larger than I am and yet she never burned at all. Her mom was very thin and she burned.

As I understand it she was being moved back to hospice and fell getting onto the transport and when they got back to hospice they realized she had broken her leg. Eventually they decided to operate and it went well and was healing very nicely and the next thing I hear is she fell and broke her hip. She said she was not sure if it was the fall or if the tumor that was there was the issue. This last week I have not been able to get through on her phones so I have had to rely on her daughter for info. I hate to bother her, she works nights and has a young family and also has had her own tangle with cancer. She is just a wonderful girl that has let me know how Cathi is. She told me Cathi is  not really eating well and I know the last time I talked to Cathi, she told me this hip thing took a lot out of her.

      "Content": " You have to admit we have been quite a crew. I still remember picking up Ellen, MK knew her right away. Poor Vic driving around a strange town, no idea where we are going. Anyone that knows Vic, knows he plans everything. Routes being a major plan and suddenly he is in a car racing for an airport to meet people we had no clue what they looked like. Still trying to remember who it was that said she would be the one with only one boob. Talk about\n a blonde moment.tee hee All I could think of was to hang a lemon around my neck and hope incoming friends would connect the lemon with lemonz. But being women naturally all turned out well. I can still remember all the pretty decorating Betty did to the hotel. That poor girl at the desk was a really good sport. I just wonder how many of us remembered to e mail her. I think the blondest thing I did on that trip was when we were going out to eat, Vic said we better hurry, Sara's husband is in the car, we rush out and jump in the back and he just looks and starts the car and next thing I know he is calling Sara to tell her he has her passengers. I did not know, she had her car there also. Talk about\n embarrassed, but I must say she is married to one fabulous guy. He was the best tour director. I learned more about\n Louisville during that ride that I could have learned reading all day. Then after lunch we got in the car with Sara and we were going to Churchill Downs and got lost. She hands me her GPS and says \"do you know how to work one of these?\"First one I had ever seen back then. Who knew Churchill was hidden inside the town. Candy, I agree with you, the newbies should figure out how to meet, bond and pull each other through this. Women have a remarkable ability to really be there when we need each other. When you have met, it only makes it stronger. Kathy maybe you can organize the newbies and figure out something. Believe me its a trip you will never forget. I will always be so glad I was able to make that gathering. I will never forget that feeling of sharing we all had. Thankfully, from there, I was able to go up to Indiana and meet Shell. I am forever grateful that the ladies made the gathering that close to her house. A few hours and I got to deliver a hug in person from all of us, as she was to ill to make it to Louisville. I am also soooooo happy that I went because I got to meet Cathi, I have no idea how I would have done without her. She is so level headed. I am waiting for a bill for all the advice she has given me. None of these close relationships would have been possible without a gathering and I strongly recommend the newbies think about\n it. Its so nice when you see a post from someone and you can picture their face and the wonderful smiles and jokes and the great time we had. I know I am not alone when I say we really enjoyed every minute. I really had my blonde moment when I was staying at a hotel outside of South Bend and went to pay my bill and she offered me a discount on any mid western hotel. I told her I never drive in the midwest, and she turned and informed me I was in the midwest. Who knew! I thought midwest was out west. Of course it was graduation day for Notre Dame and every parent was standing there listening to this not so intelligent person making a fool of herself yet again. LOL Bev you were really a pleasure to meet. Now every time I read your posts I think of you and your wonderful smile. These are the things that make a gathering so special. I hope all the newbies get to experience it. Thanks to all of you for posting your congrats and I know Jo-Ann would have posted that story she has been promising if her dinosaur had not expired. I know all of us are knocked just a little bit harder because we got to met Fran and her wonderful family. Love to all Joyce \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Wow Bev I am impressed. I have to tell you about\n the colonoscopy I had while on chemo and rads. They decided that I needed the big nasty jug to drink. Now please remember I threw up my entire treatment. Good news there was I lost over 50 lbs. LOL I was told if I threw up with the medicine I would have to start over. You have no idea how awful it was to try to decide which end was going to win. There I sat on the potty with a trash can in my arms. Dh had to do some talking to get me to do that again. First thing he did was educate me on what medicine to insist I would take. Next thing he did was remind me a little potty time or cancer treatment? I have to admit he was right. spent some time on the potty went to the hospital in the morning and had a polp removed which came as a shock. I could not tell they had done anything. The way I see it that sure beat anything colon cancer has to offer. The big plus is your dh does not get to say you are full of it no matter what you say for about\n 24 hours. Take my word for it...I worked that one. LOL Love and hugs. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

Once PCE headed in your direction she knew her way by heart. All the ladies had their pink on and PCE knew your addy from all the times she has picked you up for the flights you have taken to be with others. I am so glad to hear you are home. I will be waiting to hear your results are just great. Now for a little chuckle...... Hope this makes you smile...... As you know I was hit once right square in the butt by a Harley in a parking lot as I was walking to my car and ended up with quite a bit of orthopedic surgery..... As I was laying there totally unable to move, I know they got a sale on that plaster....I had the fortune of having my own personal rooster in the room across the hall. My good fortune did not end with a cockadoodle doo at dawn. NO my rooster somehow knew when I was starting to doze off and she would let loose with these very loud cockadoodle doos. Now I bet you smiled with that thought just knowing someone had as rotten a stay as you did. Love,Hugs,Prayers, and Best Wishes to a very special lady. Joyce \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Jo-Ann, I can not believe this. Today I was thinking about\n you and wondering if you quit again. I was wondering if I could post congrats to you this year. As long as you are no longer smoking I think you should hang with our date. Besides that, I am getting to the point if I told you to add a month I would have another date to remember and you know how that would work. Lets just go with the itch and consider it scratched. Having to deal with kicking that habit two times makes that one miserable itch.  Just the other day someone asked me my age and I had to give them my birth date and told them to work it out. Does this sound like a person that needs another date to remember? Now let me tell you, I think you are one very strong woman. I could never have even one, or I would be at it again, and I am not strong enough to go through that again. Kudos to you for kicking the habit again. You need support or feel the least bit like giving in just yell. I know how rough it can be. I promise not to tell Vic and we will hang with our original date and I will promise anything you want me to promise for one of your wonderful stories. I know I am not the only one that misses them. Every time I see a fire ant I think of you and start to laugh, except when they are trying to make me lunch. Can't wait for your stories. Love and hugs, Joyce  \n \n \n \n ",

I can not believe Chuck offered to leave the farm, to pick you up. Wow!!!!! Plus he offered to let you drive his J.Deere. I have to tell you I got carpet burn on my chin when my jaw dropped. Stranger things have happened I am sure but, M.K. please tell Chuckie I am so proud of him. If he keeps this up and we will have to paint his J. Deere pink. Make him part of the group.(I would love to see his face if someone said they were going to paint his farm equipment pink) Just thinking about\n this gives me chuckles. \nJo-Ann, as you know even when we are all there in all our wonderful pink outfits, we can not hear so good.....must be the pink clouds we fly through. So please let us know how you make out. Love and Hugs, and best wishes for some good luck.\n \n \n \n ",

Remember the last squamous I had they thought was melanoma and sent me to Penn. This time its on my arm that I wear the sleeve, but for the first time mine was B9 no B no S and no M. Now you know there is no free lunch. I am sure I will end up with a huge balloon to celebrate this one. I mean your are not supposed to puncture your arm, how does it feel about\n being scalped? You know I never go out in the sun anymore without all the protection I can muster....I was so mad when I continued to have problems I asked her what was the problem...Her response to that was, I am paying for all the damage I did to my skin as a child. She said I would continue to have to get my skin checked every year, if I never went out into the sun again. You can bet my children are slathering my grandchildren with protection. Mean while it seems to me your due for a break. Its been one thing after the other. Did you get parts for your dino or did you buy a new computer? I know one thing I sure have missed you. Hope all goes well with your arm and I am so glad they caught it early and a little scalp job fixed you right up. Let me know how your arm is dealing with this. Love and hugs, Joyce.

My axillia was catching cancer cells and it managed to acquire a 5 cm size before I started with the changing of color. It made lifting my arm painful. My color change seemed to spread from the side forward. As anyone can tell you IBC really is nasty because if follows no rules. There was a nun and I who both had the exact same presentation and we were as the doctor likes to call his success stories. So just because someone did not have what you have does not mean that you should not check it out. But I find the more medical things a person reads, the more problems they are sure they have. I have stopped laying my Cure magazine around, for that reason. You would be surprised how many people have had to go to the doctor because they read it.

It started out when we had something to celebrate I would post asking everyone if they could hear that noise....It was the sound of my drum being drug out of the closet to celebrate someones good news. People that lived near or were very close to one of the girls that had something done, would post for me to polish my drum and get ready to celebrate. Then it progressed, when we started with a bus and the next thing you know we had a kazoo and tamborine and so on until we had a full band. No one actually had these instruments. Everyone picked an instrument and we did our fantacy parade down the halls of the hospital to make our ladies smile. There is nothing like knowing you are not alone and people care and throw a smile in with silly stuff and its one of the best medicines in the world. Disaster struck when we went to LV for a meeting( a real one) real instruments were given out and I was actually given a drum to play. I have to tell you my imagination can run amuck but not enough to enable me to actually play my drum. Believe me, my drum playing could be called a lot of things but theraputic healing is not on the name calling list. LOL I still have my drum and if I need a smile I look at it and think how thoughtful it was and its a gift I will never forget. The magic of smiles are they do go around and come back and put themselves on your face. Some people think we are silly, and frankly after what most of us have been through, not many of us worry about\n that. The wonderful thing about\n posts are you do not have to read them. So if we get silly and one person smiles, it was worth the effort. Hope I have caught you up on all of our smiley antics.\n \n \n \n ",

On another note, my daughter bought a property in Texas on the Gulf Coast and I told her that was a bad move. All she carries is a stun gun.

Best discribed as I looked like I had taken a beating on my breast and it was strange colors of purple and red and orange. Many doctors do not know IBC if they fall over it. One thing that all the patients with this doctor had in common, was the fact that we all had very strong heat coming from the discolored area. My discoloration started on the side and was working its way across. I saw others that were not like mine. I think that is what makes it so very difficult. The only biop. they did was in the axillia. He explained that it was acting like a screen to catch the cells and that was a good way to verify what we were dealing with. Of course his face told me he did not doubt the outcome. There was no actual tumor in my breast. That is what makes IBC so difficult. The axillia (basically in the arm pitt)was over 5 cm. That is why I had chemo first. IBC should be treated with chemo first. Even with the new trials I have not heard of one that does not do chemo first. I am sorry to say I know of no one in your area. One thing I know I still have my hand doing the cramping thing and the numbness in that arm. I would push what ever I had to push to get seen by someone. \n \n \n \n ",

You really have my sympathy. I know how rough it is. You just post to your hearts content and know we are with you. If you have any problems with him going back on Atkins let me know. I have a story you can use. You might warn him.... Cathi and I will come out and sit on him if he feels he needs something on his belly.

So if I read right we can now send mail to the MKChuckie farmette. Love it. I am going out shopping for a record that teaches you hog calling. Might I warn you to watch out for the rooster. They can be very nasty critters. Thanks so much..... I have not had a chuckle like this in months. Oh about\n no animals.... I only have one thing to say, no one buys an airport unless they plan to fly. So when does he buy the horse and cow? You did not get suspicious when he said he was going to plant hay? Tee hee.

I do sometimes wonder if I am the only person that sees the irony in this whole thing?

LOL I know, I know that Joyce is a mess. Jo-Ann, your New Years sounds like a bummer. I feel for you with this one. Sounds like your doctors have figured out a way to take the joy(and the Snickers) out of your New Year....every bit of it. Bev has the right idea....Make a tough resolution for someone else. Now that works for me, but I have a feeling that is not going to be so much fun either. Good luck to all and am anxious to see what others come up with. Ps. should have added Pounds to be removed do not count unless medically necessary because I have never met anyone who thinks they are to thin. LOL Love and hugs and good luck to all. Joyce..Ps. Think when I have this no cooking and cleaning down, next years will be to take a hot air ballon ride.

      "Content": " Tis the season for shocks. Jo-Ann, getting your port out is a sign of something worse than global warming. Now this is really scary. I read that and looked out side and said to Vic.......Just call me Chicken Little because if the sky isn't falling it ought to be. I am so glad I broke my foot on the 26th. I found out there is nothing worse than a broken foot for increasing your eating. If I had resolved to lose weight I would be in serious trouble. So I found out before my resolution decision that I would be wasting my time saying I am going to lose weight. Eating has become my indoor sport. I have decided the TV needs a good healthy law suit. Have you ever actually bought a cheeseburger that looks like the one on tv? Have you ever actually been served a sandwich that looks like the one on tv? I am not a breakfast person, but they have me ready to run out and get one of those also. Seems they are also trying to condition me into thinking I need three pizzas to get through the day. What I am saying here is I am watching way to much tv. I think I have discovered the reason Americans need to resolve to lose weight....Our TV'sLOL \n Jo-Ann you asked how in the world did I do this....Let me tell you I am embarrased. Its boring. Nothing interesting Always, I have had a good time with my injuries because I have chosen interesting ways to get them. The motor cycle hitting me square in the butt, trapped under the ice, the broken neck, not once but twice, so on. This one is not interesting. We went to our sons new house for the holidays. I unpacked the food and vic decided to take the car out of the drive, and park on the street, so we would be able to leave without making 20 people move their cars. Long story short, when the young people started to really party Vic and I decided maybe we were getting old. Had enough holiday blah blah and thankfully I am usually designated driver, but he had not been drinking. He was talking to his daugher and I went on down to start the car. Making this boring story short... New developement, no lights, cement deep gutter in the street and final black top not put down yet to bring the street up to the gutter....right foot went down in the gutter and I tried to catch myself with my left foot.....Yes I know asking a lot of one foot....LOL the left foot caught the edge of the cement and because the road was not finished front half of the foot went down and twisted and down I went. Now my helpful family all comes running and before I can stop them they pick me up and have me on my feet and walking to the car. That of course was the same foot that had the pins in it from a previous accident. Besides doing a bruise and bone check I did find one thing kind of humorous. The only really deep cut I got was from my medical bracelet. I know when my ortho comes back from vacation he is going to be so disappointed in this story. I am embarrased to tell it, its so ordinary. He has come to count on me for my unusual ways to get injured. I guess I will have to admit to getting older and not up to my usual standards. tee hee Love, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

After beating my head against a wall over a similar issue, here is my advice.....Call and ask where is your check. Tell them you cancelled your order a month ago. When they correct you about\n how you only changed addys....Jump all over them. Next tell them you want a refund dating back to your original call. You will then order a new subscript\nion when you have your refund in hand. Sadly it was the only thing that worked for me. What ever you do never buy anything from a publisher where you want the bill and ship it to someone else. Boy oh boy can they mangle that. Hugs and good luck. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

She bought their plots and when ever he starts to cheat on his diet again she gets in her car...his obvious next question is what are you shopping for now. She told him... \"take a ride with me instead of eating the candy and I will show you\". She took him to the plots and told him since his life style was preparing him rapidly for this \nlocation, she was getting in the habit of driving out there and thinking of it as his new home. Since he put down the candy and came with her, he was on this side of the grass for another day. It worked for him He has lost 75 lbs. Don't know if shock therapy works with your dh or not but I know after a million fights this one worked for her. I have to be honest here. On the way home I would ask for dh to stop at the bakery.

      "Content": " Ah we have all had many days like that. Funny thing about\n treatment is you think you have no control at all and in some ways you do not, but in others you do. My favorite story is going shopping for a wig (Dr. told me I had 17 days before I would be totally bald, so to get myself a wig), and my denial was that I would only need it for a short while. I went to a dept. store and bought a wig on sale. Plopped it on my head and decided it was a close match. Good enough right.... Nope I remember well climbing in the shower bald and just standing there, at a total loss trying to decide if you use soap or shampoo on a bald head. I realized how dumb that was. I started to laugh and cleared that hurtle with a chuckle and decided that trying to face all the trials that way might make it better. I got out of the shower and put my wig on for the first time with a bald head. Well so much for my chuckles... I swear that darn furball had teeth. Something was biting my bald head. I pulled it off my head and threw it on the floor and stomped on in. I stomped it so bad all the time yelling I might have to put up with cancer but this I do not have to take. Vic and I still laugh about\n how he came running, thinking I had finally totally lost it. Cancer is a see saw. You just have to hope for more ups than downs. I hope you have many things you can look back on a laugh at. Yes, I know if anyone had written that last line to me after I started Chemo I would have thought they were nuts.  Hugs, Joyce \n \n \n \n ",

I have to admit reading these posts has made my day. You know there are several good things cancer has done for me. One thing is really noticing the change of seasons. Another one is not minding getting another year older. The joy of celebrating another year of survival has sure taken the sting out of aging. Some days when I look in the mirror to become a natural medium blonde thanks to that outfit that thinks I'm worth it...lol I have to remind my self I am so lucky to be here complaining about\n looking like an old bag. I think the very most important thing is all the friends I have made here over the years. All the ladies I would never have gotten to know. I cannot imagine a time when I did not know all the ladies that are here and all the ones I have known that are now watching over us. Poor Geo, who got so confused when a strange blonde with a lemon hanging around her neck came up and hugged him. Becky I will never forget his face. Absolutely precious. Libby and Becky with their welcoming hugs. They presented me with my first \"In person Hug\" Going to the airport and standing there with a lemon hanging around my neck so incomings would know who lemonz was. Cathi, I will never forget your face when we showed up to pick you up and there I was wearing my lemon.Now that really is a lol. Candy and Gail, I would give much to be able to hand you some of last years Marlot. Vic really did surprise us with that one. Lori, you deserve a lot of credit for the numerous times you have had to step up and be pilot, plus Tav being the steward on the flights, I have no idea what I would have done without you. We barely gave you a chance for a honey moon. Lauri, your stories have given my mind trips to places I will probably never go. That lady in Texas that brought stories of fire ants into our humor and new meaning to the term John Deere.....The card queen(Libby) and her flying pigs. Thank goodness I said \" When Pigs Fly I will do that\" Who knows what I would be getting if I had picked one of my more colorful answers. LOL Cathi thank you so much my very dear friend for this wonderful post. There is no way I can ever thank you for making my morning coffee so wonderful. Ladies, if we survive one day or rocking our great great grandchildren....there is no denying every woman that finds this group has found herself a very special group of ladies. Thanks again so much.

Basically if you go up 95 from Del. Marcus Hook-Boothwyn is the first exit in Pa. To go to Marcus Hook is to the right, Boothwyn is to the left. Sun Oil and several refinerys are there. That is why we know that the oil shortage in the 70's was humorous. Crossing the bridge to Jersey you could see all the loaded down tankers lined up in the Delaware River, they had no where to put the oil, because the storage tanks were all full. Marcus Hook is an old waterfront town with lots of history. Blackbeard had a home there supposedly. Actually I think the Pagans taking over the town had a lot to do with our getting a Post Office out here. Not a lot of people were willing to drive down there. Guess I rattled on and gave you more info than you wanted now didn't I. LOL Ps. Unlike your paper (which had us in stitches) there has never been a story about\n a single tractor track being seen down there, infact I will go a step furthur and say a corn field has never been seen there either.

They complain about\n all the moose. Well I have to tell you poor Vic wanted to see one. Never spotted one. We went to The Famous catalog store you know the one with double initials and then a bean. We walked in and there was a moose....sadly it was stuffed but I told dh at least you can say you went to maine and saw a moose. LOL Love hearing from you. Love, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I was diagnosed with an uncommon type of BC and this is how they finally picked up on it. The reason this was so hard to pick up on is with my type of cancer there are no hard and fast rules. Some have these signs some do not. Mine was never picked up with a mammo. There rarely is a discernable tumor in the breast with this. I had a C scan, and as you might know nodes act as a screen for cancer cells. Mine was actually clustered into a 5 cm tumor with cells running down the nerves in my arm. I know this is scary but remember, I completed treatment in August of 99, and here I am writing to you. I had no clue at the time about\n this type of cancer and spent from March to October insisting something was wrong. I also could not hold my arm straight up. Chances are very good its nothing, I have cancerphobia, (my word for me) but if it shows nothing ask them to explain the color change. I wish I could help more but if for nothing else we are here to talk to and if I can help in any other way I will be glad to try.

When she had a separate occurance on the left side he told her it was not bad because it was not close to the wall and her heart should be fine. He was right on both occasions. I am sorry but I do not remember your cancer \nlocation was. Hope when you do get it checked out you will find everything is fine. Good hearing from you again. Just so sorry it had to be a problem that brought you back. Hugs, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I have been told that people push it until there is a mold which is enough to tell anyone (even me) this has had it. If you ever get a chance to read what Erma Brombeck says about\n \"True American garbage\", do your self a favor and read it. I got a real chuckle out of that one. I could swear she was looking over my shoulder and listening to me. The shoe really fit. I liked the one where she said left overs that are not to be touched go on the top shelf, because she had plans for them. The next day was hot dogs at the park or some such reason and the left overs go down on the second shelf. So on and so forth until the end of the week and its on the bottom shelf.... and now is authentic American Garbage. How many times did I do that before I quit kidding myself and started to fix platters for the shut ins. As for invisible thread, now I ask you, this is serious chemo laps.........Are you asking me about\n sewing? You made the quilt....I did the applause for your efforts. You do remember my making the skirt for 8th grade class? How I had to wear it and ended up the day in a waist band? After I tried sewing, I decided algebra was easy. LOL Thanks for the chuckle.

I have now been told three times I have suspected lung cancer. I am up to 4 different nodules. Seems as if the scar tissues scare the doctors silly. Could this be due to lawyers circling every diagnosis? I was in an accident and broke my ribs, after this I had the radiation with extra fields because of the type of cancer I had and my Rad. Onc. explained my ribs are now like turkey bones that have laid out in the hot sun for a year. This area shows up as a big possible. I know after one diagnosis you can not help but panic. I found out a while ago that this type of scare is normal after radiation. Get it checked quickly,but try not to let yourself climb up on the ceiling until you verifiy there is a good reason to be there. Take it from one that was on the ceiling so quickly I got caught on the fan. I Hope this helps until you can get it checked out. Sometimes its a long time from hearing this type of thing to being told its nothing. Hope your news makes you smile. As for the Bladder I would get a front row chair and ask them to explain that and watch the show. I love to watch doctors moon walk. It should be interesting and please let us know how you make out. \n \n \n \n ",

Deb you made a good point Lemons are sour. That one made me laugh. Never did a name suit a mood more than lemon did the day of her surgery. I was really sour. I read your post and chuckled and gave myself a thunk and said Dah. Mk I know you have had your plate full. Kathy and Deb she said thanks for the wishes.

Care to guess who did not use antibiotic right away. Just ran cold water over it. After all these years out I got lazy. I thought I was safe. What a mistake. I have to admit I got careless. I really did. When I went to the Lymph Therapist she told me the woman that came in before me was 25 years out and just got it. So please be careful. You really do not want to have to do this massage and sleeve business. But if you are getting a problem... Do not wait... Run do not walk to get it taken care of. There is no cure. But several of our ladies have had treatment and wore their sleeve and have been able to discontinue using it. Deb made a great list and the only two things I can think of to add are burns and air travel. I know after you have it hot tubs are out. I am not sure if they can cause a problem. I am sure there are more. Now that I have shared this rotten news that no one wanted to hear I will go make myself something chocolate and hope next time I post it will be something someone wants to hear. This kind of news can only be shared while eating chocolate. Love and Hugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

A possible infection or another problem have left them testing before they can tell if they can procede with her new bone. One would think after all the money that has been spent on this disease that they would have done better. Have any of you looked at the price of a test lately? I would really like to know why in this day and age and all this expensive machinery, they \nopen you up and say Oh my, we need more testing.....Sorry for the vent. This just seems so mean that I had to blow off steam. The thing that amazes me is Cathi took it better than I did. I have been talking to myself ever since I talked to her daughter. What kind of world is it where a daughter calls me and I have to ask what the doctor said about\n her cancer after I find out about\n her mother.

One thing I have found that all of us have in common (that I know of) is the heat that comes from it.  Mine was orange and purple with a few tints of yellow and red. I also had a skin texture change. These things combined finally made the doctors realize even though my mammo was fine I had a problem. It took all of this to make them realize I was right. March to October this fight went on. IBC is one of the BC diseases that have had less research that the others because its not as common.  I was given a new treatment at the time and I have been doing very well. Please remember IBC really has no set standard of rules. I personally think any question and you should run not walk to the phone and make that appointment. Best of wishes, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

By that time I finally realized I needed the kind of help I could not get out here and went to a Breast Disease surgeon in the city. I have to admit I knew I had cancer and my surgeon could tell I knew. He told me he was confirming what we both suspected. If I did not want to drive back into town and sit in the waiting room until his patients were gone, he could call me at home. Seems he likes the waiting room empty so only gives bad news last( My DSIL went in and she said she knew when she was called last). He asked if Vic would be there for the call. He would probably call after six at night. I was given various slips for tests to take home. That is how sure my surgeon was. That was almost 8 years ago. Hard to believe sometimes. My SIL is a survivor of two different BC occurances. I hated the part you are going through the most. Waiting is a very nasty word. Hugs, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

It usually takes someone to ask before I remember I am over due to explain....at least as best as you can explain an imaginary pink plane. tee hee. PCE came about\n very slowly. We started out in a big pink bus. Now close your eyes and see that! Then it seemed like everyone was do at important things on the same day, and needed us. Now even my imagination will not enable a bus to get to the N. E., Texas, and Ohio all in a matter of one hour. I was about\n to scrap the whole thing because some thought it was silly. Then there was the post that changed my mind. We had one of our ladies tell us how she closed her eyes and imagined us all there and it helped so much. She did not feel alone and she was surrounded by people who had been there or were going to be. Another actually told the surgical team to watch out for us! They thought she was overdosed with the happy juice. Tee hee. This called for a little more thinking, now if you know me that is not my strong point. Took me a bit of thought and the next thing you know I decided there is only one way to get to all these places in a hour, and then only with imagination running the engine. That was how the Pink Cloud Express was born. Next came a chip in with imagination as to what we ate and wore. We even have instruments and march down the hall of the hospitals. The funniest thing was in LV Sara actually handed me a drum. That was when the whole group found out I had never touched a drum in my life except my sons, when I moved it to clean. But reality has nothing to do with our mission. We are there with what ever musical instrument you want to play or not, with our pink boots and boas and march into surgery to chase that \"I am facing this alone\" feeling away. That is why people who need PCE request during the week of need. Women work well under pressure. Give us to much time and we really do mess up.  If I am not home, and do not answer one of the other ladies will usually take over. We have even had a four legged steward. Tavish was a huge help. Anyone that is a member can feel free to post any ideas and certainly to jump on board. New fliers have a membership dues to pay,when showing up for their first flight..Bet you can guess. A plane full of ladies........ LOL of course the answer could only be chocolate. tee hee. This can only be signed by the idiot known as Capt. Lemon..... May we welcome you aboard? \n \n \n \n ",

I will be praying that God, research, medicine and doctors all come together in one spot and win this battle against all cancer and stop making angels out of so many women, with special prayers for young women with children, and those that never got the chance to have them. I would love to see every woman live long enough to enjoy the total exhaustion of watching grandchildren. Prayers for young mothers that are dealing with the results of having been fighting this disease, and the disaster it can make in a young family. There are many long term effects with BC in a young family that are never thought of as part of the toll this disease takes. I hope and pray that this will be the year that it ends. On a very selfish note I pray all goes well with Cathi. Lori, I wish I had calming vibes to share. Hope the soothing vibes arrive in time to make it the happiest wedding in the world.

I complained until October, I insisted something was wrong then I started turning all different colors. Skin texture was different and finally, they realized I was not fine and something was going on. They did a ct scan and they found my issue. I understand I am not alone, it is common for mammos to fail with IBC. They finally figured mine out when it was so ugly they could not longer say it was nothing. You did not mention what makes you think you have IBC. I know a lot of us would be glad to help but we really need to know more to help. If you think you have it, you really need to listen to Deb and get to a doctor.\nHugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I had no idea what IBC was and I must admit I was so overwhelmed with info I only remember asking one thing.... Did I have any chance? He gave me an honest answer and I said all I needed was to be told I had a chance. I remember the conversation so well. He also told me about\n a nun that had the exact same dia. that was doing well. I was at the hospital yesterday to see a lymp. therapist and she was telling me about\n a 95 year old woman that had the radical IBC treatment of years ago. She woke up yesterday with lymph issues, many years after her cancer treatment. She also knew several people that had been diag. with IBC that were doing well. There are several of the ladies that have it that I keep contact with. While treatments have changed and I find my self out of date on a lot, the fact that I am here to tell people that it can be done sometimes is a huge help in and of itself. The ladies here are a great bunch and we will help in any way we can. A great corner of the world to find someone who has been there and wants to help. Again, wish you did not have to be here but I hope I have been able to make you realize you can do this. Hugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Deb,thanks for sharing that. It really is the kind of story that makes women so very special. I had a 5 cm tumor, nodes,and issues plus cancer going down the nerve in my right arm. I was fortunate to find a doctor that not only was ahead of his time but worked with a team outside the box and came up with a treatment that worked for me. I had chemo first and then I had the surgery and then had chemo and rads. I had my surgery the day after my DSD's shower for her first baby. Today I went to her 3rd childs christening. I have done 5 years of Tamox and am now on Femara. I can still remember that awful feeling of being told I had cancer. Going through all the things we do but, something no one put in the brochure was that feeling you get when you get told that your treatment is complete and you only need check ups. I walked out into the sunlight and was so mad at myself for allowing that feeling to infringe on what was supposed to be a very special day. Cancer free is nice to hear but always remember your check ups. Hugs Joyce \n \n \n \n ",

We will get our Ladies Only Marching Pink Feather Brigade together and take the place with our musical talents ( Do I hear a chuckle?) Does everyone still have their musical instruments? Count on us to be there for you. By the way I am half Scottish and of all the things I have had, gangrene is not one of them. Can I have half a member of the clan status? I will be picking everyone up on March 7th bright and early. Jo-Ann, of course, I will find you and you did not even need to promise chocolate but I must admit, with the chocolate, the ladies will save you the best seat. As you know we all bribe easily! On a serious note Di, I want you to know I know how hard it is trying to be there for your parent, and taking care of yourself.

In town I had a fine needle biopsy and received a call at 6:00 telling me I had cancer. When I get my mammo in town, its a whole different world. They put them up and show you everything and talk about\n it. Out here if you want to see them you have to ask for them to take home. I found it worth the drive to get answers right away.

I did not know if we were still doing that, so I had ordered flowers myself. I increased the order and then we got more so I ordered extra fushia callas. I asked MK if she would mind collecting for me. I asked her for the amount that I increased the order and the rest went to Peter. So the flowers are covered. I ended up with four charges and three credits before that order was finished. I know the florist heard my voice and thought what now. Thanks so much for thinking of her. I have so many pictures she sent of her and the baby and I had put them on my slide show so I see them everyday. Its still so hard to believe. Love and Hugs, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Today we welcomed Gia Marie into the family! She was 7 lb. 7 oz. and 20 inches long. Both Mom and baby are doing very well. Today is important to both sides of the family. One great grandpop was born today,many years ago, and on this date the other one passed. So we had all decided this would be a great day to have a new one added to the family. Since she already has a girl and a boy she did not ask what this one was going to be. As you can guess I was a wreck with a major storm on the way and her over due. The barometer dropped and so did she. She wanted us to know she had the baby in a hurry so we could all get home before it hit really bad. One thing that made this special...the first two I was not able to pick up because of damage done from the cancer cells down the nerves in my arm. This time I had no surgery so I went to physical therapy (still have not figured out what the time out ball was doing for my arm) and built my arm up enough so I was able to pick this little bundle up at least for a while. What a joy! I loved every second.  Thanks for listening to a grandmom brag. \n \n \n \n ",

I got into the shower on day 18 and went to wash my hair and stopped in my tracks, as many here will tell you, I am my own best source of things to laugh at. I stood there and could not make up my mind...Do you use soap or shampoo on a bald head. Not to put myself in the elite brain club but I ruled out conditioner right away. I kept standing there looking at the two and I could feel the uncertainty building. Suddenly, I just laughed and realized how much I hoped this was the hardest decision I would have to make. If you can keep your humor it really helps.   Best of luck and PCE is always here if you need us.

I love my onc. but I must warn you parking and traffic are not a joy. The good news is you can get a mamo and get your results before you leave. Please let me know what area you are in and I will try to get you any info you need. If you are North of Philly on 95 you also have Fox Chase. Please let me know if I can help in any way. Sorry I did not get back to you sooner. This is our time of year to travel. Thanks to MK or I might not have seen this. I might have to leave again because of a relative needing heart surgery so if I do not get back to you its because I am in Fla. Hugs and hope I will be able to help. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

But I will admit I feel better when I talk to some of these specialists and realize I am smart enough to know I do not know beans, they are not smart enough to know that. I have to admit I have a 4 year warranty with Dell and they were here again and again. I can not tell you how mad I was to find out that if you are a dell person you talk to Americans when you call, if you are a dell owner you get this person that keeps telling you not to worry he will fix. I heard that same sentence everytime I called and I would wait for half an hour to be told this. As my warranty runs out in Dec. I decided they were just trying to drag me out till they could say goodbye. They sent a specialist when I accused them of this and he put a new part in and then he came back and did it again and again. Still no computer and I finally gave up and called my nephew and the kid fixed it in one shot. Give me a kid with an interest in computers everytime. Lots of luck and hope you have better luck with them that I did. L&H Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

Next I would make a miniature file and write on it, Important words said behind my back. When they \nopen it and see it is empty and remark that it is...your answer is \"my point exactly\". Make sure you put it out there when you can see her reaction. If you really want to push it put a paper on your desk and ask for people to name any special favors they have had to do because of your treatment you would like to make it up to them. I am prepared to bet not one nice person will write anything and those that do get them a gift certificate for McDonalds French Fries and ask them to eat them with their left hand.

We usually ask that you picture us all walking down the hall of the hospital wearing what ever comes to mind. Its always nice to know when you are uncomfortable that there are lots of us with you that have been there and done that and are ready to hold your hand and tickle a smile with a tiny pink feather.

I explain it is obvious to everyone in the store that the stress is getting to you, and I thought I might help. I then explain I will have the local support group for caregivers get in touch with her. If this does not work and make her realize how out of control she is, forget support go directly to the senior abuse line. I also hope you have your friends, S&W with you. A good way to get the name if this is not a person you want to take on is get behind her in line and when she runs her charge through say \" Hi, I know you, you are Jane Smith right? Chances are excellent that the cashier will realize that is not the name on the charge and she will have to get her license out and prove to the cashier who she is. This way chances are good you can end up getting her name, and never have to confront her. Signed the chicken livered defender of the underdog.\n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi dak, My onc recommended a few things for me to buy before starting chemo. Hand wash sanitizer, milk of mag., and a cranberry drink. He told me to drink that to flush the body, plus as much other liquids as I could take. Also might want to start on OJ if you start getting cramps. He suggested to have milk of mag. on hand incase I had a problem with that. Next he told me to get a hand sanitizer and carry it with me and practice being paranoid. Vision germs everywhere and when you are not home to use it all the time. I also have antibacterial soap in all my soap dispensers. Do not be afraid to ask people to wash their hands when they come to see you. Next you have to learn to tell people if they are even thinking about\n getting sick stay home. He said the worst places in the world are a shopping cart and a movie theatre seat. Make sure you do not touch that cart and then your steering wheel, until you have used it. I used sea salt water to rinse my mouth and I also lucked out and got no mouth sores. As for the wig. He told me to get one because in about\n 17days I would be bald. Let me tell you I strongly suggest you feel the inside of your wig. I was cheap and in denial about\n the treatment taking my hair. My sister in law and I went to the same dr. she did not lose her hair. What I did not know back then was there is a world of different chemos. One type for 1 mm and another for 5cm. I bought a R. Welsh on sale, still thinking I might be lucky and not need it. LOL I did not have a computer when I got cancer. I had none of the help and insight this group can share to help me. I never thought to shave my head. The inside of my cap on my sore head felt like a million termites and my head was a prime piece of lumber. Make sure you get one of those soft caps to wear between your head and your wig until your head stops being so sensitive. The only pity party I held for myself was over that wig. When I put it on and it bit me I tore it off and stomped all over it. I remember my dh coming in and saying what is the matter? I told him I might have to take what ever comes along with this treatment but I did not have to put up with that wig. I continued to stomp it into the carpet. I look back now a laugh and think, it was the only pity party I threw for myself and I am so glad I made it a good one. LOL As you can see one day at a time and so many of the things end up fodder for humor. My first real belly laugh was the after I lost my hair, I got into the shower and went to wash my \"hair\" I stood there and thought for a minute and started to laugh so hard poor dh came running. Wanted to know what was going on. I told him I am standing in here trying to decide what you wash your head with when you have no hair. Soap or shampoo. I laughed so hard and that whole thing changed my attitude. I decided to laugh at all I could and keep telling myself one step at a time to getting well. That was on Dec. 17,1998. I was bald for Christmas, but decided that was not nearly as important as being here in June when the new granddaughter arrived. Now I have some great shots Liana and I laugh at where we are both bald. Hugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Lauri, I do believe we ate in the same place. Not many choices for breakfast. Was it an old bread and milk store with a counter and few tables for eating, complete with banging screen door? I just loved it. People sit around and talk about\n what is going on and then check the paper to make sure the paper got it right. You have to love it. None of the New England reserve that you tend to find in Boston. Next door is a restaurant with Lobster boil dinners very cheap. Everyone talks to one another and they get you into it also. I just loved it. Of course we went up the year I found out I was allergic to shell fish. Main street has lobster rolls for a dollar, off season. Lobster heaven and I could not touch it. Someone has a mean sense of humor! Did you go to Cadillac Mountain in Arcadia? I love the plaque up there. It says something along the lines of \"If you are standing here when the sun comes up you will be the first person touched by the sun in the United States today\" I just loved that. I never realized if you love light houses its not an easy job in Maine. The coast line really travels a strange path. Not like Cape Cod where they are so easy to get to. In Maine you get to climb and zig and zag until you start to call it lighthouse hide and seek. Dh wanted to see a moose. Now I have heard about\n them being everywhere. Well we were on the look out the whole time we were in Maine. Finally after several days we spotted one, in the L.L.Bean store they have a stuffed one. Told Dh to go pet it and call it a day. In Kennybunkport they have a great local type of restaurant called Alison's and across the street from that they have an honor system parking lot complete with honor system \nopen box for your money. Try that in Philly! LOL They would not even leave you the box. Maybe I was so fond of the trip to Maine because it was the last trip we took before I was diagnosed. Have a safe trip and waiting to hear more. I have to admit I not only did not see the Capitol building I did not even look for it. To busy spotting stuffed moose! LOL Take care.

In fact when dh is trying to get me to agree to something he knows he has no shot at I just pick the card up and flash it in his direction.

My SIL and I both use them and none of the stores around here sell them anymore. We went on the net and found the company number and called and ordered a case, even with shipping it still came to a lot less. Same with vegetable bags. I ordered a case of them and split that with someone also. Seems some products sell better in other parts of the country so they stop selling them where sales are down but if you ask, sometimes they are still available. Well I think I will go wind my Hop a long Cassidy watch and drop in at the Great Atlantic and Pacific food company and then go to the Flying A gas station and get my car filled for me and my windshield cleaned and a smiling attendant to take my money and bring me my change and give me my S&H green stamps.

      "Content": " Hi, Jo-Ann and I share the same exact date. Just different years. This last April 18th has been 9 years for me. I can tell you I tried everything they have. I tried being hypnotized, I tried that patch, I tried the gum, I tried accupunture. I chewed the gum until I had sores in my mouth and all my fillings were loose. I left the hypnotizing thing and lit up. I truly enjoyed my cigarettes. But after years of addiction they started talking about\n second hand smoke and what I was doing to others. The more I learned the more I wanted to quit. My husband had quit a few years before and I went to him and told him this habit had to go but I obviously could not do it alone. I told him to take my keys and all the cigarettes out of the house and do not let me out for anything all week end. He made me destroy my own cigarettes and said if I was serious I needed to do that. I warned him he was in for a few really rotten days. He laughed and said it would be worth it if I quit. After all the money I spent and all the misery I finally found out what worked for me. The thing that worked for me was I had to decide I really needed to quit for me and those I love. Not because everyone around me thought so. So this decision made I quit cold turkey....unless you count regular chewing gum....funny thing was I was not a gum chewer. I must also add Jolly Ranchers to the list of aids. I never touched another cigarette as of 1:05 on April 18th. I also know I can not touch even one, because unfortunately I am one of those people that love the taste. Every time I got the urge I used mouth wash. That also helped. I am not going to lie to you... The first 8 days were awful. I have stonger words for it...but I know no one was more addicted than I was and if I could do it you can do...all you have to do is want to do this for you. Hugs and Good luck, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

That is where they are not even going to give you a cookie and still want your gift. While we are on the subject.... I would like to chime in with a complaint. I went to a shower and they had envelopes at each place and you were to write your name and address on the envelope. This has to be an all time low. Address your own thank you. Someone said to me its so hard for her to get all the addresses! Well they sure found mine for the invite. I was just furious. I went to the pencil sharpener and sharpened my tongue. As we all know...Not a good idea to be on the bad side of my humor. I went so far as to say I printed out the sheet of requested items, went shopping at the correct store, wrapped this gift and bought a card and carried it to this shower, which was over an hour away. Now I am asked to address my own thank you note. I want to know who would actually think this was a good idea. Well you are never going to believe this..I am listening to others complain and then someone walks up to me and tells me it is my step daughters idea. With her usual organizing skills she decided this was a great idea. Well just paint me a brilliant shade of red. Needless to say I told her what I thought of this wonderful time saver. I tore up the envelope and said now she does not have to go to the effort of a stamp and mail box, either. It would be interesting to know how everyone feels about this, also. I was just wondering if it me. What is next, buy your own thank you note and include it in the wedding card? Maybe we can get some interesting complaints going here. Or maybe I will find out everyone thinks I am being silly. Gee me....I can not imagine that happening. Love and Hugs. Tongue in Cheek.\n \n \n \n ",

Most meat took on a new flavor, I like to describe as suck on iron pipe. My onc. told me to take a bit of Phillips Milk of Mag. to keep things going. I took a bit the first couple of days, then I found an apple a day did the job. I drank lots of cranberry and something mix, because someone told me my kidney would thank me for it. I had a cancer that required you take A/C until the cancer was reduced as much as possible. Surgery was next and then Tax. and Rads. I have to admit on double treatment days I was dragging my pink tail feathers a bit. I also kept purell with me and used it all the time. If I touched something without gloves outside my home I used it. My onc. said the most dangerous thing out there was a shopping cart. Never use a shopping cart and touch your keys or your car until you use purell. All those wonderful little darlings are just working so hard to share thier germs with you on that handle. It was not until he mentioned this that I realized how many children teeth on that handle with their nose running. Love\n \n \n \n ",

King bellowing from my mouth. Free at last....As for the tamox. I am glad MK already hit you with that news. I would guess you will have to take it also. I know for a fact there is nothing easy. Never count on easy and you will not be disappointed. Hugs, Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I am good for at least two and that is on a good landing. LOL The addition of a pink libation is a great idea. Maybe if I pass out enough no one will notice my rubber ball act on the landing? Who am I kidding there are not enough pink bubbles in France to make my landing smooth. I really want to thank you so much for all the help. Hope you continue to jump in when I miss a request. I seem to be having a hard time keeping up. I know I promised to catch some flying lessons in Daytona but the instructor told me I really needed to rethink my career choice. Love ya and wanted you to know how much you are appreciated. Thanks again so much. Great, great job. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

Then I had surgery and had to go back after surgery, for more chemo. After it was confirmed I had cancer I found myself in a chemo chair. You are so right it is scary. You have no idea what to expect. I had made up my mind I was going to put up with what ever it took to survive. I lost my humor in that chemo chair. I had to go out and get a wig and all the other things he told me to get. Life took a one two change on me quickly. I did not get surgery and the chance to adjust. Just jumped right into chemo. I can tell you what brought my humor back. About 17 days into chemo I lost my hair. As everyone that has been here can tell you. I got into the shower that morning and stood there. I absolutely was stopped cold in my tracks. I had no idea if you use soap or shampoo on a bald head. I realized my eyes were going back and forth and I started to laugh. How funny is this. I have a 5 cm tumor they are giving me a 10 % chance and I am standing here with this huge problem. What to use on my head! Hope this vision gives you a chuckle. I meet some great ladies in that chair. I never realized there were so many brave and wonderful women until I got cancer. L&H Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I did not see where you wrote about that but I have been known to miss seeing a whale in the middle of a pod. I think I would wait and see what this shows before making a decision. After a few tests and all the facts are in see if your doctor is still saying the same thing. I sat down with my Breast Disease Surgeon and said I will do what ever it takes. If it improves my odds I want it. That was my attitude. That was in 1998 and I had a 5 cm. tumor. The show Survivor could learn somethings reading this board. We really do work as a team putting our heads together trying very hard to help everyone we can. Between us its hard to find a problem one of us have not had to find an answer to.

I would recommend asking if your dr. knows of any treatment you can give your fingernails to prevent this. I was told by someone that they used something in a little blue bottle and it kept hers fine. She could not remember the name. I asked if she drank it or put it on her fingernails, and she assured me she applied it to her fingernails. Just checking! LOL  Wish I had known about this. I did not lose any hair with this treatment, infact my hair grew while on it. Good luck and let us know how it goes. L&H Joyce \n \n \n \n ",

Remember my bursitis, I had to fight for months to get the right test, and it turned into a 5 cm tumor. Yep I say we all give Vets a shot.

Because she was just to far for any of us to make it...I turned my imagination loose and we started with a pink bus. This worked for a while and we all brought our instruments and hit the hospital with pink boas and of course MK has her tiera, and we have our musical instruments. (Story for another day)..Can you see us marching into the hospital with the drum and all the other instruments banging and clanging. No matter the test, if you think of us coming through the door in this impressive state it would send anyone into giggles. Then we had a real problem even my imagination could not get our bus to fly. One of the ladies was across the pond and one was here and both needed us on the same day. This was the day PCE was brought into being. Now we have a plane and pink boas and one day the PCE was needed in three places and it snowed. Someone added pink longjohns. I almost fear to think whats next. But if you stop and think about it. All of us landing at an airport in a pink plane and climbing out in pink long johns and pink boas and MK and her pink tiara. That has got to make you smile. The day I decided being the idiot that I am was the right thing to be was when we were told she could actually feel us there. Some days it pays to be nuts. I am sure as time goes on we will have more additions to our wardrobe. If we make one person feel like they are not alone and make them smile... All of us would gladly be called nuts. So welcome aboard. Tee hee Captain Lemonz Now I ask you how nuts do you have to be to fly with a lemon?\n \n \n \n ",

Not just the normal city hall marriage. They always have a camera and look for the most interesting couple. Lets face it these are a different bunch. We are talking wedding gowns and tuxedos, for city hall. Not many would do this. This years couple were the grandparents of 13 children that decided they had lived together long enough to get an idea if their marriage had a chance. Don't you just hate when these young people just rush into things like that. LOL Happy Valantines day to all. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

The good news is young children in the Philadelphia area have learned to spell. I understand the first word most of them spelled in the last two weeks is EAGLES. The really good news for those of us in the local news area is we do not have to listen to everyone with or without two drinks shout how to spell it at the top of their lungs. I love my Eagles. I have to admit I do not love anything enough to listen to it being spelled a thousand times a day. L&H and congrats to the Pats fans. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I know I have decided this extra weight is going to be going with me to more than a wedding. Step son told me years ago he would marry when pigs fly. I am trying to see if I can get fitted for wings.

He said that it has a proven track record, increased your odds, and was much more agreeable then tamoxifen. Well that might be true for others. I really had it pretty good on tamoxifen. A tendancy to put on twenty pounds but no pains or other problems to really get upset about with tamoxifen. Femara is making me miserable. I know its not supposed to but it is. I am having a lot of the aches and pains I experienced on taxotere. My body never seems to pay attention to the labels that tell you what you are supposed to watch out for. It prefers to blind side me. I have decided I am taking this body back to onc. and talk. Good luck and let us know what you decide. L&H joyce\n \n \n \n ",

She is sorry she has not been on, but her counts have been low, and she just has not had any energy. She had to go in today to have fluid drained from her lung. She had no idea breathing had become so difficult, until they drained her lung. She said that so much has been done to her, that she actually did not mind the procedure. She thinks she has had so much done that she is just numb. She has some very sore ribs but is breathing so much better. She knows I am posting this.

I am so glad you can come here for help. I have to tell you I was fortunate and had a really good Breast Disease Surgeon. I asked him to do whatever would increase my chances of survival. He sat me down and gave me his stats, and stats in general. The most important thing he did was make me feel like I had control again and together we could beat this thing. These are the things I found that you need, before you can make any choice at all. Gentle hugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

I put up with my hair coming out all over the place and really not up for all the cleaning that entailed. After I met these ladies they told me the quick and easy way is to shave your head. It also hurts when you let it come out in bits at the time. What is really great is the stories you will share later and laugh about. I think my moment came when I stepped into the shower for the first time bald... I stood there and could not decide the protocol for washing bald heads. Do you use soap or shampoo? I still remember standing there trying to decide like this was the most important decision in the world. Suddenly I saw the humor in it all and started laugh and from that minute on I knew I could deal with whatever came along. Love and hugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

But if you can not handle that, drink anything you can to get it out. Next do not wait until your sick. Take your meds this time to see how you are going to be. The day of chemo and the next day were my days to eat. I could eat anything and be fine. Day three I would get waffled. Could not eat meat and in general nothing tasted the way it should. I learned not to plan much for me the third day. Everyone is different all you need to do the first time is take your medicine and drink liquid and my onc had me take a bit of Milk of Mag. After he puts that stuff in he goes on and on about how he wants it out again. Keep a record. Next treatment you will know where the highs and lows on your roller coaster are.

When we had ladies all over the place having procedures done the same day. I went to bed and got up with an airplane. Next we have musical instruments we bring. Then we started grabbing pink boas. Sara took that to the next level, by actually visiting someone and leaving feathers from her boa behind. Not imaginary. That part did happen. It has helped a lot of our girls feel not so alone. In that time you are without anyone, be it the operating room or test area, just think about all of us. We are with you in spirit. It has helped quite a few, because they know they are in a place all the others have been and they understand like no one else will ever be able to.

Now I have to qualify that statment with (as far as my treatment decisions go) I handled three treatments each one getting slower and slower. It was harder and harder to keep it in my vein. Seems after so much chemo your veins can not support the needle. I remember how many hours the last treatment took before I waved the white flag. I admit I am with Jo-Ann. I got my port and it was love at first treatment. The veins in my arm now live just below the surface and have turned a very dark color. If you were here, I would be glad to show you my arm and I would not have to type a word. You would run not walk for a port. I know if I ever need chemo again I will. I got my port in and went and had a Pats Cheese steak. When I had it removed I celebrated at Pats again. I mean even if it is a painless procedure, no sense telling anyone. Get them to treat you to your favorite something. Good luck. Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

We are able to answer many of your questions but I am thinking in terms of from the male prospective. I have seen so many husbands, special friend, friends and family that refuse to deal with any of this. Any husband who is there for his wife is a special man and anything we can do to help I am sure we would all do anything we can to help. My brother had his wife, sister, and a wonderful MIL all diagnosed at about the same time. I realized then that men needed someone to talk to that had been there just the same way women do. If there is something you need help with I know we would be glad to ask the males in our life what they think. Who knows, maybe you will be the one to start that support group for men. In the mean time let us know if we can help.\n \n \n \n ",

I still must say its one thing to know it and its another to have it confirmed. That is a feeling I will never forget. Yet I knew it. I can not help but wonder what it must be like to have no clue and be told. 24 hours later I am having blood work and bone scan. 5 cm and the local yocals could not find it. Red inflamed and awful. If I knew then what I know now! Icould have saved myself so much. I am sure many more can also tell you stories along the same line.

I will go head to head with anyone in cooking, but baking I would embarrass myself. My mother was the baker in the family. She could make a pie dough so flakey, you could actually almost lift see through layers of the dough. Mine has been known to break a knife. Could that be why I do not find any peace with a rolling pin? As Ellen said keep your chin up but if you bake like I do you probably have a great big old smudge of flour on it.

If you knew it and finally proved it or the news came out of the blue... It is still news you never forget about the where, when and how you received it. Last night as I was writing a note to E. Edwards I looked up at the clock and it was 6:05. The exact minute I received my phone call 6 years ago. For some reason every year as I hit 6:05 it all comes back. I do not think any of us ever forget for a minute that we have cancer. I do think certain things trigger that feeling in the pitt of your stomach.That awful feeling you have that first 24 hours. It would be so nice if we could find a way to let people know we are here for this critical time. I can not imagine what it must be like to be alone and no one to talk to when you hear this news. I was so fortunate that I was not alone. I just wish I could figure out a way to see that no one ever was. Thanks for listening.                                L&H Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

She was saying she was not sure that was appropriate. I was saying there are plenty of Joe Friday boards...You know the one where you write just the facts mam! The thing that makes this board so special is the warm and fuzzy stories. The laughter and the antics that go on and no matter how much we joke and laugh and complain if someone needs us all that gets put in a closet, and anyone who can help does. That is what I loved about our board and it has been missing lately. I sure hope the board where we share, our tears and our laughter comes back soon. Having rattled on I want to thank you all for for the congrats. Love and lots of Hugs Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

Pre anything is so great, a scorch or scrape and you are finished. I have to tell you one thing I have found. If a dermatologist does not tell you what it is, you do not have good info. Two times other drs. have told me its nothing. Thankfully because I have had skin cancer surgery I go to the dermatologist every 6 months. I have had two types of skin cancer. Another ex family dr. told me he thought I had melanoma. What a horrible time until I had the surgery. I have finally figured it out. I do not ask my family dr. to check my skin. I do not ask my dermatologist to check my throat. Now lets see if I can get my next lesson down. Tee hee and please get this checked. L&H Joyce\n \n \n \n ",

Now you have to admit where else could I get all this teasing and laughter for two dollars. I really love Gl.(can not remember her post name) she managed to pick 3 horses in one race that got scatched. I still laugh at that.

      "Sample": "She said they put about\n 100 staples in and they have been keeping a check on the area and so far things are looking normal for this type of surgery. They are concerned because of the fever....Thankfully because I have had skin cancer surgery I go to the dermatologist every 6 months. I have had two types of skin cancer....LOL So I guess the cast is my best present because it was my same foot my ankle surgery was done on. I was so relieved to hear the ankle was fine and no surgery is necessary that the foot thing was no doubt the best gift this year....Cathi is still scheduled for surgery on the 11th( tomorrow)and PCE is still fueled and ready. Lets decide on something interesting to make her smile....She wanted usto know she had the baby ina hurry so we could all get home before ithit really bad.One thing that made this special...the first two I was not able to pick up because of damage done from the cancer cells down the nerves in my arm. This time I had no surgery so I went to physical therapy (still have not figured out what the time out ball was doing for my arm) and built my arm up enough so I was able to pick this little bundle up at least for a while.What a joy!...have told me its nothing. Thankfully because I have had skin cancer surgery I go to the dermatologist every 6 months....I might have to leave again because of a relative needing heart surgery so if I do not get back to you its because I am in Fla. Hugs and hope I will be able to help. Joyce...After time almost everyone ended up with the type of hair they started with. I had chemo first that took my hair, then had surgery and then tax and rads....Would not have happened if I had not been sober. LOL So I guess the cast is my best present because it was my same foot my ankle surgery was done on....As you know I was hit once right square in the butt by a Harley in a parking lot as I was walking to my car and ended up with quite a bit of orthopedic surgery..... As I was laying there totally unable to move, I know they got a sale on that plaster....I had the fortune of having my own personal rooster in the room across the hall....",
