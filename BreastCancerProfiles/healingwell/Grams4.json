      "Content": " Thanks for replying Chemosabe and Chantry! I think the thing that bothers me most is the fact that ER- is more aggressive and the more likely to recur. \nI come from a small town and it seems that every breast cancer survivor I have encountered is ER+. I have been very anxious to hear from ER- survivors.\nIt does tend to make me uneasy knowing that there is not a preventative medication available for ER-. But, I do agree with you, Chemosabe, that the meds taken by ER+ seem to be a real hassle.\nThanks again for replying to my post and for the support.\nGrams4\n \n \n \n \n \n ",

They itch and are very scaly. As they heal, they turn a purplish color with a shiny top. The purple scar does not go away. This started about\n 3-months before my diagnosis. My PCP says it can be a precursor for breast cancer. I have had at least four outbreaks of it since then. Dermatologist has shot steroid into a large one on the top of my foot three times now.

In answer to your question: When you get your pathology report back, you will be able to read about\n your estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and HER2 status. Each will have either negative or positive associated with it. Estrogen positive girls are able to take tamoxifen, etc. as added protection after radiation and chemotherapy. Estrogen negative girls are not eligible to take the estrogen medications after chemo and radiation, but it seems they respond better to the chemotherapy. Let us know what your path report reads and keep on posting.\nGrams\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Kind of like a warning or a beforehand symptom. \nMy PCP has done biopsies of my lesions three separate times now...one on the inside of my thigh, one on the inside of my foot, and one on my arm. She had a fairly good idea of the dx before the biopsies, though. \nI also get them in my mouth (oral lichen planus) and vaginally. I had my worst outbreak of the oral kind during my chemo. Its classic design is a white striated look (it reminds people of spider webs) on the gums and on the tongue. It makes me really sensitive to spices. My mouth burns like I am eating hot, Mexican food with many, many foods that have no hot spice taste at all. \nI would think that if two dermatologists have seen these lesions, at least one of them would have known that it was lichen planus, if it was. \nGood luck on finding out what they are and what to do to help with the itching. I know the itching can really be annoying and painful at times.\nGrams\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
