      "Content": " Hello, you guys were very kind when my mom had her scare and biopsy which came back as calcifications. Well now I am having a scare of my on. The last few days under my arm has been hurting. I went to my GP today and she said I had some swollen lymph nodes. Also my White Blood Cell count was high. It was 14.1 and normal is below 10 measured in thousands I believe. My GP said I have to have a mammogram immediately either Monday or Tuesday. She said be ready they may call and with the appointment and I have to go quickly. \nMy signature and profile are not correct as I have not been on the site for a while. I am very scared. I am 33 years old and just had a hysterectomy. It is along story but it was not cancer thank goodness. I had tons of trouble because I didn't start hormones right away and if this is something I will have to go off hormones. That is just one fear among 10,000 going through my head right now. \nI don't know what else this could be. I mean I guess I could have some other kind of infection and my lymph node there is swollen. I don't know. Has anyone had anything like this happen. I know I am up for a lot of waiting. I will wait for the mammogram and if they find andything wait for a day to get a biopsy and wait for the results. Any tips to get through this? The hormone changes from the hysterectomy had already had me in a pretty bad state. I just had to do an intensive therapy program. I know I am kind of jumping the gun but I am really scared.\n30 female.

      "Content": " I know in forum of a personal nature such as this the patient themselves are supposed to make the post however my mom is the patient. She is 62 years old and doesn't know how to use the Internet. She has a touch of dementia. She is still here enough to be affected by this. She just forgets things sometimes. I am her care giver. \nOn Wednesday she had a diagnostic mammogram. It came back with a cyst. The doctor said it is most likely benign. He said 10% chance of cancer. But to us that sounds like a lot. I mean if someone told you that you had a 10 % chance of winning the lottery then you would be pretty excited. Unfortunately for once I was not at the doctor with her when she got the mammogram. But they said something about\n calcification. Also she has had milk discharge from her nipple but they said it was from one of her meds. \nI called all around yesterday and got her an appt with a renowned cancer center for next Thursday. They should be able to do the biopsy that day. Does anyone have tips for things to sk the doctors, things to get through the time, just any tips in general? \nI am worried sick about\n my mom so please do not take this wrong. I have fibrous breast already. I just started hormone replacement therapy because I had a premature hysterectomy. If she has a certain type of tumor I will need to go off of HRT. I want to go off of it as soon as possible in order to prevent what she is going through. I don't mean to seem selfish. I could not be more worried about\n my mom. I want to help her in every way I can. That is why I am here. I love healingwell. I have been a member for a long time. Thank you for your help. ",
