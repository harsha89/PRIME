    "Content": " Hello. I am 39. I started about\n a year ago with spontaneous nipple discharge. ...clear. July 2013 i had a mammo and u/s due to a lump i felt. I have been doing these every 6 months since. A year ago after the discharge my ob found a lump under my left nipple. Everything showed cysts as before but was still sent to a surgeon. Surgeon did cytology on discharge.....said rare ductal cells and lymphkcytes. He wasnt worried despite aunt having double masectomy years ago and mom having non-hodgkins and lung cancer and a breast tumor. She passed away in 2013. He said a ductogram would hurt but reassured we can watch and wait. Well now i have bilateral nipple complex cysts and the left feels heavy and the right only discharges if you squeeze it. I see same surgeon tomorrow. I saw a new surgeon PA last week and she calling me back after surgeon returns on Wed. As she feels benign but woth family history and losing a cousin to ovarian cancer a year ago i can get aspiration but maybe need be in OR because \nlocation under nipple and the are 1cm and need for maybe a core biopsy but if still small then consider bilateral excisiobal biopsy because small cysts and \nlocation but i am small chested too so she said may end up lil bit deformed. I have read a lot and i really want a core biopsy like radiologist recommended but i am just lost and confused. And my nerves are all shot. Help \n ",
