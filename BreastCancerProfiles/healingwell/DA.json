      "Content": " Hi - I am almost nine weeks post-surgery and am also dealing with an \nopen wound. I've also been using the silverdene cream, which seems to help. My doctor has me cleaning the wound by squirting it with sterile water using a syringe before applying a wet-to-dry compress. It is starting to close, but he said that it will take a month or so. The other breast is hard along the bottom. My ps says that it's still swollen. Has anyone else had this problem for such a long period of time?\nBye now,\nD ",

      "Content": " Hi Sarah -\nI would push to have additional tests performed. I was 29 when I felt a lump (I also have fibrocystic breasts). Fortunately, I had doctors that did not dismiss the problem, so at age 29, a biopsy revealed cancer, and I had a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to a small number of my lymph nodes, so I had to go on chemo. Even though it was pretty tramatic at the time, I'm still around 24 years later to talk about\n it. After I was diagnosed, several other family members also decided to go in and we discovered that breast cancer ran in the family, but no one had been talking about\n it.\nD ",
