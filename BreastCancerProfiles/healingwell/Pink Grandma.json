    "Content": " Hello .......I too saw the topic and had to read the thread. You see I have dense breasts and always have to have a follow up mammograms every time.......so far so good.....but it is sure scary. I've also have had 2 colonoscopies. The first one had a polyp. So they have me do them yearly now. Number 2 came out fine. I've been putting off my 3rd one only because of the prep. Like others have said the test itself is a breeze. So you've talked me into it......I'm calling my doctor tomorrow and setting up colonoscopy 3. \nThanks for a great thread.......... \nPink Grandma\nForum moderator-Hepatitis\nWhen the going gets tough....the tough get going! Don't always know where I going but I get there anyways.\n ",
