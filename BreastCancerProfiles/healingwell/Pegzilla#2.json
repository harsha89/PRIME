      "Content": " It's been a long time, folks. Sorry to have been AWOL so long. I've been busy working (planning to retire soon though). Actually I'm supposed to be working from home today (taking a break right now, LOL), because the weather turned crappy and I didn't feel like fighting it today. My work laptop is just to my left, frowning at me because I'm not tapping away on its keys, he he he. But since I forgot to bring home my power cord, the battery will die soon, and I'll just have to wing it from my home computer (no email from work, what a shame)!\nEvery once in a while I jump on HealingWell to see how everybody's doing, and was sad to see you're having more treatments, Cathi. Hope it goes well, and does some good for you.\nI was also sad to see that you're having problems, MK. Hope they get resolved, or at least you find something that helps you get around easier.\nAnd Lori, I'd love to come to the gathering to catch up with everybody, but I can't that weekend. I've kind of got all my travel budget spent anyway (going to Santa Fe/Albuquerque in April, Boston in May, and on an Alaska cruise in August -- then I have to stay home and work to pay for it all). \nI have three pictures of my Breast Friends as part of my screen saver -- one from Las Vegas, one from Susan's funeral (me, Peggy, and Luci), and one of Susan, and MK that I think was taken at our second Myrtle Beach gathering. Keeps you all in my thoughts and my heart. \nSo, everybody, be well !!!\nLove, Peg V ",

      "Content": " I'm doing just peachy. This summer will be my NINE-year mark, so I'm happy about\n that. I ran into a woman on the elevator today at work who knew who I was and knew I'm a survivor, although I didn't remember ever meeting her. She's just one year out, but looked great.\nI left work early today because of the weather (the company sent a blanket email giving us permission to go home at 2:00). I left at 2:30, and it took me an hour and a half to get home, a trip that I can make in 25 minutes in good weather. Didn't get over 25 miles an hour the whole way home. Now the weather folks are debating whether what's expected for tomorrow qualifies as a blizzard. I'm ready for spring, big time.\nMy kids are doing as well as can be expected for college students (stressed out). My DD just broke up with her boyfriend of over a year, and is living alone, so is lonely. But she'll have to learn to deal with that (tough love stuff here--and she's three hours away, so we don't see her as often as WE would like). My DS is heading into finals week next week, so I don't want to even call him! My DH retired last October, and I'm SO jealous, especially on days like today, when he never left the house. I'm thinking that 2010 sounds like a good year for me to retire.\nWe have an aging dog, a mutt named Wilson, who is starting to do weird things, like following me around, even into the bathroom and the laundry room. He hates it when my DH goes down to the basement and starts making scary noises (sawing wood, etc). He tries to find a place to hide as far away from the basement as he can, which is usually under the desk this computer sits on. He doesn't make a very good footstool. I think his health is failing, and the vet wants us to bring him in to have his teeth cleaned, but I'm afraid he wouldn't survive the anesthesia. So we live with his breath, which is like something crawled into his mouth and died.\nI'm trying to log on more often because I miss you guys....maybe I'll make it to a gathering someday.\nLove you all, Peg V ",

      "Content": " Well, it's still snowing here. They were saying we're having the coldest February on record. \nabout\n the robins...on the news yesterday they said that the robins that stick around in central Ohio all winter are usually a hardy lot, but they're dying now because all of their food supply is frozen. They don't eat birdseed (so the normal bird feeder won't help), but they do eat suet. Their normal diet is insects (hah! they're long gone or buried) and berries, which are frozen. Poor things!\nI worked from home two days last week when Delaware county was at level 2 and then 3...I would have gotten a lot more done if my DH weren't also home, and interrupting me all the time!! He works for Dublin schools (two suburbs to the west of us), so he was home when they closed. Some of the school districts have used more than their planned five \"calamity days.\" Westerville schools will have to forgo a day off on Memorial Day to make up the sixth day they used last week. I'm glad my kids are in college, and I don't have to mess with babysitters and fouled-up Memorial Day plans.\nI'm getting cabin fever, though, so my sister and I are going to venture out today to explore a knitting store in Columbus I heard about\n. The roads have been cleared for the most part, so I don't expect any problems....\nStay warm, everybody!!!\nLove, Peg ",

Yes, I'm going to school (getting masters in Marketing and Communication), working full time, trying to get my DD into college.....very busy. \nCandy, I tried to return your call, but got your answering machine.\nAnyway, I'm fine, other than a sprained ankle (I fell at the high school...janitor mopping the floor didn't have one of those yellow \"caution\" signs, and I was, as usual, in a hurry). Coming up on my 6-year anniversary (discovered my lump in the shower on Good Friday 6 yrs ago).\nI miss you all, but I can't seem to find the time to get on the board. It asked me for my logon and password, and I was terrified that I wouldn't be able to remember it, but I did!!!\nAnyway, I think of you all often, but I will be swamped until about this time next year. You all can load up the PCE and COME TO MY GRADUATION!!!!!\nLove to you all, Peg ",

First there was snow (we got about 8\", but parts of northern Ohio got as much as 36\", just ask Cathi!!!)...then we had ice, which froze the surface of the snow hard enough to support the weight of our dog, 80 or so pounds. Parts of central Ohio had power outages as long as 6 days. Then rain, and the snow disappeared in about a day and a half. And then more rain. Then north of us more ice, and more rain.....and more to come, if the weather guys are right. I was very grateful that I had decided to hoard my vacation and take the whole last two weeks of 2004 off!\nPersonally, we're okay (no flooding, no power outages), but 59 (I think) out of 88 counties in Ohio are applying for federal disaster relief.\nYep, Ma Nature definitely hasn't been kind.\nAnybody in real trouble? \nLove, Peg ",
