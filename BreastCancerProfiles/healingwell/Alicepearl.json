      "Content": " Oops - thought you were a doc on here. Guess I should pay attention to my doctor then when it comes to prescribing an antibiotic for me, which is what I intended to do from the start. So I will take the med as prescribed to me and carry on. You've obviously had a lot of experience with these cysts. Am curious - are you post-menopausal? ",

      "Content": " Thanks, Merrida, very good points about\n the antibiotic, and no, I did not have fever, it was not warm to the touch, and blood work was not done either. I'll take for a few days and when the redness is gone, I'll likely stop it. \nI failed to mention that along with the 4 prior cysts, I've had aspirations each time, and the fluid was sent to a lab for analysis. Am always worried that my luck has run out for a good report. This one is different because it's made my breast so sore. Never experienced that before. ",

      "Content": " So glad to read others' experiences with breast cysts. I am 66 and had my first cyst in 2001, then skipped 6 years to 2007, next ones in 2011 and 2012, and now in 2014. All except one were on the left. Current one just came about\n suddenly - had my last mammo one month ago with normal results - and is large and very, very sore. Saw my PCP yesterday who feels it is a cyst and am scheduled for ultrasound and aspiration in about\n ten days. I've always had small breasts with dense tissue, but it's only been after menopause that cysts have been a problem and seem to be getting more frequent. Nearly forgot to mention that my doc noticed some redness and elected to start me on an antibiotic for 7 days, in case there is infection involved. Anyone here experienced that?\nJust thought I'd share. And of course I'm still a little nervous that there's more to it than just a cyst. ",

      "Content": " Understand totally about\n antibiotics being used way too much and have had knowledge of this for years. I definitely should have questioned it more. The redness is more pink in color and not what I would call patchy and is not itchy either, which is likely what led to the antibiotic recommendation, in that it was not an epidermal kind of rash as in contact dermatitis. I would think the difference might imply a suggestion of an inflammatory breast process, i.e. infection. Nevertheless, you are correct that I was remiss in not questioning that more. I'll just be happy when this aspiration is done and behind me. ",
