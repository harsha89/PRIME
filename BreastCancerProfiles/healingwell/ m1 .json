      "Content": " Hi All. \nI did a search on the forum prior to posting, but nothing came up regarding breast disease/breast cancer.\nI am 43 years old. Had an abnormal mammo in late December and was called back in for additional films. Those came back abnormal too.... microcalcification cluster in the left breast. Was immediately scheduled for a vacuum assisted stereotactic biopsy which I had performed last Thursday, Jan. 13th, and titanium marker was installed. The stereotactic sucked because the area was close to the nipple and the probe overshot and exited out the bottom of the breast. So now I have an 8 guage \"through and through\" tunnel in that breast with an exit wound as well as the entry. Grrrr. I've been pierced like a punk rocker. Where is my jewelry???? \n \nRadiologist expedited the path on it. My dingbat ob\\gyn doctor called me Friday night with the results... all is fine. Calcifications were benign. Nothing to worry about\n, we will just stick with yearly mammo's to keep an eye on everything.\nLast night at 5:30pm she basically calls me back and says \"ooops. There was a part at the end of the report where the radiologist is insisting you have a surgical consult due to radial scar tissue found in the biopsies. Sorry about\n that.\" I asked her why I need a surgical consult if it was benign and she said she didn't know. Basically, she gave me results on Friday without reading the entire report, and it wasn't until the RADIOLOGIST followed up with her to make sure I was scheduled for a surge consult that she actually read the FULL report and then had to call me back with the news. \nStill, she didn't have a single answer to any of my questions. I've had more informative conversations with my Pit Bull\\ Boxer mix. \n \nI've done some googling and read that radial scars can \"hide\" cancer cells. Has any of you wonderful ladies on this board had anything like that in your initial DX? I would love any information you could share, since it's obvious I wont be getting any answers from a medical professional until I can get into this surgeon guy for my consult.\nThanks so much!\nm1 ",

      "Content": " Thanks Bev!!\nActually, my radiologists have been golden (I'm up to 3 now.... guess my films are considered interesting... hahahaha). They warned me the probe might exit the other side.... they tried to avoid it but it is what it is.\nMy referring physician however has been close to useless (or a \"hot mess\" as you say.... LOVE IT!!). Will be swapping her out in the near future. \nFrom what I have read, a radial scar is not really \"scar tissue\".... they call it a scar because of how it looks on film, but it is actually tissue and ductal changes in an area that 25% of the time can \"hide\" cancer cells. They say it is rare (something like only 3% of tissue abnormalities are radial scars), and considering how many views this post has gotten with no one raising their hand and saying \"uh huh! Me too!\" I guess the rarity of it is pretty accurate. \nHave a surgical consult tomorrow morning at 9:45. I think they are going to want to do a lumpectomy to check for cancer cells around the area of the titanuim marker. Poor boob still has more colors on it than a Picasso and it appears we are still not done with diagnostics.\nWill post up findings etc., as I go, if that is okay with the Mods. If nothing else, at least this post will be here for someone in the future that may have this \"rare\" finding in their path report.\nHugs right back atcha!\nm1 ",
