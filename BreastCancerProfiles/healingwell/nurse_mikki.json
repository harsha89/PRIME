Or has it been like this for most/all of her life? If NOT a lifelong thing, I would definitely request a surgical biopsy.\nYou are right that a skin punch biopsy should be done. They need to sample the skin in the suspicious area, as well as the underlying tissue for the most accurate picture. Needle biopsies are notoriously inaccurate--there is a much greater chance of them missing something with that (relatively) tiny needle. Better biopsy ideas would be a core biopsy (done in the breast surgeon's office or in the mammogram suite by a radiologist) or surgical biopsy (where she would be under anesthesia & have the area cut out)\nGood luck!\nMichele\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n ",

The tape recorder and extra person were invaluable to me. \nI also kept copies of all of my test results, pathology reports etc in a folder. That way, if you are seeing more than 1 doctor (ie the onc, radiation onc, surgeon, family doc, gyn etc) you have everything you need available at your fingertips rather than having to wait for records to be sent to them. Just ask your docs for the test results as they become available. \nI kept a regular spiral notebook, too. After I listened to the tape at home, I would write things down in the notebook. I would also use the notebook to jot down questions/symptoms I had in between appointments so that I could discuss at my next appointment.\nHugs to you,\nMichele\n \n \n \n \n  ~~~~~~~~~~~\n \n \n Breast Cancer Chronicle Demystifying BC, one step at a time\n \n \n \n ",
