      "Content": " Just wanted to say my PSA (the official term) was reported to Sanofi 6 months later. Well, i think it was before 6 months but i was told they had already reported it when i went for my 6th month check up. In January 2010 it will be 4 years without my hair and it doesnt get any easier.\nOur group is growing by the day, we all feel the same but give each lots of emotional support as we are the only ones that know what its really like.\nThe problem seems to be when Taxotere is usued with other chemo drugs not on its own like its done when men have it for prostate cancer.\nIts now a big problem for women in France - lots of them also permanently disfigured with this drug.\nPlease contact me if you think you have this problem\nshirleyledlie@hotmail.com ",

      "Content": " The drugs company do not tell oncs that it might happen so unless they see it to one of their patients they dont know it happens either. SA also changed their wording last year after it happened to another lady in the USA but when it happened to me it didnt say this. \nHaving been left with a large financial burden the least this company could do would be to supply my wigs - because if its true what they say that its only 4 or 5 women it wont brake their bank will it. On the other hand if its more than that..............\nSo what are they scared of?\nI have had a recent email from my onc saying that sinse he reported my case there has been more cases of it happening all over the world. The more this drug is used the more women will have this disfigurment.\nYour question is difficult to answer, had i been told it might happen but highly unlikely i possibly would have thought 'it wont happen to me', if i had been told it will definatly happen than no i wouldnt have had it and asked for a different drug. This happend when i was a young 47 and you cant imagin the grief its caused me, how i cant live a normal life and how its affected my self estime. I feel so ugly and nothing will change that apart fom my hair comming back.\nThe sooner SA realise i am not going away the quicker we can sort something out because believe me i will be shouting it from all the roof tops!!!
