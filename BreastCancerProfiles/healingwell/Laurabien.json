    "Content": " Hey! Soooo.... a couple of days ago I got this sharp burning, searing pain in my left breast. It's awful. I called the doctor and made an appointment for this afternoon. This morning I noticed when I bent over (without a bra) my nipple wen inward and my breast fell over it like the head from Alien. I went to the doctor and he is sending me for a diagnostic mammo tomorrow. I am freaking out. UGGGGHHHH. Any stories or words are much appreciated. ",
