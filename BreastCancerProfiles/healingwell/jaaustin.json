I've always been one to do EVERYTHING humanly possible to fight this battle. I've been NED for 6 1/2 years and I thank God everyday for giving me the tools to fight.

My doctor normally does treatments every 4 weeks, but I asked to do it every 3 weeks so I could be done quicker. I'd suggest just seeing how you do. Gearing up for the 1st on is definitely hardest, because of the fear of the unknown, but the treatment itself is really not bad. I usually started feeling \"queasy\" about\n 36 hours after my treatment. Keep us posted!\nHugs,\nJulie\n \n \n \n ",

I called the nurse and told her my concerns and told her I didn't see the point in doing them unless something is discovered at my reg. exam or if I'm experiencing symptoms. She agreed and said she thinks the onc. orders them just because he can and \"why not\". I asked her to cancel them and said I would just do my regular check-up. She was totally fine with that. \nI felt so LIBERATED! I told them what I wanted instead of the other way around!\nThanks, ladies. I really feel at peace with my decision.\nHugs,\nJulie\n \n \n \n ",

Don't make more stress for yourself.\nIf you have cancer, deal with it. If you don't, try to take something positive from this experience and move on.\nIf you can't deal with things by yourself, see a counselor.

Once I had a game plan I felt much better -- like I had a little control. I didn't have a choice. I had to have a mastectomy. I ended up having the \"healthy\" breast removed 1 1/2 years later and doing bi-lateral reconstruction at that time. I didn't have reconstruction initially because my daughter was only 19 months old and I didn't want to be incompacitated any longer than I had to. In retrospect, having it all done at one time wouldn't have been that bad. I just had surgery yesterday to try to match up my new breasts. The \"healthy\" breast has always been bigger. They will never be perfect, but I don't regret having them both removed.\nPlease know that you are in my thoughts and prayers. We will be here with you on your journey to offer information and support.\nHugs,\nJulie\n \n \n ",

I was diagnosed at 30 and had a 19 month old daughter. I had mastectomy, chemo, radiation, tamoxifen-- the whole nine yards. I cannot speak for everyone, but for me the chemo was not as bad as it could have been. I NEVER threw up and I was on the \"tough stuff\". I led a normal life for 2 out of 3 weeks and just felt like crap for the other 1. Would I do it all again? H@ll no, but I made it and so can your wife. I will be 5 years out in April....\nTake a deep breath and let the information come to you. You will feel better when you have some control again.\nHugs,\nJulie\n \n \n ",
