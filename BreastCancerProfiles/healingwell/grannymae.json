I hope your biopsy went well..........the name, 'wire guided biopsy' is enough to throw you into a state of panic' now that I re-read, not sure that is the one you were having.\nIn any case, I have been there and done that twice, I just wanted to see how it went for you and let you know that as a 8 3/4 (but who's counting!) year survivor..............I'm here to support you!
