    "Content": " Hi All,\n I am usually on the fibro site but noticed your posting about\n estrogen suppliments.\nI tried the estrogen patch many years ago and found the glue from it ate my skin. It\nstarted itching so I took off the patch and my skin went with it. I have found blue or\nblack cohash work well for the menopose things. Soy isoflavens work well too. Vit E\nhelps with the hot flashes. \n For your dry skin I have found a God Send.....Colostrum and Hylaronic Acid. I use these\ntogether everyday. Colostrum is bovine breast milk in a pill (also comes in goats for those\nlactose intollerent) and Hylaronic Acid is a trace mineral found in Japanese food. I've been\nusing these for years and no longer are plagued by dry skin. It becomes thicker, more\nelastic, and heals quickly. I also noticed a real nice shine to it. I've had quite a few comments\nover the years how nice my skin looks. I'm 55 and have to admit I don't look it. \n I do Super Cissus RX, Malic Acid and Bio-Sil for my arthritis and fibro. I can now work\nan 8 hour day without problems. 8 months ago I could barely hobble through.\n There are herbs to help counter-act the effects of chemo. I don't remember offhand but\ncheck it out. Good Luck to all of you...\n Nana Monster ",
