    "Content": " Hi,\nI\u2019m writing a story for Cancer and Careers.Org about\n Living With Cancer as a Chronic Disease and I\u2019m looking for working people being treated for incurable but treatable cancers to interview about\n the challenges they face both in their personal and professional lives. For example, having to take time off from work for constant monitoring, coping with drug side effects and the mental stress of dealing with the reality that they may never be cured of their cancer.\nIf you are interested in being interviewed for the story, please e-mail me at (e-mail address deleted to protect the op) and give me a brief descript\nion of the type of cancer you have and some of your career concerns and I\u2019ll contact you.\nThank you so much for your help.\nBest,\nJo Cavallo\n ",
