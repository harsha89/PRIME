      "Content": " Looking for help and answers regarding Tamoxifen!\n01/04/12 I was diag with IDC stage 3 in my right breast with 3 positive Axillary lymph nodes, went though 4 weeks of \"heavy\" chemo followed bu 12 weeks of chemo light. I had both breast removed 06/21/12, did 30 treatments of radiation. In Oct I had a major energy increase, pain was lessening and I was starting to think a bit clearly. Then in 11/12 I started Tamoxifen! My live has been a living heXX ever since the Tamoxifen. I have body pain, low energy, tiered all the time, memories loss, lack of concentration, HOT flashes, some mood swings.Every moring I wake up with my calves so tight its frighting, then when I stand me feel are pulsating with pain.a We have yet to find a something to help with the pain! I do PT and yoga, hot baths and massages.\nWhat I am wondering is since both my breast were removed along with 8 axselary removed for the right side. the left breast was fine and no node with cancer.\nMy question is what are the benefits much less need for taking Tamoxifen? I really am not a big fan of the status quoe or just because its been don't this way for years does not means it works for me. I have had darn near every side effect (well the not as common ones.) \nI am just at my wits end as to what to do next! Any suggestions are WELCOMED!\nI guess I should add that I Am post menopausal and had a hysterectomy but left my ovaries.\nThank you for any and all insight! Yes I know that we cant offer Medical advise I'm just looking for suggestions and feedback.\nThank you all! \n ",
