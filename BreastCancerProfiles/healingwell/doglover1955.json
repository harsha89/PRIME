      "Content": " Hi, I am in remission from breast cancer and am on tamoxifin now.  Was told that was the only one that fit me.  The problem?  Major hot flashes, we are talking 20 in a 24 hour period.  Dr. put me in neurontin then for that, which has helped.  I have a HSA which means no co-pay and we are talking like $80 a month for that alone.  Besides I am already on to many drugs.  Does anyone have any other ideas?  The Dr. thinks I will adjust to the tamoxifin and stop hot flashes, what is the experience out there for that?

      "Content": " Barky Boys, are you a dog lover? I live alone and have to support myself so being tired is a big problem. The neurontin is helping, it is just so expensive and I get tired of taking so many drugs. I will keep on that drug till my Dr. appt. at the end of Jan.. Even when the hot flashes are in check, I still seem to have problems sleeping now, I am 55, so maybe age is my problem also. I just have to keep on going cause those dang dogs just won't do anything to help support me! ",

      "Content": " LOL. That is what I tell my \"boys\", after I berate them for not helping out around the house more. They always act like they never get fed when I get home. I would be lost without them though. I also remind them on these cold days how lucky they are to be so spoiled in a nice warm house and comfortable couch. ",

      "Content": " The taking half a pill at a time sounds like a good idea. The hot flashes disrupt my sleep so bad and it what gets to me so bad. I have also heard even without flashes, that tamoxifen can disrupt your sleep. Have you had that problem? Sometimes I get so tired and want to sleep so bad all I can do is cry. Thanks for your input.
