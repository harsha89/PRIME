Im sure it probably is but cancer just seems to be everywhere I look at the moment. \nBut no, he hasnt done any tests at all, just an examination. I would feel more at ease if he did a biopsy, I know they can do that at my surgery, my friend had one done there so its not an inconvienience to wait for appointments at the nearest breast clinic etc. \nParanoia is a fickle thing :) ",
