She said no it's starts with an \"A\". I said Arimidex? she said yeah. I said I thought I was taking generic Femera. So since April I thought I was taking Femera.

I know things work differently on people, but I don't want to get it in the morning then become sick while I'm at work and can't drive myself home. You didn't scare me with your post, it just added to the anxiety I'm already having about\n all this. No... I am very glad to get this info so I know what I could possibly expect. All the info the ladies give is helpful to me right now. I wish I could be more helpful to others. Maybe later on after I've gone through all this. Thanks and lots of hugs to everyone. ",

The one I ordered is part human and fiber and I won't be able to use real products on it. \n I may call tomorow to make sure they did order my wig. I already got my meds filled and will take them with me on Thursday so they can tell me what to take when. I can't even remember to take a vitamin once a day (which reminds me, I need to take one now) I don't know how I'm going to keep up with taking what I have. I have 3 diff meds right now. I hope they will work and I won't have to get something else filled. Of all things I just came back from vac yesterday and last week while away part of my tooth broke off. One that is more filling than tooth. I knew this tooth would have to be crowned eventually. I went to the dentist today and told him about\n my cancer and treatments starting this week and if there was any way possible he can do something temporary. Well, he was able to do it but said any kind of sensitivity or anything to let him know right away. Gosh I hope I don't have to try to have a root canal and crown while I'm doing chemo. ",

She's not sick or anything so hopefully she will just die of old age. My dad passed away in '97 he was 79. I don't have any brothers or sisters. What relatives I have live in Europe and I only know my uncle and his wife and only met them twice because they came here. So once my mom is gone I feel like I will have no one.

And I get so many compliments on my hair color. I dye it due to greying \n It's kind of a burgundy color. I had a lady over the weekend tell me how she was admiring the color as the sun was hitting it before I walked in the store and I wanted to cry. That has been my biggest dilmea with wigs. Finding a color close to this and a style. I sent away for a color ring thru a website that has the wig I want and I found a color a little close, that's why they had to special order it because they said no one has ever bought that color before.

I haven't really felt like vomiting, but when that little lump came up in my throat a couple of times, I just took a pill. I've had heartburn a couple of times. The warehouse manager has the flu or bad cold, so now I'm scared I'll get sick from him. I had been suffering with tennis elbow (not from playing tennis) for the last 3-4 months and that has just disappeared over the weekend. Maybe a reverse reaction to the Neulasta shot or the chemo drugs. I got the drugs thru the same arm the tennis elbow was in. I mean I feel no pain at all in. I was having problems picking things up certain ways because it was hurting so bad. Anyway, I guess for the most part, I'm doing ok so far. I just had a piece of chocolate cake, yummy!! \n ",

I can't feel that there is a balloon inside of me but it's just the thought that's kind of ceepy. I'm like scared to move for fear that it may pop. It's filled with saline so if it does it's not like there will be something toxic running into me. Most of it would probably run out of me anyway. And of all things a rep from the company that makes them was there to watch and help if needed, and \n happened to be kind of cute too. I didn't have to let me they said, but when they said he traveled about\n 2-2 1/2 hours to watch I figured that was the least I could do. But he was very nice and wanted to know if I wanted him to hold my hand. I didn't really feel anything because they numbed my boob. But I just had surgery again on the 27th to take out 3 nodes (which were negative,yay) so I'm still recooperating from that pain. The pain under my arm from that is what has been the worst. I go for a catscan this morning to make sure the balloon is in the proper place and should start radiation on Monday 2 times a day but only for 5 days. Hopefully, I won't have any real side effects since it will be short term. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Well, it's day 2 after my chemo. So far I am doing ok other than some heartburn. I took some Peptol Bismol (tablet) and it relieved it some. about\n 8:45 the 1st night I felt a small lump in my throat like maybe I may feel ill so I took 1 of the pills for nausea and went to bed. I got that way about\n 10:30 last night too so I took another one. My mouth is extremely dry. I have drank more water in the last 2 days that I probably have in the last 2 months. I don't like to drink water even though I know it's good for you because it makes my stomach hurt if I drink too much, but hasn't seemed to bother me yet. I got my Neulasta shot yesterday and I took a prescript\nion motrin before I went to bed last night in case I may wake up with any joint pain. I felt a little jittery yesterday morning and I don't know if it was just anxiety that I may get sick or if it's that pill I have to take for 4 mornings after treatment. ",

She said not to gain weight or really try to lose any while on Chemo, and I just read that online today. I printed a bunch of stuff out and I thought that was one of them, but I can't seem to find it. I think it increases the chance of it reocurring if you gain weight. I guess that may also depend on hiw much you gain. ",

I went to a specialty shop that has different things for breast cancer patients. There is not much in the color I want. I found one that is kind of close to my haircut. I'm not crazy about\n it, but they have a stylist at this place that can cut and shape it. The wig will be a little longer than my hair now. I have only told a few select people at work about\n my cancer and want to keep it that way. My insurance will pay up to $350 for a wig. I figure once it's over with, I can donate it to the American cancer society. Which by the way, they have wigs too. ",

      "Content": " Just wanted to let you all know, that I had my 2nd surgery Wednesday and I will be a candidate for this radiation treatment. I go next Friday for an xray or something so they can size me up or whatever. I can't remember half of what they tell me anymore. I'm still so overwhelmed by all of this. I'm still kind of feelin the effects of the anesthesia today. Blechhhhh! Here's a little something about\n it. I'll keep you updated once it starts and how it goes.\nMammoSite Radiation Therapy System (RTS), FDA-approved in May 2002, is a simpler, less invasive method of delivering breast brachytherapy, a site-specific radiation treatment completed in four to five days, as compared to seven weeks for traditional external beam radiation therapy. The new device delivers radiation directly to the area where a breast tumor has been surgically removed via lumpectomy, which is the site where tumors are most likely to recur. With its site-specific approach, MammoSite avoids external beam therapy side effects, such as the irradiation of healthy tissue.\nBrachytherapy is the first breast cancer treatment to deliver radiation directly to the original tumor site and decrease radiation time. While standard breast brachytherapy involves surgically implanting up to 24 catheters into the breast, MammoSite calls for just a single catheter to perform the therapy.\nMammoSite RTS consists of a balloon catheter that is inserted into the area of the breast where the tumor was removed. Once inserted, the balloon is expanded and radiation is delivered through a tiny bead attached to a wire, irradiating the area surrounding the cavity. ",

I guess some people don't know what it's like to have 1 surgery after another and radiation and chemo and what a toll it can put on you. I would think if your doctor gave you a note saying you can't do 12 hours right away that it should suffice. Some places are just so unsympathetic. The owner of my company has asked me a couple of times how I've been feeling. For themost part now I am ok. Don't know what it will be like once I start chemo. Some people are uneducated in any cancerl, I am one of those people but am slowly learning. I'm sorry you have to put up with such asses. Hopefully they will work it out with you.

Then...because this thing would drain, I was wearing a maxi pad under it to catch any drainage and on top of that I started draining from the other end (if you know what I mean) So I have been wearing pads in 2 places for the last week. Anyway, that part is over. ",

She said that it now has a permanent code (insurance purposes?) because it is a successful treatment. I go back for surgery again on the 27th to make sure there is no more cancer there and also to do a sentinal node biopsy. I'm a good candidate for the Brachytherapy but they won't know for sure until the slice me \nopen again. This is all taking so long since I 1st found the lump. I would much rather do the Brachytherapy. It will be less expensive on my wallet. For the traditional radiation I have to pay a copayment each time I go ($25 each visit,5 dyas a week for 6 weeks I think). I will be in the poorhouse by the time they would finish! All of this is stressing me out between getting referrals from my primary care, calling the ins co to make sure this and that is covered to having to tell my mom when she comes back on Saturday and my job!

No, I'm not pregnant. I had my tubes tied years ago. Wish me luck with my mom today. She is going to be devastated. She's going to think just like I did when I heard the word cancer, \"death sentence\".
