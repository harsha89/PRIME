      "Content": " I recently had a mammagram,,,which was not done on time because they were backed up because of weather,,I have been called in for a special view mammagram and ultrasound on my left breast,,which I am having to wait for because they are so busy ,,and the waiting is starting to really get to me so I thought maybe asking some questions might help.  In the report it said I have dense breats and that it made it difficult to make sure if what is showing up on the screen is just calcium deposits{I think thats the correct term},,it said they appear to be benign. I spoke to my nurse and she said that they need to take a better look to make sure they are benign. I guess my question is how often does this happen,,how likely is it ,,that it could be cancer?,, I have researhed dense breasts and found that women with them have a 75% more chance of getting cancer,,and that facts like ,,starting your period at an early age,,and not breat feeding add to the chances,,,any help on this subject would be greatly appreciated while I wait to go back.

      "Content": " I have good news to report. The radiologist had 2 areas on my left breast he wanted to check into more so they compressed and took pictures of those specific areas. It was still hard to see so they did an ultrasound and found a cyst but nothing to worry about\n and to just come back  in a year. I asked if it was somthing that I needed to keep an eye on but the ultrasound tech told me that it was  just a cyst,,which is a pocket of my own body fluids and nothing to worry about\n. Thanks for the replies to my questions and the concern. I am still concerned with this cyst and with the articles I have read on women with dense breast having a higher percantage risk of getting breast cancer. If I can find that article I will post it on this web site. Thanks again and I wish everyone here  best wishes and lots of prayers with all their tests and procedures. ",

Should i insist on an ultrasound if they dont find anything,,just to be on the safe side?? ",
