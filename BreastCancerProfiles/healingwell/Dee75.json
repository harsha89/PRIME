      "Content": " Hi ! I'M Dee and I'm 83. I would be a five year survivor of cancer but lately I've been having some swelling and seems like more lumping in my left breast. I had a lump and 19 nodules removed. I had chemo-radiation.Yesterday I had a mammogram and than they had me have an ultra sound. Then I was told to do a follow up with my doctor.It takes 48 hours to get test back. That should be around noon tomorrow. It sounds like I have a problem as if the mammogam was ok I did'nt need the ultra sound. They did measurements and I did'nt understand what they were talking about\n. Anyway it's a scary night for me. I thought this would be a great place to get my feelings out. thank you all. Hug!",

He's going to talk too my oncologist and maybe they'll wait until my treaments are over and my port is removed before he works on my teeth. I'll know Monday. What a bummer!!!! I'm not sure what he'll do, but it's going to be a fortune and I believe it has something to do with the chemo and radiation. Hope your all doing fine. I refuse to let this get me down. :>) Dee ",

It grew real fast, so I went in to the regular doctor and he said he wanted it taken out even if it wasn't cancerous, because it was near my lymph nodes.  Well, it turned out that I had HER2 cancer, but no cancer in the lymph nodes. I had a lumpectomy, than chemo and now I'm having radiation. I will take Herceptin for a year. I'm doing fine. Going everyday for radiation gets old, but it doesn't hurt.
