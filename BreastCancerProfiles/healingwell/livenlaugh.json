My husband is taking three weeks off after my surgery and I am working on dinners to freeze. I think I am going to get a body pillow.\nThey are also having to take out the centinal node on the right side. This is a secondary cancer from radiation from the Hodgkin's lymphoma I had 15 yrs ago.\nI keep telling myself that I got through it once, and can do it again.\nThanks for listening.\nlisa\nLisa\nFibromyalgia, GERD, Iron deficient anemia, ADD, and15 yrs. survivor of Hodgkin's Disease.

      "Content": " Hi there...My name is Lisa and I was diagnosed with DCSI in the right breast two days ago. My situation is different. I have a high risk of Breast cancer because I had hodgkin's disease and was treated with radiation. That was 20 yrs ago and it was told to me that I have a higher risk of Breast cancer. And now having breast cancer at 43 the drs state that my age also poses a high risk. Now here is my possibilities:\nTypically the treatment is lumpectomy and radiation but radiation is not an option because it has been previously radiated. So they said that I could have the lumpectomy and take hormone meds but I am still at a higher risk of reoccurance. Or...\nI could have a masectomy possibly double because I am at high risk again. My head is spinning so if this sounds scattered, I am sorry. I am looking for guidance and wonder what other people have done in a similar situation.\nThanks\nLisa ",
