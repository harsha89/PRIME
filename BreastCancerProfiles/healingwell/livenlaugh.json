After reading this thread, I am nervous about\n having the bilateral mastectomy and the after affects that it can cause. Am I most likely to have this? I also have fibromyalgia.

What should I have on hand for recovery?\nThanks\nLisa\nFibromyalgia, GERD, Iron deficient anemia, ADD, and15 yrs. survivor of Hodgkin's Disease. ",

      "Content": " Hi there...My name is Lisa and I was diagnosed with DCSI in the right breast two days ago. My situation is different. I have a high risk of Breast cancer because I had hodgkin's disease and was treated with radiation. That was 20 yrs ago and it was told to me that I have a higher risk of Breast cancer. And now having breast cancer at 43 the drs state that my age also poses a high risk. Now here is my possibilities:\nTypically the treatment is lumpectomy and radiation but radiation is not an option because it has been previously radiated. So they said that I could have the lumpectomy and take hormone meds but I am still at a higher risk of reoccurance. Or...\nI could have a masectomy possibly double because I am at high risk again. My head is spinning so if this sounds scattered, I am sorry. I am looking for guidance and wonder what other people have done in a similar situation.\nThanks\nLisa ",

      "Content": " Hi there,\nI had a double mastectomy 4 months ago. I do not need radiation and chemo. I am feeling increasing pain, I think nerve pain. It is like a shock across where my breasts are. I needed the right expander removed in August due to a staph infection and due to have it put back in on the 10th. Is this normal to have increase pain? Sometimes it takes me by surprise. \nThank you for any feedback and let me know if you have any recommendations as to how to minimize it.\nThanks\nLisa ",

After reading the thread about\n post pain, I am nervous about\n having the bilateral mastectomy and the after affects that it can cause. Am I most likely to have this? I also have fibromyalgia. I have DCSI and because it is a secondary cancer due to radiation treatments, it needs to be done. Any tips on what to prepare for? Does anyone have body pillows? What should I have on hand for recovery?\nThanks ",
