I really don't wanna do chemo or anything i prefer to remove them. I think the knowledge of knowing what i can do makes me stronger. I was near my mother when she go BC and it was such a horrible time in our lives. She was in her 60ies but now I fear the worst. I always said to my self if it is... i would remove them and get implants. I was to concerned that i would get it again...and so on. Now I am faced with this possibility and its stressing me out because i don't know as much as i bought i did. Anyone who has advice or gone through this....anything will be nice even just information. If the cancer is caught early, is there a chance i can just remove it and proceed to place implants in. I would like to just avoid having to suffer with chemo and possibly having cancer return....if its in the family already.\nI know I sound insane but I am trying to cope and move on...in case. Im very afraid.. ",
