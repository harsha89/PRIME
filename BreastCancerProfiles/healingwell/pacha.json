    "Content": " Hello,  I have a close family member who was diagnosed with BC during the summer last year. The person concerned is a very private lady and I repect her wishes for privacy. However I feel that in trying to protect her family she is not getting as much support as she needs. I am sure her condion is far worse than she would like us to believe. I would be very grateful if anyone can provide an idea to what may happen next and how I can show my support and love. Before this occured I was  considering moving away from the area but am not sure what to do for the best. Should I stay close by,will I be needed to provide daily care?\n \n ",
