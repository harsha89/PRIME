      "Content": " Hi everyone,\nI was having pains in my right breast on Sunday night, like someone was stabbing me in the nipple and just below the nipple, slightly to the right, with a needle. When I went to bed, I did a check and found a lump that was like a pea or a bead about\n 2 finger-widths away from my nipple to the lower right. The pain subsided yesterday evening, but I find that my nipple is still a little tender, although that could be from all of the poking and prodding! lol\nI have \"lumpy breasts\", as stated by a doctor in university and I know that my mother has the same. She said that they gave her a term for it.... I guess fibrocystic breasts, or something like that. I do my regular checks and I know that this lump was not there before.\nI called the next morning to make a doctor's appointment, but I am kind of wondering what it sounds like to people who may have more experience than me. I plan on telling him that I want to get it checked out, but what should I push for?\nThank you very much in advance! ",
