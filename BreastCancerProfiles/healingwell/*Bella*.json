    "Content": " Hi,\nMy mom just got the results back from her most recent mammogram and it says the following:\nThere is mildly dense fibroglandular tissue bilaterally. In the left breast there are no increasing focal areas of irregularity, suspicious calcifications or skin thickening to suggest neoplasm.\nIn the upper right breast and seen only on the MLO view, is a 9mm nodular density. This needs to be further evaluated with a spot compression MLO view. The remaining portion of the right breast appears unchanged since the prior study.\"\nMy Mom is 55, in good overall health, and we have no family history of breast cancer, but I am very scared, to say the least. Do you have an opinions on what this may mean? Does this sound like cancer or could it be something else?\nThanks for any insight you can give. ",
