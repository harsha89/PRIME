    "Content": " Hello Everyone,\nLast month suddenly i see a drastic change in my left breast.It got swollen little bit under the nipple and i can feel the hardness and little bit pain .SO I went to obgyn on Jan 21st he saw my breast and told it is because of excess caffeine,soft drinks and chocolates and he suggested me to take Vitamin E and Womens oil prim rose tablets.And the obgyn also told me to do an Ultrasound.The ultrasound reports came out normal.It says BI RAd Category -2, thats means no cancer sympotoms(thats what doctor told).\nNow ,I took a second opinion, the second doctor told it is inflammation and he gave ibuprofen 600mg and SMZ-TMP DS800 substitute to BACTRIM for two weeks.\nAnd my first obgyn told, my left breast is very dense.\nAnd also my periods are regular. I am 1986 born.I have a 3.5 year old baby.Did breastfeeding for 1year.\nPlease help me with my situation.When I take these BActrim and Ibuprofen tablets, I feel some discomfortness in my stomach.\nNeed suggestions on this please.\nThanks\nRamy ",
