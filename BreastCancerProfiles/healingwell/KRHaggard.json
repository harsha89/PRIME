    "Content": " I was scheduled for a stereotactic bopsy after a 2nd mammogram. It was not pleasant but it was tolerable. They told me they would call me within 24 hours to give me the results. I got the call almost exactly 24 hours later. I was told on the phone that I had breast cancer and that I would need to get in touch with a surgeon in the next day or so. I have had 2 surgeries and 33 rounds of radiation and my last mammogram was clear! The worst thing I went through, though, was the wire guide to pinpoint the tumor. It is like being stabbed with a wire with a fish hook on the end. Worst experience of my life. I even went into shock after the procedure and the surgery to remove the tumor was delayed. Just be cautioned if they tell you they are going to do this! ",
