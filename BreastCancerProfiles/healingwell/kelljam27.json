    "Content": " I\u2019m a 21 year old female who smokes a little. 9 weeks ago i felt a lump under my nipple in my right breast it was moveable then one week later i began having a burning sensation in both breasts then a day or so later my breasts became very hard and soon after i could feel a new lump every day! I can now say the 1st lump has gone down in size but the lumpiness in my left breast is now giving me pain under my arm and i have slight swelling there. During these 9 weeks i have seen 6, yes 6 doctors and at 1st my doctor kept telling me it was due to hormones, i just didn\u2019t agree, and went back to the doctor every week as the pain is awful and i haven\u2019t had one day where i haven\u2019t felt pain. i have no history of breast problems in my family and have never suffered from anything of this sort before. My breasts are small and have always felt somewhat bumpy and hard. I\u2019ve been off the pill for 6 months for no reasons. I finally got an appointment to see the specialist at the hospital followed by an ultrasound (it only took 6 weeks!!!) the specialist examined me & said i definitely don\u2019t have cancer which i know he can\u2019t tell that just by feeling but it did ease my anxiety and i was told id have to wait 2 weeks for an ultrasound as its not serious, since then ive had a bad ache in my left arm which im told can be linked to anxiety. i had my ultrasound yesterday and the lumpy area I\u2019m fearful of was not seen on the scan! But one lump in the right breast did show up and I\u2019m told it looks like a fibroadenoma. Now i am off to see my doctor tomorrow as I\u2019m sick of the pain and demand something be done or i receive some pain killers! And maybe he will have the ultrasound scan back so he can see where to go from there. is appreciate any comments if you have had similar situations and your outcomes.\nGod bless. ",
