They say it takes a week to kick in and elevate your WBC so taking it after treatment doesn't hurt. They give it to you so your WBC will jump up to normal after your treatment. Its a good thing I took it too cause my WBC dropped down to 1.8 a week later (normal is 4-10) then by the next treatment it was ",

      "Content": " Bernadette: I know you don't want to feel like you did this last time, and I know I didn't want it either when I was going through it,Â BUT I strongly hope you take the shots cause the results of low WBC is far worse on your body then the feeling you have with the shot, see if you get too low you \nopen up your body to all kinds of infections.. severe ones, that could end you up in the hospital. I hated the way it hurt and how sick I felt with the chemo and shot for 4 days too, but I made it through all my treatments without complications. I was ready to throw in the towel alot too and got very discouraged but my fiance and this board kept me going. Gear up for next treatment. Get on board the nausea meds, pain meds if needed, ect. Think once you know what to expect each time makes it easier to handle it. I just know I would feel really bad those four days and took my nausea meds on schedule for 3 days no matter how I felt. I was so bad that I couldn't go up and down stairs those 3 days, our bedroom was upstairs so in the day time my fiance put a twin bed in the livingroom during the 1st 4 chemos so I could relax and not have to climb stairs while I rested during the day. I know it sounds terrible and know your hate how you feel but its worth it if it cures you and gets rid of the cancer. Like my fiance says anything thats strong enough to kill cancer has to make you feel bad too, but its worth it for your future. (he always said \"but its worth it for our future\") That helped to keep me going cause I know I was doing it for us and our future and you are doing it for you and your future with your family. Hope you don't get too discouraged, now that you know what to expect, have a long hard talk with your onc doc, explain you need nausea meds and pain meds to help you get through k... and by no means give up on your future cause its worth the battle to have one kkkk.....Here are the meds they put me on... EMEND (3 tabs once daily) zofran sublingal every 8 hours as needed (but I took it for 3 days on schedule no matter what) and compazine as needed ( only took it a few times) I never took pain meds but if you need them have them give you Norco or something simular. This is what I took with A/C when I was on taxol I just took compazine and norco...... Sorry so long I do that... lol when I was little my dad called me windy cause I talked to much... do post and let us know how your doing k.. and I will keep you in my prayes and hope the best for you k.... never give up!!!!!!...skeeter1 ",

UUmm thats interesting.. not sure what to think but just glad its all over. I hope all goes well for you with the next tx's...I reallyÂ am notÂ totally convinced it was a allergic reaction I had butÂ it really doesn't matter right now anyway just hope with ever it was for you its going to be better the next treatment...skeeter1Â  ",

I was nervous the first visit and first treatment, but was surprised how simple and easy it was for me,it became a routine to go there get aÂ treatment and go home. I wish you all the luck with radiation. Glad you have made it this far, soon everything will be over, you just wait and see..I am happy for you....skeeter1 ",

I had DS shave if off before it fell out too much. Finding long strands of hair all over was really hard on me. So I said shave it off, shave it ,all, off. I was funny cause I would laugh while he shaved it and then when I saw it fall to the ground I would cry, once it was gone I got use to it. It took 6wks after my last treatment to come back and now its only about\n 1 1/2 inches. it looks like it may have a wave but can't tell yet if it will have curles. I wear a wig cap under the wig I have. I like my wig I feel very comfortable with it, you will get more comfortable with yours too. I occasionally wear a baseball cap gosh really not into scarfs or regular hats think I look like Minnie Pearl in them lol... we went to our state fair and I wore my wig... on the way home in the car I took my wig off I was so hot...anyway it was so funny to see people look at me at the stop lights. They would glance and then take another look... lol I teased DS and told him the next one that stares at me I am gonna wink at....lol!!!needless to say I was having a good time at the stop lights.. Things will fine at work for you in the wig...... have fun with it... ok... skeeter1 ",

I colored it over a month ago and it worked great I put it back to my light brown hair color. Everyone at work say they like my hair. I was amazed how it grow back with a style of its own and it really isn't bad lol I went to sally's and got the color that has conditioners in it figured that would be better for me and the color dye there is more like the color they use in beauty shops. Explore your new color and new hair and have some fun with it. I do feel more normal now. I am back to work, have my natural hair color back and each day I feel stronger and stronger. Life is going well for me now. Today I am going to a luncheon were I work for breast cancer it is \nopen to the community too and from what I hear they do it every year, guess they give us gifts and have a nice meal with linens tableclothes ect.

I also wear compression panty hose when I work, and I work 12hour shifts 3 days a week. With all of this my leg pains are almost gone and after my 12 hours shift on my feet the whole time when I get home I have no leg pain at all. I can't tell you what causes the pain but know this has worked for me. I asked my onc before I started taking the tabs if it was ok and he said it was fine wouldn't interfer with arimidix and when I come back in Dec he is going to seeÂ how it helped me and may suggest other patients take it too. I also take calcium and a multivit a day too along with my effexor... good luck and talk with your onc and see what he can suggest or if it thinks this will work for you.... skeeter1 ",

I think if you talk with them and come to an understanding as to why they choose not to share this with you it will help you move on from this. Also if you don't understand why and how this happened you will never trust your PC again, and that would be hard to continue to have them as a PC if in your mind you will always be questioning all the care you get in the future with them. I would let them know that too, that you need to come to an understand about\n this cause otherwise you will never be able to have complete trust in the future care they give you.Â  I know your a very resasonable person and will be able to get past this. Its a shame it happened, you have every right to question and understand why and how this could have happened to you.

It has helped the pain alot. I go back and forth with the omega3 I was told at that atkin store here that it doesn't have phyoestrogen in it. I have taken it for a week and had great result along with mag. I really don't know forsure if it has estrogen in it or not and was wondering if any of you would know the answer I looked it up on internet and just got more confused. I stopped taking it for now until I can find out forsure. I know I should ask my onco dr. but I really have a hard time getting ahold of him. The chemo nurses asnwer his calls and you never can talk with them direct you have to wait for them to call back and it takes forever I hate to bug them about\n a question like this. I know mag is good for muscles so I take 300mg daily along with my multivit. I hope someone here knows the answer about\n the omega3 from salmon....Yikes I start work on monday 12hrs on my feet wish me luck. That is why I want to know if its ok to take omega3 with arimidex.

      "Content": " This is a BIG RED FLAG for me. I am upset, concerned and worried for you. Did you have a lumphectomy or mastectomy. I had lumphectomy and before I had rad tx I had an onco nurse tell me that I shouldn't have pain in throat, neck ect only if they are radiating the neck area and that is normal with thyroid rad ect. It is caused from mucous membranes being radiated and that shouldn't happen with breast cancer radiation. If I was you I would further investigate this. See when I was mapped they took pictures of my tatoos and kept the pictures in my chart. They also drew on my chest that day in black marker exactly where the radiation would go, and put that pictures in my chart. They did xray of my chest once a week and checked each week to see if they were radiating the right area. Every treatment I was remeasured by my tatoos before they placed the radiation on me, and at least a couple times they placed a tab on me during a treatment to measure the amount of radiation I actually was getting to make sure it was right. Now if they did all of these precautions with you then you should be able to ask to look at your chart and have them explain exactly where your radiated to makes sure they aren't radiating the wrong area. I could be way off but I really think this isn't a side effect from the right radiaton tx for breast cancer. I really would hate for you to find out too late that they radiated your mucous membranes and it caused damaged where it shouldn't. My radiologist told me that no matter how well they measured and no matter what precautions they took I would have a small amount of radiation damage to my lung. A very small amount and wouldn't feel any different but in future xrays it would show up later. That was the only thing he said would happen to me other then the normal skin and tissue thickness ect. I did have small amount of pain in the muscle of my breast and my skin was like it was sunburned at times but that was it. Sorry so long.... investigate, maybe the others on this board have an opinion on this... have them show you exactly where they are radiating.... I wish you all the luck in the world... keep us posted on this ....skeeter1 ",

My radiologist told me not to put the gel on before radiation. I guess some say to make sure you put it on 2 hours before and not closer. Mine said don't put it on that day until after tx. I got up in mornings took shower cleaned with ivory bar soap and never put the gel on, once I was done with radiation I put it on right away and then few times during the day. I took my radiation at 11:30am. IÂ am done with my treatments now ended 1 1/2 weeks ago and during my treatments I had no burns and my skin only turned pinkÂ but was goneÂ the next morning, but the last week with the boosters I did get more of a red color and dry skin. I used the radia plex gel for one week and nowÂ I put a light eucerin cream on. So good luck and just be persistant with your skin care and you will do fine. Now my skin is almost back to normal!!!Â  skeeter1\n ",

They had Brides Against Breast Cancer in a town close to use and since I am getting married next summer we went to it. Its a wonderful program not sure if you guys have heard of it. They have tons of wedding dresses that businesses and people have donated and sell them and donate the money toÂ makesÂ wishes come true forÂ breast cancer patients, anyway when they found out I hadÂ breast cancer and was in treatment she told me I could pick out any wedding dress I wanted and anything else and I could have it for free... WOW WOW WOW.. I had such a wonderful time I tried on alot of dress and finally picked one that fit me great and was absolutely beautiful looked like a princes dress. I came home glowing.

My last dose was end of May, I think it lasted for 2 months and now I get alittle bit if I sit/stand for along time, but seems to be getting better each day. Hopefully yours will do that too. I have to go back to work and stand for long hours soon so I ordered some compression stockings to help my circulation. I think its caused from our nervious system. I think in time it goes away but have hear from others that they still have it years later. No sure but have notices mine is getting better.

I looked up the side effects of Sonata and effexor and what drugs not to take with effexor and the only one I found in sleeping pill form was Ambien... they said the two drugs interact together not sure what they do... since Sonata is a sleeping pill together wonder if they interact together too.. and that is why.. has anyone run across this... I have quit taking sonata now hate how it makes me feel during the night... was thinking about\n trying tylenol PM but not sure what it will do.. any suggestions??? ..... skeeter1 ",

I got so bad hot flashes the other night I couldn't sleep, butÂ I do get sad and think that is probably normal. What are your thoughts on this. Of coarse I would clear it with my onc.

      "Content": " Skky, I too got pain in the elbow after my lumphectomy and occasionally get it now.. it feels like I bruised my elbow and it feels like a lump too... I asked my wonderful nurse prac a few weeks after surgery what it was and why I had that... she said with in the armpit area is a major nerve that travels down the armÂ  and with the swelling and irritation of the lymphnode area and during the surgery the doc moved the nerve around it can get irritated and cause the pain I was feeling but will get better ... I think if you never exercised much after your surgery and your doing it now that the nerve is being maniputated again now and moving back to where it belongs and that is what your feeling... but never assume always ask.. so call your surgeons office and talk with the nurse or doc and see if they think it could be the nerve now since you have started to exercise now and never did much before ok.. always better to be safe then sorry... occasionally when I have exercised my arm alot I feel it again... but it goes away in a day now... I am doing exercise in the gym at my hospital now and use the wt machines with little weightÂ  to stretch my arm more now and get it back in shape going very slow with it... but it seems to be helping and my arm is getting close to feeling normal now... I really can't say enough about\n early exercise and what it does for the muscles and surgery site later on...just never do it on your own without asking your doc first cause everyone surgery is different k... you don't want to strain your muscles too soon .... skeeter1 ",
