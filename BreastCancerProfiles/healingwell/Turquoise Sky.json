    "Content": " Hi, I'm from the Lyme forum, but was curious to know what was the thought was about\n these new guidlines. My husband actually reacted more strongly than I did, when we first heard them! My concern is that the insurance companies will refuse to pay for them even if the Dr. still orders them. Those that we know who have had breast cancer were mostly under 50. I am still in shock that anyone could ever possibly go along with this!\nGod bless all of you! ",
