I had a yearly mammogram then two days letter I recieved a letter from the radiologist stating I needed to redo my mammo because it was in conclusive and I also got an ultrasound. I had both done last Thursday and I was called back from the dr office stating I needed to see the dr about\n my results. Dr stated I needed a biopsy but not to worry. I am really scared and I am freaking out.. Anyone have good advise? \n ",
