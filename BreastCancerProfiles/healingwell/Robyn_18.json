    "Content": " Hi everyone, I posted on here a couple of times last year but just haven't had much time lately. I just need to vent a little bit.  My mom was diagnosed with cancer september 2003.  She went through 6 months of chemo theraphy and was horribly sick, lost all her hair and wow! did she have a lot.  She was then suppose to start radiation but the cancer spread to her bones and they stopped all chemo/radiation treatments.  She is a very happy person with a good outlook on life, she is still working and making the best of things.  She is taking 90mg of slow release morphine 3 times a day and the doctors have also given her liquid morphine for inbetween her pill times.  She doesn't take advantage of it but I still feel that its way to much drugs for her to be taking. She has lost over 30 blbs since I started school this year.  Annyways, I am heading home for christmas and am really nervous, I know it kinda sounds silly but I am!  I am only 19 year old and  have been away at college since September and I am not sure how I should act or be with her.  I want to treat her normal but I also want to make things extra special cause everyone is telling me that she isn't goign to be around much longer.  I have total breakdowns and stuff lately cause I just don't know how to deal with all the things going on.  Sometimes I just want to quit school and move home to be with her but she wants me to live my life for me.  None of my friends understand what I am goign through and it sooo hard to deal with. I put on a happy face for everyone and sheild everyone from how I actually feel but it is sooo hard to do.  I found this poem that I thought you all might like... it is totally how I feel .. If I could give my mom the world   If I could give my mom the world Or anything she wanted, I'd give her my own heart and soul And leave my own heart haunted. I'd take upon myself her life With all its strife and pain, And let her ease into some space Where she could live again. The pain for me would not be pain, At least not for a while; For I'd be doing it for her, And I would see her smile. I wish that I could take her heart And cleanse it with my tears, And make her sorrow go away, And answer all her fears. I wish, I wish, but then I can't, As I watch helplessly, And take her in my arms and say I wish that it were me. But loving is a hard, hard way, With all the pain it brings. And yet there is no other way To touch the heart of things.                                                                                                      By Dimitri Shostakovich   Anyways, I just needed to vent and put my thoughts into words and writing to people who know what I am goign through.  Merry Christmas EVERYONE and good luck with your treatments.   Robyn ",
