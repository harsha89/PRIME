      "Content": " I had my stereotactic biopsy today.  The procedure wasn't too bad - a little painful when they numbed me up, but after that I didn't feel any discomfort. The staff was very supportive and reassuring. I brought in a favorite CD to listen to - to help distract me, they covered me in a warm blanket and even gave me some chocolate afterwards! Before they started, I was offered some Valium, which I took since I was pretty nervous. I only took a half dose, which took the edge off but didn't leave me feeling loopy. My doctor was wanting to remove all of the calcifications, but there were too many so she just got several good samples. They also placed a small clip in my breast, to mark the area for future reference. Afterwards they took several mamograms - my new baselines. Then they wrapped me up in an ace bandage (think uniboob), gave me an ice pack and sent me home. I should have the results on Monday.\nI'm a 36 year old mother, have had Crohn's for 14 years.  Taking Imuran, Pentasa, prednisone, Prevacid, Forvia, fish oil and Cymbalta.\n ",
