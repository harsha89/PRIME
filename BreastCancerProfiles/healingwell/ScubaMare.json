    "Content": " Hi All. I'm new to the site -- and to medical \"issues\" -- and I just wanted to thank you all for this great site. \nIn March, I was very surprisingly diagnosed with pulmonary emboli in both lungs. I had been short of breath for a few days and decided to have it checked out. Long story short, they think the birth control pill may have been the culprit (I'm 50) and I was hospitalized for one night. I'm very thankful to be recovering very well from that and have returned to all normal exercise and activity without being short of breath. \nA week ago I had my annual mammogram and, for the first time, got the letter that there was a \"finding that needed further investigating.\" My doctor didn't really tell me much, something about\n a shadow and that they get a lot of repeat screenings just to be on the safe side. She called it a re-screening of my right breast that may include a few more angles. She was really quite nonchalant about\n it all. Of course, after the PE in March, I'm freaking out. \nI'm off the pill now and not menopausal quite yet, though I have the usual normal cycle, two periods one month, a skipped period, etc. and have been going like that for about\n a year now. \nFrom what I've been reading from all of you wonderful people, though it's nearly impossible not to worry, I should try to relax and that in more cases than not the findings are normal. The only history of breast cancer in my family is my mother's grandmother. My great-grandmother. My mother is 84 and has never had any breast trouble. \nThanks for any advice or comments.\n ",
