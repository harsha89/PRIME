    "Content": " hi, i have very dense breast tissue, i have had my right breast mastectomy and the left breast had a lumpectomy, i have triple negative ,her2 .once each year. 2013 and 2014, now i have under arm swelling called lympodema,for a year now, i am feeling a sore area under the arm ,i am going to have it looked at as soon as i can. i am scared .i was the one who found the lumps even after the mammograms,i told them something was there so i waited longer for them to check again ,it gave the cancer time to grow larger. that's what happens with the triple negative cancer. i hope your repeat mammogram comes out negative. \ni am so sorry about\n losing your husband to cancer,i believe in prayer!, i'll keep you in my heart for prayer, that is the only way we can survive this . p.s. i am also a new member here. lily ",
