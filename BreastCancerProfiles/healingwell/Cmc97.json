    "Content": " I'm 17 and a couple of months ago since like December, maybe, I started having breast pains, mainly in my right. I read an article on how to check for lumps and I did, but I'm still not sure. I'm just confused I don't know if it is normal, like a part of my breast or if it is something that I should get checked out. There is an obvious size difference in my right breast than my left and it feels -more like hurts, and looks weird. Also right under the breast is a little spot that sort of looks blotchy that I just noticed in the mirror. I could be totally paranoid because I freak out about\n this sort of stuff all the time, but I'm really freaked out, and It hurts all the time. Please help! ",
