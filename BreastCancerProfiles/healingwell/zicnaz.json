      "Content": " Got a call from the imaging center yesterday to come for more pictures today. I have a dense spot in left breast. After reading posts on this forum I feel better this morning, I was worried sick all night ! It is amazing how your mind takes over with negative thoughts. Will find out today what is going on. Thanks for listening. ",

      "Content": " They did find something about\n 1 cm. Will have a biopsy next week to tell what it is. I am OK with it , abit scared , but I can't keep making myself sick with worry. It could be weeks before I find out, and if it is cancer I will have to deal with it. Easier said then done.\nThanks for your reply it really help to \"talk\" about\n it\nKathy ",
