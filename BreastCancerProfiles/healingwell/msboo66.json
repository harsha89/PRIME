    "Content": " I had a fibroroadnoma when I was in my early 20's and had it removed even though the doctor said it wasn't neccessary. Glad I did because my mom was dx with breast cancer when she 57 so I was really glad that it wasn't there when she got her dx. In 2003 at the age of 36 they found a lump on my mamo and they also did a ultra sound and said it appeared to be a fibro. They weren't 100 % sure. I have this thing about wanting things to be 100% sure so I had it removed . They told me before I even left recovery that it was indeed a fibro.After some research I found out that fibros are mainly caused by estrogen dominace(sp?). So are some bc though also. I now do a natural progestrone cream hopefully to balance it out. Not sure if going to help or not but maybe it will.My moms bc wasn't estrogen related but it was very agressive. I just wanted to post my experience hoping it may help somene out there.\np.s. I come here most everyday and want you ladies to know that you are my heros. You all are the most encouraging women I've ever come across. I'm saying prayers for all the wonderful women on this board. Mollie\n ",
