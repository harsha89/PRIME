      "Content": " I posted last week about\n a call back from a mammogram...I was so nervous and asked for an earlier appointment..they had me scheduled for a month later which made me think it wasn't anything..they had a cancellation on Wednesday April 1st and they did another mammogram and an ultrasound and everything is fine..I have REALLY dense breast tissue and last year they did a 3 D mammogram which sort of cuts through the dense tissue and they can see things they haven't seen before...they do want me to come back in 6 months just to be sure because of my history..I'm glad they're watching me closely but a call back can mean nothing and many time that's the case!

      "Content": " Hello...I am new to this site. I just received a call back for more pictures from a mammogram..the person calling said that at it didn't say they see any masses or cysts but they just need more pictures. I have very dense breast tissue and also fibroids on the right breast. They have me scheduled for a come back on April 20...I am so scared that I had my gynecologist call and see if we could get it any sooner..they moved it up to April 15. They tried to reassure me it to be alarmed that it was common. Is it a good sign that they are waiting a month to have me come back??\n(I gave your post a subject line. \n )\n ",
