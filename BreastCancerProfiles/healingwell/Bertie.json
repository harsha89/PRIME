But it is a new day...and we have renewed faith and hope; as God heard our prayers and we are hopeful that these new drugs will make her feel better and start seeing improvement in her day to day recovery.  We've never given up, been scared so bad we can't sleep or focus on much else sometimes but never ever gave up.  Please keep my mother in law Anna Mae in your prayers.

My sis-in-law introduced me to this site. my mother in law is fighting a mean round of cancer. she lives in maryland and we live in iowa. we see each other once per year but are in constant contact and are very close. distance has not made us less close. we do feel however, helpless in the sense that we cannot be there to be a lending hand, a shoulder to cry on, give encouraging words and help out more. the distance thing bothers me; although i know that that's how it is and that they would never think another thing about\n it...that's just how it is.\n \n \n ",
