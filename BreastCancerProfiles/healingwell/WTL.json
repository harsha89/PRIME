Wondering if every time the mamo shows changed calcifications I will need a biopsy. Seems like a scary cancer watch. I will keep posted as to what happened. I appreciate sites like this to read and share thoughts and concerns. It does help the process. Thanks again for the response. WTL ",

Have not changed anything so far, but thinking with this next check I will go somewhere else for mamo and reading thereby getting a second opinion. Depending on the outcome, hoping this will help clarify things for me and I can make further decisions. Will keep posting happenings and results. \nGood luck and keep researching and sharing. \nWTL ",

      "Content": " This is my first post and I'm confused that six months ago I had a core needle biopsy for microcalcifications and I understood the results to be benign. Just had my six month mamo check and the radiologist said more calcification showed up and they need to do another biopsy. I have since talked witht he surgeon who did the first biopsy and he said the results from the first biopsy show lobular neoplasia which is not cancer, but not benign. This is a whole new story for me. Needless to say I'm questioning where I am at and why another biopsy. Anyone else have this situation? WTL ",

      "Content": " My second biopsy came back with basically the same, but stated as atypical lobular hyperplasia. Seems like they use all these terms interchangeably. Surgeon had me see the oncologist and basically he suggested Tamoxifen for five years. After discussing the side effects, one of which is blood clots, which run in my family, my dad died from pulmonary clot. we decided to do a watch with mamos and maybe MRI. Still not confident this is the right decision. I am postmenopause and had my ovaries removed after menopause which probably means not much estrogen going on. What I understand is the Tamoxifen stops estrogen from feeding the wild cells, but estrogen levels are already low why would this be necessary? \nWould love to hear from others with this diag and hear what decisions they made.
