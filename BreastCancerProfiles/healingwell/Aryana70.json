    "Content": " Hi Everyone,\nI recently had blood tests done, and everything was fine, except my liver function was up slightly and kidney function was down. But my ANA count was a concern from my doctor, it came back 2560.....I dont know what that means he is sending me to a rheumatologist for more testing. All the bloods for lupus, arthritis all came back negative. So i'm not to sure how i should react and if there is anything to really worry about\n. I've just turned 40, I have aches and pains, headaches, and i'm tired all the time, would this tie in with the high ANA\ncheers ",
