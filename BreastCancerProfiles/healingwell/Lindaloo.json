    "Content": " I went for an ultrasound of my L breast after having two mammograms and the doctor now wants to send me for a PIM test.  He said there are only 65 of these machines in the US and he recommends this test rather than a biopsy.  I was wondering if anybody has had this test and what could I expect.  \n \n \nModerator Chronic Pain\n \n \n \n ",
