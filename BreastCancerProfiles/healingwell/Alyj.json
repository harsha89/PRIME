    "Content": " Hi, I'm here in this small town in England and I have the same situation of a call back after a mammogram and scan as some of the contributors. I feel so alone and find that I can't really talk about\n my fears because I have to be the strong one in my family. I am so scared about\n the waiting game, even though it's only a week. Just writing this has helped me to relax a little. ",
