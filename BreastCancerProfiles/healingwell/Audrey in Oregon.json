    "Content": " Hi Ladies,\nI have suffered from PMPS for probably about\n 5 years now.....but I just found out what it is YESTERDAY! All these years I've been freaked out that I was having a recurrence and that the cancer had spread to my bones. I've gone to see my oncologist periodically in a state of panic, and they've reassured me that it's neuropathy, but until I did a google search yesterday, no one has told me that this is common and, indeed a real syndrome. My pain is tolerable, compared to what I have read that some of you endure. Now that I can let go of my fear, I feel SO much better. I have had some relief with Gabapenten, and occasionally have to up my dose. \nI just think practitioners should let women know that this is a real syndrome, and that LIFE GOES ON and let go of your fears that this is a recurrence....
