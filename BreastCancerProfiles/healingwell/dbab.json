      "Content": " Looks like I am not out of the woods yet. The other day I noticed a red brown possibly blood discharge when I did a self exam on the right breast (the one that is suspicious), so I called my doc and she referred me to a general surgeon for a second opinion. I will pick up my films and meet with her on Tuesday. Can one have a bloody discharge and it be a benign condition?\n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks sylvie, I'm 31 and my doc said that I will start doing the mammograms when I'm 35. I am guessing that she doesn't think the mammogram is necessary right now since she has already felt the lump so I'm just going straight to the ultrasound or she may do the mammogram also depending on what the sonogram shows I'm thinking. \nThank you for the good luck, I'll take all I can get \n \n ",
