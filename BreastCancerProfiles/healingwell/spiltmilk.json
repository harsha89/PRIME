    "Content": " I recently, about\n 3 months ago had my yearly mamo. They found micro calcifications on my upper left breast. Did another more extensive mamo, then said that it looked ok, they were round. Come back in 6 months for another check. Recently, in the last month or so, I have had pain in my upper left breast area. Not all the time, it comes and goes. Sometimes a achy feeling, sometimes a burning. I am scheduled for a second opinion by a surgeon. Is it a good idea to go for a second opinion for this or am I just being silly and all women have breast pain??? I am 42, with a family history of breast cancer (mom and maternal grandmother).\nThanks for your opinion. ",
