I just looked in here tonight because I went with my wife yesterday for a breast biopsy. Path report due back tomorrow, but doc is sure it's cancer, though not life threatening.\nForgive me, but you husband is an idiot. My wife's family is full of heart problems but no BCa.

      "Content": " Krisha-\nSorry to respond so late. It's cancer. But, fortunately, caught early - it's about\n 1 cm in diameter and the cells are very well differentiated. Plan is for MRI, then lumpectomy and five sessions of brachytherapy (seeds).\nBTW - I've been seeing a therapist since I was diagnosed, and Carol sees her, too, occasionally. We were both there today and she (therapist) said what many others have said - that many times husbands just don't know how to deal with their wife's BCa. And so, I apologize to you and your husband. My only excuse is that with advancing age and cancer, I've become very rebarbative and curmudgeonly.\nI'm scheduled for first session of chemo this coming Monday. Infusion at 8 AM and then hourly blood draws for 10 hours.
