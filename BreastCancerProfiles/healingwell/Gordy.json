      "Content": " Krisha-\nI'm an advanced prostate cancer patient with incurable metastases and am well known on the PCa board. I just looked in here tonight because I went with my wife yesterday for a breast biopsy. Path report due back tomorrow, but doc is sure it's cancer, though not life threatening.\nForgive me, but you husband is an idiot. My wife's family is full of heart problems but no BCa. It can happen to anyone and we all have to be very aware, concerned and knowledgeable.\n-Les\n \n Dx PSA 26.5 Gleason 7 (4+3) @Age 61\n Start Casodex and Zoladex\nPSA drops to <0.01 \n 5 weeks of IMRT and then HDR brachy\n Rad Oncologist orders CT scan of pelvis \nbecause of complaints of pain in both thighs\nMRI confirms pain not caused by cancer BUT\n CT scan of pelvis picks up a nodule at bottom of left lung\n CT scan of lungs shows 1/2007 nodule has grown and \nthere are numerous nodules on both lungs.\n Thoracic surgeon removes wedge of left lung for biopsy\n Path report says 95% chance of metastatic PCa, but she's\nnever seen cells like this before.\n 2nd opinion at M.D. Anderson in Houston. \nThey confirm: mutated PCa, very rare, but seen there 2 or\n3 times.

A number of lung nodules have grown, but, more important to him, is the fact that the malignant lesion on my pelvis seems to have flared up and he wants me to start chemo.

      "Content": " Krisha-\nSorry to respond so late. It's cancer. But, fortunately, caught early - it's about\n 1 cm in diameter and the cells are very well differentiated. Plan is for MRI, then lumpectomy and five sessions of brachytherapy (seeds).\nBTW - I've been seeing a therapist since I was diagnosed, and Carol sees her, too, occasionally. We were both there today and she (therapist) said what many others have said - that many times husbands just don't know how to deal with their wife's BCa. And so, I apologize to you and your husband. My only excuse is that with advancing age and cancer, I've become very rebarbative and curmudgeonly.\nI'm scheduled for first session of chemo this coming Monday. Infusion at 8 AM and then hourly blood draws for 10 hours.
