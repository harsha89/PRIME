      "Content": " Well I had my diagnostic mammo ( 8 more views and being really squished} and us. Was told I needed a biopsy on both breasts. Was also told nurse would talk to me to go over radiologists findings and talk to me about\n biopsy. Turns out she left for the day and she would call me tomorrow {today} I did ask what birads I was and she said a 4. She said they already had in my chart that I had breast cancer which really through me for a loop. I said no I was never diagnosed and she removed it from my file. I am wondering who put that in there. The nurse did call me today and said I had to see a breast surgeon for consult and would have biopsies the next day. It is scheduled for March 19 and the 20th. It will be core biopsies. I asked her specifics from radiologist and she said she could not tell me. So I have no clue what those spots are though but us lady did say that they were solid and definitely not cysts. This waiting is all consuming. I am pretty good all day and only a few OMG moments but alone at night it hits like a ton of bricks. Any suggestions or advice? ",

      "Content": " Thx for the reply. Staying calm I am finding is not an option. Tuesday cannot come soon enough. I am feeling quite stupid because when they called me Thursday afternoon and said we can get you in first thing that next day Friday. I said no and then they said how about\n first thing Monday and I said no. I was worried about\n work being mad. So I opted for Tuesday afternoon. It did not dawn on me about\n the anxiety I would be feeling until then even more so with the urgency of them trying to get me in as soon as possible. So now I wait. I am also feeling the effects of not having anyone there with me. I went with my husband through all of it and I am not sure if this doesn't go right who will be with me. I do NOT do well with things like this when it is me. I do not even take Tylenol or cold meds. \nBut for now I wait.\nI am so sorry to hear about\n you losing your mom. My husband was told he was going for the cure and was even told he was in remission but was dead 2 months later. ",

I keep thinking of my kids if this doesn\u2019t go well. My 16 year old just got her first serious boyfriend and my 18 year old is going to be going to college in the fall. I just don\u2019t want them to have bad memories of this time. ",

      "Content": " I am new to this forum but I am quite scared. I got a call back from a digital and 3D mammo from 2/27. This was my first mammo and I just turned 50. They said I needed to come back in for a more bi-lateral views and a ultrasound and that the mammo part would take about\n an hour. Which is unreal to me because the initial one took maybe 15 minutes. I am nervous because I thought the 3D part would negate the need for unwarranted call backs for benign issues. I read the statistics and they all say not to worry and only about\n 1% is cancer found. That does not lessen the anxiety. Especially, I lost my husband 4 years ago due to lung cancer and I recognize the pattern with the docs.. Help and support will be greatly appreciated. THX ",

      "Content": " Post a reply \nWell tomorrow is the day I get my biopsies. Wish me luck. This is one test in my life I need to pass. (negative , I mean) I did have the consult with the breast surgeon and I must say I do feel better. She said that both masses are about\n 9MM and have characteristics for malignant and benign. She also said that if it is cancer that can easily remove them and have some chemo but no mastectomy. Which put me at ease. My lymphnodes are fine as well. So if it cancer, it is early. It was nice just to have someone explain things to me, answer questions I have and explain the process. To speak to you like a person and NOT a patient. She also showed me where they were and to feel them. Kind of odd but I never felt them. They were just random blips on a screen to me. I still have some anxiety but I guess that is normal. I should have the results Friday or at the latest Monday. Another long weekend I am guessing. She did tell me to stay away from Dr. Google and WebMD and to relax some. That they can get me through it. So again I wait. I will post ultrasound report tomorrow after biopsies ",
