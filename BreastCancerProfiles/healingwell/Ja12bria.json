      "Content": " Hi to everyone. I'm new to this forum so forgive me if I ramble a little.\nI too am experiencing burning in my left breast for maybe a week or so and it's getting progressively worst. I went in to see my primary care physicians for a fever I woke with on Monday this week and told him about\n the burning I'm having in my breast. He had the gynecologist examine me and she said its probably a pulled muscle. I scheduled my annual mammogram which I've have been putting off for months...now I have to go. I did tell the scheduler that I'm experiencing burning in my left breast so she made a note in the system. Hopefully I'll get to the bottom of this one way or the other.\nI think with lots of prayers asking for guidance and direction I'll be alright.\nThanks for listening:) ",
