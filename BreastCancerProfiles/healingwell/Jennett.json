      "Content": " I'm 67 y/o, been in menopause since I was 48. Had a lot of cysts during pre-menopausal years but now experiencing my first since my periods stopped. It's painful. I had the painful ones aspirated years ago, but now they say just wait and see. I don't understand the term \"complex\" that some of you are using. Mine has debris floating in it. Is that what the term means ? My breasts are dense from all the fibro tissue over the years, so it's always hard to get a good mammogram. I also have leukemia and hope to avoid a second cancer. ",

      "Content": " Hi, Ann. I've just experienced the same thing - mammogram, recheck, echo, and 2 fluid filled cysts. Mine aches all the time. Before menopause I had a lot of cysts, but this is the first I've had since entering menopause 17 years ago, thus my reason for concern. I do not take hormones. I DO however take vitamin, including a B-Complex supplement and extra Folic Acid and Biotin, and wonder if that is the cause. I'm going to have mine aspirated and hope they do not return. If you learn anything new about\n yours, please let us know. ",
