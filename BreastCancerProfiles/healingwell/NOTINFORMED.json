    "Content": " I just found this site. I am 3 years out on TAC, before chemo I had a full thick head of hair, now very thin, I have been trying a lot of different treatments to try to get some thickness back to my hair. I believe that we should all be informed that the hair loss might be permanent, and not told the customary \"it will grow back\" . Yes I am glad to be alive but I should have been able to make a more informed decision, I feel that the doctors made the decision for me and that is WRONG. ",
