Just updating and wondering if anyone is on Tykerb.  Last I talked to MK I was having some problems with tumor marker rising and alot of hip pain. Well, I have a new hip. Had a total hip replacement in March and it was amazing the pain was gone. Have had a few set back, life can't be with bumps. I got an infected port and it was total in my entire bloodstream by the time the doctors decided it really had something. I am starting Tykerb and Xeloda as soon as I get the all clear on the infection. My chemo stopped for the hip replacement so I have been off for about\n  5 months and my tumor marker has gone from 450 to 1200 so anxious to get it back in control.  I am curious if there is anyone else on Tykerb and Xeloda and if the side effects are managable. I think of you all often and would be glad to here how you are doing. Love, Cyndy \n ",

I went and saw my transplant doctor (had the stemcell transplant March of 1999 and would never have another) and he feels that my response is stable to the Navelbine so he is not for changing my chemo (Navelbene and Herceptin and Zometa). He did mention that GEmzar is his next choice. My local doctor will go with his recomendation (saw her today) I have have a hard time with my right hip where I have a tumor in the neck of the femor and have had it radiated (Nov 1998) Any how in January my foot broke(left) when I stood up after putting on my socks which caused me to do more weight baring on my \"bad\" hip. When I saw my stemcell doctor he x-ray it and I have arthritis and avascular necrosis in it. If it doesn't stablize they will consider a hip replacement which I don't even know if it is an option with all the bone involvement I have. To be determined at a later date (lol) And the icing on the cake, which I know for sure I have MK sympathies, I managed to get shingles in the midst of all this fun. Thank you all for all your prayers. Love Cyndy ",

I put them there and had quite a bit of pain in my shoulders and they wouldn't let me move them down because the test had already started. Rigged up some pillows to rest them on to take the pressure off the shoulders. I have made a mental note but I'm sure next time I'll put them right back up there. I got my results today. They made me wait to see the doctor before doing my treatment. Got a little anxious wondering if that meant they weren't going to do treatment but did get the regular after. The results were what they already pretty much new. Diffuse skeletal matastases. present at the angle of the right mandible, rt clavicle/shoulder, left shoulder/scapula, rt glenohumeral joint, rt scapula, several ribs, thoracolumbar spine, and pelvis. The liver and spleen appear enlarged and heterogeneous, along with prominent streak artifacting. the reminder of the study is normal. The doctor wasn't sure what the jargon with the spleen and liver meant but thought it was a postive that it didn't specifically say metastases. If anyone knows what it means would appreciate any comment. Thank you all again for being with me via PCE. I see my stem cell doctor tomorrow so if anyone is free...... Love you all, Cyndy ",

It does a number on my white and red counts so have shots every week. I hope that it is doing the same to the cancer cells. Tumor marker stablize for a short time but this week it was up some more. At some point I will probably breakdown and let them scan me to find out just where it is at. It's been a long time since any CT or MRI's have been done.

I decided my girls and my grandsons still needed me around to make cut out cookies ( I have not passed on the secrets yet) Thank you all for all your positive reinforcement and encouragement you give me when I'm feeling sorry for myself. (I have never been the strong one) I love you all. Also anybody that has had Navelbine I would appreciate any comments. I have not had any naseua but had the chemo sleep (sweatin, clammy, restless) little bit of off taste and the literature said one in ten will loss their hair. Thank again all of you.
