      "Content": " New member here, hopefully someone out there still responds since the last post has been a few months... A few weeks back my right breast started hurting (felt kind of like my toddler had stepped on my breast but she hadn't) so I did a self exam only to find a lump. I went in for a manual exam and was referred to another \nlocation that does digital mammography, which I completed last Wed (May 7th), today I received a call from my original doctor stating she had received her copy of the results and the 2nd doctor wants to \"keep an eye on it so go back for another digital mammography in 6 months\" she then added (and I quote word for word) \"and we are going to have to need you to go see a surgeon. Do you have a surgeon in mind? Can I make you an appointment with one we use?\".... I'm obviously worried about\n what's going on here when she jumbles her words using words like \"have to\" making it sound very important non-negotiable but then saying \"need\" like it's a preference but not necessary. (or maybe I'm just over thinking that out of terror)... Either way since I had a digital mammogram where they took 6-8 pictures of the one breast should I be over concerned about\n the request to see a surgeon or is that just protocol? I have a family history of breast cancer so it only adds to the panic... any help is greatly appreciated. ",

      "Content": " My Anxiety Life: I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers as well.\n I don't understand todays health care providers AT ALL they never seem to want to follow-up with you on important matters but then get upset if you make an appointment to follow-up on something they should have contacted you for in the first place. Their logic, \"a sick person could have used that appointment\", that's IF you can even manage to get an appointment at all. Then when/if you do they don't put any work into helping you at all, that or you end up getting stuck with emergency room bills when a doctor wont see you in a timely manner and you go to the er only to have insurance deem it \"non-emergency\" and refuse to pay.\n Point and case for me personally: I was having massive headaches, involuntary muscle twitching/spasms, and sharp electrifying sensations going down my face/legs. The doctor said \"migraines\" and handed me a script\n for seizure medication saying that it will help with the headaches. He never did any type of brain scans to make sure there wasn't anything serious or anything. Flash forward a month in to the medication the electric impulses, muscle twitching/spasms, and now(at the time) my arms and legs shake violently when I lay down. If those weren't bad enough I was riding down the road one day and next thing I know I wake up confused and everything around me is a blur, my husband explains that I just fell over on him and was twitching, I had a seizure for the first time in my entire life (and the last thank God)! Needless to say I stopped that medication and now am much better... Then came the recent events: I called my doctor at the end of March with a nasty case of food poison, and they said the earliest appointment was May 13th, I explained I had food poison and couldn't keep anything down for 10 days straight and she said \"oh well I guess that wont work, I tell you what give me your number and I will call you if an appointment comes up.\" needless to say that day never came.\nSo then came the day I found the lump: first thought in my head, aside from please don't let it be cancer, was what am I suppose to do now? My doctor has a waiting list of months out, but I've always heard come in IMMEDITELY if you find a lump and have a family history. Then there is the voice in the back of my mind screaming \"he gave you medication for seizures that caused a seizure, when you have no history of seizures!\" So what do I do? Where do I go?... I called around to every facility that is known for conducting exams only to be told \"you need a referral\", \"sorry we aren't taking new patents\", or \"we can get you in x amount of months from now\". In the end I went to the health department which has now became an adventure of itself. Now the \"real\" facilities look at me like I'm some criminal or low-life druggie because I went to the health department instead of \" a real doctor\".(Note: I don't think that people who go to the health department have to be either of those things, it seems to be society's way of thinking now days though, or at least in my area it is) I actually had someone looking at the referral asking me who is the \"real doctor\", not the one that wrote the referral from the health department, but a \"real\" doctor.. I must have looked at her like she was insane or something because she responded with a look of shock and the quickly said \"I mean who is your normal physician\". \n Seriously, you have a referral in your hand with a doctors signature stating there is a lump, but they ask you who's the real doctor. \n Does that mean the men and women who work for the health departments trying to help low income families or those in need aren't considered real doctors any more just because they work essentially \"for free\" because they get government funding instead of health insurance from a patent? \n \nI think common sense has evaded so many people today! It's sad that you can't get help when needed but if can manage to find some where willing to help your frowned upon because it's the less desired facility. \nI think I have droned on enough, and I apologize for the rant, it's just nice to be able to vent it all out. I know how it feels not wanting to bother your loved ones with your stresses, it seems like they can only be so sympathetic before you wonder if they are getting feed up with hearing your problems.. At least that's how I feel... Also I try not to bother my husband because he has enough on his plate being the sole provider in our home and still living with the affects of his former career (US Army, combat veteran). ",
