    "Content": " I am 32 years old and i am currently wearing a bra between a 38h and a 36j. I wore a minimizing tank top about\n 4 days ago. When I finally took it and my bra off at the end of the day I notice that I was experiencing sharp pains in the right side of my right breast. I soon learned that the pain would only go away if I either was wearing a bra or was holding my breast in the same spot that I bra would. The pain has been constant for the last 4 days every time I take my bra off do you have any ideas on what could have caused this? ",
