      "Content": " hi there this is my very first time on here or any other forums so please be kind,i am just over the big 40 and a few months ago I woke up to find my right breast to be swollen red I was surprised that it was like this anyway I waited for a month or so b4 I went to see the doctor I had a lump and it felt hard but no pain so as the time went on it got bigger so I did go see my gp she said it is more likely to be a cyst but I should be seen within 2 weeks I was seen 2 weeks later I had a mammogram done and scan when I was having my scan done the lady said I would just like the doctor to see this b4 you go and see the consultant upstairs anyway she came out and told me to go upstairs to see to doctor so I sat waiting it was the end of the day and I was the last one to see him he told me that it was a cyst and the I was fine I was soÂ happy that it wasn't the c word I never asked anything about\n it and plus I was rush out of the door.",
