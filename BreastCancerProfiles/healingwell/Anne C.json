I sorta thought it was the same thing. And why do Drs track them if it might not mean anything?\nDo the numbers themselves mean something or just the going up and/or down?\nAlso, I have realized that no matter what happens that Jesus is still with me and I don't have to fret over everything! \nSo I'm trying to rest in Him and stay at peace, as much as possible. Some days are better than others.\n(BTW.....I found out that I will have another grandchild born in Sept.....my oldest son's first child. I will then have 3 grandchildren and 2 step-grandchildren. That's exciting!)\nThanks! ",
