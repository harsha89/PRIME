    "Content": " Hi\nI am also 3 yr survivor this June. But in last month I have had swelling in my lelft arm, hand. Fingers feel numb. I had a DOPPLER SCAN done today. I do have lymphedema Onc. told me. Now he wants me to get another PET SCAN done May 16th, I just had one done few months back. I just found out last 2 scans had SOME abnormalites some suspicious areas. BUT I didnt know about\n them few months back, THey thought it was just from my surgery (Mast.and REconstruction) I had stage II Breast Cancer. IS he ordering this BECAUSE of the swelling? (Lymphedema) What exactly does ABNORMAL mean? Is it possible for cancer to come back at the same area?? SOrry for all questions, just bit upsetting at moment ",
