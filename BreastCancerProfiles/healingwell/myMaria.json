      "Content": " colorado mom,\nmy wife was diagnosed with stage iv back in Dec. 07 (age 39). she was 20-weeks pregnant with our (now healthy) daughter at the time and doctors initially planned only to keep her alive until she reached 32-weeks, if possible. \nshe had mets in spine, liver, ribs, brain... she has been getting regular PET, CT, MRIs (every couple of months) since. All have been negative since spring of 08. She also gets regular blood tests of CA 27.29, Arimidex daily (Ovaries were removed during c-section), aredia monthly to repair bone (also has anti-cancer activity), and she has been doing very well until recently. minor set back, discovered carcinoma in situ in left breast (origin of cancer) and cells in a couple of her lymph nodes. mastectomy of left and under-going recon. \nin addition, my wife's vision was also affected and she has double-vision due to nerve damage, but corrected with prism glasses. she also had a collapse vertebra and though reinforced with kyphoplasty, she still suffers from uncomfortable and chronic back pain, so she is also on painkillers.\nanyway, she has been doing well and the medical community has been very impressed and amazed at her recovery and current status. her oncologist has decided not to resume chemo and feels that current course will be fine for now. don't want complications of chemo to affect other concerns such as optical nerves, etc. if needed, can always go to chemo... i was concerned about\n this change from chemo to no chemo, but as often and as well as she is being monitored, i feel a little at ease with the decision. she would have been given Taxotere, which is known to cause nerve damage. \nit helps that her oncologist is one of the most celebrated and known in the region :)\nin short, my wife is doing well.

      "Content": " suzieq855,\ni am sorry for your cancer, but you certainly have an attitude that will help you through! btw, i think it sucks when family are unable or unwilling to be supportive. i had to go through it when my wife was diagnosed (her side of the family, that is). my wife's family live in the same metroplex, but i couldn't and didn't rely on them...\nbeing on a forum like this can be very therapeutic and comforting. hold on and continue being strong!\nmoving to florida? how will this affect your health insurance and/or current treatment plan?
