      "Content": " Thanks Bev,\nI am concerned that it maybe something else only because my original breast cancer was mis diagnosed by Ultra Sound as being an infection and having fluid, if it wasn't for me insisting on a biopsy who knows where I would be today, so maybe it is just my need to put my health into my own hands that I may insist once again on a biopsy (may as well keep them busy).\nThanks for the hugs I am throwing some back your way and I really appreciate you making the effort to reply to my post.\nHope you are doing well.
