      "Content": " Good New!!!! I just got results of biopsies. NO CANCER. Thank you so much for your support and prayers. \nprof- I see we take alot of the same medicines. How are you doing with the Crohn's disease. I've been on so many meds trying to get this under control. The Imuran alone didn't do it. So the doctor, just last week, suggested going on the one entocort a day. So far so good. I'm glad you're finished with radiation. I went through that and was so happy when it was over. Hope you're having good days.\nMeds:  Asacol 2 tablets 3x a day\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Telling myself that this is probably nothing and then 5 minutes later I'm thinking the worse and a nervous wreck. I've been keeping busy to keep my mine off it. My house has never been so clean.

      "Content": " Hi,  I had breast cancer in 2005.  It was in very small and in a duct.  I had a lumpectomy and radiation.  I go for a mammogram every 6 months.  I went three days ago and the nurse came out and said they wanted to do an ultra sound.  I didn't like that.  After the ultra sound they said they see two spots in the same breast where I had the cancer and now want biopsies.  I go tomorrow for that.  I am so scared.  I take arimedex and I thought that would keep me from getting breast cancer again.  If it was one spot I could say that maybe it's nothing, but two spots.  I pray I don't have this back again.  Support and prayers would be greatly appreciated.  Arlene\nMeds:  Asacol 2 tablets 3x a day\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Doc didn't think it was shingles because there is no rash. The pain is severe. I was taking darvocet and he switched me to percocet. Has me feeling real loopy and fuzzy. Don't like this feeling. I really think that when they did the biopsies they hit a nerve. Hope this doesn't take too long to heal. The med is making me want to vomit.

      "Content": " Hi,    I went through breast cancer 3 years ago.  I just had a mammogram 12 days ago and they found 2 spots on my left breast that I had biopsied.  Thank God they were benign.  Since the biopsies I have this awful pain in my back, the same side as the biopsies.   The pain is constant and in one spot in my back.   I called the Women's Center and they had me come in to check the area.  All looked good.  They sent me to see my primary doc.  He thought maybe shingles, but I have no rash.  He put me on darvocet for the pain.  He said if it doesn't go away in a couple of weeks I should call him.  I've put the heating pad on it, I tried ice packs.  Nothing seems to help.  Anyone else have this kind of pain.   \nMeds:  Asacol 2 tablets 3x a day\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
