      "Content": " Just have to vent before I break down and ball in front of my kids. I am still in the \"wait\" mode as far as when my surgery is. Waiting to hear from insurance and I see plastic surgeon on Monday. Cant decide on whether to do just the lumpectomy that my surgeon says would \"probably\" be ok or the mast that my onc recommends. Can't decide which form of reconstruction yet. Pretty much have read everything to read on each but wow what alot of info. Trying so hard to keep things \"normal\" here and trying to prepare my house for while i am out of commission. With 4 kids at home its rough. My 18 yr old will talk about it but she's a typical teenager and justs hopes this wont interfere with her life. I don't mean that in a bad way, its just that I was a teen when my mother was sick and I understand what she feels. My 12 yr old wont even talk to me about it. My 10 yr old is just scared and is acting out. My 5 yr old doesn't even know i am sick but i can tell he knows something is different because he's been so cuddly lately. My husband is great but bless his heart, he wont read any info I have and is so sure that this will be fine. I hope for that too but poor thing, he didn't even realize that mastectomy meant taking the entire breast until last night. I was dx on Dec.7. He thought somehow they would save the exterior of mine and my nipple and just put something underneath it. Well, thanks for letting me vent. You ladies are the only ones who know what i am feeling and I could sure use a hug.\n ",

Having quite a bit of pain but I am managing it well. Thanks to all of you for your encouragement. I have expanders so me and my lovely drains will be going to Nashville every week for a while. Going to do a round of chemo in about a month. About how long will I have these drains? My family is being wonderful and people have brought more food than we will ever be able to eat but at least I don't have to worry about cooking. More news later...........Sherry ",

      "Content": " Thanks so much for your support. Right now, I am just trying to keep things as normal as possible and trying to stay busy. I have given my kids (according to their age), bits of information just to let them know something. I was 12 when my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer and I know that kids pick up on things and leaving them in the dark is not fair. I will not use the word cancer until it is diagnosed as such. My way of coping is I am preparing myself for the worst and hoping for the best. My husband is wonderfully supportive (although in a little denial) and I have alot of family but sometimes you can't vent what you are really feeling. They don't want to hear that my gut instinct says I have cancer. I know that attitude is half the battle and I have alot to fight for.

      "Content": " Thank you all for your words of encouragement the other day when I was having a meltdown. I'm much better now. I finally have the date of my surgery. January 19 I will have a bilateral mast with lap dorsi flap and tissue expanders. I know I will be somewhat uncomfortable for a while but just having the \"plan\" gives me something to prepare for. They tell me this is an overnight stay. I have good feelings about that and bad. The good is I won't be away from my kids to long and the bad is I might not be away quite long enough lol. I don't mean that the way it sounds but I have a tendency to overdo and cater to those around me. Anyway thanks again and I will keep you posted.\n \n ",

I'm sure stress is the cause but i know the importance of eating especially now but with no appetite and the thought of food makes me nauseas. I have lost 14 pounds and today the lightheadedness and weakness set in . A friend of mine sells this product from Lifesource call Body Balance. It is a liquid whole food supplement. (checked with drs. completely safe). So I tried that and was able to get up and do a few things. I think I am trying to be so strong and upbeat for my family that I am not paying attention to the terror going on inside me. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

I went for my mammo and they set me up with a surgeon that very day but only because I told them that i wanted to be seen NOW. I am not usually that aggressive but it paid off. Mammo was on Wed am and surgeon was that afternoon and biopsy was Friday. i get results today.\nPlease keep posting like i am even though i do not have a diagnosis yet but it has made the waiting bearable. It seems i have become obsessed with this disease and want to talk. Family and friends are wonderful but they can't relate and they don't want to talk about it until they know its there sometimes not even then.\nI am so sorry you may be facing this with the situation you are in. But there is help out there and even if i find out i don't have cancer, I will be checking in on you here.......Keep posting..............Sherry ",

And she verified that i will be going through some chemo because of my age. It scared me at first but at least finally said what i needed instead of \"its your decision\". Even though I know it is still my decision sometimes theres just too many decisions to make. I don't have the medical degree they do so I'm going to trust them. She also said I could have immediate reconstruction.  Perky breast and tummy tuck doesn't sound too bad after 3 kids lol. Check back with you soon....Sherry ",

They found a 3cm \"spiculated\"? lesion and clusters of microcalcifications and to top it all off suspicious lymph nodes the film. Needless to say i was a wreck when the radiologist sent me directly to my dr and two days later had a biopsy which was Friday. I am supposed to get results Tuesday.\n \n ",
