      "Content": " Bev, thanks so much for your response (and for your note about\n my remission...I truly feel wonderful right now and am so thankful to be in remission). \nI don't know about\n the margins...she went in for a biopsy last week and from what I understand, they took the entire lump out by taking a lot of biopsies. Would they be able to determine anything about\n the margins from biopsies, or would a lumpectomy have been the only way to do that? \nI think that she's leaning towards the mastectomy right now. \nI've given her the info about\n healing well and a link to this post, so I hope she's reading. If so, hi to my mother in law and ((hugs)). I hope she'll join. The UC forum helped me tremendously when I was diagnosed.\n \n \n \n ",
