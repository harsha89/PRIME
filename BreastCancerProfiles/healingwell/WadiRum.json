    "Content": " Hi,\nThis is my second year taking Tamoxifen. I experienced hot flashes, memory loss and weight gain (a few kg). The weight gain is definitely because of the Tamoxifen since in the last 20 years I had constant weight, plus or minus 1-2 kg. I am 44 and exercise 3 times a week (weight lifting and aerobics). \nTo fight the side effects of the Tamoxifen I also discussed with a naturopath specialized in women\u2019s health issues (Dr. Kristy Lewis, Ottawa). She recommended several supplements, which I now take: DIM, Inflamatrix, ACES+Zinc and Probiotic. Both my oncologist and my radiologist rather smiled when I mentioned the subject but I did not mind. \nI also did acupuncture for one year, before surgery and during radiation. I did not need to do chemo. I met women who did chemo and I found incredible that for chemo they were prescribed more pills (for nausea) rather than being encouraged to at least try acupuncture (in parallel with the chemo). I strongly believe that the accupuncture solves the nausea and the lack of energy (I know two women who had breast cancer and one ovarian who did chemo with accupuncture). And, if anyone has any fear of the needles, don't. There is zero pain. \nI did not continue with the accupuncture because I am too busy and the hot flashes are not so bad. But I think that the accupuncture would also help with severe hot flashes. Good luck.\n \n ",
