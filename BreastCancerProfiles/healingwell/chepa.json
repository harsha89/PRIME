    "Content": " Thank you for all your comments about\n the side effects of femara on sex drive. I have been on femara since April of 2011.  I have no desire for sex.  My private parts bleed and are chaffed.  I cannot sleep well.  I have gained weight and my joints hurt all the time.  My oncologist says that I have vaginal atrophy but I know it has been caused by the femara.  Thank god for an understanding partner but I worry that this is hurting our relationship.  Your comments helped me see that this is not just in my head.  ",
