    "Content": " just finished watching a movie called 50/50 and i never cried so hard for a reason that i can relate to the movie is about\n cancer wchich i dont have but i do have lots of health problems i recently had my colon removed and surgries that followed up! this movie made me realize so much about\n life 1 that we/you are NOT the only one affected by a dissase when diagnosed , 2 you HAVE to continie to live until your heart stops beating! 3,it okay to be doubtful and okay to be optimistic thats why we have feelings. and alot more stuff one part in the movie that made me cry was when he started going under anestisa not knowing if he will wake up alive! when i went under for my 1st surgery i was scared and i cried my self to sleep scariest thing ever its like crying before you die! its scary but i knew when i woke up my body would be diffrent i would have scars and a ostomybag. im only 18 (17 at the time) why wouldi want a scar i still like running around half naked lol! anyway thelast major surgery i had i was cracking jokes and just didnt want to shutupp but i went under with a sence of HAPPINES and COMFORT that things are going to be ok ...its just the way i felt and THAT was the best feeling + the drugs they give you :) i know this fourm is for people with cancer and i am writing this to say it may be ok and it may not be ok but whatever happens will happpen live life to the fullest and be healthy but dont over do it eating healthy 24/7....drinking tea or somthin because you heard.....  isnt going to keep your heart beating for ever the guy and the movie spoke to his counsler and said im goona die and im ok ....but your gonna die to one day! SO TRUE just think you live your life as best you can and you walk outside and get hit by a car ...how did drinking tea help????  it definetly didnt things will happen on its own terms its up to you to make living life good :) ..... i hope everyone who reads this finds a spot of optimis and a place of reality :) -Jackie\nUC for 6 1/2 years \nhad colon removed Oct.10,2011 a laproscopic incession w/ ileo loop (2 surgeries in 1) , temp. stoma named mr. wiggles.
