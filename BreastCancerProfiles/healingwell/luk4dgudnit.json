    "Content": " Hello Englishtea,\nYou should ask for a needle biopsy if that will comfort you. Stress can make it worse if its more than just a cyst. Doctors tampered with my left breast and removed cysts/lumps on four occasions and my breast is still sore now after three years. I sometimes want to cut it off myself and call it a day. But, I do believe if the cysts were alarming to the physicians they would tell you. Sometimes those cysts could be fibrous breast tissue at least that what they told me. I know there may not be any concrete proof out there but I stopped drinking any soda, eating chocolate/caffeine and the cyst have been absent for the last three years. It can be scary but worrying or stressing can definitely make it worse. My prayers are with you!\nluv4myself&people ",
