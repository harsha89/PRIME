Now it is over with all medicines and I feel unprotected. I would like to hear experience also of stopping zoladex and tamoxifen. Does it get back to normal with weight, sexuality etc. ",

      "Content": " Hi! In Sweden we get a free course in makeup(and makeupthings in present)and also how to make a nice turban when you loose your hair. It was very helpfull and since I already had lost my hair I could give advice to the others where to find nice turbans and how to make it look really like your in the latest fashion. If you put on eyeliner and paint eyebrows softly and a little eyeshadow people have to come really close tio see that you lost it all and it's fake. I had so many complements of my turbans and that I looked so nice that I never ever put on the wig that I had tried out. After the chemo and the raditation all came back very quickly. First the eyebrows and the eyelashes and slowly the hair. In two month the hair was back and stronger the ever. I found out that short hair suites me better then long. Since then I have short haircuts. Keep struggling it is not as bad when you see everything in the backmirror. Good luck! ",
