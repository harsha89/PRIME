      "Content": " Thank you both very much for the response. She is ER/PR + and HER - Neg, which the Doctors say is a good thing. Found a good doctor who does not believe it is a death sentence in the city and says ladies live with this for a long time - I think we're going to go for a partial mastectomy w/axillary dissection and oophorectomy since no menapause yet. Have you had this? Any suggestions for a helpful recovery? Also, is Chemo just one kind or are there many kinds with different drugs? Are there many women you know who survive a long time with Stage IV/I am not sure if there are alot of people who have this or not. Thanks for all of the answers and support!! ",
