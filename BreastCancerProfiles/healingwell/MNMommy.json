    "Content": " I just went through all of this TODAY! Complex cyst with debris after a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. the radiologist immediately aspirated the lump -- (brown liquid by the way) and it's on its way for testing just in case. in the dr's words...\"he's drained hundreds of cysts and none has ever been cancerous\" but as we all know -- there's a very first time for everything. oh, and i asked him what was this \"debris\" in my fluid...he explained it was probably just protein which is very normal. due to the size of my cyst (small walnut) - i really had no choice but to get it removed/drained. results should be back in 4 to5 days. i hope this helps?? at least someone!! \n ",
