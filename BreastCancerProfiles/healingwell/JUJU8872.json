      "Content": " Good Grief, how you ladies make me think. I sat at the funeral of my childhood friend (since I was 11 y.o. ) on Thursday, the day that my GYN called me for a f/u on my mammo. Marion died of Alzheimers at the age of 57. I cried because I had not seen her through the last two years of her life. Now today, for the first time I realize that I have had no one to go through this with me. During my treatment I was estranged from my family, and as much as I love them, I still do not let them know anything that goes on -- ANYTHING. I sit here now in my chair, on the computer that I could not teach Marion how to use 10 years ago -- and back then I could not understand why -- and I am tearing up realizing that not only did she not shared this experience with me, I did not share the last two years of her life with her -- those years when her family needed me most, and I was not there. Friends are precious and we need to recognize the sacrifices they make for us during these times. For those of us who have someone left to thank, let us do so -- especially this week!\nJudy ",

All arm, etc hair fell out as well. At that time, my meager hair regrowth fell out, too. Fuzzy hair tried to regrow 2/3 times before it finally started to come in. Finished Taxol in Mid June, had the beginnings of a \"five o'clock\" shadow by end of August, and went without wig by 1st week in November.  Everyone is different, but this will give you some perspective. Lots of luck. (By the way, lashes and brows came and went for a year after I finished treatment!!!)\n ",

After two years, though, they seem to be coming back and she may be going through menopause. No hair loss at all with either of us or my sister who used your drug 10 years ago. This is ust info for you. As for dry eyes, I have a problem, but no real prescript\nion needed, just over the counter. \n \n ",

Maybe I can give you some information. First, breast cancer almost never \"hurts\", but that is not always the case. Second, most lumps are benign, so please rest easy until you investigate further. I urge you to make an appointment with your doctor right away. While you are very young, you do have a history in you family. Some other ladies will sign in soon with other words of comfort and advice, but they  will and I do urge you to call your doctor tomorrow and make an appointment. Tell your the office that  the lump has been there for a while. Then, go to the appointment, and let us know what is going on. \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Kathy. I thought it was \"ringing\" too, but after searching the internet, I understand that it can also be a buzz, hum or chirp. Other than this, I am doing very well on my Arimidex, and if Arimidex is the cause of this problem, I do not intend to stop it until I am told to do so. I'll live with the chirp. \nTo continue on a personal note, breast reconstruction begins for me next Friday with the insertion of a chest expander. It will be outpatient. Then about\n eight weeks later, after 6 weekly \"fillings\", I will get the permanent implant along with the lat muscle movement. Then after things \"settle down\" my PS will do a \"match\". He believes this is the process that will give me the best outcome. If I fail to \"fill\" because my chest tissue can not expand, then I'll get the expander removed, and he will do the full lat flap with implant. He believes that I will \"fill\".\nI hope all is well with you and your family. Had a great Holiday here in Birmingham. I'll let you know how all this surgery goes in about\n ten days or so.\nJudy ",

In August that year, I visited an ENT because of pain along the jaw line and sever pain in ear. It seems my ear had bledd and leaked onto the eardrum. He cleaned it out, gave me drops for extremely dry ears and mentioned that I might have \"referrential pain\" from rads that went up to the collar bone. Don't know for sure. I do not know when tinnitus started. I live in the South in a heavily wooded neighborhood and thought for a long time that I had lots of crickets and secadas in my neighborhood. Even though \"they\" persisted through the winter, I excused it because of mild winters. Eventually last winter I noticed that I heard the \"crickets and secadas\" everywhere -- Not just at home. Current ENT does not have any treatment, and I believe virtually all tinnitus is permanent. My ENT says that my tinnitus is due to a very slight, high range hearing loss. I have seen the graphs and believe me, it is minimal. For my age I have great hearing.\n \n \n ",

As for the doctor, he has written me a letter giving reasons for his charges. Can you believe that I did not know that I could not lift my arm above my head? I guess I  had just adjusted to this part of my life. Anyway, I am in physical therapy now to help with this and am looking forward to doing the mastopexy sp???? shortly after June 15th. I do have an out of pocket maximum, but it is for \"eligible charges\" only. I am approaching this so the 20% will eventually go away. However, right now, I believe the devious insurance company is plotting to see how little they can pay on the rest of my claims so that I have to pay more.  HA! HA! HA! \n \n \n ",

If all else fails, get with the Komen organization for a mammogram. (I paid for mine for 3 years  because my old insurance did not include my breast center in its coverage -- I live in South and it was only $196 for mammo,  $96 for doctor visit. I bet you could even make payments). You did not say if anything had changed since your last mammo. All this worry may be for nothing but trust me it is much less expensive treatment if it is caught earlier than later. I know. I did not have mammo for 3 years so my cancer was caught much later so I  had to have 2 rounds of chemo and then radiation.  Just because you are unable to pay does not mean that you can't get treatment.\n \n ",

According to old PS, a PS was sued recently for trying implants with a radiated mastectomy area.  For this reason, old PS says that PS's are being very careful using the implants as well as the LD procedure coupled with implants. \n \n \n ",

Your doctor will tell you what you need to know, but you will need to write down the answers so you can remember what he says.

Also, surgeon will not know your course of treatment until after a full pathology report comes in following surgery.

My family history is full of bc women, and when I was diagnosed, they still did not react the way I wanted them to. So, Krisha, don't worry about\n this lack of \"caring\". It is just part of what you are going through. If you and Chrone are actually diagnosed, there will be other feelings and family reactions, so let's just keep first things first and get through the rechecks, and by the way, don't either of you forget to ask for a copy of your reports to keep FOREVER.\nJudy ",

For a Stage II, they might try one of those new lab tests to see if she will benefit from chemo.

That really did seem like a long time, but as far as having chemo and then surgery, this is one treatment that several of these ladies here on the board have gone through. There seems to be a Plan of Care depending upon the BC at presentation and as I recall, one of the criteria for chemo first is to reduce size of the tumor. I am sure that there are others. So, to calm your fears, yes, this treatment plan is quite normal and the chemo will help lots with this disease. I personally did surgery, 2 chemos and radiation in that order.

When I was diagnosed in December 2004, my teaching hospital, University of Alabama Birmingham, would not do reconstruction of any type since I had to have rads. I had to wait for six months after rad treatment. Isn't it strange how times have changed in just 3 1/2 years. Yes, both PS I have seen are board certified, my fav is the first at his teaching hospital trained to do the new silicon implants. I'll probably be seeing him an a couple of months to see just where I am. I can change insurances in January. My daughter opted for a double mastectomy in February 2007 and she too complained about\n the temporary expanders. Loves her new silicon breast implants, though. She did not have to have chemo or rads. \nThanks,\nJudy ",

      "Content": " Hi, Karen. \nI have not yet had reconstruction, but my DSIL is a plastic surgeon. There is a dirty little secret out there that most of us do not know about\n breast reconstruction. OUR INSURANCES PAY VERY LITTLE FOR BREAST RECONSTRUCTION!!!!!!!! When you start talking about\n DIEP or SIEP (micro surgeries) VS tram you are talking about\n major time differences. I am sorry to say that with what plastic surgeons are compensated for these reconstructions, most prefer the tram or even the free flap (not quite micro surgery) verses the longer DIEP or SEIP surgeries. PS's just can't seem to convince insurances to pay more for these better but more costly, time consuming surgeries. If I have one, and I say if because my insurance does not use the plastic surgeon I have chosen, I will have either the tram or the free. To my knowledge, no one in this town does the micros on a regular basis because of this compensation problem. The metro area here is over 1,000,000 people. Most do free or tram. \nJudy ",

I do not know if this is because I chose to go a wild and crazy \"bleach blonde short, short do\" back in January. As far as for growth, I don't really know how much has grown out since I have had it cut 4 times since November. I would say it is about\n 2 inches, especially around the neckline -- don't want those dark roots to show too quickly!! Katt, try getting a regular \"trim\" to see if that will encourage growth of your hair. By the way mine is just as thick as before, and I am hoping that this trim I got yesterday got the last of the curl.\n \n \n ",

Just settle down, sit back, take deep breaths and relax as best you can. That \"catching\" is probably not anything, just an indication of nerves. It sounds like you have a great doc and it is important that you are having the mammo so soon and you should insist that you get the other tests soon if they are indicated.

I had the IHC first - everyone does because this is the cheapest test and only 25% of bc patients test positive for HER2. It was +++ so I volunteered for a Herceptin study which required a FISH test in order to qualify. I did not qualify for the Herceptin study because my FISH did not show that I had \"gene replication\". So be sure to ask what a positive FISH means because I believe it is positive if it finds the aberant gene replicating itself way too much. Oh, and my first med onc said that approx 10% of the IHC's who tested at +++ are actually negative for gene replication.\n \n ",

No one mentioned any tumor or lymph node on either reading -- just the bone injuries and in 2004 reading a possible rotator cuff injury and a torn muscle in the back - neither are yet fixed. I did not get mammo in 2003 because of the pain I was in, and I believe I just waited too long -- until the next cycle in Nov 2004. Regardless, nothing showed on the Nov 2004 MRI either. I, too, do not know what your MRI reading means, but get to the DR asap -- mostly to set your mind at ease. \nJudy ",

And as an FYI, I remember getting angry when people would tell me to cheer up I only had 8 more months of treatment, six more months of treatment, etc. And please do not tell her \"Before you know it, it'll all be over.\" I believe the best way to get through this is to practice one of Dale Carnegie's philosophies \" Handle everything in bite size pieces, live in day-tight compartments\". In other words, when she is discouraged about\n her treatment, encourage her to look positively towards the end of the \"bad day\" or the \"extremely long week\" -- . Encourage her to look at the small picture, not the big one, and she might not get as depressed as some of us do. Oh, and please remember in conversations to TALK TO HER and not to talk about\n her cancer.\nOh my gosh, I have rambled here, and I hope you understand what I meant. \nJudy ",

      "Content": " Hi, Dorri. I had a sentinel node biopsy with 3 showing positive, so they continued with the axillary resection (I think that is what it is called). When all was over, a total of 14 nodes were found in the breast and surrounding tissue with 5 positive nodes. I had 2 rounds of chemo therapy and 7 weeks of radiation. The path report dictates what treatment is done, so I recommend you get your MIL to ask for a copy of the path report. My onc surgeon told me that 4 positive nodes and above required the 7 weeks of radiation; that this was the \"standard of care\" for positive nodes. She also told me that she \"hoped\" I had another node positive because she really wanted me to get the radiation therapy. As it turned out, I did. It has been 15 months since my surgery. Had a clear mammo in November, and no, positive nodes does not necessarily mean a bad outcome -- just means that you will probably get more treatment. Get that report and start from there.\nJudy ",

I also had 5 positive nodes, so they did a large field for me. It got a little of my neck and from sternum to beneath the arm along the whole rib cage. As you said, they are trying to get any nodes or tiny cells missed. \nI did have some slight problems towards the end with a sore throat and some pain in my ear, but all was managable with aleve. Throat went away and ear pain comes and goes but not as much as before. I believe I have a little nerve damage there.\nBefore you know it, it will all be over, and you'll be back to normal - whatever that now may be.\nJudy ",

My tumor was just below the nipple and that surgeon decided to cut a wedge from the nipple because a needle biopsy would likely shoot through the tumor since it was so close to the skin. (Final report said tumor extended to but not through the epithelium). I had to wait 4 weeks after the biopsy for the surgery. My first surgical oncologist said I could wait from December 1 until Feb 20 for surgery since my biopsy diagnosis was mucin carcinoma. Ha-Ha what a joke -- \"Infiltrating mammary carcinoma\".\nI have always been concerned about\n \"spreading the disease\" after that \"cutting\" biopsy, even though my plastic surgeon, who saw me through those treacherous 4 weeks, assured me that cancer does not spread that quickly.\nStill, I wonder.\nJudy ",

      "Content": " Chantry, when you hav 4 or more positive nodes, you must have radiation -- at least that is the standard of care in the US. Also, breast cancer spreading outside the tumor to the nodes means that there is more risk of other organs involved or cancer cells wandering throughout your body looking for a place to affect. I, too, had an agressive tumor, but as my med oncologist said, my risk for recurrence was greatest because of 5 positive nodes. \nI think it is great that you have done genetic testing. My onc would like for me to do this since 5 women in 3 generations of my family have had breast cancer. However, only one had breast cancer prior to 50 years old, so I really don't think testing is necessary. One more family diagnosis, though, and I will reconsider. After rads, I now take Arimidex with no symptoms but a head pain maybe once every month or two (I think it's when I take it on an empty stomacy). I guess we will all just have to make our individual decisions about\n treatment and learn how to cope with stressing about\n recurrence. I am sure your anxiety is much greater than mine since you are so young and have a baby. \nJudy\n \n ",

Before I knew much at all about\n my disease, I had already decided on a mast for 2 reasons: first, my family history was such that I had decided a long time ago that given the choice, I would opt for a mast. Also, I with a lumpectomy, one must undergo radiation therapy -- no choice. There was a chance I would have chemo only if the disease was caught early enough. However, I had to undergo radiation anyway -- 5 positive nodes. Regardless, I believe I made the right decision based on the information I had before surgery.\nGood Luck with the surgery. We'll be behind you all the way. You seem to have a great surgeon, as I did.\nJudy ",

I am glad I did not because I am had a lot of styes during treatment and that could have really caused infection problems. I bought a liquid eyeliner and a much lighter eyebrow pencil for my brows. When I lost all brows, I got a brow stencil from Sally's Beauty Supply. It helped.\nI was without lashes and brows for approx 4 months.  Now they are going again, but I decided today that I would look at this positively. Chemo kills rapidly dividing cells - i.e. cancer and hair. I have convinced myself today that somewhere in my body the chemo is still working after 4 1/2 months and is still searching out bad cancer cells. Go, guys, go!!!!!\n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello Grace, happy to meet you, but sorry it had to be here. I have not yet had reconstruction, but I am considering it. You might get a lot of information on Google under breast cancer reconstruction.As I understand it, there are several flap operations with tram, free and the newer diep. Tram is the older, diep the newer, and free flap is used a lot because it is a shorter surgery than diep. A free vs diep was described to me as a difference of 2 inches, with diep involving micro surgery and free flap not. Because I had radiation, I might have to have a lat flap, from the back. I'll be seeing someone in a week to discuss this. \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello, Lynda. Sorry you had to join us here, but these ladies are really great. I am relatively new, diagnosed Nov 04 and single rad mastectomy Dec 21, 04. The operation is not so bad -- probably not nearly as bad as you think. I took pain medication for about\n a week until drain was removed. I  was unable to have reconstruction because of node involvement.  I was pretty out of it for a week and gradually got much better. By the time I started chemo on Jan 11th, I was back to walking about\n a mile a day -- I normally do 2. The most important thing to remember to do with a mastectomy are exercises they give you. This keeps your range of motion going. Please don't think that you can do this for a couple of weeks. Just keep at it. It took me 6-8 weeks to regain range and that is extremely important. I have no problems with my arm. As for lifting, I do not know what my limit is but I rarely lift over 15 pounds anyway. Because I have not had reconstruction, I lift weights daily, 3 pounds, so that the skin my chest wall remains \"movable\".\n \n ",

It forms a slight diagonal line from neck to collar shoulder joint that is straight. She also said they are trying to miss the esophagus (SP!) but it is somehow it seems to be involved in that field and this is causing the ear problem. I did take 1/2 Lortab SAT night and iit helped me sleep, but pain is back again today.

I do not truly understand nor do I completely believe my onco -- mainly because I am not sure I understnad the results. When I was diagnosed I had the typical IHS test for HER2 (every one has that test) and it came back positive 3+. My tumor was  eventually measured at 2 cm and I had 5 positive nodes. My med onco felt that I would be accepted in that ongoing Herceptin for HER2 positive patients who were at high risk for recurrence, so I applied. Part of the study requires the FISH test . It is a more expensive test and supposed to be more definitive. My FISH result came back negative for gene replication  so I did not qualify for the test. My onco said that about\n 10% of the IHS positive results would be FISH negative. She said that this actually improved my prognosis. \n \n ",

Do not hesitate to tell either of your docs that you want a new surgeon. Talk with other women in your area with similar experiences and get the name of a good surgeon. Find someone that does Sentinel Node Biopsy if at all possible. If there are no positive nodes, this procedure (done with the mastectomy) will tell and it is the least invasive surgeries if this is what you have to go for. I had this done, but unfortunately I had 5 positive nodes so I had to go through everything.\nGood Luck\nJuju ",

They make the obligatory phone calls with the same stupid questions -- every day -- and they never HEAR me when I say I am not well or that things are not going well with the home, and I can not tell you how many times I have helped them with their home projects and more -- especially my sister who is a six year survivor of breast cancer.\nToday is a great example of how I feel and how much help I need, but I know they will not listen to what I have to say. As a matter of fact, I am afraid to even repeat it myself. Today I had a visit with my medical onc and my 11th Placitaxel treatment. My doctor will not be doing any follow up tests -- only a visit 4 months from now. Gave me a pres for Adimidex and told me to start 1 week after radiation. She does no testing because blood tests are often false positives and CT's provide info only a couple of months before my physical symptoms start. I asked \"In other words, it the cancer returns, I am going to die\". Unfortunately, she confirmed this -- she has only a couple of exceptions. This is a well respected teaching university hospital and I am devastated. Can any one offer any hope for me? ",

ELIMINATE SUGAR. Use protein for energy - i.e.\nwalnuts (can't eat peanuts or cashews because they are addictive!!). Look for high protein foods with no sugar. Try Smucker's natural peanut butter (creamy) and eat a peanut butter sandwich. This has 8 gr protein and only 1 gr sugar. No, it's not like real peanut butter, but it is o.k. Remember you are just substituting protein for energy. I got my peanut butter at a healthfood store. When you are better, remember to do your arm exercises so you regain range of motion.

Hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes came out twice. \nI have my 12th Placitaxel Monday. Mapping is 12th of July, so you are a little ahead of me on the treatment schedule. \nAs for protein, I read labels. Pita bread has about\n 4 grams of protein in each, eggs are a little rich in protein also. All meat has protein, but you have to pay attention to the quantity since you want to maintain weight. As for me I have actually lost about\n 10 pounds, but I eliminated sugar in December when I was diagnosed.\nJuJu ",

Any tips on how to handle family members who call \"the cancer patient\" daily with stupid questions. They are finally getting on my nerves. I live alone and take myself to all treatments. Is there a book I can buy for members of my family that will help them be more sensitive to my feelings. ",
