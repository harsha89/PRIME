    "Content": " Have been diagnosed with Proliferative Fibrocystic D/0 with Radial Scar 1 cm after 2 Mammograms, 1 Ultrasound and results of a Core Needle Biopsy with Stereotactic Guidance. The result was that it is benign. I just turned 67 and never had any prior problems. They suggested that they I schedule an appointment with a surgeon to remove the rest of the Radial Scar. (not much is left since they took out 7 samples) . I do not want to have a lumpectomy! Is an \nopen surgical biopsy with a 6 month follow up of MRI or Mammogram with ultrasound a good alternative? ",
