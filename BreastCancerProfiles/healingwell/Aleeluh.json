      "Content": " Hi everyone this is my first time on these boards, im in need of some advice. I have found a redish/sometimes purple/black place on the under part of my breast it has been there for about\n 4months. I went and saw a doctor three months or so ago, she said \"its a bruise you prob hit it on something, if it doesnt go away in a week or so call me..I knew I hadnt hit it on anything but she is the doctor not me\"<== she didnt seem to worried.\nThe place didnt go away in a week , so I decided to give it a few more days and it never dissappeared, so I called her again.. the same doctor was suppose to make me an appointment with a specialist for something else and still hasnt, all and all she just doesnt seem to care. I have recently been looking for a new doctor. =( The place hasnt went away in four months so it is not a bruise.. I have added some photos in the links below of the spot, and maybe some of you can give me some information or input, it really has me worried. The pictures are cropped just so you can see the place and nothing else, dont worry. Thanks in advance everyone.\nhttp://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i164/Pro121/CIMG0006_edited.jpg\nhttp://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i164/Pro121/Picture113424432_edited.jpg\nhttp://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i164/Pro121/Picture113424442.jpg ",
