      "Content": " Hi,a ll...had a mammo with US (one side only) last month. They said they found 2 large cysts. \"Simple\". I was going to have them aspirated and biopsied, but canceled as the larger one started to decrease in size. Over my \"period\", by a day or so. (I had an ablation, and ovary removed in 2002 due to cyst issues, and so no REAL period anymore. Dr said I was perimenapausal 3 yrs ago.) Anyway, this AM I have a very small lump, tiny, in the armpit, same size as the breast in question. It is tender. Should I be concerned?? Was I wrong to cancel the aspiration? I can stioll feel the cyst, just smaller now. Back to being concerned. I have a history: 16 yrs of cysts, 1 benign lump removed, bloody discharge that was not confirmed to be \"anything\", and one breastcare DR said after an MRI, that my breasts have a lot of \"sparkles\"...is that calcifications? She never told me. Thanks for ANY words of wisdom..:) This is the only online board that is nice...breastcancer.org isn't... they don't reply unless you have been diagnosed. ",
