The idea is once you have a solid diagnosis- there should be a pathology report with staging, grading and what the tumor is sensitive to. At that point there is a web site (we saw it) that has the exact preferred treatment according to a blue ribbon panel of experts. Your MD should be able to cheerfully explain what treatment is proven best practice for your exact condition and why other ones are not. This is called \"evidence based\" medicine these days. ",
