    "Content": " Hello \n \nMy name is Heather Soo and I am a PhD candidate at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.\nI am currently undertaking a study that looks at how the way that we tend to think a lot about\n certain things might influence our thoughts and behaviour\ns that relate to illness, focusing both on Type I/II diabetes and specific cancer groups. I believe this is an important study as it looks at both positive and negative affective outcomes, as well as behaviour\nal outcomes in illness, in relation to thinking style as opposed to content which has been the key consideration to date. \nIncreasing our understanding of how people think in response to illness may help identify individuals who may experience difficulties in adjusting to illness and also guide us in developing ways to help overcome these difficulties.  \nThis study involves the completion of a survey online, with online follow-up at three months and six months and is focusing on the following specific cancer groups: breast, colorectal, prostate, skin (melanoma), gynaecological, as well as Type I/Type II diabetes. You will be required to give an email address so that we can email you the link to the followup studies but your data from the survey will be kept separately from identifying details.\n \nThe study has been approved by the Ethics Committee (Human Research) at Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, 2109, Australia and is already hosted on a number of Australian support sites, including Ovarian Cancer Australia and the Breast Cancer Institute (Australia). I am now looking to extend the study internationally and would be very grateful if you would be interested in participating.\nTo learn more about\n the study or to register to participate, please go to:\nhttp://www.mris.com.au\nor, if you have any specific questions, please feel free to email me at:\nheather.soo@students.mq.edu.au\nor call on 61-412-155208.\nThank you. \nHeather (Soo)\n ",
