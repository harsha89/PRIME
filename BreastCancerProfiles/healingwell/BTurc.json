    "Content": " Hello,\nI realize this is the breast cancer forum however I can't seem to find anywhere on healing well that discusses or offers a chat forum for ovarian cancer. I am hoping someone can help as this would be the closest forum to ovarian related issues. I have been dealing with a simple ovarian cyst on my right ovary for a couple years now. The darn thing keeps growing (every time I go for follow up they tell me it slightly grew). It started out as a 3 or 4 cm simple cyst and is now almost 8 cm. My current doctors don't seem too too concerned about\n it even though I have symptoms that could coincide with ovarian cancer. I am 33 years old and suffer with a history of anxiety. I am looking to chat with someone who has history of a simple ovarian cyst. I am also wondering if a simple cyst could be cancer.. my doctor says that most ovarian cancer cysts show up as complex and have a whole different look / texture from simple cysts. If I am completely wrong in posting this here I truly do apologize. Any help / direction is greatly appreciated. God bless. ",
