If you dont think that you are receiving the attention you need, keep pushing for better treatment. I'm not sure about\n the numbers, but somewhere around 80% of lumps are benign, so I hope you will fall in that category, but push your doctor for more follow up. You need to make sure that YOU are taking care of yourself, and advocating for yourself.

I am taking it pretty easy though, and DMIL has been over quite a bit to help out as well. \nThe weirdest thing is that I really dont have any pain at all - just where the drains are. Because all the nerve endings have been cut, I dont have any sensation along the incision, and althought the chest is sore, its not as sore as I thought it would be.I havent even taken any tylenols!

Although I was not Her2 positive, a friend was, and she was also very upset by that particular diagnosis. However, with the drug Herceptin, there is a VERY good \"cure\" rate!! \nAlso, living with a port is not a difficult thing. I had one because I have a 10 month old daughter, so I couldnt get a pick line, and even before my diagnosis, my veins were hard to hit. The port insertion and excision were easy operations - I didnt even need to go under for them. And once the incision was healed, I barely felt it. Unfortunately, because I am (oops, was) small chested, it was very noticeable. So as soon as I was done chemo, I had it taken out. \nI will not say that chemo is easy, but, it was not as difficult as I thought it was going to be. There are alot of medications to help with the side effects, and life is still liveable throughout the treatments!

Biopsy? \nI will be going in for a double mast. and my surgeon expects the surgery to only last about\n 2 hours...so for a single mast, less than that..I'm sure some of the other women here will tell you about\n their experiences. \nAnd if you want someone to explain your pathology reports, definetely ask them!! Out of my surgeon, onco, and radiologist, it was my radiologist that did the best job of explaining things. Go figure. \nI hope this helps a bit.

It simply confirms if the cancer has spread outside of the breast. But since cancer can spread without having any nodes positive, the procedure, IMHO, is redundant. Having no nodes positive didnt change my chemo, and is only good for determining my stage of cancer. So I'm a stage 2 instead of a stage 3, yipee. It certainly hasnt changed my outlook - I still feel that it will come back someday (since my cancer was a grade 3), and now I have to deal with lymphedema as well. Whether or not you have nodes positive doesnt seem to change anything, and only seems to add to the whole ordeal. \nIf I am wrong, please, please correct me.\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

      "Content": " Chloe, i am so sorry that you have to be here. I just want to add my support, and give you a few questions to consider...\n In my situation, I didnt know until the lumpectomy that my lump was cancerous. If I had known before hand, I would have given much more thought to having a mastectomy instead of just the lumpectomy - due to alot of family history of bc. I also would have asked the surgeon if he could do a Sentinel Node Biopsy, rather than an auxilliary node biopsy, as you are more at risk of lymphedema with the auxilliary (I now have mild lymphdema - swelling of the arm). I'm in Canada where the sentinel biopsy is not as prevalent, but if I had searched, I might have found a surgeon willing to do it.I'm not sure if in the States anyone still does the auxilliary or not. \n There are many types of cancer - Dr. Love's Breast Book does a great job of explaining the different types. But for the most part, \"staging\" is determined by tumor size, Lymph node involvement (has the cancer spread to the lymph nodes in the armpit), and the \"grade\" of cancer (is it fast/slow growing). Tumors can also be ER (Estrogen Recptor) positive or negative, PR (progesterone receptor) positive or negative, and HER2Neu positive or negative. \n I have one more treatment left (I had AC & T), and although it wasnt a walk in the park, it wasnt as bad as I had thought it would be. The worst thing about\n the surgery (for me) were the drains that are attached for a couple of days. If you have the auxilliary node removal, make sure you ask your surgeon for exercises to do after your surgery to regain full motion of your arm. \n I hope that everything goes well for you on thursday. We will board the Pink Cloud Express (PCE) and be there with you in the OR so that you do not go through this alone. We are here for you!!!\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

It is just so hard to let go of not being able to have any more children. But I need to do what is best for my little girl - and a mast will decrease my chance of recurrance. \nI do hope that you continue to advocate for yourself, and that the idi*ts in your town come to their senses.

I do feel like I'm a bit more run down, so I'm trying to take it easy, but I still go for a walk or a jog every day. Other than the second and third day after chemo, I really dont have too many aches or pains. I've found the taxol to be very easy - but I also only had it every three weeks.\nI met with my onco today, and the preliminary results for my genetic testing are positive for the gene. I had counted on that, so it wasnt any big surprise. She thinks that I should get the mast, do rads and then have the recon. But I'm going to talk to my radiologist and see if I can do rads first, and then have the mast and recon at the same time - if I have to get both done, why not get them done together! Although the radiologist may say that I dont need rads at all if Im going the mast way. I had hoped to get things a bit more finalized today, but it didnt happen. In my mind, I'm already past the chemo, and want to get on to the next phase. Its very frustrating to not know what is going to happen next. \nBTW sorry about\n the Seahawks\nchantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

      "Content": " Oh,grrrrrrrr. Things are all up in the air again. I saw my surgeon to talk about\n the mast. and he wants to get going on it, so when I told him that my appt for the PS wasnt until April, he said that he would call the guy to see if we could get me in earlier. So now, I'm not sure if I'll be doing rads or not. The reason for me doing rads, was because I didnt think that I would be getting the mast done until much later. So now I'm in a bit of a tizzy. \nI also had a really hard day yesterday. On Monday, I go (with DD) to a play group, and all the mothers there breastfeed. Throughout this whole ordeal, stopping breastfeeding was THE MOST difficult thing to deal with. I wanted sooo much to give my daughter the best. So when I see all these women still breastfeeding, it really hurts. Then on Tuesday, I had to buy formula (again, the hurt), and also talk with the surgeon about\n the mast. It just sort of all hit at once. Also, we had ideally wanted 2 children. Now, I'm not so sure. And even if we did, I wouldnt be able to breastfeed that child either. So I had a BIG pity party yesterday, sitting and bawling my eyes out. Mourning the loss of some pretty important (to me) dreams. Aw drat, herecome the tears again.\nI'm so glad that the rads havent affected your energy. I've had a cold for the last week - another thing thats bringing me down. And the weather has been really cold, so I havent been able to get outside. (OK, I have complained enough...sorry)\nfor the genetic testing, all they did was take some blood. Very easy.\nTake care of your burn, and I hope the rest of your rads are just as easy for you!\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

We called TeleHealth (an Ontario-run telephone help line for health questions), and the nurse gave us a few tips to help her breathe. The nurse didnt think that she needed to go to the hospital since she didnt have a fever, just alot of congestion. So you are all right - she does need me. Thanks. Sometimes its hard not to feel totally overwhelmed by negative feelings. I'm not like that usually, but the situation this past week was very emotional, and well, I guess we cant be positive all the time.\nBernadette - I had 4 AC and then will have 4 taxols in total. I think that we are a little bit behind the US up here in terms of personalizing regiments. Basically, every woman who is early stage gets either 6 CEF, or 4 AC and 4 Taxol. Thats why this site has been such a help to me - I can get info on treatments that are standard in the states, but that may not be up here in canada.\nAgain, big big BIG thanks to everyone here for the help you've given me throughout this past year. \nLots of Love and hugs,\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

Although its a crummy situation, cudos to you for your wonderful way of handling it! \nThere was one more thing that I thought of... although getting through the surgery is probably (and rightfully so) the formost thing on your mind, if you have to do chemo, depending on your cocktail, you may want to consider getting a pick line or a portacath. If you decide to go with a portacath, perhaps they could insert it at the same time as your mast??\n Some of the chemos can be very hard on your veins. Since my cocktail was AC & T, (with the A - adryamicin being extremely hard on veins) and since they seem to have a hard time getting my veins to begin with, after my lumpectomy, I went back and had a port inserted. it was a very easy surgery, but perhaps you could get two birds with one stone??(that is, if you need a something like a pick or a port to begin with)\nTake care of yourself this weekend. Have some fun, get out and try to keep your mind off of evrything (I know - easier said than done). and if you need us, we are here.\nHugs,\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

I went to a play group with a bunch of other mothers, and those same thoughts were going through my mind. I know that i shouldnt be so negative, and usually I'm not, but this last week took a toll, and when you are staring death in the face, and then dealing with your own mortaility, emotions can get a little raw. \nThanks Lori for your words of wisdom too. I keep thinking that the worst is behind me (well, almost - 2 more taxol to go), and so when I hit that wall of emotion, it always takes me by surprise. I've read that once you've finished treatment, there are new emotional adjustments to go through - like those that Kattbird is dealing with. I just want it to be over, but it never,ever will. And I find that very depressing. Always keeping one eye out for anything that may be wrong. Yuck. But then I bounce back, and try to go about\n things normally.\nDeb - i'm sure you looked stunning at your daughters wedding!Thank you too. Everyone here is an amazing help to me. thank you all for sharing your stories and personal experiences. This site is a life line to me. \nAnd we've been doing th eshower thing for the past couple of nights and it is working. We also jacked up her matress to help her breathe. Hopefully by this weekend she'll be back to her old self!\nThanks everyone,\nLove and hugs\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

Good luck with the Taxol - please post as to how it's different from the AC for you. I'm very interested in knowing if its easier/harder. I do actually have a response to your original question..its just taking me a while to get to it....\nIn my local newspaper this weekend there was an article about\n a company called \"titbits\" which makes knitted breasts. They are supposed to be very comfortable and lightweight. I dont know if they would be able to help you,as they are designed for mastectomy patients, but they have a website... www.titbits.ca . Hope it helps.\nBTW, do you still have to get the nuepogen shot for taxol?\nHope things are going well,\nchantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

If its going to fall out, then it should just get it over with and do it! Then I could clean it up and get on with things. Oh well.

I've had a bit of a cold and they almost had to delay my 3rd A/C - my counts were at 1400, and they usually want them at 1500 - but we went ahead anyways. I always find the 2nd day after to be really rough - verrrrrry tired. But then I seem to bounce back by the 4-5th days. We'll probably have to delay my 4th A/C though because of blood counts.\nYou say that you are tired all the time....I cant even imagine also having to work through all of this. I hope that I won't get too tired - some days its already hard enough to find the energy to take care of my little one.\nKathy - I hope you're doing ok. i havent seen any posts from you in a while.\nTake care both!\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

I'm not going with a wig, since I'm staying at home on maternity/disability leave. I've got quite a number of scarves and hats and they seem to be doing the trick. It's getting colder up here any ways, so hats are a pretty common sight. I went to a wedding yesterday with a scarf wrap and a hat, and everyone who knew what I was going through told me that I looked great. Fortunately my eyebrows are still here - I think I'll be more upset at losing them then my head hair! However those pesky chin hairs are still around.

It took about\n two hours, from the time they did the injection to finish. You have to stay still, but it's an easier test than an MRI.

Thank you so much for your replies. \nSince I am relatively young (35) I am looking for something that I can feel comfortable with, especially in a bathing suit (I love to swim), also, I am a fairly physically active person too, so I need something that goes along with that kind of lifestyle as well. It sounds as if the tram flap may not be what I would be looking for, as it doesnt sound too stable (I have fairly strong stomach muscles and would have alot of adjusting to do if they werent there anymore). I'm not very large breasted at all, in fact, I'm pretty small, so going breastless would not be psychologically devastating to me, but, I say that now... Idont really know what I'd feel like if they were gone.\nThanks for your suggestions Candy on waiting. I have a feeling that I probably will wait for any recon until DD is a bit bigger and not so dependent on me...maybe 15 - 20 years???? (LOL)\nAnyways, I hope to read about\n it this weekend, and wil probably come back with a bunch of new questions. \nHave a great weekend everyone.\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

I was node negative, but had an aggressive cancer that is ER neg, even though I found the lump when I was pregnant. I just met with the onco today, and she said that herceptin might be an option for me. Are you ER neg too? I'll also be doing the AC + T. And I have a muga test on Tues. What is that? What does it test for? I'm supposed to start chemo on the 19th, and then get a port after. (they want to get me started soon). What is the herceptin for? Is it kinda like a tamoxifen but for ER neg? \n \n \n \n \nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

What are the pros and cons? With a little daughter I dont want to worry about\n lifting her. Can I get a mastectomy and then do reconstruction later?

(I'll probably google it when done here) My husband has been coming with me to most of my appointments, and has been a great help. I feel deep in my bones that I have the cancer gene, but I will be getting tested for it, to determine if I should have additional surgeries (masect, ooph, etc...). My biggest concern is that I've given it to my daughter. One more question, if you are ER- does that neccessarily mean you are PR- too? The next time I see my onco will probably be when I do chemo for the first time (hopefully Sept 19). I honestly dont know what I'd have done without this website!! It's been such a great help!\nThanks again!!\nChantry\nThere are no wrong turnings, only paths we did not know we were meant to take - Guy Gavriel Kay\n ",

I only had a lumpectomy because my biopsy came back as \"suspicious\" and not \"cancerous\". So hoping for the best, I told the surgeon that I just wanted a lumpectomy. Now with my diagnosis, and probability of carring the cancer gene, I will probably be seriously looking at a masectomy (or both), and perhaps an ooph too. \nI was diagnosed with invasive ductal, ER neg.

      "Content": " Hi ladies... I am new to the club - I found a lump in my right breast at 8 months pregnant. I had an ultrasound done and the doctor was almost positive it was just a fibroid, but due to the significant amount of breast cancer in my family, I pushed for a biopsy. Unfortunately the biopsy came back as inconclusive, so they scheduled me for a lumpectomy and (if required) lymph node removal. That was Tuesday. So now I feel like the bionic woman with my 2 drains hanging around my waist. My question is this... the surgeon who did the removal is not a real talkative kind of guy... and I dont exactly know what kind of questions to ask him.Before my surgery i had a bone scan, chest x-ray, and abdominal ultrasound. I am to call him next week, and if he has the results of all, my appointment will be the next day. I want to have a list of questions for him, since he doesnt seem to want to volunteer too much info.Oh, and by the way, my healthy little girl was born on may 31, and is as cute as can be. ",
