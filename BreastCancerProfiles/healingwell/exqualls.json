I squeezed in an appointment with my dentist, as the normal date would have been just after surgery. my hygienist reminded me that she had a double mastectomy 15 years ago (so long ago i had forgotten) when she was quite young, and actually had a very aggressive cancer. she is the picture of health and vitality.\nI've had my pre-op work-up with EKG, chest X-ray and blood tests. I've met with my plastic surgeon, and i feel quite confident with her. i learned i'll have to get implants after the tissue expanders. i had hoped i could do a fat transfer from my belly area, but apparently i am not heavy enough (that was nice to hear). tomorrow i see the oncologist and then the next day i get that extra ultrasound to try to find out what those other two spots are that were lit up by the MRI. I'm also going to get a flu shot and a shingles vaccine, since i am approaching the age when shingles could appear. \nit is so hectic to work full time and fit in so many appointments. and aside from medical appointments, since my birthday happens to be a couple of days before surgery, it's that time of year when i have my annual \"dates\" with various girlfriends. I am losing the \"alone time\" i dearly love, but i am also grateful for so many distractions to keep me from thinking wild thoughts.\nOnce again, i am reminded that i am grateful to be able to post my thoughts and feelings here. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this, as I know that if you're reading, it's because you or a loved one are in a similar situation.

      "Content": " Three days until surgery. All 3 doctors--the surgeon, the plastic surgeon who will start reconstruction with the tissue expanders, and the oncologist-- all say I'll only be in the hospital over night. That just seems insane. Other women I've spoken to say they've stayed 3 and 4 nights. I hope that will be true for me as well. I can't imagine that I won't need as many days of high-octane drugs as possible. I admit to becoming more nervous as the date draws closer. I completed my living will and designated my health care surrogate (something I never did with my previous back surgeries or shoulder surgery). When offered the chance to do so previously I always brushed it off as unnecessary. When the thought of dying flits across my mind, it doesn't so much have to do with having cancer, only the routine risks associated with surgery and general anesthesia. \nI really do recognize that death from a surgical complications is not likely, and it is not what has lead me to feel more anxious as the date draws near. It's everything that comes after the surgery. The pain from healing, the weekly visits to inflate the expanders, the discomfort I've read about\n from having those --and the chemo! Fatigue, going bald, mouth sores, finger and toe nails falling out-- and all of this going on for months, before more surgery for reconstruction. And I don't even know yet if I'll need radiation. \nI'm so thankful for being able to vent here. I share a little of this with my husband, but he has so many of his own health issues, I try not to burden him. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this, as I know if you're reading, it's because either you or a loved one is in a similar situation.

      "Content": " i had the appointment yesterday with the radiology oncologist. I've seen a lot of doctors, especially recently, and this woman was IMPRESSIVE. The second she walked in, without even my chart or file on her, she knew EVERYTHING about\n my case. When I would ask questions, she would reference the answer based on facts that were specific to ME alone; like the fact that I was a grade 2, or that my ki-67 was 48%, and that though my margins were \"clear\", it was only by 1 millimeter, and although i only had one lymph node with cancer, that it had \"nearly escaped the node capsule\". Unfortunately I am in the \"grey zone\".... if 4 or more nodes had cancer, or if it had spread to the chest wall or anywhere else, then yes, definitely need radiation... if zero nodes, and no other spread, definitely no radiation. One to three nodes is the grey zone. The gist of the visit is, of course, that she recommends I have radiation, 30-33 treatments. \nShe went over the side effects, the sunburn, which could range anywhere from redness to blistering and peeling, and fatigue. There's a small chance that the radiation can damage my thyroid gland, due to the proximity of the thyroid to where the radiation beams will be aimed, which would lead to hypothyroidism. There's 5% chance that the radiation will cause a totally new cancer. And there is a 20% chance of getting lymphedema. I knew I was already at risk for that since I had all my left axillary nodes removed. I didn't think to ask if the radiation makes my risk 20% higher than it already was from the surgery.... I'll have to look into that. I need to find out more about\n lymphedema as well.\nFor some reason I had it stuck in my head that after chemo, I will be about\n 95% sure that the cancer won't come back. I don't know where I pulled that number, but it was what I'd been considering as gospel. According to this doctor, with chemo alone, I am 80-85% clear. Add in radiation, and it goes up to 95% clear. I spent a couple hours searching online for statistics, and they are all over the place. One site will say 65%, another will say, 75, or 83,...... lots of numbers and none of them approached 95% cure rate from chemo alone. Also, none of the sites were organized in a way where a person could view stats based on the facts of their particular cancer.\nI don't need to decide right away if I'll add radiation after chemo. I have time to do research. \nMoney is a factor, unfortunately as it is for almost everyone! I just recently reached my maximum out-of-pocket for health care costs for this year, so I am no longer having to pay my $75 co-pay! Yeah! But that will end Dec. 31, 2016, and I'll have that multi-thousand dollar amount I'll have to be out-of-pocket again. The chemo alone is scheduled to continue through April, 2017. If I add radiation, that would take me through June. Oh, and having radiation means that my final breast reconstruction would be delayed --she said I'd have to wait 6 months after the end of radiation before doing reconstruction. So now I'm into early 2018 to have the reconstruction, and once again having the thousands of dollars out-of-pocket! My head is spinning. Time to do something relaxing. I can't think about\n my cancer anymore today.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this.\n ",

My onc refilled the 2 prescript\nions for cough medicine, and sent me over to another clinic to get a chest xray (my 3rd one in 2 weeks), and wants me to see my PCP tomorrow for follow up on my cough. I can't afford all these visits!!! I've paid $75 3 weeks in a row to the onc, and haven't even gotten my chemo. Plus the cost of RX (not much, but still). Who knows how much my insurance company will cover from the ER visit, and now today more xrays. I'm going to call tomorrow to see if he xray results are still negative. If so, then I'm not going to see anyone else. If the results are positive, I'll set up an appointment with a pulmonologist (lung dr?). Of course I'm praying the results are negative as I can't afford to go to yet another doctor's appointment\nThese delays in treatment and this endless, hacking cough are really getting to me. While I was waiting to get my xrays I actually started crying in the waiting room! Not sobbing hysterically, just tears drizzling down my face. I didn't mind cancer treatment. I looked forward to it! As I knew I was making progress toward killing the cancer in my body.....and there was an end in sight. Now there is no end in sight. I will miss my son's graduation for sure. ",

That has been my goal, to take the mystery out of breast cancer and catalog some of the things we may go through. \nWhat happened after the bronchitis and pneumonia, was that I got Guillain-Barré Syndrome. Something I had vaguely heard of on the TV show \"House\", but that's about\n it. It's a neurological disorder and it's possible to die from it although not likely. Most people do have a complete recovery after a few months. it's just very slow going. I have MUCH to discuss after what happened after the emergency room transferred me to the big local, well respected, very prestigious local hospital. Unfortunately I need to stop now and hopefully get a chance to write again tomorrow. Let me just say there were horror stories from my 12 days at this \"prestigous\" hospital. I've transferred to a different hospital, and it is much better.\n Best of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.\n ",

I know being in a wheelchair or using a walker isn't the end of the world, and that is not even the problem. It's the severe, stabbing PAIN and the burning that goes along with the paralysis that has me in a wheelchair or walker. Wanting to see people or go anywhere is the last thing on my mind. \nI don't want to make this a GBS forum, but I just want to really let people know, who may be going through cancer, that life may deal you a really crappy hand and force you to deal with something even worse. And we just have to stay strong, think positively, meditate daily affirmations even if it's just for five minutes.

And although i am well-educated, i am embarrassed to say i took a \"keep my head buried in the sand\" approach to screenings. The last time i saw my OBGYN was when i gave birth to my last child 21 years ago. Three or four months ago i noticed a lump in my left breast seemed to be growing daily (I've always had large, lumpy breasts). The growing lump was accompanied by extreme pain, sometimes lasting 24 hours a day, other days, just a few stabs of pain off and on. \nI finally went to my OBGYN for pap smear and breast exam. She felt lumps in both my breasts and sent me for a diagnostic mammo and ultrasound. When she called with the results a few days later, her voice gave away great concern... she sounded like SHE was in tears to have to tell me. She said I had bilateral malignant tumors in both breasts... a 2.5 cm lump in the right breast, and a 3.6 cm mass (plus other masses) in the left breast (the painful one). \nI am scheduled for a biopsy and MRI in a few days. I've never known anyone who's had breast cancer before, so I have no idea how alarmed I should be (other than the morbid tone in her voice when she told me the news). ",

      "Content": " Well, I haven't been able to keep the positive vibe going. I vacillate between more bad days than good. On the good days I try to do pre-cancer activities--with whatever limitations I now have. For instance, EVERY day up until 9/27/16, the day before my mastectomies, I had a few daily rituals. I used to do splits--forward and to each side, 50 sit ups within a minute, 50 push ups (military style, up on my toes, no knees touching the ground)-not timed, and my favorite, a 10 point balance routine I learned from karate (I have a black belt). From a defensive stance, every move is made on one leg. First on one leg, then the other. The routine involves lifting one leg up and into a precise position, holding it at least ten seconds, then moving that leg into a different position and holding at least ten, pivoting on the foot on the floor while putting the in-air leg into ten different positions and holding it...and so on, without wobbling, and all on one foot, of course. Obviously this involves incredible balance, control and strength in feet and legs and buttocks, and core ab strength. \nThese things were done every day and not considered my exercise for the day. To actually burn calories mostly I chose between kickboxing or an hour-long fast walk with a neighbor.\nSo, I used to do all these things, and as of a week ago I could do none. I was afraid to even try splits, as I wasn't sure I'd be able to even get up off the floor afterward, due to the GBS. When I was in the rehab hospital we practiced putting me on the floor and seeing if I could get up by myself. I couldn't. But I've been out of the hospital 4 months now, and have improved so much from the GBS, I decided to try all my previous daily rituals I detailed in the paragraph above.\nI started with splits. I couldn't get down anywhere near to a full 180 degree split. Maybe 90-100 degrees, and it hurt. I used to get into that 180 degree split and bend and reach forward until my stomach was flat on the floor and stay there 30 seconds. Now, with my limited stretch which really pulls in both legs, I can barely lean forward at all. Then I try to reach my hands to my toes and lay my stomach on my leg, each side. I can barely reach my toes, and and I can't get my stomach down much at all. I go through the motions of the side splits with the same type of limitations. I've been doing this every day and it hasn't gotten any easier and my splits haven't gotten wider. I do remember from years ago, getting up to the level of full splits that I finally got to, took a LONG TIME. And once I got there I had to do it every day in order not to regress. \nTo get up to doing 50 ab crunches in a minute didn't take long at all in the past. When I was at my fittest I could maybe do 65-70 in a minute. But when I tried my crunches last week I could do only 5. FIVE. But I've been doing them every day, and pretty quickly got to 20, and yesterday I got to 35. I'm not timing myself--that will come later. My goal is to do one more than I did the day before. It is VERY hard. I am groaning and really working to get through the last few sit ups.\nSo I've made no progress since I re-started my splits/stretches, but I continue to do it and I presume I will slowly be able to get to the 180 degrees, and stomach to the floor level EVENTUALLY. Like it could take a year...... or more! But I am determined to get back to that level. \nThe ab crunches I am certain I will get back to my previous level within another month or so.\nNow for the push ups. I can do zero. I figured this would be hard, since my chest was operated on from armpit to armpit. Twenty years ago, when I first started push ups I also could do NONE. Not even girl style, with my knees on the floor. I remember back then I just tried every day and suddenly one day I could do one, then another, and eventually built up to fifty, no knees on the floor push ups. I think it took nearly a year to get to that level. I think now I can do ZERO for many reasons.....one, they are naturally the hardest exercise I ever did, period. Two, I've not been in an exercise program for almost a year now. Three, the cancer surgery. And four, the GBS. I hadn't realized how having numb fingers and feet would effect doing a push up. But when I tried doing that ONE last week, I wobbled and fell to the floor immediately, and I realized that since I can't feel my feet, and I lost my proprioception, my mind really couldn't tell that my feet really were holding up my legs... I couldn't feel WHAT my feet were doing......they could have been off in space somewhere. All I felt in the half-second or so that I was in the push-up position was that my stomach muscles couldn't handle it, my arms wobbled on my unfeeling hands, and I experienced fear as to what my feet were doing. \nI'm ashamed of myself for not trying again since that failure last week, but I AM going to begin trying again, today.\nMy last and favorite of my previous daily rituals was the 10 point, one-leg balance routine. It had taken years to get to the level of doing that, so it is no surprise that I could not do it at all on the first day. I have continued to try everyday, and I can get into the first position for a few seconds until I lose balance, and strength, and have to put my foot down. But I keep at it and go on to the second position, and I get to it and wobble, then have to either put my leg back down, or have to reach my hand to a counter not to fall. I proceed like this through all ten positions, and I fail at them all, every day. But on most days I can see the smallest of improvements in some aspect or other. Maybe I can hold a position for another second or two before I wobble and put my foot down. Maybe I can do the pivot without holding onto furniture --for a brief second. Maybe I can extend the lifted leg higher. Overall, it's a complete failure of balance and strength and flexibility for my 10 point routine. But I am so happy that I am doing it again every day! I really used to love doing it. For some reason I would always do it in the kitchen. Whenever I'd have to be in the kitchen for a few minutes or so, probably waiting on the microwave, I would use that time to do the routine on each leg, and I loved it. I loved knowing I had the control and balance and strength and flexibility to do this. Soooooo, as pathetic and wobbly as my routine is now, I do actually love going through the ten points and at least TRYING them, and seeing some improvements. It will depend on my GBS whether I will ever be able to do it as perfectly as before. \nWhile I am trying these various exercises, that is when I have my positive vibe going. But that's a small part of the day. Mostly I still feel like I'm in a holding pattern, and that is an unpleasant, depressing feeling.\nPS-- has anyone heard from Susie/Straydog, since Hurricane Harvey? I am worried.\n ",

      "Content": " My oncologist was an impressive person, and i felt quite confident and comfortable with her. There was just this one thing that gave me pause. She said they had a meeting of the \"tumor board\" (my surgeon had told me that he and a group of other specialists gather all information on a patient and discuss it thoroughly to debate and come to an agreement on treatment). She said that they had agreed that I would need chemotherapy, which didn't surprise me. But when i asked about\n the results of the oncotype test she said they had not felt that test was needed, that it is a test ordered when results are borderline, when they're not positive already that chemo is needed. I was not borderline because of the size of the lumps and the high ki-67 result-- 48%. Through all of my internet research, I have gotten it into my head that an oncotype test was imperative, so the fact the doctors did not feel it was needed in my case makes me feel like we're not going to have all possible information before going forward with chemo and (maybe) radiation. She said i could request that my surgeon order the oncotype test at the time of surgery, and the results would be in before I would be starting chemo, and IF the results made the need for chemotherapy doubtful, then the plan could be reconsidered (although I will be getting a port put during the surgery, in anticipation for the need of chemotherapy). \nMy third ultrasound went well enough-- they were looking now in a deeper area that had been spotlighted by the MRI. However the doctor did not think it was anything of concern. \nBills keep pouring in every day. A few hundred here, a couple thousand there---amounts they say insurance doesn't cover or that are under appeal. Usually I am obsessive with bills, paying them in full immediately, although there have never been so many or in such high amounts before. And what a relief it is that I actually do not care about\n the bills! I find i just set them aside, knowing I'll pay what I can when I can, without anxiety. The perspective that having cancer has given me makes me not sweat the \"small stuff\", like a bill being paid in installments and not in full. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this, as I know that if you're reading, it's because you or a loved one are in a similar situation.\n ",

I decided this yesterday, and yesterday and today we have had hour after hour or torrential rain, thunder, and lightning. \nSusie, I know you're in Texas, but I don't know if you're experiencing any of the effects of Hurricane Harvey. I hope that you are fine. I really empathize with hurricane survivors. It's been a very long time, but I dealt with victims of Hurricane Hugo on a daily basis for weeks and I can still feel their desperation and sense of loss and sheer confusion. It was dreadful for ME to experience it second-hand!\nPS, I REALLY believe that the delay is due to GBS. Most doctors know nothing about\n it, and have to research it before making decisions. Apparently, different anesthesia has to be used. \nI need to get my \"Lauren's Hope\" medical alert\n bracelet updated that I have GBS. I got one after I had all my lymph nodes removed during the mastectomies, since I can't have shots in the left arm or BP taken on that arm. If I'm unconscious, who'd know? I have to put on the bracelet that I have GBS, as apparently there are a lot of restrictions as to what medical treatment I may or may not have. Example, if I'm in a car accident, or any accident that involves metal causing a laceration, one of the first things a doctor would do is a tetanus shot. I'm not allowed to have one!\nI went to the Lauren's Hope website to try to just order a new tag part, as I don't need another bracelet, but I couldn't see where that was an option. It probably is, but my mind is scattered- to put it mildly- so I didn't find out how to get a new tag made to add GBS to it.\n ",

He was quite sweet and said he understood how emotional it will be to lose my long hair that I've always been proud of, but he disagreed about\n how I relate the look of extremely short hair on women as a symbol of them \"giving up\". He said I should see it as the opposite, because when I go bald, and then eventually go through months of having extremely short hair, it will be because I specifically have chosen NOT to give up. I am choosing life by going through chemo, and the hair loss is like a badge of courage confirming this.

I am up to 41 ab crunches, just 2 push ups, splits still are a real effort and I don't get near to 180 degrees. The 10-point balance routine is having some success! If I were being judged by karate black belt standards, it would be a failure. But each time I do it I can hold a position a little longer, or there will be a little less wobble. So I am actually thrilled.\nAt the moment, all I can think of is Irma. We've been lucky in my county (Pinellas) for decades, just having a few tree limbs down, maybe a few roofs damaged, and minor flooding in some places. So I'm starting to think 'our time is due'.....Plus, I think maybe everything bad that's happened to me is just a precursor to worse things to come. My BRCA cancer gene tests were negative, yet I got cancer... and how rare is it to have a part of the breast reconstruction to fail (the right side tissue expander), and getting GBS is SO rare.....I read .001 chance of getting it. \nMy younger son in first year law school is in constant contact with us. His older brother, who is off the grid, we have not heard from. He is so off the grid I don't know if he even is aware of Irma. Well, here I go crying.......the mere mention of my older son sets me off into a crying fit, I am so worried about\n him (even before Irma). I consider my older son the thing I am most upset about\n. On a scale of 1 to 100, cancer worry is a one.... GBS worry is about\n a ten. Older son worry is 100+.\nI had an appointment for this afternoon with the cancer counselor, and she had to cancel, as our county has a mandatory evacuation for her zone. Our county is very small.... a little peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico. I fear the entire county will get a mandatory evacuation order. \nPray for us! ",

      "Content": " At 3:30 am I woke up for some unknown reason and felt a tingle on my scalp. I scratched my head and a hand full of hair came out. Three hours later I am still combing my hair and gathering up a pile of it on a pillow next to me. It looks like a wig laying there. Day 14 post chemo, right on schedule. \nLast week when I was at my onc's just for my blood test (where I got the good results about\n my WBC count going up to 8.6), I saw a patient there I had never seen before. I tend to notice the women who appear to be my age, as there aren't many of us-- most of are in their 70s or 80s it seems. I was behind this woman in the check in line, and we started talking, and the sadness on her face was painful for me. She apologized to me for seeming brusque to me in a reply about\n how long the line was. I said what I'd say to anyone, \"don't worry about\n it, we're all stressed here\", and her positive reaction to me understanding her overreaction was visible. Like a plant that leans toward the sunshine, she drew closer to me and said \"thank you, I'm not normally like this.\" She said she was there for just her second time. I told her I, too, had only had one treatment so far\". I had never seen such....loneliness.... in her demeanor. I hugged her briefly, and she was so grateful for a small act of kindness, that it made me realize that she may not have a support system of family or friends.\nWe each got called back by different nurses, into different rooms. My visit was a short one, just to do the blood test, and since I got the immediate great news about\n my WBC, I was practically skipping out of the area when I saw her again as I passed through a different waiting room, on the way to check out. I can't remember exactly what we said to each other, but we introduced ourselves with names this time, hugged again, told her that I know that she's scared and everything is an unknown at this point, that we're on a journey we didn't plan, but we're on the right path. I hope we can share contact information the next time we run into each other.\nWhich brings me to the subject of my own friends, the three best friends that I shared my news with (the news has spread to others at work and in my neighborhood, but basically I only talk about\n my cancer journey with my husband, two sons, and my 3 best girlfriends.) My dearest friend and I have been incredibly close for almost 40 years! She was supposed to come to my house tomorrow, Tuesday, day 15 post chemo. We knew I'd be bald or close to it, and I'd be wearing my wig for her --the first person to see it. Also, it would be the last time we see each other before Thanksgiving. My friend has severe OCD, and unfortunately, me having cancer is a stressor for her-- it pains her to think about\n me going through this, and it triggers her OCD. She is now totally caught up in how ill she is feeling from eating \"bad hummus\" that she says she can't think about\n anything else, and cancelled our plans for tomorrow. Frankly, it hurts me. I know she can't help it. I know her mind is totally obsessing about\n the fact that she \"may have\" eaten hummus that had been recalled. But this little, tiny, selfish voice in my head says \"but what about\n me?.... I don't MAYBE have malignant cancer ... I DO.... my hair isn't MAYBE going to fall from my head (and after all these years, she knows and completely understands my hair obsession), it IS falling from my head... RIGHT NOW... I won't MAYBE be nervous about\n wearing a wig, I WILL BE. I won't MAYBE be going thru 5 1/2 more months of chemo, it's a definite....anyway, I don't like this little voice saying these things, but it's there, I'm hearing it. \nAs I just spent most of yesterday with one of the other in my trio of friends, I called the third and asked her to come over tomorrow and share my first wig experience with me and we'll also have lunch and do a craft project together. \nI go to the onc today and I will be watching out to see if my new acquaintance is there. I want to reach out to her. She really seemed like she had no one to share her feelings with, and I want her to know she has me.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. ",

The push-ups vary from day today. One day I can do four, the next day I can do 10, the next day I\u2019m back to four. Of course my 10 point balance routine is where I am most limited.

The doctor decided that the right breast was not losing ALL of its fill, and so she decided to try again filling both sides, and putting a bit more in the right to try to get it to catch up to the size of the left breast. For the first time I could actually feel each breast as it \"blew up\" like a balloon. It was a \"tight\" feeling, but not very unpleasant. By the time I got home it was after 2:30. I feel like I DID nothing, but was so exhausted by these two appointments. I actually took my wig off in the car driving home, as I had developed a headache. \nAnd like the last time I got a fill up, I came home and measured each breast so I can tell if it does down. I'll see the doctor again in a week. Tomorrow morning I see my surgeon for a follow-up, the first time I saw him since surgery on 9/28, (however I was incoherent from fentanyl, so I don't really count that). The only visit I remember with him was on 9/1, my initial consult when he outlined my diagnosis and what type of surgery and likely follow-up treatment I would need. \nSo this is the third day after my second chemo, and it is pretty much following the experience of the first time, lots of fatigue and some nausea. I believe the nausea is a bit better this time, since I have the added drug, Varubi. A side effect of Varubi, however, may be heartburn, as I have had that several times a day, which is not usual for me.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.\nAddendum: I mentioned to my husband that we'd be seeing my surgeon for the first time since surgery and he corrected me that we had already had a follow up with him. Strange that I have NO memory of that, but I checked my \"master list\" of all appointments and there it is-- I saw him on Oct 14. I guess I was still on pain meds then and obviously cannot trust my memory.\n ",

      "Content": " I hate to admit that I am feeling a bit depressed and overwhelmed at the deflation of my right tissue expander. I remember being surprised at how elated I felt after I had the first fill up in the expanders, and just the tiniest of breasts started to show. Those small, feminine mounds made me realize I WAS recovering... I still had chemo and radiation in the near future to kill the cancer, but here was visible proof my body WAS recovering. \nEach week I'd get a fill and the breasts were growing. I felt like me again. Even though I technically \"have cancer\", in my mind I feel like a healthy person since I'm doing everything to fight it, and since I was starting to look like me again--with breasts and great-looking wigs--I felt as happy and positive as ever. (And if anyone reading can't tell, I am a super positive person by nature.)\nHowever it cannot be denied any longer. For at least 4 weeks the right breast has not kept up with the left, and it doesn't just look smaller (lots of women have one breast bigger than the other, who cares), it is mis-shapen. Because the skin expanded out, then when it didn't hold the fill, the skin falls in on itself and it's almost like a cave-in on the right side of my chest. I am not properly describing how horrific it looks. It also doesn't help the overall look that the port for chemo is just over the right chest area (I'm not even going to call it a breast anymore), and having the port creates an indentation under its \nlocation as well, so there is a whole lot of ugly going on the right side of me. \nI go to the onc's office in an hour or so for blood work, hoping my WBC is high enough. When blood was taken 2 days ago my WBC was 2.2 (normal is 4.2-10.0, and my PS won't fill the left one unless the WBC is at least 4.0). I've eaten a lot of spinach salads and a lot of red meat, hoping that it will be at least 4. Whether it is or isn't, there is still my appointment later today with my PS. And I believe I'm going to have a mini-breakdown in her office when I undress. Not because \"I'm ugly\", or \"IT's ugly\", or anything to do with looks....... but because it means I'm not on the path of healing that I had been on. I had looked at this as a straight path of healing... Double-mastectomy, starting reconstruction right away with tissue expanders, continue to get the expanders filled weekly during my chemo treatments. By the time chemo is done the breasts would look perfect (although nipple-less, until later, but who cares), then I'd get radiation, then go back to work and my normal, fun, active life, and a year later get the expanders switched out for implants, and have nipples reconstructed or tattooed, or whatever the PS decided.\nThat's not my path anymore. One side of my body has taken an ugly step backward and I'll need yet another major surgery in between chemo and radiation that I'll have to heal from before radiation can begin, and then start the process of filling that expander every week. \nUgh..... I dread today. ",

Then this afternoon I had my second chemo treatment, which, like the first, went very smoothly. Hopefully the added anti-nausea drug, Varubi, will help me not to repeat the pattern of last time....wherein as the night went on, and then the next couple days, nausea increased to the head over the toilet level. \nMy oncologist asked me to defer getting the colonoscopy that the cardiologist wanted me to get, until after I am done with chemo.

      "Content": " Well. The coughing is continuing. Up to the point where I feel like I'm going to black out. That feeling happened last time, when it ended up turning into pneumonia. But it doesn't continue on for more than a few minutes, whereas before my coughing fits lasted anywhere from 20 minutes to over 3 hours. The morning after my surgery I had a chest CT and it showed no pneumonia. Looking at my previous posts, it looks like my coughing started around Nov. 15, so I am filled with fear and helplessness. \nThe infected, red area near my surgery site has not spread, but it has not gone away, either. \nHere is a lesson for everybody-- get every vaccine that is out there! When I found out I had cancer, I thought I was doing everything I could by getting a flu shot and a shingles vaccine. I IGNORANTLY believed that to get pneumonia, you had to get the flu first. So, by getting a flu shot, I thought that meant I wouldn't get pneumonia either. WRONG WRONG WRONG \nEverybody please get both a flu shot and a pneumonia vaccine. If I had gotten both, I (most likely) would not have gotten pneumonia back in March, and I never would have gotten GBS. And now that I have GBS, I can never get any kind of vaccine again. This is what I've learned through websites and forums, however I still am going to confirm it with my neuro. But overwhelmingly, all the other poor souls who have gotten GBS have said they were told no vaccines of any kind. \nAnd onto a much less serious subject than pneumonia and GBS, I wanted to report that my hair is maybe 2 inches long... which is not good. Most people probably would have 4 inches by now, but I have made my peace with it. The thing I really wanted to say was that it grew back exactly what it looked like before--blond, a little wavy, and the same texture. I've heard so many folks say theirs grew back differently.\nOh--remember I said after my Nov 2 surgery I was \"loopy\" for at least a week?, which normally after surgery I only stay that way a few hours or a day at most. I posted about\n things my husband said I was saying that was all messed up, and about\n really bizarre texts I sent people. I had an appointment with my neuro yesterday, and was sitting in the waiting room, and the PA passed by and did a double-take at me and exclaimed \"Oh, I'm so glad you look so much better today! I'll be with you in a moment.\" I had NO CLUE what she meant. I remember my last visit there and I was doing and looking pretty well! So, I assumed she had me confused with someone else, afterall, it had been awhile since I'd seen her. We get into the patient room and start talking and after a few minutes she realized that I did not remember that I had an appointment there on Nov 8-- that my PS requested I see my neuro right away as I was so out of it. She told me about\n the whole visit... I could barely stand up, I was slumped over in the seat, too weak to sit up straight. I was very weak and had extremely low blood pressure. But I had no cough at that time. This is so bizarre to be told about\n going to an appointment and saying and doing things of which I have ZERO recollection. AND, my husband told me that on Nov 9 we went to lunch at a restaurant and I ate an entire Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. I would NEVER order a PhillyCheese Steak, and I am kind of a dainty eater-- I don't eat any kind of biggish sandwich out in public. I keep asking him if he's pulling my leg, and he has made it clear that he is not. This is kind of funny! But I'm definitely going to have a talk with my doctor about\n the different anesthesia I had this time. What if I didn't have a husband who is home 24/7? Hospitals release you as long as someone says they are going to be with you for the first 24 hours. Without my husband home, I could have been going out and saying and doing God knows what!\n ",

I'll write more about\n the kids' visit when I have more time. \nThe first week they were here I had 3 dr appointments, one of them the very next day, the out-patient surgery to get my port out. The anesthesia went MUCH better than after my Nov 2nd surgery, thank goodness. However the once previously, nearly invisible, scar from when the port was put in, is now very thick and lumpy. At my post-op visit the following week the doctor prescribed a compound cream to be made at one of those specialty pharmacies. The last compound cream prescribed to me was by my neuro, to help with the excruciating pain I have sometimes in my hands..... and insurance would not cover it, so I did not get it. However, to smooth out a lumpy scar, they okay'd that prescript\nion!! I saw on another forum someone say when their insurance wouldn't cover the scar cream, it cost them over $1400! Does this make sense, for insurance not to cover something to ease hideous pain, but wait....i've got some lumpy parts to a one and a half inch scar, let's pay up!!

      "Content": " Happy New Year one and all. I am thinking of what positive things this year will bring for me. It will bring an end to my chemo in mid-April, so that's a great thing. It will bring a surgery in probably early June to switch out my defective tissue expander for a new expander, and then my right breast can start getting filled up to match the perfect shape and size of my (already filled up) left breast. It will bring and finish my course of radiation--30-33 treatments, 5 times a week, starting after I've healed from the surgery, so I'll probably be done by mid-August. \nOh, and in May, after chemo has ended and before the surgery, my son will be graduating from college and I'll go up to see that, plus we'll be finding out what law school he will be going to!! \nSo, by mid-August of 2017 I SHOULD be done with all of my breast cancer treatment that can be done for this year. I have to wait a year after the last radiation treatment for the plastic surgeon to do another surgery to switch out the expanders for silicone implants. So in 2018, I'll be 58, and have great-looking breasts, lol. I saw a T-shirt in the breast cancer store (where they sell the prosthetic breasts and clothing--which I had to get a prosthetic breast to wear since my right side is flat due to the defective expander)-- I saw a T-shirt in that store that said \"Yes, these are fake, my real ones tried to kill me\". I thought that was so funny. Normally, I wouldn't want to call attention to my breasts at all, but given that I'll be 58 and have breasts that a 20 year old would envy, people are going to assume they're fake anyway. So I may just get that shirt. But that's 2018. \nI think I reported that since I got my diagnosis in August 2016, until November, I stressed-ate myself up 25 pounds. And that once I learned it was that much I started watching what I ate and in a few weeks I lost 7 of those 25 pounds. Well, somehow I managed to gain all 7 back! So for 2017, besides sticking to my path of kicking cancer's butt, I am definitely going to lose those extra pounds. By the time my cancer is gone, I want to be ME again (minus the hair, lol)... But then of course the hair will start growing in and maybe I'll get lucky and it will grow fast. I'll try minoxidil. \nI week from today I have my last AC treatment (Adriamycin and Cytoxan), which has been every 3 weeks. Then I switch to Taxol treatment once a week for 12 weeks. If anyone reading can tell me what to expect from Taxol, please let me know! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. ",

      "Content": " So I've been learning about\n Taxol since that is the next chemo med I'll be taking, in my ACT regimen. (AC was Adriamycin and Cytoxan, taken together, 4 treatments, 3 weeks apart). I start Taxol on Jan. 30th, and have 12 treatments, one week apart. \nAlthough most of the side effects are the same-- hair loss, fatigue, nausea, sores inside the mouth, there is also the possibility of neuropathy in the hands and feet. I made sure with my onc that it is okay to take L-Glutomine, as was suggested in another forum, as a way to possibly ward off neuropathy. \nWith AC the actual treatment time-- sitting in the chair with the IV bags-- was about\n 2 hours, followed by another 2 days of getting IV fluids for 2 hours each day. With Taxol the treatment time is 3-4 hours, but no coming back on other days for IV fluids. \nWith AC, at the end of the treatment the nurse would apply the Neulasta patch on my stomach, and it would automatically inject me with the drug 27 hours later (to help bring up WBC). With Taxol, it is not followed by Neulasta. If my WBC is too low, I'll get an injection of Neupogen. While on AC, during the 2nd and 3rd weeks when I was not receiving treatment, I still had to come into the office twice a week to take my blood and check my WBC. With Taxol, there is just coming in every Monday to get it. They'll take my blood first and make sure my WBC is high enough. If it isn't, then I'll get a shot of Neupogen and have to come back another day for the Taxol. \nAnother thing with Taxol is (for just the first 5 treatments) I have to take some steroid pills. Twelve hours before treatment I take 5 pills, then 6 hours before I take another 5 pills. Then for the second Taxol treatment, I take 4 pills 12 hours before, and 4 pills 6 hours before, and each week it's decreased by one pill. My Taxol appointments are scheduled anywhere from 9:30 am to 10:30 am, so I'll be taking the pills the night before, as well as setting my alarm for 3:30- 4:30 am to take the second dose! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.

In any kind of testing I'm used to being in the TOP one percent....... now I am literally in the bottom one percent of brain function, in ten out of 12 categories. I don't have the energy to write more about\n it now because of the other thing that made yesterday a tough day--apparently a crown fell out, leaving a raw nerve and me screaming in agony. It didn't happen until after doctor's hours. From what I've read online folks with dental problems during chemo either had to WAIT until chemo was over before taking care of their problem, OR, chemo has to be delayed to take care of the problem. \nI see my onc on Monday, presumably for chemo, but I'm hoping she'll say I can delay it to get my tooth taken care of, at least with a temporary. However, even this option causes me anxiety.... I had my chemo treatments timed to end just in time for my son's graduation, and depending on how long I have to delay chemo, this throws a wrench in everything. ",

      "Content": " Susie, I hope that hot tub did the trick and helped you feel not so much beaten by a baseball bat! She must've been VERY thorough to make laying on a bed too painful. \nIt took several after hours phone calls but the doctor's office finally wrote a script\n out for (low dose) Vicodin that my husband picked up and that did the trick. One measly pill every six hours and no more pain. \nUnfortunately I ended up getting cold/flu symptoms starting Friday night. Saturday was pretty rough. My temperature got up to 100.3 a couple of times. The magic # is 100.4.... all along my onc has said if my temp ever got to 100.4 I have to go straight to the hospital, so thankfully it never got to that. Sunday the fever was gone, but today, \"chemo Monday\", the other symptoms were still present---cough, runny nose, watery eyes, general achiness (not in the bones, though), and so when I went for my chemo she could not give it to me, we have to skip this week. I am on such a tight schedule. I had ONE WEEK to spare to finish chemo before my son's college graduation. Now that one week is gone. I cannot have any other thing happen to stop my progress. Honestly my son's graduation is THE only good thing happening in my entire life. My marriage is a mess, we are financially ruined, my first born, brilliant, gorgeous, talented son is doing God-knows-what, I am fat, bald, and oh, I have cancer. Being able to see my younger son graduate is the ONLY positive thing I have to hang onto. \nI feel partially responsible for getting sick, because I \"went out\"...... I ventured into the real world. A restaurant and a couple antique stores, and my immune system is ruined enough from chemo (and a loss of lymph nodes, too, I suppose), that I can't fight off a single germ. \nSo for the next 2 months I am going nowhere and seeing no one other than my immediate circle, and all my medical appointments. I have my bone scan set for tomorrow. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. ",

      "Content": " Well this endless coughing has continued through ten days now. The chest xray and the bone scan I had on Tuesday both came back normal. And other than a fever that got to 100.3 9 days ago, every days since then the highest it's gotten is 99.6 every single day. From day one of chemo, my onc has said if it gets to 100.4, go straight to the ER. \nSo last night it got up to 100.9, so off we went to the ER. They did another chest xray, nasal swab, blood draws, got a urine sample, etc. My BP got down extremely low -- like 83 over 52, which has never happened. They ruled out the flu and pneumonia, which is good. So their \"best guess\" at this point before the blood cultures come back in 3 days is bronchitis. I was given a broad spectrum antibiotic and 2 prescript\nion cough medicines, one a capsule, and one is a liquid. Other than my fever dropping to normal, I think the cough suppressants are working as today my coughing bouts have been much shorter and not quite as gut wrenching. Tomorrow I'm due for chemo, and I suspect it will be cancelled again, unless I have a 100% improvement. So I'm praying for my miraculous recovery overnight! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. ",

If they last more than a couple hours I just about\n become insane. \nIf your symptoms did not involve your hands and feet, then I don't think it was GBS. And I, too, had read about\n the link between cancer drugs and neuropathy in the hands and feet. In fact, the drug I was on when I first got side tracked by pneumonia, Taxol, listed neuropathy as a side effect. I made it through my first 5 (out of 12) Taxol treatments before I had to stop treatment due to pneumonia, and it was just as I was getting over pneumonia (after 5 weeks) that I first felt the start of paralysis. I told myself that the neuropathy from Taxol was finally catching up to me as a side effect so I didn't even mention it to my doctor that first day. But on day 2 when I was totally paralyzed from the hips down, I knew this was something much worse.\nWith a lot of hard work with physical therapy I have had a great deal of improvement, especially in my legs. It's my own fault I am not progressing more with my hands. The exercises to do for the hands are SOOOOOO much harder than the ones for the legs, so now that i am home and can pick and choose which therapies to do, I do not pick the painful finger exercises very often. But I MUST. Typing this message has been torture. It feels like it has taken 6 hours to type, fixing mistake after mistake.

      "Content": " Hmmmm. After my 2nd radiation yesterday, again felt achy all over, like in my bones. Today was the third (took only ten minutes), and again I feel achy. I don't want to jump to the immediate conclusion that the achiness is from the radiation, because my husband got sick with flu-like symptoms (including severe all-over body aches) on the same day I started radiation. I don't have any other symptoms, though, while he has sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, coughing, watery eyes, etc. \nI guess I'll read up more on radiation side effects.\nI washed my wig for the first time last night, and I was so nervous about\n how it would look afterward. The lady at the wig store had said to wash it gently in the sink with wig shampoo in cold water, rinse, then turn it inside out and let it air dry on the \nopen wig stand (my stand is not a head form, it's completely \nopen, just a couple criss-crossing, thin plastic pieces). So I checked on it periodically as it dried and it looked like a scraggly mess. Since you aren't allowed to blow dry or use any kind of iron--curling or straightening--I began to freak out.

      "Content": " Susie, I was wondering about\n you being MIA, and fearing it might not be something wonderful like a vacation. Saying prayers for your and your family, and hoping to hear from you soon.\nTo go on with my story, which is very hard for me to write about\n, my stay at Morton Plant boiled down to me hearing \"I'm not willing.....\" by so many nurses and aides, I lost count. Not just about\n myself, but all the 2 Max patients. It's difficult for me to criticize this hospital or the doctors and nurses and aides in it, because in all other departments everyone I've dealt with there has been superb. And I don't mean to frighten anyone who is reading this and is facing breast cancer. Staff who handle breast cancer patients are wonderful! Compassionate, loving, always there for their patients. The fact that in my last post I reported that an aid ripped my gown off over my head, revealing the ugliest full frontal nudity in the history of the world, is something I don't believe ANY other staff would do, except for this small group of nurses and aides working with paralyzed people who apparently are sick of their jobs, tired of having to stretch and strain and lift people who can't do anything for themselves, including wiping their butts. Sorry to sound so crude, PLUS, I'm not trying to make excuses for these people who were not willing to help the paralyzed, but when they did, they did so with a fed-up attitude, and no caring or compassion for their patient. That was their job. If they weren't willing to do their job, and do it compassionately, they shouldn't have been there. \nSo......there were 2 events that happened during my stay there that have scarred me terribly-- in fact, have given me PTSD. One I've told you about\n, the disrobing. The second one I'll tell about\n in just a moment. I just want to preface by saying it was set up because of how over the course of nearly 2 weeks I knew that the nurses and aides on the night shift were not willing to help, AND when help would arrive it would be after a long wait, and the person(s) \"helping\" would be doing so with shade in their eyes and a clearly disgruntled attitude. It's unlike me, as i have a strong ego, but apparently being paralyzed and enduring 12 days of being made to feel like a burden, as someone no one wanted to help, but the second traumatic event there happened because of me not wanting to be a burden to anyone. I was so tired of feeling embarrassed to always need help, and from people who so clearly did not want to help. Obviously it takes a long time for me to get up the nerve to even write about\n this....I'm dragging out saying it, as it was so horrific to me, and reliving it now, just in the time it takes to write about\n, is likely to set off one of my PTSD attacks. But I took half a valium, so here goes. \nOkay, so being paralyzed from the hips down, my legs were like concrete pylons--all I could experience from my lower half was extreme weight...they were dead weight, and in my mind I visualized them as concrete pylons. I was due to be transferred to a different hospital the next day. In the morning two WONDERFUL people from the hospital's physical therapy department worked with me. My arms were less paralyzed now, it was mainly just my hands that were still paralyzed, along with my concrete pylon legs. The 2 physical therapists, using belts attached to me to help lift me off of the bed actually got me in a standing position! I was so happy. I didn't think it was possible! it only lasted a second or two before they helped me back onto the bed. So, that night when I had to go to the bathroom, after I had pushed the button for a nurse, and waited an inordinate amount of time, I decided to try to do it myself. Using my forearms to push my torso up, which took a great deal of effort......oops, I've got to run to a doctor's appointment. I will finish this later today. ",

We also have had either drought or horrendous rains (without the temperature swings), and no matter how much rain we get, 2 days of dry and sunny and the plants start dying. Of course as soon as you water, you get a downpour and then they\u2019re overwatered. Without professional help it\u2019s nearly impossible to keep nice flower beds, or even grass. \n I had my pre-op visit yesterday. The visit went fine, but it wrecked my nerves for the rest of the day and most of today. Just all the horrific memories start flooding in and it takes me a day or so to get a grip and concentrate on the present and future, and not relive what has gone wrong in the past. I am exercising as much as I can. Mostly walking, but I\u2019ve added light weights also. I was just heading for bed and I can feel myself drifting off, so goodnight and I will TTYL. \n Best of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " pt 2. \nThen about\n a week after that my husband and I had each DVRd shows to watch, and I came into the room to watch mine when I thought his was over, but his show had run late and so I caught a minute of it. There was a husband and wife on a couch being interviewed, apparently about\n a bad flight experience. I do not know all the details of what went wrong on their flight but I got the impression it was one of those stories we hear about\n occasionally where a plane can't depart as scheduled, (or people can't de-plane when they arrive) and they are stuck on the plane for an inordinately long period of time. So the maybe one minute of interview I saw had this couple complaining that they couldn't even get the flight attendants' attention to get some water or peanuts. My reaction: I flew into a rage!!! These people are on TV because they couldn't get nuts? Had to stay in their seats for way longer than was comfortable? Maybe the air conditioning wasn't on....I don't know,.....there could be much more to their story but that is the part I heard before I went berserk and started screaming....How about\n not being about\n to get a NURSE'S attention when you need to pee??? How about\n this going on for 12 days, not minutes or hours.... How about\n being paralyzed and having someone disrobe you in front of whoever may be around--- when you've had a double mastectomy and the right breast area was a MESS with the deflated expander and lumps and bumps and scars everywhere.... How about\n being abandoned for so long that I attempted (on my own since NO ONE would come to my aid either like these people waiting for nuts) so I attempted to \"de-plane\" myself from the bed and immediately crashed to the ground and crumbled like the twin towers.......anyway, you get it. I could not take hearing someone get to have TV time on a national show to talk about\n how lousy the airline treated them, when the hospital I was in gets to get away with no one knowing how they mistreat the paralyzed, the extremely obese, and other \"2 max\" patients. It's not that I want to be on TV.. I don't.... I want the hospital's extreme neglect and abuse to be talked about\n on TV. (And I don't mean to make light of anything these or other passengers have gone through, I'm sure it was miserable and maybe gave some folks a lasting anxiety, which is terrible. ) I'm just telling you my reaction to hearing one sentence from a TV show and how it set me off SCREAMING every neglectful and disrespectful thing I went through for 12 days. And of course, mentioning it all like that brings back the feelings of being there, which sets off the PTSD attacks.......\nYikes, I'm a mess..\n ",

I still actually have more pain from the area in my back where the chunk was taken out (the surgery on 11/14/18). I had my post-op visit yesterday and she said I am healing so well that we could schedule the next surgery, which MAY be the last, scheduled for February 18!!! The actual left breast that she constructed from my back tissue to fill in the area mutilated by the staph infection looks BETTER than the right breast! The shape and size is better. What this February surgery will do is even out the contour of my left armpit, and she\u2019ll take fat from my belly to give the right breast a better shape, like the left one has. She will also make nipples for both using belly skin! So it will be like getting a mini tummy tuck. \nEverything is moving so fast now. I have had minor setbacks from Voldemort. But every day I work hard on my leg strength and balance, so I think I am not far behind. I take EXCEPTIONAL care to avoid germs for at least 2 weeks pre-ops and 2 weeks post-ops. \nWell it is late and I should rest. I can feel pain in my back so sleep doesn\u2019t come easily. \nI hope you and hubby are doing well. TTYL ",

      "Content": " Hi Susie. Thanks for removing my last name, I didn\u2019t know that was a no-no. I wouldn\u2019t want to get put into forum jail! \nYes, I painted as a child, very young, I started drawing as soon as I could hold anything in my hands, and then my mom started getting me canvases and paints and easels probably by age 4 or five. Back then I only painted seascapes. Over and over again. some of them with a palm tree, some of them with a dock, some of them with a pelican sitting on one of those wood posts. Just endless seascapes, and a few horses, because all girls love horses. \nWhen I started taking piano lessons at about\n age 9, I gave up painting and was consumed with the piano, until I went away to college. And in the decades since then I have only drawn or painted maybe a dozen times. I was in charge of an art project at my sorority for Rush Week and when the boys were in elementary school I did a painting for a Halloween event. And when they were in elementary school I actually did a couple paintings on commission! But once I got busy with the kids and other activities, I did not paint or draw again. \nYou know Voldemort made it so that I can\u2019t do any of the physical activities that I used to do, at least not yet anyway. \nAnd although the palms of my hands are partially paralyzed, I decided I would try to draw or paint since I couldn\u2019t do any of the other activities that used to keep me so busy. \nI honestly did not know if I would be able to draw or paint anymore. Not because of the partial paralysis, but because I thought the talent had disappeared from not being used. I don\u2019t mean to sound egotistical, but I have impressed myself! I really didn\u2019t know I could do all that I have done. Like I said I really had only done seascapes in oil painting. And the style was always realism. And the thought of ever painting a face never even occurred to me, as I thought that was impossible. And now I\u2019ve painted faces, which I think have turned out quite well, and as you\u2019ve seen I\u2019ve painted all kinds of different animals and subjects, and use different styles like impressionism, and abstract. \n Well I certainly am hogging this whole text about\n me. I\u2019m so sorry you had the stomach bug and the flu, but happy to hear that you got medicine for it and are on the mend. How is your weather right now? We are having a wonderful cold front. For the last two or three days it\u2019s gotten down into the upper 40s I believe. This is the weather that I love love love. Normally I would be outside walking quickly, but I am staying inside to avoid germs. And, I\u2019m not supposed to be walking quickly yet, not supposed to get my heart rate up yet \u2014the last surgery was just 13 days ago. Although it seems like it was months ago for some reason. \n How is your husband doing? And how old is your grandson now? If you are on Facebook again say hi to me! TTYL ",

      "Content": " I finally got my drains out yesterday (in 2 days it will be 4 weeks since my double mastectomy). I FEEL great, but the doctor says I am still healing and not to do anything, no working out. Exercise was a big part of my life before this happened. The only way I've ever been able to manage my weight has been through heavy exercise (which, luckily, I enjoy). She also put more saline in my tissue expanders. I am obeying the doctor's orders and doing almost nothing. \nMy mammaprint test will not be ready until Oct. 31, and there is the slim, nearly miraculous chance that the test could say I don't need chemo. But chemo is set to start Nov 7, so we are proceding as if that is the case. I see the oncologist's PA later today for something, not sure what. And the nurse from my surgeon's office called and said the \"tumor board\" had met and discussed my need for radiation and concluded I \"might benefit from radiation\"....Really? MIGHT? What kind of wishy-washy statement is that? I went ahead and made an appointment with the radiology oncologist for 2 days from now, but I am going to have to hear \"compelling\" reasons to add radiation. I mean, supposedly they got all my cancer with the surgery. I'll be (most likely--I'm planning on it, anyway), having months of chemo treatment to kill any stray cancer cell that MAY have wondered through my body. I need to hear more than \"might\"!! \nIf anyone reading this can offer any insight, please do! I'm all alone in this, basically, having never known a person who's ever had cancer. So everything is new to me. Since my diagnosis, I have discovered that a friend from work went through this a few years ago, and my dental hygienist. But I truly welcome input from all. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this.\n ",

      "Content": " So, my first chemo was a breeze! The actual chemo part was a breeze, but the overall appointment was quite long, almost 5 hours, and only the last 2 were spent getting the chemo. The 3 hours before that involved a lot of waiting (the waiting room was the busiest I've ever seen it, maybe 4 times as many people there as I've ever seen before). Then my time with the nurse went quickly, with her drawing my blood --from my port, no more using arm veins, which is nice--, taking my blood pressure and getting weighed. From the time I learned I had cancer I began stress-eating. Heavy duty stress-eating! And it's embarrassing, but from the time I saw my OBGYN on 7/22 to 10/13 when I got weighed at the oncologist's office, I gained TWENTY-FIVE pounds. Yikes. I knew I had gained \"some\", but finding out it was that much straightened me out, and I stopped binge-eating all the high cal foods in which I had been indulging. Each doctor visit since 10/13 when I started being more in control, my weight has gone done a pound or so, and as of today I have lost 7 of the 25 I have gained. So I felt good about\n that. After the nurse saw me there was another longish wait until I was able to see the oncologist. She was with me for quite awhile reviewing all kinds of info. The liver scan I had last week (because a blood test had shown elevated enzymes) was normal. The echocardiogram I also had last week, which is done as a baseline since the Adriamycin damages your heart, was not normal. I have a \"diastolic dysfunction\" and now I'll have to see a cardiologist, too. This really surprised me. I would not have imagined anything being wrong with my heart. My entire adult life I have done major cardio exercise several times a week. I've always had a low heart rate and low blood pressure. Until now. I thought the HR number being higher, as well as the higher BP, was due to the stress of the cancer (on top of many other major stresses I have in life), but I guess not. \nSo, three hours after all of that, I finally get to go into the chemo room, and sit in the comfy recliner. All I can really say about\n the 2 hours of getting the various IVs is that it felt cold in my veins. I felt a twinge of nausea by the end of it (no big deal), and just a tad bit achey (also no big deal). The nurse assured me that this would be the only easy visit. Of course in three weeks, for the 2nd round of chemo, I'll be bald, and unknown how I'll feel physically at that time. She warned me that by the 3rd (of the 4 total of these chemo drugs), I will be saying \"thank God there's only one more after this, as I can't take it\"..... So I am relishing the good times while they're here. I took an hour walk after I got home with a gf who lives down the street, and now I am just settling in to watch the shows I have DVR'd from last night. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this!\naddendum: Miss Positive spoke to soon! My first chemo day was not as breezy as the day went on. Nausea grew by the hour from about\n 9pm to midnight, when I knocked myself out with a valium so I could sleep. I have an anti-nausea \"Sancuso Patch\" on, I took my prescript\nion anti-nausea meds, plus I had anti-nausea meds in my IV drip before the chemo meds, and I sucked on ginger candies to calm my stomach. So without all of that, I'm sure it would have been much worse. I'm thankful today I woke up feeling great, got a morning walk in, and hopefully I'll have a chance to vote today before I go back to the cancer center to get a 2-hour flush of IV saline.\n ",

      "Content": " Thank you, Susie.\nThe last few days have been a mixed bag. Some days too tired to move, but no nausea. Other days non-stop nausea but I'll have lots of energy. This is my 10th day after my first chemo...I keep anxious track of the days since 98% of everyone I've talked to says I'll go bald anywhere from day 14 to day 17. My friend at work who went through this shedded so much on day 10 she shaved what was left off. But one of the nurses at the cancer center said not to expect it until day thirty. She must've been on crack that morning, as I've never heard anyone say anything remotely that long. \nAnyway, I went yesterday for my blood count, and my white blood cells were very low (2.7-- and normal is 4.2-10. The morning before chemo my WBC was 8.9). I asked my onc if my WBC was okay enough for me to still get my scheduled \"fill up\" on my breast expanders that was scheduled for the next day (this morning).... she said No, and I was so obviously disappointed that she ended up hemming and hawing and giving me a print out of my complete blood count and said to let the plastic surgeon decide. More about\n that later.\nWe also discussed my mammaprint results. I had not seen my onc since I got the results a couple weeks ago, it was her PA who had called me and said that I was \"high risk\", and when I asked her for the number, she said \".097\"...... I recognized right away that number was not in the high risk zone (by a smidgen), but let it go, because I knew there were other factors besides the mammaprint test that indicate whether chemo is needed or not, like my high Ki-67 result... which was 48%, and that the cancer in the one node that had cancer had escaped the capsule. So yesterday talking to my onc, we went over the mammaprint results. I swear I had heard the PA correctly, but Lord knows my brain has been in such a fog, I will assume I heard her incorrectly. The true number was not \".097\" as I had heard...it was NEGATIVE .0097\"... and ANY number that is negative is considered high risk. For mammaprint the range is very small. From -1.0 up to zero is high risk/chemo recommended... from zero to 1.0, it is low risk, chemo not recommended. No grey area with this test. So my # was BARELY negative, but it did put me in the high risk group, so that's that.\nWe discussed what high risk means in my case. Based on every test result done on me, including the genetic and genomic tests, pathology reports, etc-- AFTER getting chemo there will be an 11.7% chance that the cancer could return to some other part of my body. We discussed radiation. If I get radiation when I'm done with chemo (as I had been resolved to do), that will increase the odds to 95% that cancer will not return to that breast, my left one. The right breast had non-malignant cancer so would not be radiated, even though it was removed and is being reconstructed just like the left breast. But the odds of cancer coming back to the rest of my body would still be 11.7%... so only a 5% chance after radiation that cancer will come back to my left breast, but still 11.7% that it could come back somewhere else, the likely places being brain, lung, bone.\nSo, back to my onc giving me a copy of my blood count to give my PS today, for her to decide about\n proceeding with my planned fill up. NO. My WBC was 2.7, and it has to be at least a 4.0 before the PS would stick a needle in me for the fill up. I think my onc HAD to have known that the PS would say this, I think she just didn't have the heart to give me what I considered bad news, as I was excited that I was going to get \"filled up\" the next day, and she didn't want to burst my bubble. I have mixed emotions about\n that, because it's a 45 minute drive to my PS office for her to tell me NO. However I recognize that oncologists probably have to give people bad news so often that this one little thing (which wasn't truly \"bad\" news, just disappointing that I'd have to wait), she decided to let someone else tell me. I am fine with her decision. She's a great doctor.\nNow, on to some more disturbing news which I learned at my ill-fated PS appointment. I believe I had reported before that one breast wasn't filling up as much as the other, even though the same amount of saline had been put in both of them each time. The last fill up I got the doctor and I mentioned how the right one was smaller and she said that can happen sometimes for various reasons and that the next time I came in she would just fill up only the right side to even them out. It has happened to other patients and all was well and good. Wellllll, since I was there today anyway, she examined me and said that my right breast seemed even smaller than it was at the last visit. Meaning it isn't holding the fill. Possibly. She said that since it's a \"blind\" injection-- guided by the magnet..\n the place where she inserts the needle is located by her putting a magnet over each breast and finding the exact spot and marking it with a dot. So the dot is in the right place when she does the injections, but it is still considered \"blind\" as there's no way to see that the needle is definitely going into the right spot. What reason could there be for it to NOT go in the right spot? Well, there could be a ripple in the expander, there could be a fatty deposit or scar tissue or something that makes the needle not hit the right spot, and the saline could just be injecting into \nopen space, not going into the tissue expander at all, OR, and here's the really bad part, OR the needle might miss the exact spot and puncture the expander, rendering it useless, that saline already in it will leak out and any further saline put in would just continually leak out. And the ONLY solution is surgery. Major surgery. I'd have to be \nopened up, the right tissue expander removed, and a new one put in, and of course surgery cannot happen until after my 6 months of chemo, then a month to get over the last dose, then 6 weeks to heal from that second surgery before she can start the fill ups on the right side. Then I would start the radiation much later that originally planned, meaning the third surgery (to switch out the expanders for implants), will be pushed further away.\nIn order to know for sure she has to be able to fill up my right side, and then see if it holds..... we couldn't do the fill today because of my stupid low WBC. I go again tomorrow (Thursday) for blood work and IF my WBC is 4.0 or higher, I can call and come in Friday morning to get the right side filled up. I googled \"foods that raise white blood cell count\" and ate as many of them as possible the rest of the day. \nI am hoping tomorrow my WBC will miraculously go from 2.7 to at least a 4.0 so that I can get a fill up on Friday so we can see what my future holds....... I told my husband and my 3 besties to pray extra hard that the problem is NOT that the expander has a puncture. ",

      "Content": " We survived Irma! Just lost all power for a few days, which is not fun, but I think I've read that there are still a million Floridians without power, so I know we're lucky. We had part of our chimney fly off, and some rather large oak tree branches from our yard and from neighbors' yards to clean up. Some houses in our hood were not as lucky. We are in a heavily treed area, with many huge, old oaks. \nI called my PS today to see if we have a date set yet for my reconstruction. Again I was told they didn't have all the information collected yet to set a date. I asked what doctor or doctors did they still need info from, and we could go get it and deliver it to their office. She said, No, they still were just working on figuring it out and they'll call when they have a date.\nA part of me thinks \"this is sounding ridiculous\". But then I look at my left breast, which is so perfectly done and with invisible scars, and I think , \"okay, I'll wait, she must have a good reason\". I still believe it's because of the GBS. She must feel like she has to check on every drug and procedure I will have, to make sure that it won't set off my GBS again. So I'm being unusually patient. \nIrma has messed with my workout routine. There is so much clean up to do, and of course I really can't do much in a walker, but I try. We boarded every window and had sandbags across one side of the house, and inside the house a couple hundred paintings, crystal, china, and antiques had all been stored safely. It seems to take a LOT more effort to put things back than it did to take them down.\nI know when I first got GBS and I disappeared for 5 weeks, one of my first posts back I said i was going to have to tell the horror story of my first 2 weeks in one hospital, before I was sent to another one for 3 weeks. But actually, I've been unable until very recently to even think about\n it. Both hospitals had sent questionnaires to fill out about\n their service. The second hospital questionnaire I filled out right away with glowing reviews. The questionnaire from the first hospital I couldn't bring myself to look at for four months. It just sat on the coffee table staring at me. I'm not ready to \"go public\" and post about\n it here yet, but I filled out the questionnaire and added a typed, 6 page history of my treatment and mailed it out today. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all!

      "Content": " A girlfriend reminded me of something yesterday that I have accepted as normal, and that is that being treated for cancer means I have four or more appointments every single week. And looking back at my calendar, I can say four is the minimum. Often it is five, sometimes, six. \nI started my first entry in this forum by confessing I hadn't seen my OBGYN since I had my last child 21 years ago. That is a telling indicator of how often I used to see ANY doctor. I suffered from (literally) tennis elbow for a full year before I went to the doctor about\n 3 years ago to get a prescript\nion and an arm brace. I never really got colds, or sore throats or UTIs or anything else to make me pick up the phone and actually make an appointment with a doctor. I had four back surgeries back in 2004 and the second I needed no further treatment for my back, I went back to my usual \"avoid the doctor\" lifestyle. \nSo it's a bit funny that my life revolves around doctors' appointments. And this will be true for anyone who starts treatment for breast cancer. During weeks that you get chemo, you will also go 2 more times to get flushed with IV fluids and receive anti-nausea meds; if you're having reconstruction, you will also be going to the plastic surgeon once a week. And because you have cancer and are receiving dangerous chemo drugs, your oncologist will be very careful and have you see various other doctors to \"rule out\" potential problems. I always thought of myself as the healthiest person in the world and now I'm being seen by every specialist there is. \nI'm pointing this out just so everyone can learn that this IS the new way of life once you have cancer. I'm not complaining. I am GRATEFUL that all the treatment I'm getting is killing my cancer, and the various other doctors visits are making sure I stay healthy. \nI think about\n what I do far, far more than I ever did before. I had been totally without thought as to the physical consequences my actions could have on me. If I wanted to plant something in the garden and there was a buzz of wasps or bees lurking near me, I planted away, believing \"I'm doing my thing, they're doing theirs, we won't bother each other\". Now I have to wonder if an insect bite or sting could cause lymphedema, or have some heightened effect if it happens to be one of the days that my immune system is low. I do craft projects, and now I find myself searching for a thimble to make sure I don't even get a pin-prick. I don't walk outside without shoes. I really could go on and on here, listing all the ways I don't just do whatever I want to do as I used to before. Like I said, though, these aren't meant as complaints.... Just statements of facts, this is the new reality. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. \nOh, my right boob is still down by 1/3 of an inch-- I am glad it hasn't gone down any further. If it holds at this amount, it will still be a half inch larger than it was before the fill up. ",

We are worrying over Irma now. I'm in the Clearwater area (near St.Pete/Tampa). I've been here nearly all my life and have never evacuated before. A couple times we put up sandbags to prevent water from coming in the house, and taken in all the outdoor furniture and hanging plants and other things that could be flying objects in high winds.

      "Content": " Good morning folks. Sounds like ya'll are hanging in there well enough. \nWhich is why I've been hesitant to write! I know it's safe here for me to vent my heart out and bemoan my fate, but sometimes I think if anyone new to facing cancer picked up this thread, after reading about\n my latest travails, they might slam closed their laptop and run screaming, as they hurl themselves off a second floor balcony. \nSo....... I was set for what was going to be close to my last reconstruction on 7/17, enough that while clothed, both my breasts would look symmetrical and in the Florida heat I could wear \"normal necklines\" with normal bras. After about\n ten days or so, the \"uniboob\" look went away and i could clearly see two distinct breasts, roughly the same size, and I could wear real summer necklines!!! Woohoo! \nKnowing that I'd have to still have another surgery to even them up, and then to do nipples, no longer bothered me as much.\nBut then..... one early afternoon after a girlfriend left after a short visit, I felt like I'd been hit by a bus, like when you get knocked out by the flu or something. I ached from head to toe, had a cough, had diarrhea, and then a fever. I was too sick to call, but my husband called both my PS and my PCP and they agreed to call in an RX for amoxicillin 500 mg. My PS had apparently gone off on vacation as soon as my surgery ended, but her back up service I guess coordinated with her. So a couple days later was a post office visit with my PS. To my surprise, she wasn't there but I saw her PA. Although I still felt I had a bit of a cold, my breast shapes were starting to please me and I clearly saw the light at the end of the tunnel. So during the visit, the PA takes her laptop and photos me directly to my PS. (I've seen the resolution on her laptop, and it is frighteningly accurate.) So the PA comes back in and says 'we've called the emergency room --the hospital is like a block away-- and they are waiting for you. We feel you have an infection. \nShe pointed out how the skin of my upper chest area was still pretty red and I needed to go to the ER right away.\nI was there for about\n a week, and most of it is a blur. I just remember hearing \"flesh eating staph infection\" and \"possible MRSA\", and doctors I didn't know coming in and out of my room all the time saying they \"hoped\" the second breast could be saved and how much more of the chest wall I was going to lose. Well....... I left the hospital with \"most of the redness\" cleared up on the right side, and my left side was GONE. Not mastectomy flat chested, but take a 10 year old boy's flat chest and then take a shovel and dig out a good portion of the left side of the body. I came home having to have a portable IV with my strongest medicine, as well as taking high doses of Cipro, and still not totally positive the right side was in the clear....Unfortunately, this is all I can write right now, as I have to leave for the first of 3 doctors' appointments today. I will fill y'all in with gorey details later!!\nBest of health and a positive attitude to all.\n ",

      "Content": " Well, I should have been able to predict this: the mammaprint test came in JUST BARELY on the side of not needing chemo. The range of chemo being recommended is -1.0 to 0.0..... the range for chemo not being needed is 0.0 to +1.0.\nMy score is .097. *sigh* Technically that is in the \"does not need chemo\" range....but just barely. And according to my oncologist, that score does not sway her into believing I won't benefit from chemotherapy. SOOOO, chemo will begin in five days. I've heard average time for hair loss is 17 days... that will put me bald on Thanksgiving day. And I will be truly thankful. \nAlso, I saw my plastic surgeon today, and although the radiology oncologist said my reconstruction has to wait 6 months from the date of the last treatment, my PS says she waits an entire year to get the best results. So, that takes care of that. It won't happen until approximately June, 2018, so I'll definitely have to incur that $$$$$$ insurance out of pocket deductible again. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this.\n ",

      "Content": " So I did start the process with the EEOC as my first step to find out if I was wrongfully terminated. I was so sure that I was not, but since a couple of people have mentioned that I should look into it further, I am. I don't want to be stupid or naive, just because it is my natural inclination to believe that I was treated fairly. We'll see what the legal minds have to say about\n it.\ni had to look back to the beginning of the thread almost to find out just how long ago my right expander failed, and I was surprised it was so long ago.... early to mid-November. So for ten and a half months I have had what is a truly horrible looking (and feeling) disaster on the right side of my chest. The \"hardness\" of the other expander does not bother me, as it can't be felt with the expander filled up and rounded out. But on the right side, where it all just collapsed and caved in, there is an easily viewed, and felt, very hard and round \"lid-shaped\" THING under my skin. \nAnd tomorrow morning it will be SIX WEEKS & THREE DAYS since I was at my PS office to get, what I thought, would be a surgery date to swap this disaster out for a new one. I was disappointed to walk out that Monday without a date, and to have to wait until \"maybe up to the end of the week\", as the doctor had said, to get the date. I still have not heard a thing. \nTwo times when I called the office to ask if there was a date yet, I was put on hold while she checked my file or whatever, and was then told both times that the doctor was still getting the information she needed before being able to set it up. I called again yesterday, during business hours, but got the answering machine, and I left a detailed message about\n how anxious I am to get a date, and even more just to get an update as to what the hold up is, and if there was anything I could do to help. No call back before close of business yesterday and no call back today. \nI have been patient. I have thought about\n what \"things\" could be holding it up-- like she wanted to have written confirmation from each of my doctors that it was okay to proceed even though I have GBS. So I allowed a decent amount of time for that. Then Hurricane Irma had a significant impact on my county and some doctors' offices were closed for up to 2 weeks. \nBut WHY hasn't anyone been able to tell me what is causing the delay? I'm starting to feel like I've been \"dumped\" by my doctor. It can't be something that she's happy about\n.....to have to re-do a surgery because of a product failure. Maybe she called the insurance company for pre-authorization and they said \"the patient already had surgery for tissue expanders, we're not covering it again\".......Honestly, if that is the issue, I may lose my mind and not recover it. I CANNOT deal with the endless insurance problems, denials, appeals, any longer. I have started imagining my life going on with my chest being left as it is..... if she's \"dumped me\", I guess she won't be switching out my left expander for the implant, either! This is where my mind starts to spiral out of control, and all I want to do is curl up in a ball on the couch and cry and watch TV and just not deal with any of this again...When I imagine that I have enough \"oomph\" to DO anything, I've thought about\n calling my surgeon, who coordinated the original mastectomies with this PS so she could start my reconstruction by putting these expanders in as soon as he was finished getting the cancer out, and asking HIM if he has heard from her, or should he recommend a different PS to \"finish up\". But I hate that idea, too, as I can't imagine anyone doing a better job on making all these scars virtually invisible.... But then again, what good are invisible scars on one side, and a hideously deformed, caved-in, and lumpy looking (from the \"lid\" shaped expander showing through my skin), on the other side? If another, less technically proficient doctor did my right side, and the scars look bad....that's got to be a better result than I have right now.....then again, I am CERTAIN that bringing another doctor into the mix WOULD cause questions/delays, etc with my insurance company, and I really am just imagining that no one is going to take responsibility for this mess ....okay, see how I'm spiraling? \nThis was supposed to be the \"easy\" part. Reconstruction. I heal well and quickly from surgeries. I already got the cancer out of the way, done with chemo, done with radiation, and this surgery (although an extra one that most women do not have to deal with), I was ready for--- looking forward to, even. And now nothing is easy again. I was looking forward to the surgery as a RELIEF almost, as it would be a clear sign I was moving past just being a person with GBS. I'd be a woman who was moving toward completing the process of recovering from cancer. Ugh, my brain is going around in circles.... circles that are spiraling the drain.\nIn less than 30 minutes it will be 9/28 (EST), which is exactly one year since my mastectomies. ",

      "Content": " We finally have cool weather here in Florida, which I love! However the 10 day forecast has us back to the mid 70s by the end of 10 days. I absolutely HATE IT if it is warm on Christmas, so i'm hoping for another cold front to come through. \nI haven't received any news about\n my abdominal ultrasound, which I am presuming means it was normal. The doctor would have the results by now and if there were an abnormality they would have called me. And, surprisingly, when I went for the consult to the gastroenterologist to consult about\n getting the colonoscopy, he reviewed all my medical history and said he did not think I was a candidate for the test, just because I've been slightly anemic for a year. He said I could do an at-home test where I smear stool samples on 3 cards, from 3 different days, then bring it back to the lab for testing. So, i will turn in those tomorrow to the lab.\nRemember I had begun making progress with my 4 little exercises I use to do daily, pre-cancer. Well, once I had the Nov. 2 surgery to exchange the defective tissue expander, that put a halt to my exercises for a couple weeks. And also I've been battling this cough AGAIN, which is triggered when I talk or move. SO, in the few minutes here and there when I'm not coughing I have attempted the exercises and I have lost so much ground \n. I can only do 3 push ups. My splits are so unimpressive. The abs I can still do 50 crunches, but the last ten are a real effort. But that's okay. I am willing to put in whatever effort it takes to get back to my pre-cancer lifestyle. However, unless the last 5-10% of my nerve damage in my feet and hands recovers from GBS, i may NEVER get back to a pre-cancer lifestyle. Doing the ten-point balance routine, I remember before surgery I was so happy that I made progress to the point where I could pivot and not have to reach to the counter for support. It wasn't without wobbling, but it was a hugely satisfying milestone to reach. Now I have regressed so much I need support after a couple seconds even from the starting position.........so there is a long road ahead of me. \nThis cough is really annoying, and limits much of what I can do, or say. But I don't WANT another xray or CT scan of my chest.......I've lost count of how many I've had in the last 16 months. I am taking Delsym and extra vitamin C, but apparently that is not enough. I DON'T want to go to the doctor over a cough. I DON'T want more xrays or scans over a cough. I am so sick of being tested out the yingyang over everything. \nPlanning for Christmas is especially stressful and depressing because my 23 year old son is \"off the grid\"....Rather than pursuing education all the way up to a PhD, which was always his own plan and desire, until the last couple of years, he does not want to be part of the world at all, in the way the most of us are. No possessions, no phone, no home, no money. I am sobbing as I write this. I know kids grow up and move away sometimes, and sometimes can't make it home for Christmas. But that's not what this is. He possibly won't even be aware of when Christmas day is, unless he is scratching off tally marks for the days and months that he's been living in a hut he built somewhere in a 240 acre forest in Northern Virginia. The hut has no heat (or a/c) or mattress or anything. And it is snowing there! I literally start to lose my mind when I think of what could befall him, and I am so worried as to WHY he suddenly switched from being a PhD candidate who knew the career path he wanted and lived the totally normal life of a college student, to being what he is now. I can't take it. But I've mentioned \"issues with my older son\" so many times I figured I would fill in the blanks. We were always SOOOOOO close. And to change into a totally different human being who does not want contact with \"the world\" at all, it's a stress that sets me off into crying jags several times a day as I prepare for Christmas. Every decoration we did together, every decoration has a memory of the time and age he was when we either made it or picked it out at the store. I have to stop.\nOn the positive side, my 22 year old is coming home on the 17th. I haven't seen him in 5 months, as he's been in DC for law school. On the 18th I get my port removed, which is out-patient surgery, and I've got appointments with various doctors that whole week before Christmas. I want to try to make his homecoming as normal and happy as possible. He has described his first semester of law school as extremely stressful, and his days are full of studying 12 hours a day, every day. Our house has always been VERY festive at Christmastime, with many food and decorating traditions that involved both sons. It's just so hard to be Mrs Happy Happy Happy, when a part of me is filled with so much grief and worry over his brother. \nOkay, sorry, I got WAY off the subject of this thread which is breast cancer.\n ",

This is very uplifting to read, as you've gone through so many horrible things, yet here you are, always with a good attitude, and so helpful and supportive. So thank you.\nYes I got an infectious disease doctor immediately. He visited me every day in the hospital (a week, I think) and when I put a call into him a week or so ago, he actually personally returned my call within a half hour. I had a question for him about\n when to stop the IV I came home with. I don't even know if I mentioned that besides several days in the hospital with an IV of Ancef, I was sent home with an IV of it as well, plus a bottle of Cipro pills. \nAnyway, I have an appointment with him tomorrow and I am praying with my latest blood results and physical examination he will say it's gone. I know redness is a sign of infection--not just staph, but any, and i have healed so much, but I am still a bit red over the area where the big chunk was carved out of my body, and the right reconstructed/implanted breast looks perfect except there is some redness. Remember the first time my PS saw me after the left side was chopped off, she saw redness on the right side and said \"we may not be able to save the right one\". SOOOO, obviously I'm anxious and really a screaming and crying wreck waiting to find out. Just in the last couple days my hours-on-end sobbing has diminished to only crying when I think of the exact subject of my butchered left side. I have become used to thinking the right side is safe and I've managed to even think some positive thoughts about\n the future, even with this ugly hole in me.... knowing I have months or longer before there will be more scary surgeries. \nOh well, I shall write after I get the verdict on the right one.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all.

The results had shown a diastolic dysfunction. So today I saw a cardiologist. He did another EKG (which I had done a few days before surgery in September and it was fine then). Today's results had some abnormalities. The doctor said based on my echo and the EKG, he needs to get some other test results. SO I'll be coming back Friday for blood tests (the lab was closed already today as mine was the last appointment of the day), and having to come back two more times--one for a CT scan of my chest (with iodine contrast, yuck), and for another echo and stress test. Then a follow up visit with him to go over all these tests results. Plus, since my recent blood work has shown I'm slightly anemic, and there is no known reason for it (I'm not menstruating), and since I'm over 50, he advises that I get a colonoscopy to see if there is blood in my stool. I told him I had done one of those mail-away colon tests and it was negative, and he said that just means that particular sample did not have blood in it, but the only way to be sure is to have a colonoscopy. So this one visit today has created five more appointments. \nI came home feeling numb, not even able to tell my husband about\n the appointment, when I learned some very bad news about\n one of my children. So I am a tense wreck. Waiting now for my other child to arrive home from college for Thanksgiving, so I'm working very hard at putting a smile on my face.

      "Content": " Thank you, Susie. Your post means a lot to me. I can't believe you are related to and know so many people with breast cancer! Wow, I'll bet you have heard it all. Thank you for the good wishes for my husband's disability, too. He has had diabetes for over 20 years, and it has NEVER been under control, although he has been on meds for all these years. His A1C has never been correct, and each day is a struggle for him. Throughout the day his blood sugar will go from maybe 45 at one time, and he's shaking and feels like he could pass out, to later in the day being 165, then another time 365, then back to a \"normal\" range, like 100. And he feels BAD at each of these numbers. He has NO energy, ever. After waking, he stays up for maybe an hour before needing to nap. The whole day is a battle to not go back to bed. He can never feel his feet, except for pain. A lot of times he is driving and will remark \"I have no idea what my feet are doing\". Luckily the brain is still sending the correct messages to the feet (for example: push on the brakes now), and the feet are obeying, although he can't feel that they are obeying. From what I know of diabetes, it can affect every organ in the body, including the brain. He and I have both noticed a crippling loss of brain function over the last 20 years. He literally has no enjoyment in life. \nHe's been denied twice for disability, the last time was a year ago. Now we are waiting for his case to go before a judge, and there is no idea on a timeline as to how much longer that could be. People who have not experienced this level of disability from diabetes just cannot understand. If he were not my husband, \"I\" would not understand. Other than my experiences with him, the only information I have on living with diabetes is all the commercials on television, that all show healthy-looking, ACTIVE people, showing them playing golf, or working in a work-shop with their grandkids, or playing touch football with their peers, climbing hiking trails with their spouses...whatever, as the commercial narrator says \"take miracle drug Z and don't let diabetes keep you down\"... Well, he has taken all of the miracle drugs seen advertised and there is no working in a work-shop, or playing golf or touch football, hiking, or ANYTHING. What there is is just barely making it through the day, with one or two, or more, naps during the day. \nOkay, that was a lot of venting for me. He's been dealing with this for so long, and no one seems to understand he CANNOT function to carry on a normal life, let alone function in a JOB. The receptionist at his disability lawyer's office even said to him, \"I have diabetes and take insulin, and I work\"..... well, she takes 4 units of insulin a day. My husband takes 180 units. \nAnd I do not have long term disability through my job. Lord knows I wish I had purchased it separately now!\nHappy Christmas Eve, everyone!\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. ",

      "Content": " I am here! It's been about\n 2 1/2 weeks since the surgery to exchange the failed tissue expander. i ended up having to stay in the hospital overnight, strictly because of GBS. They had to do my anesthesia differently. And apparently the drugs they gave me were quite long-lasting, as for at least A WEEK after I returned home my husband kept telling me I wasn't making any sense. And I know he was right, I can remember now. And I found texts on my phone that I made to folks a few days after surgery, and there were paragraphs and paragraphs of complete gibberish. Also, for a week I was quite wobbly on my legs. I'd start out in one direction and go heading off sideways. All that has passed now, but it has alarmed me, as in the meantime I have read that surgery can set off a relapse of GBS.\n And although I thought my port removal was going to be done a long time ago, it is not scheduled until 11/29, and I am freaking out that GBS will resurface. I've had a bad cough for the last 5 days. It is starting to get better. Since my surgery is only 9 days away I am not going to go to any public places-- shopping, out to eat, etc, even if i feel good. I just cannot take a chance on getting someone's germs and then being sick and having a procedure delayed again.\n I am seeing the counselor again tomorrow, as I really do think I have PTSD from my hospital stay for GBS (I'm still not able to go public here yet). The morning I was checking out of the hospital from this last surgery for the expanders, a counselor came by to check on me. I had met him before, as he counselled me over a year ago at my surgeon's office the day I got my cancer diagnosis, and we started talking and I ended up telling him what happened during the \"bad\" hospital stay, and about\n the nightmares and thoughts I have now, and he said \"what you've described is PTSD\". I had no idea it was so obvious! But I've got to get over it..... i'll be in a hospital in another 9 days and I can't have these fears tearing me apart.\nAll for now. Time to do what little exercising I can do at this point. ",

      "Content": " I do plan on continuing to write here. I just meant that I couldn't go on with the same subject, being in the emotional state I was in, any longer. I have in the last 3 days or so significantly reduced my number of out of the blue sobbing to nearly zero. And on the subject of what happened in the surgeries of 7/17 and 8/1, I can by now usually talk to my husband or 2 of my GFs without sobbing (I have to stop periodically to get my emotions calmed down), but then I can continue without tears. This is when I start the subject. If from totally out of nowhere something triggers a memory I have a complete meltdown. I was looking through mail, a bill, and wondering why something wasn't charged on there that usually is, and then I said (not knowing that saying it aloud would cause a reaction), \"oh, it's because that was from August 1\", and from being happy as can be I dropped to the ground sobbing and wailing. I sound SOOOOO freaking pathetic. Just reading about\n all this crying is embarrassing to me. \nBut my goal is to document, even what I wish weren't true. I see the new PS next week, and depending on what she has to say, that will influence my outlook totally. Even the \"best news\", that she can fix me to something close to looking normal while clothed, means one or more surgeries. And I am no longer the fearless person I used to be. I've read that once you get staph, it is more likely to recur. Also that even for someone who has never had it, chest surgery is the most likely place for it to occur. So, 2 strikes against me....plus every surgery I have means GBS could worsen. I could tell after the 11/2/17 surgery that it set my GBS recovery back as far as balance is concerned. And the surgeries in July and August have REALLY messed up my balance. Not just balance in the fact that I cannot AT ALL do my 10-point balance routine I used to do before GBS--not even the easiest 1st point. Before the July and August surgeries I had improved a bit with the 10 pt routine (not up to the status I was at by the Nov surgery). I stumble quite a lot for what looks like no reason. I see my neuro next week so I'll find out what he thinks. I literally can't think beyond the day, or moment, really, that I am in. \nAll for now. Best of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " Unfortunately, yesterday my WBC was still too low-- 1.8, so I have to remain a hermit, as I'm at risk of catching anything and everything and having no way to fight it. Boo. \nMy chemo brain is acting up again. I tried writing an email to my workplace's benefits department, and I couldn't get it to come up anyway except as SONG LYRICS. I was writing emails as I've always written emails (or so my brain thinks), and I didn't choose any other style or font or anything, but every time I tried to write it came up as song lyrics. At first I wasn't going to send it, but I need to stay in contact, so a song lyrics email is what they're going to receive. \nSpeaking of chemo brain, I have an appointment tomorrow at a Brain Fitness Center, referred to by my onc for people with chemo brain. I have no idea what the appointment will be like. \nI also go back to the onc's office again tomorrow to see if my WBC has gone up some more. Yesterday when she told me it was still low and that I had to come back Friday, I mentioned it was a $75 co-pay every time I step through the door, and 3 times in one week is just killing us. So the PA (the onc's physician assistant) said she would code the visit in such a way that it wouldn't get billed as an office visit, just as a lab visit, and then the amount should be less. Hopefully that will work, and I mention this so that if anyone else is hit hard with co-pays as I am, that it might be worth letting the doctor's office know. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all reading.

      "Content": " Susie, I hope you're doing okay, keeping busy and no health issues keeping you down.\nI am in a remarkably good mood for someone who has as many BIG problems as I do. And I am giving credit to the counselor, whose free services are provided by the hospital where I had my mastectomies. She has helped me in so many ways to deal with the extra stress that I feel during holiday season. I'm not saying this to brag \"hey, I'm happy!\", but to remind anyone reading that their hospital may offer this free service as well. And with all the expenses we go through with cancer, it is a joy to finally get a well-needed service for free. I know there have been other free services offered also, that I didn't, or haven't yet, taken advantage of. Once a year there is a weekend retreat! There are also the make-up lessons and free make-up products (top name brands), to learn how to do your make-up after you lose your eyebrows and eyelashes, and discounts on permanent \"tattooing\" if you choose that. Which I did. I kept missing all the scheduled classes for make-up tips, and even though I've always been pretty adept at make-up, I just could NOT master drawing on eyebrows, or lining my eyes to make do for the fact there are no lashes. And when my eyebrows finally did grow in, they grew in patchy, and that looked even worse. So I went for the permanent brows and eyeliner and it was a great decision! \nMy Aetna health insurance has given me much to complain about\n, rightly so, but one thing they do right is offer a free wig each year....not sure for how many years. But I got my first wig in Nov 2016 and it was covered 100%, and it was an expensive wig. And now that a year has gone by I am eligible to get another one! Which, sadly, I do need a new one. One of the things that make a wig more costly is how they look at the scalp line. The good ones have an almost invisible fabric that has just a subtle and sparse amount of hair until it gets thicker about\n 1/3 inch in, which is how a real hairline looks. But that invisible fabric with the sparse hairs is also fragile, and with brushing it begins to come apart. In another forum a woman wrote that she was one of the extremely rare people whose hair NEVER grew back after chemo, and therefore she wore wigs almost 24/7 and said a good one can expect to last 8 months. When I first read that I was really surprised. I kinda thought wigs lasted forever! I don't \"over brush\" mine, and I don't wear it 24/7, so I guess that's why it's lasted 13 months instead of 8 months. Anyway, I have ordered a new wig which should be in next week. \nYesterday I had blood work done for my onc. (and just a couple days before I had blood work done for the cardiologist...bleh)....Anyway, I was surprised and disappointed to see that my WBC was low. Normal is 4.2 - 10, and at my last blood work at the onc's it was 9 point something. I THINK before chemo started my WBC had been like 16 or something. So here I haven't had chemo since FEBRUARY and yesterday's test showed my WBC was only FIVE. A measly FIVE. So I don't have many white blood cells to fight off infections, during the most infectious time of the year. And I have no lymph nodes in my left arm, so if I got a cut or insect bite or whatever, in my left arm, I have no lymph nodes to rush to my defense. I'm not really sure what lymph nodes do, lol, but I know it has something to do with getting rid of anything bad that enters your body. No lymph nodes and a pretty low WBC makes me feel so vulnerable, which I CAN'T STAND. Pre-cancer me had always been fearless--one of my most defining traits. But I don't think post-cancer me can be that way anymore. \nWell, it's late here so I'll stop now. Best of health and positive thoughts to all.\n ",

If you live in any kind of populated area, there are usually many, many places that could do your mammo. The place your doctor referred you to has a 2 week wait. But you don't have to go there. Call your insurance company and ask what other radiation centers are covered in your area and see if you can get a quicker appointment. \nBut regardless if you still have to wait the 2 full weeks, try to keep as many positive thoughts in your head as possible. There are many things that could cause your symptoms, and not all of them are \"dreadful\".... Even hearing that it is the dreaded \"cancer\", should not keep you from feeling positive. Getting a diagnosis is the start. Whatever you have, you then start your path toward healing. Hopefully yours will be a short path involving antibiotics or something relatively minor. \nExqualls ",

During AC, the nurses had said to take Clariton on chemo day, and for 2 or 3 days after, and that it would have an off the label effect of preventing bone pain from chemo. So I did take Clariton on those days and I never did get bone pain. Hopefully that will stay true this time as well. \nI took my anti-nausea meds preemptively yesterday so I did not have a repeat of my experience from last week--yeah!!\nS, I hope today finds you well.

I hope you are having a good day as well. \nSo no eyelashes is not fun-- dust and debris land in my eyes all the time, and I guess not having them really effects how I look! Even though (occasionally) I'd put on some liner, and eye shadow, folks still keep saying to me \"Are you tired today?\", \"Don't you feel well?\", \"Have you been crying?\" In my past I have used false lashes maybe 3 times when I was trying to look particularly alluring, lol. And although I remember not liking the feeling of something weighing on my eyelids and I would take them off as soon as possible, I decided I would try false lashes yesterday.\nUm,.... it's a little different now! To put them on, as I recalled, you place them up against your own lash line with a trace of glue running along the bottom of the falsies. Well, now I have no lash line to place them up against! It's like randomly aiming the glue-y strips somewhere on the lid, trying to get them where the lash line used to be, but there's nothing there to \"catch\" the falsies and help them stay put, or stay in an even line, or not just ooze down into the eyeball! \nAfter a few misaligned attempts, I finally got both sets of lashes in approximately the right spots. I was pleasantly surprised that they didn't feel as \"weighty\" as ones that I'd worn in the past had felt. I only wore them for a few hours yesterday, but now I feel a bit more confident that I'll be able to put them on again sometime when I don't care to look unwell, tired, or like I've been crying.

Then the cancer center was exceptionally busy and I had to wait an hour and a half before I could get back to the \"cancer room\". Luckily there was an unoccupied couch in the waiting room where I lay in a fetal position, focusing all my thoughts on not throwing up, while others in the waiting room kept pouring coffee from the nearby coffee pot and the smell of the coffee was sickening to me. After 1 1/2 hours my name was finally called and I could barely stumble my way back toward the nurse. She was very sweet and took my bag and put her arm around me and got me back to the cancer room as quickly as possible. The room was as full as I've ever seen it. I was directed to one of the only \nopen chairs where I then waited maybe another twenty, excruciating minutes. My nausea was overwhelming, and the more I was \"ignored\"--not really, I know that there were just too few nurses to handle all of us sick people-- the more distraught I became, until I was finally curled up in the reclining chair, sobbing quietly. \nBy the time the nurse was able to get to me, he apologized profusely and got permission from my doctor to add some Atavan to my drip. That, plus the anti-nausea meds over the next twenty minutes worked miracles. I was able to sit up and read my magazines like a regular person, instead of the quivering mess of a person that had first sat down. Then 2 hours of IV fluids, and back home, where I was able to take a nice walk with my girlfriend down the street. What a roller coaster of a day! \nToday has been non-eventful (big YEAH!!), with the added good news that my insurance company called and said they are approving Varubi, a new anti-nausea pill, which will be delivered tomorrow. \nAt first I started writing here with the intention of trying to learn from others about\n their cancer experiences, since I didn't start out with much information at all. Now I find myself just wanting to document my experiences to maybe help anyone else who finds out they have cancer and realizes they have NO IDEA what is going to happen next.

      "Content": " Good morning. Thanks for checking into Taxol. I did some googling and much of what I can expect is the same as the side effects from the AC regimen I'm on now-- hair loss (too late, I'm bald!), low WBC, fatigue, vomiting, mouth sores (which I've managed to avoid by religiously doing the mouth rinse every 2-3 hours), plus a new one--neuropathy in feet and hands. Since my husband has severe neuropathy in his feet I do know what that's like, and I dread it, but I (for no particular reason), feel positive that I won't get neuropathy!\nWhich brings me to a difficult subject: my positive attitude. It is true that I am naturally positive in the face of almost everything. However, I continued chronicling on this site about\n all my cancer experiences so that any other woman who finds herself in my position of a cancer diagnosis and knows NOTHING about\n what to expect, could read here about\n what happens each step of the way. And that includes the emotions that she will go through. And I have done a disservice by glossing over the worst emotions I went through initially. \nIn my 9/2 posting, which was the day after my first meeting with my surgeon, when I first found out the degree of my malignancy, I said said something about\n \"today I feel good that I have a surgery date, but yesterday I did NOT feel so good\"..... okay, that wasn't just glossing over how I felt on 9/1, it was practically rewriting history. \nWhat I'm going to do now is walk through how 9/1 REALLY went. I should have told the truth then, but in my efforts to get through the negative emotions I buried them and let only the positive emotions and truths to be told. I realize it isn't fair to women reading this, who may themselves have a similar EXTREMELY negative reaction as the one I had on 9/1. I don't want any woman to think that their negative/hopeless/frightening emotions aren't valid or \"normal\"\nOops, someone's at the door... Part 2 coming up to finish this sad tale in a bit! ",

      "Content": " I know I am using this forum as my own personal diary to chronicle my experiences with breast cancer, and thank God for it. I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't just let it all out here, in a way that I prefer not to burden friends and family with.... but believe me, I share plenty with them, I just want to cut them a break sometimes and not share every tidbit. \nYesterday was a very emotional day. A lot of stressful things unrelated to cancer were weighing on my mind, and so the appointment with the oncologist struck me particularly hard. This was the appointment they had labeled \"educational\". After I checked in, I waited for just a few minutes before a nurse I'd never seen before led me back through a maze of hallways that I didn't even know existed, until we went through a pair of doors that \nopened into a very large room filled with rows of chairs with patients hooked up to IVs. Everyone was in a different state of decay. People so sickly looking -- from nausea, or bone pain, or severe fatigue from the chemo--and either bald, or with an ugly wig, or worse yet, women my age (approximately) with a man's haircut. I never wanted to be one of those ladies who get to be 40 or so and then suddenly never do their hair again, they just get a man's cut- or close to it - and give up. I know I can wear a wig, but it devastates me to know I will be bald under that wig for 6 months, and then when it does start to grow, it takes 2-3 months to even have as much hair as a Marine fresh out of boot camp. I sound so vain, but it's only partly that. A woman having longish hair represents something--that she hasn't given up, that she's still active in life. And the reverse is true, at least in my eyes. To be my age with a man's cut (AFTER months of complete baldness), feels like anything fun in life is over. \nI literally burst into tears when the nurse walked me through that room. I know I sound horrible, and I honestly and sincerely apologize to all women who choose to wear their hair short, and I truly DO know that it's only a hair choice and doesn't really reflect they've given up on life. Something about\n how I was brought up must have planted that notion in my brain when I was young and I've never gotten over it. I'm sure the majority of women with short hair find that there's more time to enjoy life since they aren't wasting so much time on styling and managing their hair. Obviously I have hair \"issues\", and for me personally, having long hair represents something to ME.... and entering that room and seeing my future that is now very close (I start chemo in just a couple weeks), just pushed me over the edge. Like I said, my day had been extremely stressful from non-cancer related issues, and so my reaction was exaggerated. \nYikes, I am really going on and on about\n this. The truth is, out of all the things in my life right now, cancer is the LEAST of my problems! There are heartbreaking issues going on with my husband, one of my children, and also severe money problems, as well as other, lesser problems. So I entered that room with all of the other issues having been at a boiling point that day, and well, I just fell apart. \nHowever I am glad to have a date when chemo will start. Having information and moving forward is a comfort. If I could afford a psychiatrist I know I need therapy to deal with my negative reaction to short hair. \nAgain, I truly apologize to anyone with short hair, or who is bald, that I have offended. The negative feelings I have are all MY problem and based on God-only-knows some traumatic childhood experience or whatever. At least the fact that I will BE bald, and I will HAVE that short, man-ish hair for a very long time, as my hair grows EXTREMELY slowly, and I will have to deal with it, and the experience will surely change my outlook.\nI have to add something about\n my \"hair outburst\". The same day I posted here how emotional I felt about\n the inevitability of baldness followed by short hair for a long time--I also shared those same emotions with one of my sons who's away at college. He was quite sweet and said he understood how emotional it will be to lose my long hair that I've always been proud of, but he disagreed about\n how I relate the look of extremely short hair on women as a symbol of them \"giving up\". He said I should see it as the opposite, because when I go bald, and then eventually go through months of having extremely short hair, it will be because I specifically have chosen NOT to give up. I am choosing life by going through chemo, and the hair loss is like a badge of courage confirming this. I am paraphrasing him, but his words were just what I needed to hear.\n ",

      "Content": " Susie, I think I would have been a great witness on behalf of my husband, but it wasn't meant to be. Thanks for letting us know the check could arrive before the notification letter! There's been nothing in the bank or the mail yet. \nJust one more radiation treatment to go! I am quite thrilled about\n that, but my elation is diminished due to the rawness of my skin, which continued to get exponentially worse as each day went by last week. The peeling layers are so deep in my armpit that it is actually bleeding. The doctor said that was in the normal range, and she also warned me that even after my last treatment tomorrow that my skin may continue to get worse for about\n a week before it the starts to heal.\nRegarding my GBS, as of last night I am out of the main drug I take for the nerve damage, even though I called in for the refill with plenty of time to spare. The pharmacy said they are waiting on insurance approval. Grrrrr. Insurance companies sure do a lot to ensure they are disliked. The specialty pharmacy still hasn't filled the RX for the compound cream for my hand pain because.......take a wild guess......still waiting on insurance approval. \nBswift, the company billing me for my health insurance is STILL saying I owe for the 3 months already paid through automatic deductions from my STD checks. And I got another letter (like the one I had received in December), from my employer's HR department saying that as of 2 weeks ago I had been expected back at work and I was therefore considered a no-show, and in jeopardy of losing my job. The LTD department does not and will not communicate with the HR department at all. LTD has given me leave from work until November, so far, but HR thinks I was due back in mid-June. \nWhen I called HR, I explained and she insisted I needed to call the LTD dept and have them send me Form X, and that I needed to email the supervisor of my department and let him know that I was not really a \"no show\" and what steps I was taking to correct the information. First, the LTD dept had never heard of Form X, so someone from another dept will call me back (yeah, right!), and second, in the time I've been away from work my supervisor has been fired (he was the best, most prompt and thorough sup I've ever had), and my replacement is a sup I had several years ago-- who was the worst, laziest, most ill-tempered person ever). So I have emailed him twice and received no reply.\nUGHHHHH ",

      "Content": " Hooray, yesterday my WBC was up to 5.3!! I honestly felt like I was alive again. For 4 days I spent curled up on the couch afraid to move, afraid to scratch myself in fear of accidentally getting a cut... afraid of handling paper due to paper cuts! Afraid to pet my cat, afraid to do ANYTHING in fear I might get the smallest of cuts that would let in any germ that could kill me, as I had no WBC to fight it. I remember an episode of \"House\", where a young woman ended up dying because a staph infection got in through they tiniest of tears in the skin on her back from her bra hook. How many times have I had an annoyingly itchy bra hook, and reached around with my fingernails to scratch it? \nIt was horrible, I was afraid to move. And since I was trying desperately to get my WBC up, I ate tons of red meat... 3 times a day.... But on Friday I learned my WBC was up to 5.3, and my weight was up 5 1/2 pounds in just 4 days. I took a walk in the early evening with my gf who lives down the street, and I was SO GRATEFUL to be out of the house. \nAlso yesterday I had my appointment at a Brain Fitness Center, due to my chemo brain. I gave her a list of all the different ways my brain has messed up (that I posted about\n a couple weeks ago I think), then she had me take a series of simple tests on the computer. Just looking at lists of words, then showing a bigger list of words and having to push a button when I recognized any words from the original list. Also doing something similar with pictures of various shapes, and then with colors and shapes. It took a little over an hour, and then I have a follow up with a doctor in a couple weeks for the assessment. \nOh, when I went in for my bloodwork in the morning, to my onc, I was only charged $11, instead of the $75 copay, so that was nice!\nI am more than a little depressed overall, however. This weight gain is out of control. And our financial crisis is REAL. My onc, and the lady at the Brain Center yesterday, have both commented on my depression and feel I would benefit by seeing a therapist. Well, no sh!t, Sherlock. Sorry, but all I can think is \"another $75\". I would love to talk a couple times a week to a therapist! Even once a week. I just cannot add anymore to our bills. \nA part of me thinks I could/should spend some time trying to find free help for poor people like me, but here is my weak-*** excuse.... I don't have the energy to search for help. LOL. It's kind of funny. Well, not really. I just feel so beaten down, emotionally and physically, over things that have been going on for years, not just by the cancer I've had for five months. about\n 3 weeks ago I was somehow energized to spend the whole day on the phone calling various cancer foundations, trying to find help, and every call just led to other calls. I have several pages of notes about\n everyone I called and who they in turn told me to call. I ended up getting help for neulasta.... which I will no longer be getting now that I've had my last AC chemo treatment. Neulasta isn't given after Taxol treatments. \nAye, aye, aye..... I need to focus on the positives right now. My WBC is up. I can DO THINGS. I'm going to take a walk later today in my hood, and tomorrow I think I'll walk the causeway.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all reading.\n ",

Also, the dye that was injected to travel to my lymph nodes so the doctor could remove the sentinel node(s) and see if cancer was there, did not work (due to scar tissue from a previous surgery). Therefore he removed all 24 lymph nodes in my breast/armpit area, and tested them all. And the good news is there was only cancer in the closest node, so i was very happy to know that the cancer wasn't spreading wildly throughout my body as I had feared, and as it had done with my friend's friend... who recently died :(. \nThe mammaprint test results aren't in yet, but should be by the time I see my surgeon and my oncologist at the end of this week. I've done a lot of reading about\n the oncotype test and mammaprint (which is apparently a better version of the oncotype test), and i am keeping my fingers crossed that the good news will keep rolling in, and that the test will say I won't benefit by chemotherapy. I know that is a lot to hope for. Everyone I've talked to that has needed a double mastectomy has also needed chemo and radiation. But I might as well dream big! In any case, I should know in a few days. \nI still have my drains in, as apparently I've been overdoing my exercises. All I've done is walk around my house slowly, and do the few sets of arm movement exercises that the hospital told me to do (which are really minimal movements as far as exercise goes). Since I have felt pretty well, I've done the exercises to excess, I guess, so my drains could not be removed this week as planned. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this.

      "Content": " After wallowing for two days in self-pity, I yanked myself out of it this morning. My work friend who I found out went through all of this 3 years ago (and who gave me the kick-in-the-ass to finally go to the OBGYN in the first place), knew just what to say. She got me to refocus on the fight against cancer. Of course I KNOW that is the number one priority, but my mind had linked the path I am on fighting my cancer, with the journey I am on to rebuild my breasts, and when that rebuilding process hit a major setback, I let it effect my overall positiveness and happiness. \nShe reminded me to focus on the fighter that I am...... And I am kicking cancer's butt. I was just barely in the group of people who would benefit from chemo, and I chose to get it. I am barely in the category of person to benefit from radiation, and I am going to get that, too. \nSo what if my outer shell, the shape of me, is going to be mis-matched for longer than expected. So freaking what. And yes, I'll be forced to have an additional surgery, but honestly, I don't think anyone heals faster from surgery than I do. \nSo, today my oldest friend is coming over to spend the day with me. This is my friend with OCD who cancelled on me when I lost my hair. So instead of being the first person to see me in a wig, she is the last. And it doesn't matter. It is such a non-issue! I honestly don't think about\n my baldness and what it means time-wise for how long it will take before I have a decent amount of hair again. I am enjoying my wigs, and REALLY enjoying how there is no upkeep to my hair looking great. When I had my long hair, that I was oh so proud of, it was a minimum two hour ORDEAL for me to get done up for anything. I don't have great hair, but I could make it look great, when I put in the 2 plus hours to get it that way. And it would last for just that day. The next day it would be so-so looking. Day three was pony-tail day. \nNow, every day is a great hair day. It takes five seconds for me to grab the wig off the stand and adjust it over my head. Five SECONDS! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. ",

      "Content": " Hi.\nI know it's been a long time since i've posted. I am going through a period of denial, where i try not to think about\n ANY of this. I have my surgery date--July 18, to switch out the expanders for implants. I know that's a good thing, it's progress, it's moving forward in the list of things that i have had to do since I was fist diagnosed. \n But I'm in a panic. Right now as I write about\n this my throat and chest are clenching, my heart is racing, and I feel like I can't breathe. Surgery can trigger a relapse of GBS... I was lucky the Nov. 2 surgery did not..although I do think it halted or at least slowed down my recovery. I stumble more frequently so that I look drunk when I walk without a cane. My legs \"give out\" fairly often, where I can't get up off a chair of couch. I have always had extremely strong thighs, because of all the sports I've done for decades. I NEVER couldn't get up off a chair or couch until GBS started. When I remember exactly how it happened, a day or so before I got totally paralyzed from the hips down, I experienced not being able to get up off the couch... I started, then my legs failed and I plopped down. I had to use my hands to help push me off the couch and I remember thinking \"well, THAT'S something that's never happened before!\". Then the day or so later Voldemort came (I forgot this is the disease I will not name!), that morning I had to get my husband's help to get off the couch, and after a few feet my legs gave out totally and then you know the rest.........So I have this huge fear that Voldemort will come again when I have surgery. This surgery is much more involved that the one on Nov. 2, just to switch out the defective expander. Because of Voldemort they had to do my anesthesia differently somehow, and I do NOT like, in fact I'd say I HATE, that I have no memory of anything after I was dismissed for SEVEN TO EIGHT DAYS!!!! How much worse will it be since my surgery this time is more involved and longer??? \n My head knows that surgery is a good thing, a positive thing.....but my emotions --- my PTSD-- is controlling my emotions, and I am in panic mode.... since this surgery is longer, it will give Voldemort more of an opportunity to paralyze me again...and then I'm in that black hole I can't think about\n......that's why i haven't written, because I try very hard not to think about\n the upcoming surgery...\n I hope, Susie, that you are doing well. And to any other readers, too, I wish you the best of health and POSITIVE THINKING..which is not always so easy! ",

      "Content": " I saw the plastic surgeon today. The drains weren't ready to come out yet (although I am ready for them to come out!). However something wonderful happened during this visit. I was not expecting this to happen until much later, for some reason, but the doctor started the process of filling up my expanders! She held a magnet over my breast/chest area until it found the magnet on the expander under my skin, and then marked the spot on my skin with a marker dot. She then used a syringe and put in 60 CCs of saline solution into each side of my chest, and voila -- I suddenly have breasts! Small ones, but there they are! I have breasts again! It was amazing as well that I did not feel a thing. The THOUGHT of a needle going into my breast (without sedation or medication of any kind) sounds painful, or at least uncomfortable, but it was neither. I felt absolutely nothing. Hopefully one day my breasts will have feelings again, but for now, I am happy to see the feminine contours. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. ",

      "Content": " I couldn't find information anywhere that listed achiness as a side effect of radiation. I also realize that within the last couple of days I've felt down, depressed. That is not me!! I'm so naturally positive, I make people sick. In previous posts I'd been saying how much I was looking forward to starting radiation, getting back to defeating cancer, but there is no getting around the fact that I have been depressed every night this week. \nAnd for anyone reading who is only interested in what I'm going through with breast cancer, skip the rest of this post. Originally I hadn't wanted to go on too much about\n my Guillain Barre. But I realize I DO think it's beneficial to describe what I'm going through with that, as well. Beneficial for me, of course. Beneficial to the maybe one other person reading this who may also suffer from Guillain Barre. But beneficial in general to anyone with breast cancer who then also finds themselves dealing simultaneously with another major catastrophe-- whether it's a disease or some other traumatic event. \nSince I began radiation I think my Guillain Barre IS getting worse. The numbness in my fingers feels deeper, and the same for my feet and calves. By about\n 8pm I am ready to scream in pain, and I picture relief from my hand pain in the form of someone chopping off my hands. My brain will tell me I need to scratch my foot (for example), however as I scratch the area, I realize the place that feels like it needs to be scratched is about\n an inch or more below the surface of the skin. Today I was in a store and felt a drop of water land on my hand. I looked up to see if I could see the leaking ceiling, but couldn't find it. I looked at my hand to wipe off the water, and there was none. I attributed that to the droplet beading up on my sunscreened hand and falling off. In the next few minutes in the store I felt 2 more drops of water land on my hand. Of course, there was nothing there. Then in the car on the way home from the store it felt like a drop of water landed on my lower leg. I looked down to discover that the place I felt the water was underneath my sock. Guillain Barre attacks the nerves and destroys and/or alters (at least temporarily, sometimes permanently) how the nerves convey information to and from my brain and limbs. This is a weird-*** disease!!\n ",

      "Content": " So I've been chronicling \"what it's like to have breast cancer and what to expect each step of the way\", but I have left out something that most chemo patients go through, and I am no exception: chemo brain. Chemo brain is forgetfulness, fogginess, ineptness. It is frustrating and a bit humiliating, and humbling. \nAs I type along here it may seem like it is easy for me. Normally it is. I've been a super fast, accurate typist for decades, never having to look at the keys, of course. But occasionally, in the midst of typing a sentence I will suddenly need to type the \"s\", for example, and have no clue where it is. I will stare at the keyboard and my eyes will slowly go over each row of keys and I will not see it, even as I go over the row that it is in. It may take several searches before I finally find it and can go on. \nAfter brushing my teeth it has happened a few times that I find myself holding the toothpaste tube in one hand and the toothbrush in the other and not knowing what to do with them. I've already brushed...the cap to the toothpaste is laying on the counter... and my toothbrush needs to be put back in its case, which is also on the counter. But I stare dumbly at these two items in my hands and I know there is SOMETHING that has to be done with each of them, but I don't know what. After 30 seconds or so the fog lifts and I put the cap on the toothpaste and my toothbrush back in its case. \nI had to type in my social security number into some website the other day and kept typing in the same wrong number, absolutely positive that it was the correct number, and getting angry at the site for telling me the number didn't match what was on file. After about\n five tries I suddenly remembered I had the first three numbers completely wrong.\nI have stood in front of my bathroom counter trying to figure out which container is the antiperspirant. I see all the bottles lined up, body lotion, face serum, makeup remover, antiperspirant, hairspray, perfume, etc, and I cannot figure out which one is the antiperspirant.... I'll have to review each item several times before it suddenly dawns on me.\nWhile getting dressed I have put my shorts on, then underwear over them. I don't realize it's wrong until I almost have the undies pulled all the way up. Then I take them and the shorts off to do it the correct way and I again put the shorts on first and then the undies, not realizing it is wrong until the undies are almost up. On the fourth attempt I got it right!!\nI've lived in the same house for 26 years. All of my doors (and there's a lot of them) \nopen IN, except one, the door to the laundry room, which \nopens OUT. I will confidently stride toward a closed door and attempt to \nopen it out and be surprised that it wasn't right, and of course I do the opposite with the laundry room.\nAnd perhaps the most vexing error I keep making is to try and fail to send a text on my phone. I will type out my message and press send, set the phone down and look away, and within a couple seconds I realize I didn't hear the \"whoosh\" sound it makes when the message sends, so I look down at my phone and I see that my message is not now in a blue bubble as it should be, it is still in the area where I typed it, but the last letter of the message is missing. So I retype that last letter and hit send again, set the phone down, about\n to move on to my next task, and I realize there was no \"whoosh\" sound. Again I look at the phone and there is no message in a blue bubble, there is my unsent message still where I typed it, with the last letter missing. Obviously I have pressed \"backspace\" instead of \"send\", two times. So very carefully I type the last letter again and hit send...... and ...... drumroll.......no \"whoosh\" sound, no message in a blue bubble. Again I very purposefully retype the last letter and hit SEND, put the phone down and expect the \"whoosh\" and not get it. I'll do this over and over again. The more I focus on the buttons I am pressing the more frustrating it gets. I'll retype that last letter, practically mashing the key I am so upset, and to send it I'll hit the backspace button, or the return key, or the space key, over and over and over again, until the fog finally lifts and I see the blue \"up arrow\" which is the button I have to press to \"send\"..... Talk about\n frustrating. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. ",

I started to do facebook a million years ago, because i am a naturally chatty person, but I soon became addicted. So I stopped altogether. \nProbably the majority of women who are dealing with breast cancer are on facebook, and the majority of them have posted that they have breast cancer. Their news spreads, and everyone in their social sphere, present and past, learns of it, and supportive feedback comes in from a multitude--a dozen, maybe a hundred or more, people.

I was surprised that my hair was several inches longer overnight! But as I ran the comb through it, I discovered it was so long because half of the hairs weren't attached to my scalp, they had come out and were working their way down and out... all it took was the comb to have them come out completely. By the time I finished combing, about\n 3/4ths of my hair was on the bathroom counter, and I looked in the mirror and saw a nearly bald head with random stragglers attached to various areas of my head, hideous and scary looking.\nSO! It was with great trepidation that I went through my morning routine after waking from that dream! As of now, I still have my hair. And my right boob :)\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this.\n ",

      "Content": " Omgosh, what you, and your husband, have been through over the years is so much more than my little problems, I am truly embarrassed to have ever complained so much. \nI am SO sorry you have not found relief from your back pain, as I have. I do meet many more people (in real life) who have had failed back procedures than successful ones. I was in a position of \"have surgery, or you're not walking\". All I could do was crawl across the floor with my elbows dragging the weight of my body on the floor behind me while enduring excruciating pain. My kids were only 9 and 10, so I didn't really have a choice. I do truly feel blessed every time I am walking somewhere and I remember my rehab, when just putting one foot in front of the other was an effort. And now I just \"walk\", like it's no big deal, without a thought. \nI got a Fed Ex letter from my employer last night at 7pm, telling me that they only had my disability through 12/24, and so from 12/25 onward I was considered a \"no show\". This is just irritating. I have been coordinating my leave through the benefits department at my company, and through the insurance company that has been paying my short term disability. They have it noted that my disability lasts at least through Feb 15. And I learned last week through the insurance department that I DO get long term disability, which I had no idea. I'm not sure what getting that will mean. I don't think my paychecks will still be the 60% I've been getting, and it won't be every 2 weeks, it will only be once a month. So I have some more learning to do, plus I have to educate my company to coordinate my leave with the other departments with which I've been dealing. \nI've been going bald a lot lately at home. The wigs just keep feeling scratchy or heavy or sweaty (I'm in Florida where it's 80 degrees). Early on I never could have envisioned wearing the turbans or other type of skull cap when I had 2 beautiful wigs from which to choose, but a couple weeks ago I started wearing them almost exclusively while I'm in my house, and now this past week I have mainly just been going around completely bald-headed. And I've even been going bra-less. The prosthetic breast and bra is lop-sided. I am always having to adjust the prosthesis to raise it up to sit as high up on my chest as the side that has the very full tissue expander. So I am walking around the house looking like a real beauty, lol! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. Speaking of which, I know folks are reading.... does anyone every have any comments? I did originally start this hoping that folks who have been through this before me could offer any insights. I hope my writing \"style\" hasn't scared anyone away from commenting or interacting with me!\n ",

(But I\u2019ve had worse pain through Voldemort, so I feel like I can handle most anything.). It\u2019s weird... I am not wearing any Gauze sponges, ABD pads or bandages or anything. I can just look down and see my new breast (from my back skin) sewn onto the front. And in the standing bathroom mirrors I can see a HUGE, maybe 10-12 inches long incision going horizontal from about\n under the armpit and just over then central spine. A friend told me this scar evens out and goes flat, and the fat from the other side gets redispersed, so I won\u2019t be flat-backed on one side, and rollly, lumpy on the other side. The doctor was able to gather up quite a lot of fat from this one side, and with the expander underneath (which she already expanded once) I may only need one more expansion in order for it to be equal to the other side. Thee is a lot more visible scar line on this left chest, so I hope my scar Rx cream works as well as before. \n All for now.

How can this be? This is THE drug to treat a very serious and painful, life altering disease!!!!\nFor some good news my breast and armpit area are healing nicely from the radiation. No more \nopen, bloody areas! Yeah! Nothing is looking scaly or peeling, it just looks very sunburned. Whether this will just fade away in time, or still peel as sunburned skin tends to do, time will tell. I am just so relieved not to have the \nopen, bloody areas in my armpit that were rubbing all the time.\nI went to my onc on Friday just to give blood, and I go in today for the results (this was a more comprehensive blood work than they usually do, the results of which are ready in a matter of minutes.)\nSo hopefully there won't be any of this \"well your blood work shows your liver enzymes are high, so you need at CT of your liver\", which happened before one time. \nI want to question her as to the efficacy of my chemotherapy since it was cut short.

I don't blame your friend for not wanting to wear an ugly wig. Losing (long hair) is SO hard anyway, and then to replace it with something that looks like it could be part of a Halloween costume is insulting. I'm glad she found a wig she felt good to wear. I have been bald just about\n 2 months, and just in the last couple of weeks I have felt comfortable to go bald inside my house around my husband. I do not think I will ever go bald outside. I have worn just my turban to just go out to the mailbox, or to briefly water plants. I know that there is a small risk that the hair loss could be PERMANENT. That would truly be dreadful. \nI am curious about\n the results of the brain testing, too. They talked about\n possibly being referred for \"therapy\", and I am even more curious about\n that.

      "Content": " Howdy. I don't have much positive to say,,,,,which is what has kept me from writing. I feel ungrateful, or rude somehow, if all I do is come on here and complain about\n one thing or another. But truly, if nothing positive is happening, then there's just no writing. \n My surgery is actually july 17, i had the date wrong before. My pre op visit with the PS did NOT go well. I left in tears. I don't know where I got the idea that this surgery would give me 2 fairly same sized and symmetrical breasts, minus nipples to be added somehow later. But that is NOT what is happening. The ONLY thing happening is switching the expanders for implants. That alone is nice. It's a big deal. But it does NOT make me normal looking even fully-clothed. I guess because of the failure of the right expander and how long it had to stay that way before getting the new expander, the right breast is so far from being level with the other breast. Like if I were in an airplane seat, I'd be in seat 11A and my right breast would be in seat 12A.... it's just a LOT lower. I have no clear understanding as to how it can not be lifted up at the same time as the expanders are switched out for implants. But blame Voldemort again. She says she will only do one thing at a time, to keep me under anesthesia as little as possible. That's nice. That's important! However I handled the news VERY BADLY. To know that I'll leave the hospital with the breasts still in different rows on the plane, and that would mean ANOTHER SURGERY to lift the other one up, stressed me out so much. Another surgery. I have avoided doing so many things because I didn't want to take a chance of getting sick or injured before this surgery, therefore delaying it. I wouldn't didn't fly up DC to see my son, as I was avoiding crowds. No swimming in pools or floating down the Weeki Wachee River, as my immune system is so low, I could catch any water born bacteria through a hangnail. \n Probably everyone else knows this, but I was not aware until my recent visit with my onc, that my WBC count will probably stay low for 3-5 years post chemo. Stupid me! I thought a couple weeks after chemo stopped, which was a year and a half ago now, that it would be back to normal. lololol. My latest WBC was just below the normal range... normal being 4.0-10.0, and mine was 3.9...... Even during chemo it was usually higher than that. \n So it wasn't the fact that I learned from my PS that my breasts weren't going to be \"perfect\" or whatever.....it was knowing there would be AT LEAST one more surgery after that. And feeling that my whole life is going to still be halted, waiting and waiting, to actually DO anything. \n I had been making myself happy with the one thing I could do-- oil painting--no matter how many times I dropped a brush, mistakes can always be fixed on a painting. But the news from the PS put me in such a downer mood.......just seeing me type that stops me in my tracks... the pre-cancer, pre-Voldemort me would NEVER have felt down for more than a quarter of a second, before going back to Ms. Positive. But I just don't bounce back into the positive zone quickly any longer. Since the appointment with the PS I basically have done nothing but watch TV, locked away in my son's old room, so I can close the door. There's a humongous TV in the family room, but that would make me visible to my husband and other son and I just want to kind of pretend I don't exist right now. \n There are a couple other non-health related things that are causing me great distress, too, so it's not \"just\" cancer and the surgeries for it, that have put me in this room. \nSusie, I never did reschedule with the PTSD counselor. I did try a couple more times and the calls actually dropped twice, and i did not try again. \n So, surgery is a week from today. I don't know if I'll post again or not. I hope to be able to write in a couple days and say \"great news!! I jumped back into the positive side of life again and have left my son's room and TV!!\" \n Even if I don't post I'll check in to see if you, or anyone else posts. I know it's still early summer and you have many hot days ahead, which I hope you can endure. Best of health to you and your family, and to all.\n ",

I am doing what has to be done to be as healthy as possible, to give myself a cancer-free future. \nDespite the fact that the 3 or 4 times I've had my tissue expanders filled they have each been filled with the exact same amount, one breast is bigger than the other. My PS didn't seem too concerned.

I am not describing her response very well and that is just because my brain isn't fully functional at the moment, lol.

I am happy to report that I feel nothing negative about\n my expanders. Yes, I can feel the hard edge of them, but to me that's not a bad thing. Unusual, yes. It's not how natural breasts feel, and it won't be how my breasts feel when I eventually have the expanders swapped out for implants. But I feel grateful, or even exuberant, just knowing that my breasts are in the process of being reconstructed.

      "Content": " One of the appointments I went to after that last post was to my PS. The first thing she said when my gown came off, is \"It doesn't look like we'll be able to save the other one\". Everything was a blur after that. I was dumbstruck, and became tearful. It is taking me many days, and it's still ongoing, for me to \"accept\" a new reality for myself. That I'm NOT basically \"done!\" and ready to get back to starting a new life. The time period just to heal from the staph infection is 6 months to a year, so I've got plenty of time to process. I go through being convinced I'm going to be able to keep the right side implant, and thinking, Okay, I can deal with that. It's just going to be many more procedures on the left side, more complicated ones, I'll be finding new doctors, and just in general have a new timeline to begin what was supposed to be my \"second act\" in life (as an artist). Unfortunately I have MORE than 50% of my days where I think that I will also lose the right side to the staph infection, and then I basically \"lose it\" and cannot find anything worthwhile to think of. The fact that across my entire chest area my skin was reddish is what is so convincing. Back to the time I was thinking I was healing normally (after the emergency surgery to remove the staph infected left breast), yet the PS seeing me without my gown said it was extremely doubtful I'd be able to save the right one, was based on the fact my chest was red all the way across, and to this day it has remained so. I finish a 2-3 week course of this portable IV that is supposedly handling the staph in a couple more days. Then they say they have to wait 3--4 days before new blood cultures will tell if the staph is really gone. So if they find any in my blood, then off goes my right breast, and any other parts of my sternum and ribs, etc, that may also be in danger. \nI'm sounding calm because I am on valium. My undrugged mind focuses too quickly and completely on the most severe cases I've read about\n. \nWell I don't really know what else to say now. Y'all know the most personal, embarrassing things about\n my whole life. If anyone has any \"good ending\" staph stories, that would be nice to share!\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " Susie, you have been through SO MUCH, it makes me gratefully aware that all of my complaints are minor in comparison. With all that you, your husband, and your family members have endured, you are still such a positive and helpful person. I hope you know that you are appreciated. \nI am very sorry to hear about\n your friend that has a severe case of GBS. For him to have been in a nursing home for 3-4 years, I am guessing his paralysis went up into his chest and stopped his breathing or his heart, causing him to be on machines, at least for awhile. The fact that he is in a wheelchair now and hopefully able to go to that extensive rehab program is such good news! Of course the insurance is the rub. \nIf you don't mind, what is his name? I am eager to donate to his GoFundMe account, and I'm sure many others would also donate. I have made donations to others through GoFundMe. Other than the rare cases of GBS that result in death, his case must be the next worst-case scenario. I only went through the truly hideous part for 2 weeks in a hospital, and then I was able to go for 3 weeks to a rehab hospital. I literally can't fathom the amount of suffering he has endured in the 3-4 years in a nursing home. I really hope the money is raised to get him into rehab. I know it made all the difference in my case.\nAlthough I want to focus (in life, and in this chat), mainly on my breast cancer journey, since we're talking GBS, here is my update: all of my fingers are still numb. Typing is a nightmare, and I spend a ridiculous amount of time correcting mistakes because I cannot hit the correct keys. My hands feel like I'm wearing leather gloves all the time....so try to button a button, or unscrew a cap, tying a shoelace, or just about\n anything that requires dexterity, and it is an ordeal. The pain in my hands that previously had me ready to scream by 8pm and longing for relief in the form of someone chopping off my hands has subsided. Yeah! There is still pain, and it does get worse as the day goes on, but the pain meds are mostly able to manage the pain now, when they were unable to just a month ago.\nI have some feeling back in my feet-- maybe 10%-- but it is all on the inside of my feet. The entire surface and more is numb and painful at the same time. This is a huge improvement. Two months ago it felt like from my knees down to my toes, that my legs had been replaced with large concrete pylons, that I somehow had to lift and plop down to move ahead in my walker. I had no perception of my calves or my ankles, let alone my feet. So the fact that it is only my feet that are 90% concrete blocks is a remarkable improvement. By the end of the day I have shooting pains up my calves and into my buttocks, but the pain meds help most of the time. \nI still have severe balance problems. And if I can't see what my hands or feet are doing, I have no idea what they may be doing. It's difficult to describe. The physical therapists called it \"proprioception\", and that is what I've lost, and hopefully will get back. \nOne last, unrelated topic before I end this seemingly endless post, lol. I was reading through some of my earlier posts and saw where it was mentioned several times about\n my son's college graduation, and that getting pneumonia was going to cause me to miss it. (Of course, something worse caused me to miss it.) However, I did get to see it live! The college had a \"live stream\" of it, and so I saw it in real time. I had just gotten out of the hospital a couple days before, and was dependent on an aid for EVERYTHING. My \"aids\" were my husband and older son (who came home for 3 weeks to help take care of me when I was at my worst at home), but both of them were going to the graduation ceremony for my younger son. So my best friend from college came and spent a couple days with me and was my aid--to eat, to go to the bathroom, etc. She and I both watched the ceremony and had much better views than if I'd been there in person, as their seats were quite high up. I got to see an up-close view of him walking up to the stage and shaking hands with a couple men, and receive his diploma, while on the screen it showed his name and Magna Cum Laude under it. \nOkay I have babbled on so much that I probably have alienated any readers who once had interest. Sorry! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

It's the co-pays for each visit that is killing me-- $75 each visit! \nThe worst thing about\n my taxol treatment is having to wake up in the middle of the night to take the pills. I took my first does of pills (steroids) at 10 pm, then when I was trying to go to sleep around midnight, I kept thinking \"I'll be getting up in 4 hours, why bother sleeping?\" Even knowing that I HAD to sleep, so I eventually fell asleep around 2, then got up at 4 to take the second batch of pills-- with food-- so that totally woke me up. Then I go through the process of \"why bother going back to sleep\" when my alarm will be going off again in a few hours. But then I eventually fell asleep for a couple more hours. So, sleep is just totally thrown off on Taxol Mondays. \nI'm not sure if I mentioned that I finally lost my eyelashes. There is a good reason animals have lashes... they act to keep dust and debris from landing in your eyes that you aren't even aware of, and that I am keenly aware of all the time now! My eyes are always watery from whatever keeps landing in them. My leg hairs, however, still continue to grow. Boo! ",

      "Content": " Hi Susie,\nI am having my husband check out GoodRx and Blinkhealth.com for his meds. He takes 2 different insulins--lantus and humalog, plus Trulicity for his diabetes. And after having a heart attack about\n 7 years ago (he had a stent put in), he also takes amlodipine and metoprolol for his heart, plus atorvastatin for his cholesterol. \nI know it's easy for me to say, but please don't blame yourself for taking steroids all those years. You have dealt with so many health issues, and I think our first, natural, reaction is to accept what the doctor says and follow directions. If you have nothing else going on in life (your own, your spouse's or your kids'), then maybe it's more \"natural\" to do lots of homework about\n your health and the medications and treatments the doctors suggest. But you've had so many issues, as well as your husband, and your sister with breast cancer and your mom with lung cancer! \nI have time now where I could do research, but I don't have the brain power for it! Chemo fog has really changed me. I used to be a multi-tasker, both with mental and physical tasks.... now i am a no-tasker, lol. It's all I can do to just make it through the days and go to whatever doctors visits are scheduled. In my time off from work I started something I had always been interested in--ancestry.com, and I have totally messed it up! I'll click on my great-grandmother, and it will say she's the mother-in-law of my 6th great-uncle! I have no idea what I've done. \nYou definitely are lucky to have both your grown kids nearby! That is what I wish for myself for my entire life. I know I've said mine are 21 and 22. The 21 year old, who just visited from college, found out he's been accepted into one of the law schools he applied to, with a generous scholarship! Woohoo! He's applying to several schools, and in the next few months he'll continue to find out where he's accepted, and with what scholarships (which are absolutely necessary in our situation). So for the next 3 years he will most likely live in state (Florida), or his other choices were in other southern states and all the way to the DC area, not exactly close by, but at least it's not cross-country. \nMy 22 year old is another story. He is every bit as brilliant and accomplished as his brother, but sometime during his sophomore year in college he became \"lost\", is all I can call it, and the journey he's been on since has been a nightmare for us. So up until a couple years ago we thought this year he'd be starting a PhD program in engineering, around the same time his younger brother would be finishing college...... and instead..... we have no idea what path he's on, or if he'll ever join the \"real world\" again. Sorry I am sounding mysterious, I am still trying to protect his privacy, even though I am babbling on about\n him! It is just the most difficult thing for a parent to have NO IDEA what your child is doing or what their future holds....let alone where he could be living! \nMy employer and my disability carrier have each been telling me different things about\n when I am supposed to return to work. I know it's a fluid process, dependent on the information received from my doctors about\n my ability to work, but it is very frustrating that they each aren't saying the same dates. I'm sure it will work out, but it causes me a lot of anxiety.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. ",

I admit I DID need those extra meds, but doing without them didn't mean I went back to dry-heaving. I've just had some unending queasiness. My son got home from college a few days ago and basically I've been a lump on the couch. But a happy lump, as it is so good to see him, and his brother here together, and getting along well.

Or that I could get a totally new form of cancer from the radiation. I mostly don't think about\n these outcomes because there are so many more pressing, and REAL issues I have to deal with. Foremost is money. We are in rather dire straights. I have the only job in our household. My husband has been out of work for years, and is trying to get the disability he deserves, but it hasn't happened yet. My job does not pay much, but it gives us health insurance, which I had always only thought of as important to cover my husband's many medical bills and anything that could happen with the kids. \nBut now, of course, my insurance is covering my cancer treatment. Except for the thousands of dollars in deductibles and co-pays. \nI outlined recently what my \"chemo-brain\" has been like. Obviously I cannot work. My job is done on a computer and a phone, and requires fast-thinking. I've been on short-term disability, getting 60% of salary, but that is going to end soon I believe. I have my head in the sand... I don't want to call my carrier and find out when the paychecks will stop altogether and when I'll have to start paying THEM for the health insurance ($560 a month) since there won't be any paychecks from which it would be deducted automatically. It's really all too much to think about\n. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading this. Send some positive thoughts my way, too!

      "Content": " Thanks for the ideas. I'm surreptitiously texting with his girlfriend to get clues as to what he may need or want for a graduation gift. \nI've been using a lot of Orajel for my tooth, plus got a temporary filling kit at the drug store, and that has helped a LOT. I am curious to see tomorrow if my onc says to keep using the OTC temporary stuff, or if I actually will have to see a dentist to get a \"real\" temporary fix. I just don't want anything to delay my chemo schedule.\nAlthough going bald on Taxol is a major side effect, I obviously didn't have to worry about\n it since I went bald during my AC chemo treatments. However, just before I started Taxol my doctor said \"Don't worry if your hair starts to grow in with Taxol, sometimes it does, but that doesn't mean the chemo isn't working.\" I guess sometimes people think they aren't getting a proper dose of Taxol if they see hair coming in. \nWell, guess what?! I have stubbly hair growing back on my head. I still LOOK as bald as a cue ball, but I can feel it, and if I look very closely I can see it. I am blond, and this new hair on my head looks like the hairs I've always had on my arms--VERY blond, see-through almost. The hair on my head was never THAT blond, and I certainly don't want it to all grow back see-through, which I don't really think will happen. But to have it grow back an even paler shade of blond than I naturally was would be wonderful... maybe save me from putting highlights in my hair! \nI WISH other people could see my new growth; it really is totally invisible, but I am reaching up there touching my scalp all the time to feel it. It's embarrassing to be able to make this comparison, but my head feels like about\n a three-week growth of leg hair. Ew, I know, right? But on my head that is a good thing!\n ",

      "Content": " Okay, so.... up to the time of my first meeting with my surgeon on 9/1, all I knew was that I had several large, malignant tumors. Life leading up to finding this out has been in a downward spiral for many years, on many fronts. My husband's debilitating diabetes and many, many years of being out of work has taken a huge toll on our marriage, and our finances. Many days the stress I felt would manifest itself physically-- my teeth and jaws clenched, my throat tightening and the feeling of a huge lump in my chest. And then most stressful of all, issues with one of my sons. To honor his privacy I won't specify what the issues have been, but there have many tense/anxious/angry/fearful....events over the last several years, which keep escalating. Every time we think we've been through the worst, there is more. \nSoooo, on 9/1 my husband and I get to the doctor's office, and I handed in a huge stack of forms that they had mailed to me to fill out, and the lady in the front office handed me one more form and asked me to fill that out while I waited for the doctor. It was just a questionnaire with maybe 15-20 questions, and to answer I had to check a box rating the scale of how little or how severely I felt about\n each answer. (Example, answer 1 means no big deal, answer 5 means severe problem).\nI honestly cannot recall the exact questions, but they were along the lines of, \"how happy are you in your marriage\", \"do you feel in control of your life\", \"do you feel you have more or less stress than most people you know\", \"how do you rate your financial security\", \"is the health of your spouse a factor in your overall well-being\"..... And to all 15-20 questions I gave 5 as my answer. The final question was a yes/no question: Do you think that your death would alleviate your problems? (again, paraphrasing... but you get the point...) and I answered yes, and I handed in the questionnaire and soon after I was called back to talk to the surgeon. \nI went in by myself and got the news, that there were 2 quite large, and one or more smaller, malignant tumors in my left breast and a large, non-malignant mass in the right breast. We discussed the course of treatment: double mastectomy and reconstruction, chemo and possibly/probably radiation. Then he had my husband come in and told him as well. I was just feeling a bit numb when we got up to leave the room. However the second we emerged from the room behind the doctor, another man intervened and asked us to step back in the room to discuss the questionnaire I had just filled out. \nHe was a social worker, and immediately went over each question individually. Suddenly I LOST IT. I was sobbing and shaking as I clarified my answers. \"Of course I have trouble sleeping most nights, my life has been hell for almost 15 years, of course I stress-eat, yes I cry more often than the average person, NO my husband does not help ease my stress, YES he is a major cause of the stress.\" (this part was REALLY hard for me to say in front of my husband. I don't say this to him in our lives... that his endless health problems are stressful for me and that all the years of not working have been a burden... I try not to hurt his feelings, because he can't help it that his health is so bad and he can't work). And then the last question... I was practically choking on my sobs as I qualified my answer. \"Of course I think of dying to solve my problems! I WANTED to come in here today and have the doctor tell me 'Sorry, but you are stage 4, and the cancer has metastasized throughout your body... get your affairs in order, you only have a couple weeks left.' \nAlthough I had never crystallized that thought before that very minute, all of a sudden that is how I felt. I told the social worker I wanted to be told I was dying (very soon) of cancer so I would not have to keep dealing with all THESE ISSUES (I said this waiving the questionnaire around). Who wouldn't want a way out? As there is no way out, things just get worse year after year. \nSo I arrived at the doctor's office just feeling a bit numb, and left a sobbing wreck, but also numb in a new way. Now I knew that in addition to the very long list of stressful issues in my life, I get to add surgeries and chemo and baldness and radiation to the mix, and when the cancer treatment is all over, every single one of my problems will be if not the same, then worse (especially financially.)\nI really only felt like dying was a good option for a few hours. The Miss Positive that I normally am (for what reason, I don't know, lol), returned, and so when I posted on 9/2 about\n my previous day's visit to the doctor, I totally glossed over the depths of despair and hopelessness that I felt. \nOkay, there, I did it. That was a hard confession! I really am a positive person so much of the time, but I felt dishonest that I omitted that those very dark, negative emotions are real, and getting my cancer diagnosis brought it out. ",

      "Content": " I know, \"congrats you're going to have surgery\" sounds weird, but it is appropriate in my case! I really am excited to move on with reconstruction.\nIt IS in my LTD policy that I won't get LTD since my SSDI is higher. If my SSDI had been lower, the LTD would have made up the difference. \nI'm not sure if I've mentioned it here before, but ever since having to spend five weeks in hospitals, totally dependent on others, I have been having \"waking nightmares\" where I am living a life like that and calling out to my nurse or aide \"help!\", and hearing them say they're \"not willing to help me\". I have sleeping nightmares like this as well. Before GBS, I NEVER thought of myself as helpless or that I'd ever be dependent on anyone, until maybe I was 100 years old (I come from a line of long-livers). I have to try really hard to push these thoughts out of my mind. It does no good to think them, and in fact probably does harm by leaving me feeling anxious and constantly aware of my mortality. Who needs that? \nI'm trying to get as strong as possible before my Oct 31 surgery, especially anything to do with my arms chest as I know I won't be able to do hardly anything for 6 weeks or so afterward. So besides the push ups I try to do daily (some days I can do 10, other days only 5), I am using free weights and doing all kinds of exercises for my arms and chest muscles. \nSusie, it is hideously hot here as well. I know that Fall supposedly arrived almost a month ago, but you'd never know it. I long for the cool weather, and especially for the very few cold days we get here in Florida. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " My cat came home today, safe and happy and hungry, while I was at chemo! Yeah! This is the first time in a week that I have not had this horrible dread and anxiety eating at me. \nAnyway, chemo thread here! Had my fifth taxol today, and told her I'm still throwing up in my mouth and still having bone pain. So she switched the nausea medicine, but told me to just use OTC products for the pain, and IF those don't work, to let them know and they'll consider something with a narcotic (she had me on Naproxen, which only reduced the pain somewhat, but didn't get rid of it). I am not expecting any, or much, relief from OTC pain killers. \nThe hair I noticed growing back on my head isn't getting any longer. Perhaps there are more hairs per square inch, but the length isn't changing. I find myself getting more depressed about\n my looks; the weight gain, the baldness, the loss of lashes and eyebrows. When I first had surgery the doctor's office gave me info about\n something called \"Look Good Feel Good\", where you sign up to go to a seminar and get free makeup and demonstrations about\n how to do your brows and lashes, etc. I never signed up because I really was doing okay with my looks until the lashes and brows went. Their lack changed my face so much.... made me \"look\" like a cancer patient, even when I had my wig on. So in the last couple of weeks feeling like there's no way to NOT look sickly anyway, I basically stopped wearing my wig almost 100% of the time --in the house. For the few things that take me out of the house I would put a wig on. So I signed up for the seminar, but the nearest date I could get isn't until mid-April. Oh well, better late than never. \nI started to realize that it may effect my husband seeing me bald all the time. I don't mean that I look \"ugly\", because I know he doesn't see it that way. But it may make him focus on \"my wife is going through cancer\" every second of the day, never giving his brain a rest not to instantly think of that. So, starting yesterday I decided to wear a wig as much as absolutely possible. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.\n ",

I'm sorry you haven't been feeling well. Since you are moderator of chronic pain and psoriasis, does that mean that is your main problem? I don't know much about\n psoriasis, but chronic pain I can relate to (having had 4 back surgeries). Luckily, the last surgery \"fixed me\", so the pain is gone, but there were many dark months of chronic pain which takes such a mental toll, as well. \nMy last round of AC on Jan 9 pretty much wiped me out, energy-wise.

I was looking at some of my previous posts and it amazes me that after the early chemos I still had so much energy and took nice long walks, sometimes more than one a day. \nI think I may finally be losing my eyelashes. about\n 50% are gone.

      "Content": " I can't believe it's been so long since I've written. It certainly hasn't been because I've been busy. Just about\n the only thing I've done is binge watch tv shows. I needed to see the newest season of House of Cards, and since it had been over a year since I watched season 4, my husband and I went back to season 1 and went through every episode through season 4, and just this week started season 5. With a gf down the street we binged on Stranger Things. One of the cable channels has been airing old ER episodes, starting with the pilot. Supposedly there are 15 seasons of ER, but so far they just keep repeating seasons one through 4 over and over. \nI've done my pre-cancer warm up routines maybe only every other day. I am up to 4 push ups. I am stuck at 45 sit ups, and the last ten kill me. Splits are still difficult and far from complete. On a few of the 10 point balance moves I can hold the position for a few seconds without much wobbling. But once I do the pivot on my balancing foot, it's all over...... I mean I keep going, but each of the moves I do after the pivot is pitiful. It was never this hard as a beginner. Duh, I have GBS and my feet are numb and I have no sense of balance, so I know I can't expect quick, or even complete success.....perhaps ever. \nI've been having a pity party for the last couple days over my hair....which is stuck at 1 1/2 inches, and stands straight up all over my head. Anyone who has followed my thread from the start knows that I have hair issues. I had quite long, and pretty, hair. I'm not a young person, but I had young person hair. I'm not sure how many more years I would have kept it this long, or even longer, but I do know that when the time would come for me to have a more mature person's hair, I would never, ever gone for a mannish cut, like many older women do. And once again, please forgive me for having such negative emotions toward very short hair, I have no idea what childhood incident put that imprint in my brain, but it's there. \nActually, there are four things I've managed to do for decades, because I didn't want the negative consequences that would almost certainly come later. Living in Florida my whole life, as a kid and teen and sometimes one's entire life, is spent enjoying getting a tan. When I was VERY young, like 12 or 13, I kept overhearing my mom and so many of my mom's friends (who were in there 30s and 40s) complaining about\n the \"sun spots\" on their hands making their hands look so old. And way back then I remember I started putting SPF 30 on my hands, and I did it daily, even when not tanning, and to this day I do not have a single spot on my hands. Another thing I saw when I was pretty young were the debilitating effects of osteoporosis, and I vowed I'd never end up hunched over. So I read that I needed extra calcium, magnesium, vit D3, and weight-bearing exercises to ward off bone loss through the years. And for decades I have diligently taken those measures and it has worked. When I had a bone density scan before surgery, she said I have the bones of a 25 year old. The third thing was I didn't want to end up with missing teeth or dentures when I was old, so even though I never went to my PC doctor for an annual pap smear or breast exam (STUPID!!!!!!!).... I never missed a six month cleaning. \nThe 4th thing I've worked on for decades was the hair. I know I sound so vain and shallow. I am lucky to be alive. However, these four things I had control over for decades, and for decades I have succeeded. The hair was lost overnight. It came out 2 days before Thanksgiving last year, and even though I stopped chemo in February, seven months ago, I only have 1 1/2 inches of hair. And my hair grows hideously slow, it always has. So I will have this mannish hair for a very long time. I can't wear a wig every moment of the day---they get hot, itchy sometimes, and I'm sure it's good to have my scalp \"breathe\".....\nIt's so hard to have worked on something for decades and have it taken away overnight, and not easily or quickly replaceable. I guess I'd feel the same if chemo caused my teeth to fall out overnight and I had to wait a very long time to have them again, or if I'd woken up suddenly hunched over, or my hands suddenly were covered with sun spots, and I wasn't allowed to even cover the spots for a long time. \nSo decades of living a certain way to achieve certain results, and then to have one thing gone is traumatizing me. I do feel ridiculous saying that, but it's true.\nI still have this deflated right tissue expander and the right side of my chest is quite ugly, yet I'm not traumatized by that. I'm irked I still don't have a surgery date to replace it, but that's different. There was nothing I did every day to protect my breasts, so the loss of them isn't as hard on me, maybe. Maybe if I had religiously done self exams and never missed an annual checkup, I'd feel more \"cheated\" out of losing my breasts. But I was stupid. I avoided breast exams from as early as I can remember, because my breasts were large and I could feel lumps in them. I'm sure as a 12 year old the lumps were nothing, but I was scared to know for sure, so I just never continued with the self exams and kept away from doctors unless it was unavoidable. \nAye, aye, aye.... I go from not chatting at all to babbling like a self-centered idiot. Of course I have other things on my mind that are depressing me besides my stupid hair, but perhaps it's just easier to pin ALL of my hurt and angry and helpless feelings toward my hair, than it is to address the other issues. \nBest of health and positive thought to all. I need to remember this, too, and stop wallowing!\n ",

      "Content": " Susie, I'm sorry you've hit a rough patch. I hope the massage was a good first step. \nIn Florida our weather goes back and forth this time of year like yours does in Texas. It makes it hard to get dressed for the day, that's for sure. \nYes, it is my oncologist having me take high doses of OTC meds for the bone pain. First I was on the prescript\nion Naproxen, and when that didn't work, she said to go to 800 mg acetaminophen or ibuprofen every 8 hours to see if that worked, before they would move on to prescribing any kind of narcotic. I ended up exchanging a couple of after-hours phone calls with the PA in the last couple of nights and she said that the onc wants me to have a bone scan to rule out that the cancer has spread into my bones. Well, this gives me something new to worry about\n! My bff had a friend with breast cancer which spread to her spine and she died. The girl was a year younger than I am. \nAnyway, the bone scan is set for 3/7, so not too far off. It's a nuclear test, so I have to get an IV of some kind of radioactive substance, then wait 3-4 hours and come back and have the scan done, which takes about\n an hour. If anything \"shows up\", then more tests will be ordered, which could include CT scan, PET scan, MRI, and biopsy. \nAll I can think is money money money. I do not believe for a second that my cancer has spread into my bones. I believe that I am having the VERY COMMON reaction to taxol of BONE PAIN, and that I need a narcotic pain reliever to deal with this level of pain. \nI'm going to call the doctor tomorrow and beg/demand to get a prescript\nion to at least handle this pain until all the tests they want to do finally rule out bone cancer. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.

      "Content": " The 3rd xray was \"suggestive\" of pneumonia, so I went to see my PCP. The place I had the xray done was in his office building, and I was able to get in this morning. He says I do have pneumonia, that it was probably bronchitis that turned into pneumonia. So I got a stronger antibiotic and refills on my cough meds. I feel pretty confident that I won't be getting my chemo this coming Monday, which means 4 missed appointments. There is no way I'll be able to attend my son's graduation. Instead of having been done with my chemo treatments for at least 2 weeks, now I will most likely have 2-3 treatments remaining. While on Taxol my WBC has been the lowest on a weekly average, so IF I were to go to the ceremony, I would be in a closed convention center with thousands of people for four hours... No telling what I would pick up there. \nI know it's not the end of the world that I can't go. My husband and other son are going to go and someone can face time it, or video it, or something or other. \nI sure do feel beaten down by this pneumonia though. EXTREME fatigue, and dizziness and trouble even breathing at all while in the midst of my coughing attacks. It will seem like a piece of cake when I eventually get back to \"only\" fighting cancer. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. ",

      "Content": " I leave in a few minutes for my third Taxol. Which means I had to set the alarm for 3:30 am to take the steroids.... so another messed up night of sleep. \nFor someone who was as filled with dread about\n my very long hair falling out, I think I ended up handling it remarkably well. I put on a nice-looking wig, and basically when I got \"done up\", I looked just like I always did. Everyone knows I didn't handle it well when my right breast expander failed. I had linked my physical recovery to my fight with cancer, and when one side of me completely collapsed it made me feel like I was losing against cancer. The right side REALLY does look bad. Not only that there is no breast there, but there is a failed expander underneath, and there are ripples, and lumps and cave-in areas, and just a whole lot of ugly there. But I got over it. \nThen a couple weeks ago my eyelashes fell out, and i really have been surprised how much a loss of any lashes diminishes my overall look of well-being. Well, today, it's my eyebrows-- about\n 80% gone. This would have been a HELL of a lot easier to take if the hair on my head and lashes and brows would have all dropped out at once. \nI'm up for some more b!tching and moaning, but I have to leave for chemo. Hopefully I'll chill out and be in a better mood when I write next. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading. ",

      "Content": " Susie , your weather sounds pretty lousy! Florida gets more than it's fair share of non-relenting heat, severe rain and lightning, but I really think Texas has it worse. \n\"NP\"? I'm not familiar with that one.... or, it's chemo brain getting me again. \nI am LOATHE to sound like a broken record, especially a record set on something negative, but it has happened again --- bad to worse. So after 3 1/2 weeks of pneumonia and not being able to see anyone or to go anywhere, and having to delay my Taxol treatments, I finally had a breakthrough day, where I was starting to feel not quite as decrepit and pathetic. One of my BFFs lives just down the street and her birthday was the next day so we decided to walk around the block so I could give her a card also. I warned her I'd need to go slowly. And boy did I! We strolled VERY slowly---me afraid I'd burst into a coughing fit, and my friend just feeling a bit out of shape. So although we only walked slowly for about\n 45 minutes, I still had to bend over and cough several times. \nHere's where the story turns really ugly. After i got home I had a painful 45 minute fit, curled into a ball as I hacked and hacked my lungs up. The coughs were so violent I could feel them in my back. I even said to my husband, \"man, it feels like my back is exploding from the inside\"! So I spent the rest of the night my couch in a lot of back pain, and fighting the urge to cough. When I woke up Tuesday morning I was completely unable to move my legs--- now numb from the hips down. I had maybe 10%feeling in each leg, but other than that they were dead weight. The rest of that day my husband had to lift me off the couch and I'd hold desperately onto his arm as we'd shuffle toward the bathroom a few feet away. And those few feet were a STRUGGLE!! Along the way my legs would \"give way\", sometimes at the hip, other times buckling at the knees or ankles. We decide to see how a day of complete rest affected the problem, so I did nothing but the shuffling to the bathroom routine the entire day. And when it was NO BETTER at all on Wednesday we went to the ER at lunchtime. By dinner time they knew they had to switch me to a bigger hospital and be admitted. It's almost Sunday now and I'm still here, and NO\nBETTER. I am having every test done that anyone has ever heard of.\n ",

      "Content": " Well, I am up to writing right away as the surgery was postponed until Nov 2! Which I did not find out about\n until late yesterday, and was NOT happy about\n. You get in a certain mindset about\n having surgery, bag packed, advanced directive filled out.....all my friends had come over in the last couple of days bringing small gifts and wishing me well, etc. And BOTH of my sons actually called yesterday! The one who was essentially off the grid, found his way to the grid to make a phone call, so that made me really happy. His call came in the morning before I knew the date had been changed. The reason given was that the hospital had just \nopened a new surgery tower, which I had seen was under construction for quite some time, and they just didn't have it quite ready yet to handle all the scheduled operations due to construction delays with Hurricane Irma. \nSo, I pigged out on brownies and other goodies that were here with 2 girlfriends who were at the house when the postponement call came in, and now I wait 2 days. It'll be here before I know it, but i was NOT happy when I first got the news. \nI have really connected with the counselor I am seeing! She is great, and she is the one who actually labeled how I am feeling about\n my previous horrendous hospital stay as Post Traumatic Stress. I didn't realize that's what it was, but it makes sense. I've also gone to the women's group cancer counseling sessions as well. The counselor is there but stays out of it for the most part. The women just go around talking about\n whatever issue of their cancer they are currently dealing with, and everyone offers their support, or has answers to their questions, etc. It's a very helpful group. I've learned a lot about\n other peoples' cancers, only half of which are breast cancers. \nSoooo, I get to wait for a couple more days and hopefully not overeat through my discouragement, lol.\nI hope you're doing well, Susie, and that maybe cooler weather is heading your way.\nPositive thoughts and best of health to all.

      "Content": " I may have spoken too soon about\n not having bone pain from Taxol. I realize that for the last couple of days my knees have hurt periodically (and although I'm in my mid-50s I never get knee pain, or any joint pain), and yesterday my upper right thigh bone hurt. These pains aren't long-lasting, thank goodness. (Edit: since I wrote this post I have also woken up in the middle of the night last night with severe leg bone pain, and today I am having the bone pain in my teeth and my upper and lower mandibles. The pain is pretty debilitating. I called my onc's office and due to the hour someone will have to call me back tomorrow.)\nA side effect may be very poor sleep. No matter what time I go to bed or how tired I am, I awake after anywhere from 2-5 hours. Today I woke up after 2 1/2 hours, my mind fully alert\n. What happens on these days are by noon my body and mind are very fatigued, but I do not nap, I am basically a blob on the couch from noonish onward! \nI use the early morning hours to write letters (actual handwritten letters!!), as well as TRY to email folks, although my typing skills are mainly lost in my chemo brain fog. I make so many mistakes and the emails take so long to complete. \nI've spent this morning trying to plan for my son's college graduation, coming up in May. I will have JUST finished chemo, and will be in between surgery and radiation starting. So the timing is as good as it can get in my situation. \nDoes anyone have any gift ideas for a college grad going off to law school? He's been accepted to 2 so far, one down here in Florida and one in the DC area. He's waiting to hear from a couple of others, so no idea where he'll be going yet. He has a laptop of course, and he'd probably want to pick out his own IF he did need one. Do law students actually need suits to wear? Or do they dress as casually as undergrads? Is a fancy watch or fancy briefcase appropriate at this point? Susie, I know with all your career in the legal field, and your friend's son who went to law school, you probably have great ideas. Ideas are welcome from anyone! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.\n ",

      "Content": " I can't believe it's been so long since I wrote. I am not keeping up with my creams as diligently as I did at first. It's supposed to be twice a day, but now I'm only doing once a day. It's hard to do because I am putting the cream all over both breasts, not just on that little port scar. And it's very greasy and I'm not supposed to wear a bra with it on, and whatever shirt I have on becomes stained. \nBut the good news is I know the creams are still working. I notice it especially on the radiated skin. It is becoming MUCH smoother, almost normal. And the color is fading as well. So if anyone out there gets radiation and is unhappy with the color or texture of their skin, I definitely recommend that you ask your doctor for a prescript\nion compound cream. what I got is 2 creams. They are supoosed to be mixed together in one container, but my insurance wouldn't cover that cost. So I put the first cream on, which is Fluocinonode 1%, rub it over the area for 30 seconds, the the other is just called \"scar gel\", and that's the really greasy one, in a pump bottle, and I put that on top of the other and rub it in for 30 seconds. \nI see my onc next week for her to check my blood work. I hope nothing is off a little causing me to have a scan, ultrasound, or any kind of test. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " Hola. 2 weeks from tomorrow is the new \u201cbig day\u201d. We\u2019re technically in flu season now (which my doctor says lasts until MAY), so I am forgoing doing anything in public from now on. No \nopening the doors a hundred times tomorrow night for the trick or treaters. I am washing my hands like a fool and Purelling myself often. Changing sheets every day and my husband is bleaching the kitchen and all the baths 2-3 times a week. A friend suggested waiting to have surgery until after the worst of flu season is over (end of February), but I don\u2019t want to wait if I\u2019m healthy, physically and emotionally, and there\u2019s also the issue of my insurance. It ends in February, and then I\u2019ll go on disability Medicare. However through the end of this year I have met every deductible and out-of-pocket expense, which is a BIG DEAL. Just to get one surgery done before I start incurring those deductibles and out of pockets means a lot to us. We\u2019ve had problems with the house that we just can\u2019t even afford to fix now. \n.... cancer is just the beginning when you get diagnosed. So many other things end up impacting your life also that you aren\u2019t leading YOUR life anymore. I can dream that I\u2019ll get my life back!! But with 3 surgeries to fix the last disaster, and knowing that things ALWAYS come up, it\u2019s hard to picture how old I\u2019ll be by the time I ever get to be \u201cme\u201d again. Ugh. Sorry, this wasn\u2019t meant as a poor me/pity me post. I am THRILLED that a major surgery is just a couple weeks away. And I\u2019ve been eating very healthy and exercising so I feel well prepared. \n... best of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " So yesterday I missed my 4th week in a row of Taxol, from this pneumonia I have. My PA called just to check on me, and if I'd been thinking straight I would have asked her a couple of things. Like I was scheduled to have 12 weekly Taxol treatments. I made it through the first 5 treatments before I had to stop due to being sick. I had presumed that when I am better I would just pick up where I left off and have the remaining 7 treatments. But I wonder if it's going to be that I have to have 12 in a row? I'm also wondering that if the answer is I just have the 7 remaining treatments, does this long interruption decrease its efficacy?\nI am getting better slowly. Like maybe I cough only about\n 80% as much as I had been. But today I had one of the worst fits ever, lasting about\n 3 hours, and was so violent on my whole body that I \"threw my back out\". \nI will be SO grateful when I only have cancer. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.

      "Content": " Omgosh, I am so sorry it's been so long since I've posted. I did not die! lol \nThe healing continued really well from the reconstruction of 11/14/18. The back scar is flattened out, but a section of my back is flat as well. I haven't really found out if I can build that muscle back up to how it used to be. The scars on the breast are healing very well, too. This doctor did an AMAZING job-- you'd never know I had a huge canyon in my chest that covered more than just the breast area. It looks like a regular reconstruction from a mastectomy-- something I was SURE was not possible. \n \nI ended up not needing any other fill ups, other than the one she did at the time of surgery. So, my next surgery is January 4th! Less than 2 weeks away, to take the expander out and put the implant in. After I heal from that there will be one more surgery to put on nipples. I am really thrilled.\nMy son who was always \"gone\", moved to an apartment with a friend about\n 45 minutes away, but he will be here for Christmas. My other son, who lives in DC, came home as soon as exams were over and is staying 2 weeks. So overall, I'm a happy woman! My back still hurts from the surgery at times (always at the end of the day when I try to rest. There is NO comfortable position.)\nAnd I still have to work on my leftover issues from Voldemort.... I'm trying to give that no thought/stress at this time. All my thoughts and prayers are for healing from these frequent breast surgeries. \nI'm sorry about\n your husband. It sounds terrible when the typical option for a cure isn't possible. I hope there is some medical device that can help. You sound great! And having your kids or other relatives host Christmas sounds ideal.\nBy accident (it's hard to explain), I ended up re-joining facebook after nine years away. I went on the site to formally quit--since I started getting so many emails from them suddenly, and well, I stayed. At first it was just to post pictures of my paintings, since I haven't done enough yet to put on a show. I thought it would be nice to get feedback. But then being the chatterbox I am I started spilling the beans. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year if I don't read from you before then\nLinda, I removed your name, this is to protect your privacy.

Also, a cold or flu can cause a relapse of Voldemort, which is my biggest fear.

GBS paralyzed my fingers, by at least 50%. I drop things, all day. EVERY thing I do with my hands is severely compromised. I can hold on to nothing--silverware, pens, make-up wands and brushes. The list is endless. I desperately want to tell about\n the horrors of my 12-day stay at one of the best hospitals in Florida, but it will have to wait.

I hope this huge delay between treatments ---I had 5 weeks of no treatment due to pneumonia just before my 5 weeks of no treatment due to GBS, I hope this huge gap in treatment doesn't worsen my chance for a full recovery from cancer.\nI can't wait until the day I am only fighting cancer!!!\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.\n ",

You have enough that you deal with. \nOkay, so when I originally woke up paralyzed and my closest hospital transferred me to the more prestigious hospital 45-60 minutes away that night, I was placed in a unit that seemed for people who had yet to be diagnosed. I can't keep track of all the tests I had over the next 11-12 days there, but they were incessant. I was heavily drugged with IV dilaudid, (like 20 times stronger than morphine), plus had oxycodone and OxyContin. I think the last 2 tests they did gave the diagnosis of Guillain Barre syndrome: a CT myelogram and a lumbar puncture. The myelogram was weird--- they put some kind of nuclear liquid in me and then tilted me on a table in all directions, even upside down, briefly, to spread the liquid around. Anyway, they were sure of the diagnosis after those, so we luckily got approved for \"the best\" rehab hospital around. \nOh, before I get into my rehab stories from my new hospital, I HAVE to tell the nightmare experiences at the hospital I have just left, but I am too worn out now. I'll just give a hint: think of the Jessica Lange \"American Horror Story\" TV series, this season called \"Hospital\"......\n ",

He was very thorough and went over every test that was done during my 5 weeks in the 2 hospitals, and gave me a very thorough physical and he let me speak about\n all my concerns. Out of the 11 drugs I left the hospital with, he kept 10 of them the same but switched Gabapentin to Horizant, which is gabapentin mixed with something else to reduce the side effects of gabapentin. \nI like it that he called my onc while I was there and they discussed my case. They agreed I would not continue with Taxol as that may have contributed to my GBS. However I won't know what new drug I'll be on until after I see her. As soon as I got home I called for an appointment with her, but due to a vacation the first appointment I could get was June 13.\nSo in the meantime I will work on my outpatient OT and PT.\nI would like to comment that since my posts are longer my hands must be getting better, but nothing could be further from the truth. I estimate they are 80% or more paralyzed. Each keystroke is a major effort, and my hands are in EXTREME pain every moment of the day. I awake in pain and the pain increases throughout the day until I am nearly in tears by bedtime. Last night my hand pain woke at 3am and kept me up for an agonizing 3 hours.

I'll pick up a piece of paper with my left hand and situate it on the table, then grab a pen or pencil with my right hand, then start to write and realize the pen has fallen out of my hand and i didn't even know it. I can't tell if I am no longer holding something if I'm not looking at it. Proprioception it's called. Same thing is happening with my feet.

I'm glad you finally got the meds you need. \nI haven't gotten the compound cream yet, which the doctor thought i would have by now. So tomorrow I'll have to call the pharmacy and probably the insurance company, too. \n \n When you have a disease, fighting the disease is only a small part of the battle--that's what I'm learning. Incorrect billing, fighting charges, ENDLESS calls to the insurance company and almost never is a problem resolved. I am STILL being double-billed for my health insurance from the time it was paid from my STD. I call people and talk and talk and talk and everyone SAYS they understand the problem and it will be taken care of. Yet every other day I get past due notices for the insurance that was paid already through automatic deductions. \n I have little energy or patience to deal with THEIR mistake. Radiation fatigues me SO much, plus having GBS is draining and I'm still half paralyzed. UGHHHHHH\n I did not go to the SSD hearing, as the attorney's office did not think I'd be allowed to speak, nor know how long it would take. My husband gave me a pretty thorough account of how it went, and I think his case was presented very well. I will be stunned if the judge rules against him. They said he'd get the judge's ruling in 4-12 weeks. \n The radiation is finally starting to effect my skin. I thought the area that would be bothered is the area that has never seen sunlight, but my radiologist said it's the opposite-- areas like upper cleavage will be most effected, and that is what happened. The top of my breast/chest area feels itchy and irritated. She prescribed a steroid cream to apply twice a day and that is working. \n Susie, I pray your dental nightmare is over.

This morning after radiation while I was getting dressed, I saw something in the mirror, in the armpit area. Upon closer inspection I discovered it was skin that had peeled and balled up. When I pulled it off a large swath of skin came off as well. This really surprised me, as I had just examined my skin maybe an hour earlier when I got dressed, and although the area was sunburned looking, it wasn't peeling then.

      "Content": " I see the neurologist who is treating me for my Guillain Barre in about\n 2 weeks. I see my primary care doctor in just a couple of days. I had both OT & PT yesterday. One of the therapists has been at it for 25 years has seen during that time just 4 other Guillain Barre patients besides me. So I asked him if he'd heard of anyone else experience the feeling of drops of water landing on them, and he said No, but added when there is damage to nerves, it did not surprise him, as just about\n any weird feeling can happen. That rang true to me, and reminded me of the nerve damage I had after a back surgery 13 years ago. \nI was left with a very unpleasant feeling on a maybe 3\" x 3\" area of skin on my upper left thigh. The first time the weird feeling happened was when I was still in the hospital after the surgery. A nurse was doing something with my IV and suddenly it felt like a needle was being violently scraped against my skin. I shrieked and asked what the heck she was doing. Of course, she was not doing anything near my leg. That feeling happened a few more times in the hospital, sometimes more like someone was torturing me with a broken, very sharp piece of glass, dragging it quickly back and forth on that patch of skin. The feeling is so convincing. I had asked my doctor about\n it then and he said that since the surgery was basically at my spinal cord, that odd nerve reactions can occur and should lessen or disappear in time. Since then, 2004, I have experienced the jagged piece of glass scraping my thigh maybe 6 times---usually after a particularly physically stressful day of yard work or kickboxing. So that is likely what's going on here--I have nerve damage so weird feelings will happen, like the drops of water. \nI do take an anti-depressant, ever since my breast cancer was diagnosed. That diagnosis pushed me over the edge, compounding the problems I was already dealing with, financially, with my marriage, with my oldest son. And in the last few weeks the dosage was increased. \nI am now starting to wonder if I am getting lymphedema, a side effect of the mastectomy, as all my axillary lymph nodes on the left side were removed. I can't get rings to fit, and the medical alert\n bracelet I wear on my left arm is tight. However, since I have Guillain Barre, it is also severely effecting my fingers, hands, and to some degree, arms (as well as my legs and feet). I see my oncologist in a couple weeks so I'll discuss lymphedema with her then. \nSusie, I went to the inspire website and without joining read around for awhile. Thank God for the Internet and forums so we can learn so much from others' first hand accounts. \nWell I have babbled on for quite awhile here! And with how poorly my fingers function, the time and effort to correct my mistakes has worn me out, lol. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all who are reading.\n ",

      "Content": " We are scheduled to get rain every day for at least a week, so no more attempts at gardening for awhile.\nSo, let me share my despair and frustration over my Long Term Disability and health insurance situation. I had short term disability until April 4, and when I was receiving that I got checks every two weeks, and from those checks payment for my Aetna health insurance was automatically deducted. Once it switched to long term disability, I only get a check once a month, and they do not deduct for the health insurance. I was told that I would receive a bill for the health insurance from another company, called bswift.\nSo, STD ended April 4.... at the end of the month I got my first LTD check, and was told I'd always get the check at the end of the month. But I did not receive a bill for April's Aetna health insurance. I called several different departments at Aetna and they had no idea when I would be billed, and no one had a valid number for \"bswift\".....May comes along and at the end of the month I got my LTD check, but again no bill for health insurance. Then a couple days later I get my first correspondence from bswift saying I owe a little over $3000 ($602 a month from January though May, and they included a coupon book to make each payment from January through December, and encouraged me to pay up for the missed months of January through April so my insurance would not be cancelled.\nOf course I start to freak. The idea of losing my health insurance is unthinkable. At first I only started working 7 years ago to get health insurance for my husband and kids when he could no longer work and we couldn't afford COBRA any more. He'd had diabetes for 20 years and a heart attack, so medications for those problems is mandatory, and expensive, and we never know when he could end up in the hospital again. My kids had no health issues, but they are both \"extreme athletes\", so we had trips to the ER for stitches from falls, and possible concussions, so xrays and CT scans were very expensive. I was the only person in the family who never had any medical expenses.\nBut now the expenses for my cancer treatment, and now for my Guillain Barre Syndrome, far surpasses my husband's expenses, and for the most part my kids have outgrown their desire to do extremely risky sports and stunts. WE CANNOT LOSE OUR INSURANCE. So like I said I freaked, then calmed down and called bswift and explained that I did not owe $3000+, because payments for my health insurance from January through April 4th were already paid by automatic deductions from my STD checks. I asked for a letter confirming this and for them to send me a new bill from April 5th onward. The woman I spoke to seemed to comprehend the mistake and said their billing department would contact my employer to confirm and it would be cleared up. \nOf course the story goes on to be a nightmare, with me continuing to get past due notices for the months already paid, and me having to make tons of phone calls and emails to both my employer and bswift, and everyone saying the problem will be resolved....but the past due bills prove otherwise.\nI don't have the mental fortitude anymore to deal with crap like this! I used to be such a strong person, but for the last 16 years I have had to deal with so many problems, that I have been beaten down. I was feeling beaten down by many severe problems: marital, financial, and with my oldest son, BEFORE I got cancer, and then GBS, that there's not much left of me to deal with new problems that come along (like the health insurance).

      "Content": " Thank you, Susie, it is definitely quite a load off. The amount of back pay he will be getting will pay off some of our bills-- far from paying them all off. The really great change in our lives will be him getting a monthly check that will actually be able to pay a good portion of our monthly bills, so our debt will build up much more slowly. That is the biggest relief for me. \nSo as a woman in her mid-50s, who has always had to watch what I eat and also exercise quite a lot to keep from becoming obese, obviously I have gained a lot of weight in the last 10-11 months. First the mastectomy limited all exercise for awhile. Then when I was healed from that, the chemo treatment made me so fatigued I didn't feel like exercising. And then the Guillain Barre paralyzed me (which is now mostly gone, just my feet and hands are numb), but I still do not have my balance back. I have to use a walker, but I have found a way to start taking some of these extra pounds off. \nInside my house there's an uninterrupted path that I can take--through the family room, then the kitchen and breakfast room, through the dining room, then living room and back to where I started. For a half hour each day I have been walking that path with my walker as quickly as I can, which is pretty quick. I actually build up a sweat and get my heart rate up! And I am thrilled to report that I have lost 14 pounds!! I'd like to lose another ten, which should happen if I keep this up, maybe going a bit longer, like 40 minutes. \nSo, tomorrow is Monday and I start my dreaded phone calls and emails again about\n my insurance and LOA, etc. However, my last email got them to finally give me the name of the person who can presumably provide the proof that I need to show that I do not owe any back health insurance bills. On Friday I called the woman but had to leave a message on her voice mail. Wish me luck for tomorrow's call! \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

I have spent so much time every day with either phone calls or emails or faxes regarding all the problems with my employer, with the ins. company handling my LTD, and with the company that bills me for my health ins ---STILL trying to double bill me for 3 months I already paid for. I was sitting on the couch earlier and my husband had gone out for the mail, and as he came toward me saying \"this one's for you\"...I started to curl up in a ball and well up with tears, not even knowing who it was from. I told him not to give it to me, just to sit it on the kitchen counter. I was right to fear the mail, as it's from one of the companies making my life intolerable. I haven't \nopened it yet. \nI want to just GIVE UP, and spend no more stressful time trying to fix any problems, and let whatever happens, happen. My employer will eventually fire me since they think I am just \"not showing up\" for work since June 22, and my health insurance will eventually cut off my coverage since they think I have been behind in payments for 3 months. I just have nothing left inside me to keep dealing with problems.\n ",

      "Content": " So I saw the PS today, but I did not get a date for the surgery \n \nEven though I told my neuro I'd be having this reconstruction done before I did any further IVIG treatment, and he was okay with me having surgery, and even though my surgeon thought it was fine to take out my port during the same reconstruction (either the PS could do it, if she was comfortable doing it, or he would pop into my reconstruction and take the port out himself)......all of which I told my PS, she insists on checking with them first before scheduling a surgery. \nSo I'm unhappy I didn't leave her office with a date, but I know she's an extremely cautious person, and that's what I want in a doctor. Her work is really great, too. When I had my mastectomy it was a tag team of doctors. My surgeon did the mastectomies, then she added alloderm (cadaver skin) and sewed me up. The first time I saw my chest post surgery, I was horrified. It wasn't at all because I was flat chested after being a full-C my whole life, and it wasn't because I had scars across my chest that were at the moment bright red. It was because the scars weren't strictly vertical or horizontal. For the surgeon to get all the tissue and tumors out, in some places he went diagonal......BUT he may have cut me that way, however the PS sewed me up and added the alloderm where needed. The scars now are as close to invisible as you can imagine. And this is after having the tissue expander stretching the skin every week as it built up my left boob. (My poor right boob.... it's been through so much). I had thought that maybe when I went in for the \"fill ups\" it would enlarge the scars or cause stretch marks, and neither of those happened. \nSo, she says she'll call me later in the week after she's had a chance to confirm with all my other doctors that surgery is okay. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all.

Woohoo! \nI COULD be going to PT/OT, for my Guillain Barre, but I've decided just to concentrate on treating my cancer until after I've healed from the upcoming reconstruction surgery, which is still weeks away, as I have to heal from my radiation before my PS will see me. My breast and underarm are bright red and peeling a little bit every day, but no more bleeding. And, oh, my upper back did get burned as well! I hadn't noticed because I rarely look at myself naked in the mirror, from all angles. Actually, it tanned more than burned. Just about\n a three inch wide stripe of darker skin across my upper back. \nI am doing some at home PT/OT so that I don't backslide with the progress I've made. Even though this week I'll be having no appointments, I will be doing other things I dread-- trying to sort out the endless paperwork that I need to complete to send to my employer, the insurance company handling my LTD, and the company handling my claim for disability. My employer is still saying I am a \"no show\" from work since June 22, even though the company they employ to handle my LTD acknowledges that I will be out until at least November. They do not and will not communicate with each other. Also, I should find out this coming week if ONE of my many problems is fixed-- the one where my health insurance company is saying I owe for 3 months of payments that I've already paid. When the mail comes this week everyone may hear a woman screaming all the way from Florida if they once again say I am past due and threaten to end my coverage.

      "Content": " Today is Saturday. It was Thursday when my husband called the PS office and explained to the office manager how long we've been waiting, and that I had left a detailed message on the voice mail on Tuesday, and we've received no call back. On Thursday the office manager told my husband that the doctor would review all my information that night and would call me on Friday. Drum roll........ \nno call back. Friday night, after hours when I knew I'd get the machine, I left a long and emotional message repeating that I'd been living with this deflated expander for nearly eleven months, and I know I had to wait until after radiation to have surgery, but radiation ended 7/11, and now I've been waiting on a surgery date since I saw the doctor on 8/14, and that I feel like I have been dumped, and had no idea what to do. At the very least I wanted to be told if that is the case, I said I'd wait Monday on a call back, but if I didn't get one I would arrive Tuesday morning just before the office \nopens (7:30) so I could speak to the doctor before patients arrive.\nUGH!!!!!!! I don't like any of this!!! I had had nothing but the warmest, most confident feelings for this doctor, and now I don't know what is going on. I think I will also call the surgeon who did my mastectomy, as it was he who recommended her to be there with him starting the reconstruction as soon as he was done. This doctor is a \"superstar\" when it comes to breast cancer. Celebrities come to see him.....they fly in their mothers and sisters and wives to have him do their surgery. I am hoping he'll feel \"some\" responsibility for recommending her in the first place, so once he hears my story, maybe he'll place a call to her and find out what's up. I don't know. I am grasping at straws.\nSomeone called me yesterday from the EEOC as they'd received my initial inquiry. We were on the phone for quite awhile, going over all the facts, and she said that the cursory opinion was that the employer did nothing wrong. She said I can still file a formal complaint with them, which would then be further reviewed, and that the answer would more than likely be that the EEOC dismisses my claim. However it does still leave me \nopen to sue my employer, but that suit has to be filed within 90 days of getting the letter of dismissal from the EEOC. So, something else I don't know how I'll proceed with.\n ",

But I had another (free!) counseling session yesterday afternoon, so that made me get out of the house.\nI told the counselor how I felt so paralyzed, and I don't know exactly what she said, but I don't feel that way any longer. In just 2 visits with her --both were an hour and a half!--I managed to fill her in on everything that I have covered on this forum in the last year! So she knows how desperately sad I am over my older son, and my marriage isn't great, and that I feel like I'm pinning all my happiness on my younger son, now in law school in Wash DC. I think it sounds PATHETIC for a parent to pin their own future, their own happiness on their child. I certainly don't want my son to feel the pressure to \"be my whole life\". \nSo anyway, the counselor had me considering the things that made me happy in life before cancer and GBS took over and (especially the GBS) STOPPED my life, and encouraged me to find some way to participate in one or more of them, even with my limitations. I am feeling much more positive and hopeful now! \nSo PLEASE, anyone with cancer who needs a counselor but has no money for it, check with your doctor to see what services are provided by the cancer society in your area. I am embarrassed I waited soooooo long before ever \nopening the booklet and making the appointment. There are lots of other services and discounts for all kinds of things that are offered to us, just because we have cancer! ",

Having the tube get caught accidentally on something REALLY hurts, and you have to remember to drain it several times a day into a measuring cup and note how many ml are coming out of the drain each day. Having the tubing and the football (which you ciip to a piece of your clothing) really limits what can be worn, also. I won't start getting my fill ups for another couple weeks, though. ",

      "Content": " Today I had my abdominal ultrasound, ordered because my blood tests revealed something abnormal with my \"LFTs\" I think it was called.. something to do with my liver. The biggest part of me has felt that all these other tests that have been ordered ever since I was diagnosed with cancer have been a waste. Maybe waste isn't the right word....the doctors ordering them are trying to rule out problems. I guess I mean that I feel that I know the results will all come back as showing nothing. \nRemember, I was healthy as can be for 57 years, never having to go to the doctor except for sports related injuries that were always treated and resolved 100%. Well, I THOUGHT I was healthy-- there was breast cancer lurking. But then I thought with cancer there'd only be surgery, chemo, radiation, reconstruction...ta da! Back to my normal, very busy with sports activities life. But if the hideous GBS hadn't gotten me, just going through cancer makes you wonder if you're even sicker, because with blood tests every week during the months and months of treatment, any abnormality...even a really tiny abnormality that normally would not even alarm your PCP....will cause a test to be scheduled. I feel like every part of my body has had xrays, ultrasounds, CT scans--with and without contrast--all which came back normal (thank God). But always being sent for tests can make a person FEEL like a sickly person. \nTomorrow I am going for a consult about\n getting a colonoscopy, because I am just slightly anemic, and have been for a long time. Well, I have a crappy diet!! I rarely eat meat or other foods that are rich in iron. I take an iron supplement, and that's probably what keeps me being only \"slightly\" anemic. Over a year ago one of my doctors ordered one of those at home colon test kits....So, the testing company sent me one... I sent back my sample and they said it was normal. (And the insurance company has refused to pay the bill for it! Almost $500. WHYYYYYYYY would they refuse?? I'm over 55, a doctor ordered the test..... why refuse? We've been battling over a year with Aetna about\n this. They denied my husband's as well.) Anyway, it's my cardiologist that is suggesting I get a colonoscopy.....(I have a heart doctor now, even though I'm sure my heart has always been particularly strong because of decades of various aerobic activities, because the EKG or Echo, or EEG or whatever test ordered by my onc, which is mandatory before starting chemo, since the chemo can damage your heart, showed the slightest abnormality).... So I tell my cardiologist that the home test kit for colon cancer came back negative, and he says that just means that one particular sample has no blood in it... the gold standard for testing is the colonoscopy, and I've been anemic for over a year, so where is the blood loss? I am frightened about\n getting this test done, which I'm sure must be several times the cost of the home kit, since Aetna denied paying for the first test. I'm going for the consult tomorrow and expressing to the office manager my concern that she makes sure she confirms with Aetna they will cover this. Supposedly this was done with the home kit, but we know how that turned out. \nPreviously my fill ups for my tissue expanders for my breast reconstruction were done one week apart. When I got this one done on Monday, she said she was going to wait 2 weeks before doing the next one, to make sure my body accepts it and there's no unforeseen reactions. So GBS is going to slow down how fast I get fill ups. I understand but it's frustrating. I am SOOOOOO blessed to be 90% recovered from GBS in such a short time, there are many more horror stories out there of people with GBS that last years and years with complete paralysis and living on a ventilator. However, I am realizing that for the rest of my life, just having had GBS will always affect me. I run the (low) risk of it just spontaneously returning, and the somewhat higher risk that any future surgery could trigger it, or ANY virus, that I ever get, for the rest of my life, can bring it back. And i'm going to be more likely to get sick in the first place as I can never get vaccinated for anything again!. \nOne more GBS story.... last night while watching TV with my husband I suddenly screamed in pain, and began sobbing profusely, tears streaming over my face. Of course my husband paused the show and rushed to my side and asked what was going on. I told him someone just took pruning shears to my right foot and cut off my second toe...... I was WAILING as I was saying it, as the bloody stump where my toe used to be was killing me with pain and throbbing. For the first time when one of these odd nerve things has happened, I did NOT take the blanket off my feet to reassure myself that it really hadn't happened. Two sides of my brain fight each other. One side received nerve signals that could ONLY be interpreted as the pain of having a toe cut off with pruning shears, and the other side, that has visual control, is saying, \"Girrrrrl, you're in the safest suburb in Florida, and NO ONE invaded your home and is going at you with pruning shears!\" \nSo I didn't look, but I did get my husband to get an ice pack to put on the \"wound\", and it took about\n 20 minutes for the sobbing to gradually subsist, and my foot to be numb from the ice.\n ",

She said she had had 2 major staff turnovers, and between that and dealing with Hurricane Irma the paperwork was shuffled around and she dropped the ball on me. She said she still wanted to be my doctor and to see me through to the end. She asked for me to give her 2 days, and promised me I'd hear back from her. I feel much better now. \nAnd completely out of the blue, in Saturday's mail I got notice from the SSA that I was approved for SSD!!! No more dealing with sending in various doctors' reports to the insurance company who is taking care of my Long Term Disability. I expect that there might be a little overlap or something that might go wrong for the first month, but I don't even care. I am just so thankful to be getting SSD. It's not a tremendous amount, not enough to live on even if I were single, but it will help.\nI am confused as well, because my letter did not say anything about\n Medicare. I did as much research as I could online, and what I learned was if you get SSD and you're under 65, you aren't eligible for Medicare for 25 months from the time disability was approved. SSA put my disability as starting March 1, 2017. I've already been on COBRA for 2 months, so I only have 16 months left on that. \nAt my last oncology visit she thought that my thyroid seemed enlarged, and thyroid cancer is a possible side effect of radiation, so I have an appointment later today for an ultrasound.

      "Content": " Hi Susie,\nI have been miraculously busy with BOTH sons being home! Out of the clear blue, my \"lost\" son called and asked for a plane ticket home for Christmas! We were thrilled beyond belief, of course. \nAt first he said he wanted to return to his forest habitat on 12/26, but then said on Christmas he'd like to try it here 30 more days, but he'll have to make some adjustments. We were all pretty busy with Christmas shopping and cooking and decorating and crowds, and he is used to total solitude. So he's not going to go out to eat with us every time, nor go after-Christmas sales shopping. That's okay! \nHow was your Christmas? I hope you followed your Thanksgiving advice and did not wear yourself out. \nI had my post port removal appointment today, and everything is healing well, I am told, although there is still bruising 8 days later and the area is still swollen. I was hoping that the second the port came out, that area of my chest would be perfectly smooth and flat, and it is not. But the doctor thought it looked all totally normal. I can't believe you still have a port in! But maybe after so many years it just becomes natural that there is a bump at that \nlocation on your chest. I had my second \"fill up\" with the PS, and that was exciting. But there will be a 3 week interval before the next fill up due to her vacation schedule. On the one hand it's disappointing not going weekly, and on the other hand, it's nice to get a break from so many appointments. Just in the 9 days my kids have been home I've had 4 appointments, during what should be the slow, holiday schedule. \nOur weather was cold-ish for about\n 2 days, then went back to the 80s, but now we're in the 70s and then to the 60s!! within the next ten days! I might be able to wear a sweater! ",

I brought the creams in to my PS at the last visit and asked if I could use it on my mastectomy scars (which are very minimal) and on the newly stretched skin to try to prevent stretch marks, and she said yes. And it definitely worked on the port removal scar, and I HOPE it will be preventing stretch marks on my newly stretched skin.

I finished my 2 antibiotics that I got after surgery on 11/2 about\n 5 days ago, and that is when I first noticed the red area. So she drew with a purple marker around the red area and I am to report to her if it goes past that boundary. I asked if I'll be getting a refill of those antibiotics, or any others, and she said no. As long as it doesn't go over the boundary, it will probably resolve on its own by the time I see you in a week. IF IF IF it goes over the boundary, I am to call at any hour and I would go into the hospital for IV antibiotics. \nGood grief.\nThis also meant cancelling the port removal surgery that I was supposed to have tomorrow!\nLesson---which I have been taught repeatedly throughout this cancer journey, is--you cannot count on dates. Stuff happens to delay your treatment and/or recovery process all the time.\nPlus, my recent blood work showed elevated liver whatever and I have to get scheduled for an abdominal ultrasound. This is by order of my PCP. Several months ago my onc saw the same whatever on my liver , per my blood work, and from her I got to enjoy a liver CT scan. Which, of course showed no problem. \nAnother lesson--once you get cancer, if your blood work shows even the most miniscule deviance from the norm--- you go for tests to rule out whatever. ",

      "Content": " Hello Susie, and everyone! I wish I knew more \"names\". I feel like I have friends out there. Which reminds me. Let me introduce myself. My name is Linda! \nSo, my younger son just returned to DC to law school. He just got his grades-- A+, A-, B+, B+, B+, which I think is great, but he felt really down about\n. I know he's used to getting all As, and I know he has never tried so hard in his life. He put in many 12-14 hour days studying. He's going to talk to the \"2Ls\" --people in their 2nd year of law school--and see in what ways he can improve on what he focuses his study time. \nMy oldest son, who is just one year older, 23, is still adjusting to the constant and various noises and activities going on around him all the time, after spending nearly a whole year practically isolated in a forest. He still plans on returning, which makes me horribly sad. It seems like such a waste of brainpower and education and ...... life...... to just be alone in the forest meditating. His goal in staying past Christmas is to help his dad get on a vegan diet and to exercise more, because my husband is so debilitated by his diabetes. My son firmly believes a vegan diet and increased exercise will, over time, get his dad off insulin,and the other meds he takes. A vegan diet is HARD (for someone who doesn't want it especially, lol). I don't spend much time with my son. No one does, he obviously prefers to be alone. We have had some conversations, and some have been normal and some have been awkward, and a couple even got heated. Because I keep TRYING to understand his life choice and I don't get it. When his brother was here I did hear laughter coming from their rooms, so I'm glad they found some common ground to find humor. \nSo, I know I wrote that after my third fill up last week my right breast hurt. I thought the pain was going away by the third day, but it really didn't. It took a full five days before the pain was totally gone. And I go again for a fill up in just a few days. I don't think she'll put as much in this time. Also, I believe my left breast may start getting fill ups again-- if not in a few days, then definitely by the next appointment after that!! it is very thrilling to be MOVING ON with cancer stuff!! That stupid GBS really wrecked my recovery. \n And, of course, I still do, and always will, have to deal with the nerve pain and numbness I still have in my feet and in my hands. The numbness is improving. I really am so grateful for that, after reading the horror stories of other GBS victims. As far as actually being a GBS victim-- I got off easy!! But it was still the worst 5 weeks of my life being in the hospitals for that. Once i got home it seemed easier somehow to deal with being paralyzed. Anyway....enough about\n GBS. Once I get started on that subject it's hard to stop. Last thing---i am going to get a tee shirt made up that says I SURVIVED GBS.\nI hope I survive cancer. I would feel more positive in my outlook if I had been able to complete my chemo sessions, but I was unable to because of that other disease I won't mention. Hopefully there isn't a stray cancer cell inside me that the limited chemo treatments didn't get. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all.\n ",

      "Content": " Well, I have to say that I am very disappointed at how slowly my hair is growing back. Most of it is just 2 inches, and some places 3 inches. And it ONLY stands straight up, like clown hair. Not a fun clown either, but a very scary-looking clown, like the one in Stephen King's \"It\". I've tried various products thinking I'll be able to style it in some way, but the products haven't given me good results. I do love my wigs--they are very real-looking, with highlights and lowlights, and one of them is the length, style and color of exactly how my real hair looked before it fell out in Nov. 2016. The other one is just a shorter version of the same wig. My leg hair and \"bikini area\" hair grows like crazy. It took a REALLY long time, but my armpit hair finally grew back. I shaved it once and not a single hair has grown back. It's been over a month! It really does depress me about\n the shortness of the hair standing straight up on my head. \n A part of me feels guilty for complaining about\n this. I went through breast cancer, and things could have turned out so much worse, and I know they have for some other people. It could have spread to more than one lymph node, it could have spread to the chest wall (muscle tissue, I guess), or worse-- spread to some other part of my body. I know folks who have each of these paths to take. But I'm keeping it real. This is my story. What is happening to just me and the issues that affect me, and how I deal with them. \nI see my PS tomorrow, and I'll be surprised if I get a fill up. I think my skin has stretched to the max. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all! ",

      "Content": " I forgot to mention that my blood work came back normal. Yay! I didn't need to schedule an ultrasound or CT scan, whatever, to find out if something's wrong all because some #was slightly below or above normal.\nMy WBC count is still on the low end of normal, but no biggie.\nUnfortunately I didn't get to enjoy my perfect boobs for long \n \nJust when the weather is getting warmer and I no longer had to hide the hideousness of my right breast, I was finally able to enjoy wearing tops that have a scoop neck or V-neck. Welllll, not anymore! I noticed and felt something hard under my skin, going diagonally on the right boob up to almost the lower part of my neck. I took a picture of it and sent it to the doctor to see if she thought I needed to come in. Of course the answer was yes. It's a muscle. Some how the expander moved ever so slightly and allowed this particular muscle to look like its straining to escape my body. The expanders are put in under the muscles, just like implants are. But why this particular one suddenly looks like it's trying to escape my body, is a mystery. Other than the expander moving a tad and shifting how the muscles lay, the other possibility is that through my weight lifting I strained the muscle and caused the shift. I only lift 8 pounds. Just enough to keep sagginess at bay, but not enough to bulk out my arms. \nOn another subject-- my complaint to the hospital regarding how I was treated when I was paralyzed, I finally got a call from the litigation specialist today. The call happened to come when we were driving home from our impromtu trip to the PS today, and my cell phone only had 4% battery life. So she agreed to call me tomorrow morning. I am normally such a positive thinker, but for some reason I am thinking the worse. That she, or the legal department that reviewed my file, decides \"this was really not too bad, the lady is just exaggerating.\" But i'm not. Every word in my complaint is true, and all 5 of the people i have now let read about\n what happened, are horrified and can't believe they could behave so badly to me. So, I shall pray to God that the folks at the hospital have the ability to empathize and truly understand what I went through, and continue to go through, as I have PTSD. \nWish me luck tomorrow. I do feel a bit intimidated speaking with her. But I have the truth on my side and a couple things they did to me were BAD, by anyone's standards.\nBest of health and positive thought to all.\n ",

      "Content": " Continued---\nso it was night, same old story, hearing lots of \"I'm not willing\" and having the call button not answered in anything CLOSE to a timely matter. I had to pee, the portable commode was just at the end of my bed. After no one had arrived after pressing the button and telling the voice on the other end that I needed to use the bathroom, the idea of me being able to stand up, as the physical therapists had got me up earlier, I decided to try to go to the commode on my own. Using my arms I lifted my torso from the bed. Doing that was harder than I ever thought it would have been. It took a whole lot of effort but somehow i was able to turn my torso and with my arms, force my concrete pylon legs off of the bed. I felt nothing. Then at great length, I had to use my arms to raise my torso up off the bed ever so slightly (it was all I could manage) and then inch my torso down toward the end of the bed. It wasn't even an inch at a time... probably more like a half an inch. My pylon legs just dragged along with me as dead weight. I began pressing the call button again because I realized this was going to be harder than I thought. But in the meantime while I was waiting for someone to come --lol--I continued to half-inch myself down the bed. By the time I got to the end of the bed, I could see that it must've been a \"shift change\" as all the nurses were gathered RIGHT outside my \nopen door, which is what they did every shift change. Since I had finally gotten to the end of the bed, and the commode was just in front of me IF I stood up out of bed, my plan was to stand up, then twist my torso around so that I would drop onto the commode and do my business. How i would get back in bed was never a thought. I just wanted to empty my bladder a whole lot sooner than would happen if I waited until someone showed up and was willing to help a 2 max. \nHowever, by the time I got to the end of the bed I think I knew that this was something I really wasn't going to be able to do. So with all the nurses right outside my door, I started yelling \"Nurse!\" No answer, not a glance in my direction. So I did it. I used my arms to lift my torso up off the bed, and i was basically in a standing position. It didn't last a millisecond before I knew I was in trouble, and my concrete pylon legs gave way underneath me and I went straight down, just like the Twin Towers on September 11th. I'm saying that literally. I'm a very visual person, and literally as my two concrete pylon legs crumbled under me, at the same time I envisioned the Twin Towers, right next to me, as they collapsed and crumbled, I collapsed. I didn't CHOOSE to think of the Towers, it's just the vision that my brain had, probably since paralyzed folks often describe their legs as useless, concrete pylons. I was still seeing the dust from the collapse of the Towers when I finally screamed bloody murder for help, and turned to see what had become of my lower half. I fully expected to see dust, and crumbled parts of me. It's funny how the brain works that way. Logically I guess I could have realized (even at that time) that legs cannot crumble into the dust and debris as did the Towers, but logic was nowhere. I honestly was SHOCKED when I saw that my lower half was indeed NOT dust and crumbles. But my feet and knees and ankles were all in unnatural positions. If you're as old as I am and watch football, maybe you remember the Joe Theisman leg break. HORRIBLE to see. Even the announcers are squeamish sounding whenever a replay is shown of it. \nNurses finally arrived, and I can't envision how I was put onto a gurney, I can only remember what I heard two nurses say. One said \"why didn't her mattress alarm go off?\" and another said \"and how did her bed get moved so far off the wall without that alarm going off?\" I'm guessing that all my \"inching\" my torso down to the end of the bed caused the bed to move a bit away from the wall each inch of the way. I remember feeling embarrassment and shame and so much regret that I had surely made my condition even worse. I expected that every bone in my hips, legs, knees, ankles, and feet had numerous fractures. I remember crying silently as I was wheeled to xray. I made myself WORSE, more of a burden, needing even more care than I did now!! But by God's grace nothing was broken!! I have no idea if I was covered in back and blue bruises, or if the awkward collapse tore a ligament or tendon, etc, because I could feel nothing. But I cannot express how grateful I was that nothing was broken. A miracle. \nSooooooo, I have developed PTSD. I didn't know I had until 2 counselors told me. I see the counselor provided for free from the breast cancer center, and through our discussions it came out that every time I feel a weakness in my legs, or a nerve shooting up, both of which happen often, those are triggers that bring my brain, my vision back to the dual collapse of both my own legs and the Twin Towers. I always see the Towers when I remember my legs collapsing. Do you know how often I'm forced to relive not only the hideousness of my own fall, but to also relive the Towers collapsing? All the memories of that day in 2001 come back at the same time as the horrible memories of being paralyzed in a place where I was ignored, where I heard \"I'm not willing....\" so often that it made ME feel badly about\n myself, and shame, and embarrassment for being a burden. And I'm a person with a strong ego! It's pretty impossible to make me feel bad about\n myself, but they succeeded. There are so many triggers that set me off to relive these events and horrible, horrible memories and feelings. So, that's it! That was my experience being paralyzed at that hospital. The next day, after my fall, I arrived at a different hospital as much of a \"burden\" as I was before, but the staff here, where I stayed for 3 weeks, were FABULOUS. It still took 2 people maximum effort to help me do anything. But when a call button was pressed it was answered right away.... by professional, caring, compassionate people who never made me feel badly about\n anything. And each time I needed to go to the bathroom, the 2 people would put me in a wheelchair, and wheel me the few feet toward the large bathroom in my room, then they would help me out of the wheelchair and onto the toilet. (never a portable commode or bedpan here). All while respecting my privacy. A hallway door would never be \nopen,and the nurses and aides would make a point to look away, or have something to cover me if needed. \nMy hands were still paralyzed. They had to wiggle my underwear down for me to use the toilet, which is NOT an easy thing to do to a person with paralyzed legs. They had to wipe for me. You get the idea! And they did it all while keeping my privacy, and always being cheerful and happy to see me. \nI've babbled on and on, almost nothing related to breast cancer and this forum at all. I guess we could make the case that if you get cancer, you may think \"well, this is it. this is the bad health problem I'll have to deal with\"...but watch out..... something else, something worse, can still happen. I have learned personally and by hearing other patients' stories and from doctors, that the course of cancer treatment is never predictable. Things will always happen to set back your time line of treatment, or you may have to switch to a different treatment plan, you may have to postpone your own treatment because of a family member's crisis...... it's just always something. Hopefully, everyone else out there with cancer reading this does NOT come down with GBS in the middle of their treatment. Or ever. It's extremely rare, so chances are no one reading this will get it. Unfortunately, it can recur. Things that can trigger a recurrence include surgery, an infection, or injury. Well, I'm definitely having at least one more surgery for my reconstruction. And since folks with GBS can never get a flu shot again, or any vaccine, or even a tetanus shot, chances are that some time in the decades before I die I will get an upper respiratory infection, and certainly injuries because I plan on being as active as I can be, and sometimes, accidents happen during adventurous activities. I'm also more likely to get infections since I have no lymph nodes on my left side. I stress out about\n the many things that could set off GBS again, and boy, do I fall into a panic. I see blackness all around me and know that I am paralyzed and no one will help me. I hear the voices saying \"I'm not willing\"..... This is my PTSD, and I am trying to get over it. The doctor I saw today specializes in helping people cope/recover from PTSD. \nI'm worn out! And my fingers are still partially paralyzed so all this typing is a real strain. I hit the wrong keys so often it is kind of funny, If I ever didn't try to find all my mistakes and fix them before I submit, all I'd be posting would look like mumbo jumbo.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all.

      "Content": " I regret to say I have NOT kept up with my pre-cancer days physical warm ups. I had been doing them nearly every day before the Nov. 2 surgery to switch out my tissue expanders, but I know I had a set-back with that \"disease that shall not be named\"...lol, sounds like the first Harry Potter book... I know, I'll call my disease \"Voldemort\". Now I'm pretty much back to as normal as I was before the surgery, so there's no physical reason not to be attempting to do them. It's emotional, because I haven't been sleeping. Sometimes I'm awake until 5am, 7am..... I am afraid of the nightmares I'll have. I don't have them every night, but often enough that I end up thinking about\n them with dread during my waking hours!\nThe nightmares/daymares I have are about\n the first hospital I was in for almost 2 weeks when I was struck by Voldemort. I'm a very easy-going person, not a complainer at all. However when I first left that hospital to spend another 3 weeks in a different hospital, I told my best friend (an ex-nurse, btw), that I wasn't really treated right at that place (I was very vague, I wasn't nearly ready to say what happened), my bf replied in the way that she and I both would usually reply to such a statement, and said \"Let it go, it's in the past. You're in a better place, focus on the future, focus on your recovery. Keep positive thoughts in your head about\n how you are going to heal, and beat this Voldemort.\"\nSo I pushed the bad memories down and focused on recovery. But several months after I had returned home from the 2nd hospital, I finally \nopened the \"Patient questionnaire\" from the first hospital, that had been laying on my coffee table for months. I checked off all the questions rating this and that on a scale from 1-5...then it left a small space to add other comments. I hadn't planned to do this when I \nopened the envelope, but I started writing. Not planning what I was going to say, just laying out all of my experiences there, exactly as they happened. And it ended up being six typed pages! At some point not long after this I let my husband read it (I hadn't told him most of the things) and he was horrified, and said \"You could sue.\" I also let my bf read it, and she said \"Oh, my God, I had no idea it was that bad. You should sue.\" I haven't reached the point of suing yet, I am trying to get someone \"high up\" in the hospital to read about\n what happened to me.\n Anyway, not sleeping well due to the nightmares/daymares is my excuse for not exercising like I should. I am going to attempt to do my routine now! Bye folks ",

      "Content": " Hi. Yes, I have made copies of everything. A complaint was eventually filed with the nurse manager of the floor I was on. She was very sympathetic and agreed that everything the nurses and aids did wrong were unacceptable and they would all be counselled and maybe some type of course given to correct the incorrect behaviors. That's all well and good, but it doesn't seem like enough. One of my letters to the President of the hospital was answered. He went through the standard apologies and displays of sympathy, and said he was giving my letter to a different department for followup. Someone did follow up and said they would be conducting an \"outside\" investigation. (The original complaint to the nurse manager led to an internal, hospital investigation of my case.) I was told it would be 30 days to get the outside review done. Thirty days past and so I've written the President again. We'll see what happens. \nI am SO not a complainer. But there are still daymares/nightmares that I have that revolve around things that happened at that hospital and that affects how my life is continuing on now. I am seeing a counselor...the free one provided by the Breast Cancer Center. She is GREAT. I see her again tomorrow.\nI THINK I may have had my last fill up at my plastic surgeon's. The breasts are almost the same size now. The doctor said that the breast that received radiation has to be a tad larger with the expanders than the other one, because when the expanders are taken out and switched for implants, the radiated skin will shrink up a bit. And there was only so much skin left, and it can only stretch so far. So I think I'm as big as I'm going to get. Which is not quite the size I was pre-mastectomy, but close enough. \nI really can't get over having two breasts again! It is so exciting. I lived with that flattened yet bumpy side for nearly a year, and it limited my wardrobe to almost nothing. The lumps from the deflated expander started pretty high up on my chest so it limited my wardrobe to almost nothing. Even a regular scoop neck or non-plunging V-neck revealed too much. \nI hope you are doing well, Susie. Catch me up when you can.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " Well, the call to the litigation specialist went as badly as it could. It ended with her saying the hospital feels they have no compensable responsibility to me.\nSo now i'll go ahead and tell ya'll what happened. The bad part of my story happened when I was going through chemo. That's not fun as it is. I was bald, and my reconstruction of my right breast had gone badly--the tissue expander had failed, so my left breast was full-sized (with no nipple yet though) and the right side was hideous--not just flat because the expander leaked and was empty, I was covered with scars from the surgery. It was all bumpy and caved in at the same time. For awhile the expansion had worked and my right breast was growing.....then it got a leak and so became as flat as it was just after the mastectomy, but with the tissue expander still in there, which is very oddly shaped. So you could see the outline of what looked like the lid of a large jar, and then since some skin had stretched out when the expansion was working, now that it was \"flat\", that stretched skin caved in. So on the left side I had a boob with no nipple and on the right side there was the outline of what looked (and felt like) a lid, plus caved in skin, plus the scars, and plus the lump from my chemo port was on that side just above the breast area. The whole right side of my chest was a nightmare. No one had seen it, just my plastic surgeon. My husband had not seen frontal nudity since before the mastectomy, and even I couldn't look at my chest in the mirror. Just getting dressed gave me enough of a view (and a problem to cover). \nSo when I suddenly became paralyzed from Guillain Barre Syndrom, i was taken to the same hospital that did my mastectomies-- Morton Plant in Clearwater, Florida, to a different department, of course. To a department, or ward, whatever, where most of us were paralyzed or in some other way unable to do anything for ourselves at all. It was written on the board next to my name \"2 max\". I asked what that meant and was told it meant that I required the maximum effort from 2 people to get anything done with me. My husband sat by my side during daytime hours, so I wasn't mistreated when he was there as a witness. But at night, no one would answer the call button for usually up to 20 minutes, seemingly for any of us 2 max people in this ward, as i heard so many people yelling for nurses, or even crying/sobbing for help. When I'd press the button for help a voice would say What do you need? And I'd say to go to the bathroom.....but then 20 minutes and much longer would go by before I got anyone to help. Lots of nurses and aides would start to come by, but when they saw the \"2 max\" they would say, \"i'm not willing to work with a 2 max\". I heard \"I'm not willing\" so many times, it felt like a script\n. I began to feel like such a burden.... so rejected, and insulted, and belittled..not worthy of a nurse's or an aide's attention. \nSo one time when someone finally did help me get to the portable commode, which was at the end of my bed, in clear view of the hallway door, which was wide \nopen, I said nothing about\n the \nopen door.... I felt too grateful to be helped to the commode at all, and I felt a kind of shame for being a burden. It seems weird.. I mean, I was sick, I had a disease that paralyzed me AND I had cancer and my chemo interrupted and my reconstruction failing,,,, but hearing \"i'm not willing\" so many times, I was just full of embarrassment and shame for being a burden to them. I'm on the commode, the \nopen hallway door,......and the aid decided to take my gown off over my head. Full frontal nudity!!! When anyone could be walking by or into the room. He hadn't asked my permission, warned me, or do anything to respect my privacy. I was stunned into stone. That's how I am... when something so unreal happens I get shocked and stunned into silence. I was already paralyzed into not being able to react. This is part one. I have to take a little break before writing about\n the second hideous thing that happened to me there. ",

From my own experience, every time I saw a doctor, I would get a LITTLE information, plus appointments for another test or two, and/or a referral to see another doctor, then I'd come home and do research. Each doctor visit and test builds up an information pile. It does seem like your doctor should have gone over the report more fully with you when you were there! Try not to stress too much yet. You're on a new path and you don't know where it will lead, but there is SO much that can be done for cancer patients these days that the path will almost surely have a happy ending.\nBest of luck, and try to keep positive.\nExqualls, diagnosed 8/17/16, Stage 2B, ER+ PR+, HER2- invasive ductal carcinoma, with one lymph node involved.

      "Content": " Surgery \"went well\" i guess. from the doctors' perspective. i entered the hospital thinking it was going to be an outpatient surgery, which made no sense to me at all. However, right away they said it would be overnight. I had thorough discussions with all the nurses and the anesthesiologists and doctor, so I entered the OR feeling quite relaxed and at ease. At some point that night I had a PTSD attack!! I can't remember what triggered it, my only memories are of me being HYSTERICAL and sobbing uncontrollably, and a rotating set of people would come in one at a time and ask me what's the matter, or something similar, and as I'd be crying and trying to give an answer, that person would get up and leave while I was still speaking, and a minute or 2 later another person would come in, do the same thing, and repeat repeat repeat. There was no counselor called in. \nI can't talk about\n that anymore now. about\n my breasts.... the first day they were frightening. I was just a barrel chest.... no outline of a female shape at all.... definitely uniboob going all the way around me it seemed. After a bit of swelling has gone down and I can least see that there are 2 of them. Not lined up next to each other and not remotely the same shape as each other, hopefully that will change.\nGotta go empty my drains! ",

      "Content": " My timeline of 6-12 months to heal from the staph before any other surgeries could be done was based on what I heard the emergency surgeon say a couple days after the surgery. Since then, 3 other doctors-- my PS, my onc, and my infectious disease doctor, have all said 3 months, which pleased me enormously. I saw my new PS, who is located a lot further away, in another county, a few days ago. I got information on the different types of reconstruction available to me and the doctor explained why a certain one was best in my case. It will be a \"lat flap\" with expander. This is where a piece of skin, with it's underlying fat and muscle being taken from an area over my latissimus dorsi area of my back. When that area heals, there is just a single straight scar of varying inches depending on how much skin they need. But even though the area cut out is rather football shaped, the scar is just straight and smooth. The section she removes is made to form the outer breast layer. An expander goes in and the procedure is the same as before. Healing time for the breast is about\n 4 weeks, then I come in for weekly fill-ups until it is approximately the same size as the other breast. Then heal for 3 months and do an exchange to take the expander out and put the implant in. Three months after that nipples can be created for both breasts. So, 3 more surgeries. And all the same risks that go with them---more likely to have staph strike again, more likely to have set backs with Voldemort. But I left her office feeling as positive as I have in a long time. The first surgery could be as early as the end of November (3 months after I was cleared of staph), but there is no date set yet as she is extremely busy. Her scheduler isn't even able to call me to set a date until at least the second week in October. I am just hoping I can get in before the end of the year. \n I am mostly calm and not given to negative thinking, probably because there is no date set. Once it is and we start getting close to it, I'm sure my worry over an infection or worsening Voldemort will increase. Emotionally a large part of me still feels \"paralyzed\", like I can't do or go or plan for anything. But I feel that part of me is lessening. I believe I will become more active in whatever activities I CAN do, and not just stay holed up like an invalid as I have been. \n The new PS (who knew about\n my balance problems from the disease I won't name) asked why I hadn't gone back to kickboxing and racquetball and my other activities, and I said \"you need balance for all of those\". And she correctly pointed out that to do them well, yes, you do. But that I should do them to whatever degree my body allows me to do. I may not ever win another racquetball trophy, but I can be the worst player out there and still be having fun. I love it that you can play racquetball by yourself, and I may miss every shot I go for because with my limited balance I can't pivot and lunge sideways, etc, as fast as I need to, but I can try to do it, and should. Same with kickboxing. I have a heavybag, and I could punch and kick away at it, and obviously not be able to perform as I used to, but I could do it to whatever limited ability I have, and should. I haven't tried either yet, but I am warming up to the fact that I AM going to, and I've begun lifting light weights again and working on my flexibility and core strength. \n Susie, I hope you are doing well, that the Texas heat is abating somewhat.\nBest of health and positive thoughts to all.

      "Content": " Susie, I am horrified by your post. It has taken me all day after reading it to respond because it set off a PTSD attack!! It is exactly what I have begun to fear for my future (having never thought of it one iota before). Being helpless in a hospital, ignored, at the mercy of people who are far from qualified to be in the healthcare industry. I can't believe this is widespread....happening at \"good\" hospitals everywhere. I was thinking it was only at the rare, uncertified \"home\" where someone with no qualifications takes in seniors and charges them, but ignores them as they rot with bedsores. \nI keep hearing the crying and screaming from the other patients in the hospital, being ignored. Oh my goodness. This can't be my future. Until cancer I've always been in excellent health. My other stays in the hospital were due to the birth of my kids or from injuries (not disease). Being an athletic person, and planning to continue to be one until the day I cannot anymore, I presume there could be an injury or two. \nThings that can make GBS recur include injuries, surgeries, infections. I'm starting to breathe heavily now and my throat clenches up just typing this. GBS coming back is the same as being in a black pit, totally helpless, crying silently and hearing voices saying \"I'm not willing to help\". \nI am really stunned that this goes on as much as it does apparently. You complained and got your situation taken care of. My situation naturally resolved itself as I was set to be transferred out of hell to the wonderful hospital --HealthSouth-- the following day. By the time I was able to face what had happened to me, and I added 6 pages of \"additional comments\" to the hospital questionnaire, it was four months later, mid-August of 2017. Since I've sent out my comments I have wanted the hospital to acknowledge that their treatment of paralyzed and severely obese patients is right out of the dark ages. Everyone who knows me considers me \"the strongest person they know\"...... but 12 days of that gave ME, a post traumatic stress disorder! I arrived at the hospital with one disease, and i left with a new one, one they caused. Are they allowed to give patients other diseases and let them leave the hospital? Like MRSA? Or E. Coli? Or is PTSD a disorder they don't believe is real? Do they want to tell that to a therapy group of PTSD survivors? It sounds like I'm \"on a soapbox\"....just calling out a rallying cry for outrage just for the sake of hearing my own voice. I could not be more unlike that type of person. This is the PTSD talking!\nGeesh, with all this writing and thinking about\n it, my head is filled with images of what could happen again.... if not from being paralyzed due to GBS coming back, but what about\n when I get near the end of my life? We'd all like to think we'll be active right up until the end, and then die in our sleep at home, or some variation on that.\nBut that's really not likely.... especially for someone like me with so very few family members. Husband, 2 sons. One son may end up off the grid again, maybe forever.... The other one is very close to me - now- but who knows if in 30 years he or his wife or kids would want to \"take me in\"... \nYou know a huge part of me never wanted to write about\n GBS on this forum at all, and I did limit much of what my PT and recovery have been like, but I have gone on about\n it more than I ever thought I would on an unrelated forum. And I BARELY could bring myself to say I had not such a great time in one of the hospitals while being treated for GBS. So now I'm babbling on about\n my stupid PTSD, while there are women out there with breast cancer. I vow not to bring it up again. ",

      "Content": " Hi Susie and ZenHen and anyone else who may be reading. ZenHen, I wish you improvement/remission/cure with whatever health issue that you're dealing with is close to being true. I'm sorry I'm not being more specific, but I don't know what forum you're on. Susie, I hope at least the triple digits heat has gone down to 2 digits! I cannot imagine heat like that. We've been having severe, long, and heavy rain, with lots of lightning, too. The plants definitely needed the water, but for people who need or want to go outside, I think it would be dreadful.\nWell..,,,that's all the small talk I can manage. I didn't look at the last few posts I've written so I'm not sure what all I've shared. I \"think\" I reported that my infectious disease doctor said the staph was gone and I had healed from the surgery very well. That was good news. It's still good news. But it only gave me fuel to heal my negativity and downward spiral for about\n 2 days. On that second day I went out with two girlfriends for lunch at a major spa nearby, and it was all lovely..we were able to eat outside under a tiki hut and there were fans and misters spraying us to stay cool enough to be outside. We'd been lucky that our outing occurred during a sunny, blue sky day, not the rainy days. There were pools and lush landscape all around. Really ideal. I \"got dolled up\" for the first time in forever- wig, make-up, a new top I had bought just before the July 17 surgery that was supposed to basically make me whole , really cute top, jewelry, great purse, great shoes, everything. I was so elated about\n getting out of the house. I'd been just about\n quarantined for so long except for doctors' appointments, and I never bothered \"getting dressed\" beyond frumpy 'for the house only' clothes -even to the doctors' appointments! \nEverything did not go totally without a hitch. Other than a turtleneck I don't think there is ANY neckline that can hide the sunken hole in my left side without a lot of effort. My top was not low cut, but I still had to make it come up higher by pinning it in the back at the neckline so that it would raise the front. Also, although the great jewelry I chose were perfect for that top, the 2 necklaces I wore had to serve a purpose. One of them ended just past where the neckline began, effectually holding the top down so there couldn't be an unintended view of what was underneath. And a much longer necklace served to kind of weigh the whole top down--the top was of extremely thin material and the slightest wind or passing of the fan near us could cause it to billow out. I have several of those huge post-mastectomy bras that are supposed to cover everything (and they normally do), but in my case the the large cave that was dug out of me due to the staph infection could not be completely covered by any bra. I stuffed that side with the prosthesis I had from when the tissue expander in my right breast collapsed. It wasn't big enough since the cavity goes deeper than just having a breast collapse. So I filled it with whatever padding I could find, adjusted the neckline of my top, and had 2 necklaces to keep the top from moving at all.\nYet, despite these measures, just regular body movements to sit, stand, turn, eat, reach for my drink, all made a peek into the ugliness happen. Even with the bra that practically goes up to my throat and all the stuffing, even a peek revealed what couldn't be hidden: the top, middle edge of where the dug out area begins and continues into the cave. So all through what WAS a lovely few hours with friends, I had to continually check and adjust my top and jewelry to cover the ugly. \nMaybe it was that experience that caused me to wake up in the dark pit of despair and hopelessness that I increasingly feel daily. To go through as much effort as I did to look normal, to look like me, the pre-mastectomy me, and hide what was really there, and to have the efforts largely fail while just doing a regular activity--eating out in public, was like a knock-out punch. pt 1... i'll continue in a little bit..\n ",

      "Content": " Today I awoke feeling emotionally just about\n like the old me---fearless, and the most positive person in the world. Or more accurately, I feel the POSSIBILITY that I can be fearless and endlessly positive again. Which I truly thought was gone for good. \nThis is a breast cancer forum, and it's the result of the 7/17-8/1 surgeries to finally get my implants , and then to lose one breast, plus more of me--lots of muscle tissue, more skin than just the breast skin, and my sternum is now misshapen so, the bulk of everything I report on after doctors' appointments will all be a result of initially getting cancer.\nA cancer that \"should have\" had an easy, predictable fix-- mastectomy, chemo, radiation, reconstruction, and get back to my normal life. And while how I look, if and how I can be reconstructed is all stemming from the initial diagnosis....my \"normal life\" I presumed I'd returned to is not possible due to Voldemort. I know I am extremely fortunate to be about\n 90-95% healed from that disease. At my last neuro visit I asked how much more improvement I could expect. And he said since it's been a year and a half, this is almost definitely as well as I am going to recover. That would be happy enough news for most people. For me, what I'm left with after the disease I will not name, is the bottom inch of my feet have no feeling, and the palms of my hands. It feels like I'm wearing latex gloves all the time. Which makes any small manual labor extremely frustrating. I've vented about\n how many mistakes I make while typing as I can't feel the keys properly, and it's worse on my cell phone, since there is just a virtual keyboard. But thank God that someone invented voice texting. I drop lightweight things all the time, as I can't judge how much of a grip I have on things. With heavier things I've got my biceps or even thighs that do most of the judging about\n how I have to grip something. The things I've done for decades in my \"normal\" pre-cancer days included karate, kickboxing, dancing, tennis, racquetball, bowling---none of which I can do without balance. \nSo what may seem like \"vainful\" whining because I lost my left breast again (and more) due to the staph infection, it is not NOT from vanity, or the inconvenience of knowing more surgeries are to come, that I lament there will never be a \"back to my normal life\", which is truly what causes me to hide in a dark room for hours or even days. It is because of Voldemort. \nI did mention in an earlier post that I had planned on a new career. (I got disability due to my numbness and balance and chemo brain, which also persists). My new career was/is going to be as an artist. I have done quite a lot of oil paintings since January. It is not easy! I drop the brush SOOOOO many times it's unreal. Landing on my clothing, then bouncing and rolling around the wood floor. I've dropped wet paintings onto other wet paintings as I hopelessly try to catch it as it falls. I've not been able to tell how firmly I'm gripping the brush and make TONS of unintentional strokes. So I have a lot to re-do all the time. Usually trying to fix one mistake, causes a new mistake, and then again and again and again. It's quite an experience. I used to paint as a child but gave it up for the piano. As an adult, when the kids' schools found out I could draw (during my many years of volunteering), I would occasionally have to paint something for school decorations. That led to 3 commissions to paint for individual people. This all ended probably 11 years ago, when the youngest got to middle school. There weren't as many \"hands on\" volunteering that parents did. It was mainly chaperoning them on field trips (which can be a nightmare). Anyway I went from painting as a child to not painting at all, except for a half-dozen jobs during the boys' elementary years. They are now 23 and 24. When I knew I couldn't return to any of the physical activities that dominated my pre-cancer life, I went on Amazon and bought easels and paints and other supplies. At the time I bought them, I didn't know my hands weren't going to get their feeling back completely, or I might not have. But I'm very glad I did. Even though the process I go through due to unfeeling hands is very frustrating, I am enjoying it immensely , and have surprised myself at how good I am! If I had money I would get a store front and sell and paint from there. Friends have told me to sell through Etsy. A friend began the set-up process on Etsy by securing a name for my art store. It's a horrible name that I've picked, but I don't care. It's not officially \nopen until I put something in there for sale, but the name is \"isurvivedGBS\". Doesn't sound like it has anything to do with art, and most people have never heard of GBS and would not venture to even look. But I don't care. The name really summarizes the WHY I am painting at all. I survived GBS with only one part of \"me\" still able to function, the artist. I don't know when the \"store\" will \nopen. Obviously I've had a lot of setbacks, and I still face many days where I don't want to do anything at all but absorb myself in my pity party. I don't particularly care if they sell! Although obviously I need money, I am painting for ME. And I would like other people to see my work, even if they don't buy it. I'm going to keep painting no matter what. \nOkay! Long enough for today! Best of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " I guess I\u2019m glad i\u2019m not the only one. But I am sorry it happens to you as well. A couple times when I think I\u2019ve lost a post, after hitting some random key, I\u2019m able to find my post-in-progress by scrolling up, but this time it didn\u2019t work . It\u2019s almost midnight here, so I\u2019m not up for trying to rewrite all my paragraphs. I just thought I\u2019d check in for a moment. \n I have to say that I am getting more bothered by this pulled muscle or whatever it is that is over my right breast. It seems like I had just a brief moment in the year and a half since I had my mastectomy, where my reconstructed breast looked normal under normal clothing. How long did it last? Maybe only a couple of weeks, I\u2019m not sure, before this muscle jumped out and looks really odd. I see it and it reminds me of cancer, it reminds me of reconstruction. During that lovely short time where they were normal, I felt like a completely normal, cancer free person.\n I remember when I first got diagnosed with cancer back in August 2016, and I\u2019d never never known anyone who had had cancer before. By talking to coworkers that I was friendly with, I found a girl, woman, who had just been through a double mastectomy and reconstruction, that I was going to go through, along with the chemo and radiation. And she was telling me about\n the reconstruction that was still yet to come, and her mastectomy had been two years before. I couldn\u2019t believe how long this cancer process drags out. Two years will be here before you know it, and I won\u2019t be done either, because after this surgery in July, I have to heal for I don\u2019t know how long, before my plastic surgeon will attempt to either reconstruct nipples or do tattoo nipples, that apparently look 3-D.\n Surgery, of course brings up my fear that that could trigger the disease I will not name, to come back. So I have this unpleasant part of my brain that is always reminding me that there something really bad that could happen, my getting that disease back.\n My long post that was lost was about\n a couple incidents that happened that had me spiraling into a PTSD meltdown,. It\u2019s cathartic to write about\n it, so I will do so at a later time. But it\u2019s midnight here now, and I have an early doctor\u2019s appointment with my counselor in the morning. \n Best of health and positive thoughts to all.\n ",

      "Content": " Susie, I would want to be just like your friend in her 70s-- no matter what cancer may keep coming back, I would continue to fight it and go on with life, in the best possible way I could.\nYes, the muscle that popped out over the expander is supposed to be put where its supposed to be when I get my expanders exchanged for the implants. However, I rightly do not trust anything to go as planned! lol...I'm trying to be \"flexible\" in my expectations. But for now, I went to the \"cancer lady store\" and bought a bathing suit that comes up so high on my chest it covers the weirdo-looking muscle, even though my surgery will probably be in a little over 2 months. It's Florida in the 90s and I don't want to have to never wear a bathing suit for even 2 months. When I was shopping for the suit, I found out from the sales lady that my insurance covers 4 bras a year!!! I didn't know that or I'd have been buying bras in 2016 and 2017. I didn't get one yesterday while swimsuit shopping, as my husband was with me and he had already been waiting patiently for 2 hours while I tried on many, many suits. \nWriting here on this forum has been great for ME. Occasionally I have worried that I have wondered off-topic too much, too often, which is why I had wanted to stop writing about\n the disease I shall not name. But Susie, you made a good point. If someone is reading this to see what it's like to deal with breast cancer, everything else doesn't stop in life just because you get cancer. Other problems can and will occur. So along with cancer, I am also dealing with this other disease, which may be happening to other women as well. Then I didn't want to write anymore about\n my PTSD that I got while being treated (atrociously) for that other disease, because that seemed to be definitely off-topic. Then I realized that I am able to get counseling for my PTSD simply because I have cancer. I guess the cancer center has had enough people get PTSD from dealing with their cancer, so they offer free counselling for it. My PTSD is, of course, related to how hideously the hospital treated me for the other disease, but PTSD is PTSD and there could be women out there reading who did get PTSD from their cancer, so I have my \"excuse\" to babble on about\n it.\nSo after I read your post responding to my telling of the 12 days of horror I went through, you made it abundantly clear that mine was not a rare case, that patients are frequently neglected, insulted, misdiagnosed, etc. I had NEVER expected that. To me hospitals were places you go to get healed from injuries (or disease) and then back to your normal life. So even though I had PTSD and went through many dark minutes and sometimes hours when something would trigger it, your post about\n how common hospital mistreatment is, DEVASTATED me. I instantly fell into my black whole and stayed there for 3 days. I remember closing up the laptop, and everything was black... as I walked straight into my son's room which was just a few feet away. I remember giving it a second of thought as to go into that room because it has blackout drapes and all I saw was black anyway and my surroundings had to match....I had to go into a place I was already in... blackness. I curled up on the bed (early afternoon) and stayed there for 3 days. I didn't leave at all the first day (I have a strong bladder), and on days 2 and 3 I just left to go to the bathroom which is just a couple feet away from the bedroom. My husband kept checking on me, offering water and food and encouraging me to leave the room, but I basically don't remember any of his words and I basically just mumbled No to whatever he said. From those 3 days I only remember the feelings I experienced-- fear, dread, depression, disgust, and that of being alone in blackness, abandoned and left to suffer. In other words, the same way I felt during my 12 days of horror. \n I sound pathetic. That I couldn't help myself. That I couldn't accept my husband's offers of help. But I couldn't, I was paralyzed on that bed. \nThat 3 day anxiety attack was the longest, but the shorter ones continue still. A few days after I left the room I had a fun day planned with my best friend of 40 years. We drove to a downtown walkable area that features lots of arts shops, and jewelry and clothing stores, great restaurants, and scenery you can't beat. It's a place you go to planning on spending several hours. I got a great parking spot right in front of a park area that was set up with local artists displaying their work in the park. The artist directly in across from the sidewalk in front of my car had great work that stopped us in our tracks to admire. We also were having great and lively conversation with the artist, had a passerby take a picture of us with the artist (we talked to her so long we felt like friends).. so there was lots of laughing and great fun right from the start. I was holding onto my friends arm for support, as the ground was not level and I still lose my balance easily. Then my friend dropped to the ground. People gathered to help, but she was unconscious for several minutes. A couple men helped put her on a bench. Folks brought water in case she was dehydrated and food in case it was low blood sugar, but she could neither eat or drink. It took over an hour before she slowly became herself again... recognizing me, able to speak (slowly and slurry) and able to move her arms and legs. After a few attempt at standing, we got her up and into my car (which thankfully was right there!) and I drove her to an ER that was just a block or so away. Okay, here's where my PTSD kicked in again. She is my best friend so obviously I was not going to leave her side. They were able to get her into a private ER room right away, and as we walked to it we passed a room with a man in it that sent chills down me, and my heart racing..... He definitely looked like a \"2 max\". He was very old, and his body was contorted into an unnatural position and his mouth was \nopen wide as if he were screaming, but no noise was coming out. His contorted body did not move at all. The lasting image of him came with me into my friend's room. The ER took about\n six hours of getting different tests done. The nurses there were great, but I was frozen in fear. I forced myself not to show any of the reactions I was going through inside, for my friend's sake. The only way I could deal was to have total tunnel vision, where I blurred out everything but her face. I sat fairly close to her bed, but it was still painful eyestrain to MAKE everything but her face into a blur. I left the room once to go to the cafeteria to get her some lunch, and so I had to pay attention to the directions..... go down this hall, through those doors, turn right....... and everything I saw was like i was being pushed into a dreadful space (head space)... The hospital colored walls, the types of very wide double doors , the marble floors, the posters on the walls... it was like I was being attacked. My heart races and my throat and chest get extremely tight. But the majority of the six hours was spent with just the tunnel vision of my friend's face and everything else was a blur, which gave me pretty severe eyestrain and a pounding headache. They finally decided to admit her, where she stayed for 2 days, had a million tests and no explanation for why she had collapsed into unconsciousness. It was difficult to drive home. The next day I continued to have tunnel vision for several hours, and i just felt.... BAD.... off..... like my world was tilted.... I know I'm not making sense, but I don't know how else to describe it. I have had tinnitus (ringing in the ears) for many years, but the whole next day or longer it was amplified tenfold. \n Pt one.... pt 2, which will be much shorter, coming up soon.\n ",

I know it's been coming in very slowly for about\n a year now, but it's really been until the last month where it is long enough (about\n 4 inches), where I can style it and it looks cute. It's still not the long hair I miss so much and want to get back so desperately, but I can look in the mirror and admit \"this is a cute hairstyle\". \nI see the cardiologist today because.... I can't remember..... before you start chemo you always get your heart checked since chemo can damage your heart. I remember there being \"something\" he wanted to keep an eye on\", I believe an aortic aneurysm-- which to me sounded like imminent death-- but he said was something I could have had for years and years and I will just go to him once a year to make sure it hasn't moved or grown. Plus I have a murmur.... I don't even know what that means, but no one has thought it was anything to give a second though to.\nMy recovery from Voldemort is still about\n the same, maybe 90% healed. Which I am extremely happy about\n given what I've learned about\n other folks' outcomes, I still feel that if this last 10% doesn't come back I will never be ME again. Having paralyzed bottoms of my feet, and numb palms seriously effects everything I do in life. I am a GREAT WALKER!! I can walk quickly through my neighborhood as long as I can see the surface is flat, and I can walk up to an hour and a half. Doing this daily has helped me lose 17 pounds that I had gained once I got cancer, then Voldemort....However, after that hour and a half I kind of pay for it. For the rest of the day I'll have recurring, unpleasant electric shock throughout my legs, as well as numb patches of skin on my legs, and the worst thing is I end up wobbly the rest of the day. \nI feel anxious if I think too much about\n my upcoming surgery. And I USED to feel no anxiety about\n surgeries. Surgeries are a good thing! They make you better, take care of your problem. But knowing a surgery could actually invite Voldemort back into my life sets me off into a spiral of all that could go wrong and hearing people say \"I'm not willing to help\".... So, not thinking about\n it!\nHope everyone is doing well. Best of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Content": " Susie, if we lived near each other, I'm sure we'd be friends in real life. Two times in the past ten years it has worked out where I got to meet an online buddy, and both times we clicked. \nI think it's wonderful how you get to take care of your grandson. It is my DREAM to one day live near my son and his family (when he eventually has one!) and help however much they'll allow me! \nYou are right that it makes ALL the difference to take the anxiety medication as soon as I feel my panic begin. I do have a counselor just for my hospital anxieties, but I haven't been able to see him as often\nas I need to. Just last week I had to cancel the appointment that I had scheduled. I need to reschedule but in the next few weeks leading up to my surgery I have SO many things scheduled already that I am just trying to have a few FREE days. That's my excuse......I need to get past that and make the dang appointment. I have to say that the appointments with him unnerve me a bit, and I don't know why. It's nothing about\n him personally....he doesn't smell, lol, or interrupt me, or come on to me. I think it's just talking so pointedly and SOLELY on that problem that keeps me from making my next appointment. With my cancer counselor, we don't soley talk about\n cancer.... the majority of our time has been (very helpfully) spent discussing my emotions regarding both of my sons and my marriage. But I KNOW that she would be telling me to RESCHEDULE THAT MISSED APPOINTMENT. So it's past business hours here and that call will have to wait until tomorrow.\nOur weather here has been miserable as well. We've been getting our fair share of rain, so I wish I could send some your way. When it's not raining it is so humid when you \nopen the door it's like walking out into a steam bath. I'm sure you know that feeling.\nI saw my neuro about\n Voldemort yesterday. I asked that since it's been over a year (14 months since I became paralyzed), that if this amount of improvement is as good as I'll get. He said 'almost certainly, yes'. There can be an odd case here or there when a person continues to improve after this amount of time, and I will hope and pray that I'll be one of them. Really I am so grateful to have improved the amount I have, and as quickly as I did. However, as I've moaned about\n on this site, the 10-15% of me that hasn't improved---bottoms of my feet and palms of my hands, have been the most important parts of me for doing every activity that filled my pre-cancer/pre-Voldemort life. So I am returning to an activity I used to do as a child-- paint. Even though my hands feel like they're wearing latex gloves, making it extremely difficult to hold a brush, lol, I have enjoyed it immensely. I drop brushes many times during my painting sessions, but I keep going. I work with oil paints, which take an enormous amount of time to dry. I have dropped one wet painting and have it land and bounce off 2 other wet paintings as I clumsily try to catch it with my numb hands. But I've had people want to buy them and commission me to do specific ones for them, so I guess my inadequacies have not diminished my work too much.\nBack to an actual cancer subject! Has anyone ever heard of either the mastectomy or the chemo or the radiation causing the underarm sweat glands to stop working? I don't think mine sweat anymore!! The rest of my body makes up for it, lol, but it does seem odd. Also, my armpit hair has not returned. The hair on my legs and bikini area came back right away, probably a year ago. Anyway, I thought these 2 things were interesting. \nBest of health and positive thoughts to all. ",

      "Sample": "The first time I saw my chest post surgery, I was horrified. It wasn't at all because I was flat chested after being a full-C my whole life, and it wasn't because I had scars across my chest that were at the moment bright red....The reason given was that the hospital had just \nopened a new surgery tower, which I had seen was under construction for quite some time, and they just didn't have it quite ready yet to handle all the scheduled operations due to construction delays with Hurricane Irma. So, I pigged out on brownies and other goodies that were here with 2 girlfriends who were at the house when the postponement call came in, and now I wait 2 days....Then I would start the radiation much later that originally planned, meaning the third surgery (to switch out the expanders for implants), will be pushed further away. In order to know for sure she has to be able to fill up my right side, and then see if it holds..... we couldn't do the fill today because of my stupid low WBC....I have my surgery date--July 18, to switch out the expanders for implants. I know that's a good thing, it's progress, it's moving forward in the list of things that i have had to do since I was fist diagnosed....Also, the dye that was injected to travel to my lymph nodes so the doctor could remove the sentinel node(s) and see if cancer was there, did not work (due to scar tissue from a previous surgery). Therefore he removed all 24 lymph nodes in my breast/armpit area, and tested them all....I ended up not needing any other fill ups, other than the one she did at the time of surgery. So, my next surgery is January 4th! Less than 2 weeks away, to take the expander out and put the implant in....For the rest of the day I'll have recurring, unpleasant electric shock throughout my legs, as well as numb patches of skin on my legs, and the worst thing is I end up wobbly the rest of the day. I feel anxious if I think too much about\n my upcoming surgery....So many different plans to choose from.... He'll be coming back in December, so we have to study all the material he left with us. It's Thursday night and my PS still doesn't have a surgery date for me....That's not fun as it is. I was bald, and my reconstruction of my right breast had gone badly--the tissue expander had failed, so my left breast was full-sized (with no nipple yet though) and the right side was hideous--not just flat because the expander leaked and was empty, I was covered with scars from the surgery....This surgery is much more involved that the one on Nov. 2, just to switch out the defective expander. Because of Voldemort they had to do my anesthesia differently somehow, and I do NOT like, in fact I'd say I HATE, that I have no memory of anything after I was dismissed for SEVEN TO EIGHT DAYS!!!! How much worse will it be since my surgery this time is more involved and longer??? \n My head knows that surgery is a good thing, a positive thing.....but my emotions --- my PTSD-- is controlling my emotions, and I am in panic mode.... since this surgery is longer, it will give Voldemort more of an opportunity to paralyze me again...and then I'm in that black hole I can't think about\n......that's why i haven't written, because I try very hard not to think about\n the upcoming surgery......It can't be something that she's happy about\n.....to have to re-do a surgery because of a product failure. Maybe she called the insurance company for pre-authorization and they said \"the patient already had surgery for tissue expanders, we're not covering it again\".......Honestly, if that is the issue, I may lose my mind and not recover it....His call came in the morning before I knew the date had been changed. The reason given was that the hospital had just \nopened a new surgery tower, which I had seen was under construction for quite some time, and they just didn't have it quite ready yet to handle all the scheduled operations due to construction delays with Hurricane Irma....I have avoided doing so many things because I didn't want to take a chance of getting sick or injured before this surgery, therefore delaying it. I wouldn't didn't fly up DC to see my son, as I was avoiding crowds....It's been about\n 2 1/2 weeks since the surgery to exchange the failed tissue expander. i ended up having to stay in the hospital overnight, strictly because of GBS....I made a note to call for an appointment but then decided not to. If I were to find out I had more cancer, I know Id need to begin treatment right away and that would delay my reconstruction surgery!...I was bald, and my reconstruction of my right breast had gone badly--the tissue expander had failed, so my left breast was full-sized (with no nipple yet though) and the right side was hideous--not just flat because the expander leaked and was empty, I was covered with scars from the surgery. It was all bumpy and caved in at the same time....Woohoo! I COULD be going to PT/OT, for my Guillain Barre, but I've decided just to concentrate on treating my cancer until after I've healed from the upcoming reconstruction surgery, which is still weeks away, as I have to heal from my radiation before my PS will see me....When I had a bone density scan before surgery, she said I have the bones of a 25 year old. The third thing was I didn't want to end up with missing teeth or dentures when I was old, so even though I never went to my PC doctor for an annual pap smear or breast exam (STUPID!!!!!!!).......Well, I'm definitely having at least one more surgery for my reconstruction. And since folks with GBS can never get a flu shot again, or any vaccine, or even a tetanus shot, chances are that some time in the decades before I die I will get an upper respiratory infection, and certainly injuries because I plan on being as active as I can be, and sometimes, accidents happen during adventurous activities....They say the \"margins are clean\", which is great news. Also, the dye that was injected to travel to my lymph nodes so the doctor could remove the sentinel node(s) and see if cancer was there, did not work (due to scar tissue from a previous surgery)....Now I'm pretty much back to as normal as I was before the surgery, so there's no physical reason not to be attempting to do them. It's emotional, because I haven't been sleeping....I COULD be going to PT/OT, for my Guillain Barre, but I've decided just to concentrate on treating my cancer until after I've healed from the upcoming reconstruction surgery, which is still weeks away, as I have to heal from my radiation before my PS will see me. My breast and underarm are bright red and peeling a little bit every day, but no more bleeding....Another surgery. I have avoided doing so many things because I didn't want to take a chance of getting sick or injured before this surgery, therefore delaying it....It looks like a regular reconstruction from a mastectomy-- something I was SURE was not possible. I ended up not needing any other fill ups, other than the one she did at the time of surgery....I'm starting to feel like I've been \"dumped\" by my doctor. It can't be something that she's happy about\n.....to have to re-do a surgery because of a product failure....When I first had surgery the doctor's office gave me info about\n something called \"Look Good Feel Good\", where you sign up to go to a seminar and get free makeup and demonstrations about\n how to do your brows and lashes, etc. I never signed up because I really was doing okay with my looks until the lashes and brows went....Two years will be here before you know it, and I wont be done either, because after this surgery in July, I have to heal for I dont know how long, before my plastic surgeon will attempt to either reconstruct nipples or do tattoo nipples, that apparently look 3-D. Surgery, of course brings up my fear that that could trigger the disease I will not name, to come back....",
