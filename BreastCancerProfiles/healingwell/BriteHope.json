Did chemo for 3 months (AC) had tumor marker test Aug 30th, ca2729 was at 56. Had a pet scan on Sept 1st, cat scan on the 2nd, and they think the cancer has gone into the nodes between my lungs. Going for a second opinion next week. ca2729 was at 68 on Sept 6th. If anyone has a similar story, let me know. ",
