      "Content": " Well, i am sitting here having myself a good pity party and clicked on here. I am watching the Oprah show about\n Breast Cancer. It is supposed to help and it has in some ways but in others it has made me more scared. I go Friday for a biopsy and they will be draining a big cyst. They tell to try not to worry but everything I here has me worried. Four people on my mom's side have had cancer (three breast cancer). Two of them have died years ago. A lady on the show said she just had a feeling that she had Cancer. That is the way I feel. I keep telling everyone it will be fine and I can handle it or it won't be cancer but I don't really feel that way. this is just a bad day. I woke up with a migraine (I have them quite often.) I am aggravated because it has put me in bed all day. \nI am often up at night too. I have four kids, and two grandchildren. During the day I stay so busy with my boys I don't usually have time to worry. I work in kindergarden, go to school, and have two teenage boys (one in band, and one in football). Thank God for my husband. I have been with him 20 years, even though I am only 39. I had my first two kids the easy way: I married my husband. The best way to have kids, you don't have to gain weight. My middle son has a pacemaker since he was three. He is 15 now and does anything he wants. He is often an inspiration.Anyway I get off track sometimes.\n You people here have been an inspiration to know life goes on. I was wondering what people do on nights and days like this. It is hard not being the strong one, we think we are suppose to be. My husband is doing lots of things for me. Like I am made of glass. I caught him crying the other day. He said he wasn't going to live without me. I laughed and told him I would be fine. We have a running joke that when I die I would cut off my breast and butt because that is where his hands stay. I told him I was just doing it early. I also said I wouldn't mind new ones. \nMy biggest fear is if it is in the lymph nodes. With the conomy the way it is how can we afford for me to be sick. \nYou feel quilty for all that your son has to deal with but you shouldn't (even though as a mother you can not help it.) My son Jeremy has had a pretty normal life but with a pacemaker he has to deal with being different. I have tried hard not to treat him different so he is pretty normal. In middle school was the first time he really realized that there are things he cannot do. He wanted to go into the Navy because his uncle joined. When I told him he couldn't he wanted to know why. When I told him because he has a pacemaker he said but you have alwasy told me I could do anything I wanted to do. He was very mad for a while and I had to get his counselor at school to talk to him. He has since found out he is very good at music, this has made life better for him. He has asked if I thought he would be good at football ( all the boys in our family have played football). His younger brother Joseph spoke up and told him that music was his thing and football was his. He was happy with that. I am blessed with very good kids, everyone says so. I wonder sometimes though. \nAnyway i told you about\n my son to try to show you that because your son has learned to help you and he sees you going through what you do and I am sure you show him sooooo much love, he will be a better person because of it. As long as they are showed love and that they are worth being loved they will do great things. \nThanks for your posting, it helped put me in a better frame of mind.\nEllen\n ",

The big cyst that is 2 inches will have to be drained but he is not worried about\n that one. Found out I have dense breast. Which I have found raises the risk of cancer. So now I hurry up and wait again. I told my husband that instead of waiting until I died to cut off my breast and giving them to him, well I may just do it earlier. I would not mind new ones though. All this waiting is killing me. I wish they would just get it over with. The cluster is near a lymph node so pray if it is cancer that it is jusr near one not part of one. \n \n ",

      "Content": "  I went to get a sonogram Friday because I felt a new lump. I have had them before but my doctor thought I now had 2 in my left breast and 1 in the other. The nurse found three lumps, one under my arm, and one at the bottom of my breast. Both of these are only the size of a nickel at the most. The other one is under the breast muscle and cover most of my breast. She messured it at 2 inches by 1 inch. I have lost an aunt, and my grandmother to breast cancer. My other aunt this summer had a double masectomy for breast cancer. She is doing great and her out look looks great. The nurse asked me during the sonogram if I had breast implants and I don't. She told me to try not to worry this weekend. I have been trying to see if other people have had lumps that big and them not be cancerous but I cannot find anyone with a lump that big. Does anyone know of anyone else like this. I am not worried too much about\n having breast cancer, I would just like to be prepared. I am 39 years old with four children and two grabdchildren. I am in school to become a teacher, and already work in a school with children. If I have to be out of work I would like to be prepared and prepare my family. Anyway I wouldn't mind having perky new breast after all this time. \n ",
