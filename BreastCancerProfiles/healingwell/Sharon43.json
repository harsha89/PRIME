    "Content": " Hi, I'm new here! \nI had a mammogram on Thursday and they have found a cluster of micro calcifications. I'm now waiting for an appt. for a biopsy. I can't help but worry. In the last month I've been poorly twice, I had shingles then about\n a week later I ended up in hospital with a urine/kidney infection. Plus I get tired very easily and suffer from headaches a lot. Could this all be linked to me possibly having breast cancer? I'm thinking is that why my immune system is low? Plus about\n 10yrs ago I had a hysterectomy because I had severe abnormal smears which turned out to be precancerous cells. My minds working overtime as you can probably tell. How worried should I be? ",
