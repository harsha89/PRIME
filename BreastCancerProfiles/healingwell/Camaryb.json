    "Content": " I was Dx in 2011 and also had a double mast and lyph node removal. I had reconstructive difficutlies as well so I fully understand that :(. \nWere the spots on your lung there Jan/Feb? Did they tell you? I think that would be my first question. If so, what size were they then and have they grown larger? Have they suggested a biopsy? Until it's tested, it's hard to tell the \"source\". It could very possibly be a totally different cancer, not related. Sounds like you need to have a serious conversation with your doctor/s. I realize this post is a bit late, but hoping all goes well for you. ",
