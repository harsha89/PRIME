      "Content": " Hi,\nThanks for replying. I really wasn't posting hoping that someone could give me odds on whether this is cancerous or not. My apologies if it came out that way. Im really just looking for others who are in this situation to shed light with their own experiences with finding a lump in their breast and the way they navigated through the system with medical procedures. Im looking for support and understanding, as well as the truth.\nThanks for the reply! ",
