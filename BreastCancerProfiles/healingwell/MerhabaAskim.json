    "Content": " On April 6, 2011, I had both breast removed and at the time of surgery, the surgeon put in two tissue expanders. Since then, I had several visits to his office where he injected saline into the expanders. Now that the expanders are full and can not hold anymore saline, it is time to go back into surgery to remove them and replace them with implants. Unfortunately, when this time came about\n and he said to me, \"that is the size breast you will get since I can not fill the expanders any more.\" When I looked at my chest, I did not see anything that looked like breasts, but what looked like two little rocks. It was like my brain went dead at that moment. It was not until I was driving home that it started hitting me and I broke down crying. I then felt like I lost half of who I am since I also had to remove my ovaries and uterus during the previous surgery. I went into serious depression and cried for 3 days straight. Every time I looked in the mirror, I cried, every time I showered and washed my chest, I cried, every time my clothes kept falling off my chest, I cried. When I returned to the surgeon, he then gave me three options, which are really not options and now everything is sitting on my shoulders. I am so lost in making a decision. \nThe first option is to leave it at the size it is right now, which as I mentioned before looks like two little rocks. I can't see myself going through the rest of my life with no breasts as I am still young and I am use to having big ones. \nThe second option is the Tram Flap, which he would remove the fat and muscle from the lower abdomen and put it into the breast and still use the implants to make them big. However, there will be a chance of me getting hernia after and have to go back to have him fix that and have a scar from one hip to the other. I have also read in my research online that sometimes this procedure causes your navel to shift to the side instead of staying in the middle.\nThe third option is removing the tissue from my back. I definitely do not want that and be left with a big scar on my back and if it becomes infected or have any other problem with it, I would not be able reach my back to take care of it and would have to always keep running back and forth to the doctor. \nI would really like to hear from others who have had the TRAM FLAP, where the muscle was removed and share their experience with me and also let me know what difficulties they have had after some years have passed. I know that removing that muscle will make it a bit difficult to sit up from a lying position, but I always wonder what happens when I get older and not as strong as I am now, will it be much more difficult for me to sit and stand when I become an elderly person? I would also like to know if the breasts will droop, changes shape or get smaller after some years have passed.\nI am trying to see other surgeons and maybe get a second or third opinion, but while waiting, I am hoping someone would be able to help here. Thanks in advance for your caring and kindness.\nBe Blessed ",
