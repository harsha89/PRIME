      "Content": " I had a bilateral mascectomy and 8 months later decided to have reconstruction.  I had not received any radiation treatments.  When I had the expanders placed it was the worst pain I could imagine.  The surgeon had already expanded them by 200 cc each.   I thought the previous surgery was a breeze compared to this.  I suffered through this and then went to my first \"fill\", another 100 cc each side.  By the time I left the surgeon's office I could hardly breathe much less move.  It took a week to feel marginally better.  Two weeks later another expansion.  Same thing.  I got so I dreaded each expansion.  My chest felt like a rock.  After 3 expansions and constant pain the surgeon finally let me move to 3 weeks and only 50 cc.   By the time he finished the expansion 800 cc I could not find an easy way to lay down, sit or do anything.  I could feel the expanders (which were hard) push against my chest wall.  Finally just before Xmas I had the expanders removed and the implants placed.   This was a little easier but still in a lot of pain.  One week after surgery the Dr checked me out and saw that the right side was sitting rather high and hard.  He decided to wait 3 weeks and see if it dropped.  Now this is the side where I had developed an infection 3 weeks after my mascetomy and had to have more surgery to cut out the infection and leave \nopen to heal from the inside out.\n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Well Monday, I go for my bi-lateral Mascetomy.  Hoping I don't have to stay in the hospital too long.  After all the tests, biopsies I am relieved that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  It was almost a no brainer.  After all these years of burying my head in the sand about\n breast cancer and thinking not me, I am now so shocked at how many women and men who have or had this disease.  I can't believe it.  I was trying to keep it under wraps from my friends, neighbors, co-workers etc.  Now I want to shout it to the roof tops, GET THOSE MAMMOGRAMS!!!!.  Once I get through this I will make sure I do what ever I can to help anyone else who needs to know or needs support.  Again thanks for your support, this forum has been very helpful and supportive.  I hope to do the same in kind.  God Bless you all.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi again, well just got word that left breast is very suspcious pre-cancer, Dr suggest bilateral mastectomy.  So I am awaiting word from his office as to surgery date.  I feel better about\n everything today, don't think I want re-construction as it would be a lot more to put my body through.  Dr says they will be doing sentinal node on right breast but not on left.  Asked him why was the area in my right breast which never had a lump and now it feels like a large mass.  Was told that it probably was from the biopsy done last month.  Need to call him back forgot to ask about\n the throbing ache I get in that breast.  With all I have read, that the reconstruction is for looks only, no sensations in either breasts seems futile to do.  Since I am 59 and have a very supportive husband maybe I'll just deal with the scars.  Guess I won't have to worry about\n flashing anyone.  Have read I will go through a mourning process over the loss of my breasts.  I think I am strong enough mentally to deal with this.  Will keep you posted.  Again, thanks so much for your thoughts. \n ",
