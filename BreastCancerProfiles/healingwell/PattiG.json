      "Content": " I had a bilateral mascectomy and 8 months later decided to have reconstruction.  I had not received any radiation treatments.  When I had the expanders placed it was the worst pain I could imagine.  The surgeon had already expanded them by 200 cc each.   I thought the previous surgery was a breeze compared to this.  I suffered through this and then went to my first \"fill\", another 100 cc each side.  By the time I left the surgeon's office I could hardly breathe much less move.  It took a week to feel marginally better.  Two weeks later another expansion.  Same thing.  I got so I dreaded each expansion.  My chest felt like a rock.  After 3 expansions and constant pain the surgeon finally let me move to 3 weeks and only 50 cc.   By the time he finished the expansion 800 cc I could not find an easy way to lay down, sit or do anything.  I could feel the expanders (which were hard) push against my chest wall.  Finally just before Xmas I had the expanders removed and the implants placed.   This was a little easier but still in a lot of pain.  One week after surgery the Dr checked me out and saw that the right side was sitting rather high and hard.  He decided to wait 3 weeks and see if it dropped.  Now this is the side where I had developed an infection 3 weeks after my mascetomy and had to have more surgery to cut out the infection and leave \nopen to heal from the inside out.\n \n \n \n ",
