      "Content": " I haven't been diagnosed with FBD however all the women in my family have been, so I'm sure that's what it is...I have checked all the web pages and read all the information, I just wanted to talk to someone who had been diagnosed so I could get an idea of what I should expect from this...I guess my biggest question is if it would be worth the worry and money to have it diagnosed for sure. I hate to self-diagnose however in the past few years my breasts have grown so much I just can't imagine what else it could be. My mother said that she didn't get as big as she is now until recently...when she started taking horomone replacement, the estrogen made them go haywire...I'm kind of concerned because I am only 28 and I am already as big is she is now. I have a smaller build so if they grow much more I will definitely have to have a reduction. Especially if I have any more kids. I also worry because all of the pages I see are related to breast cancer, even though they say that FDB patients are not at a higher risk, I still worry. Am I being silly or a hypochondriac, am I imagining things or do you think I should go in. I don't want to go see my doctor and have him tell me I'm an idiot, but I hate to not go at the same time... Any advice you could share would be greatly appreciated...Thank you for all you have said so far... ",
