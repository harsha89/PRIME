    "Content": " Hi All,\nFor the past week I have been experiencing pain on the left side of my chest which seems to be coming from my breast. I should mention that I wear size 34DD, I don't know if my size has anything to do with it. The area right above my breast, below my collar bone seems slightly swollen compared to the right side. I slept on my left side tonight and woke up in the middle of the night with intense pain and almost a burning feeling in some parts of the breast. When I go to sit up my breast and the area above it is in so much pain. It's now 5:00 in the morning and I'm freaking out. I'm sure that the pain is coming from my breast but I'm also scared of it being heart related. I have an appointment with my gyno on Tuesday, hopefully that will give me some answers. I just don't know if I should go see my regular doctor tomorrow. I'm just so freaked out...can't even sleep right now. ",
