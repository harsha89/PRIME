      "Content": " I know what you mean. I got my mammo two weeks ago--been getting them every year since age 34, except I skipped last year, and am now 50 and got that dread letter to come back for more testing. I wouldn't worry except that my Mom and best friend both died in 2005 within 6 months of each other from breast cancer! I am trying not to worry until i have something to worry about\n but it is annoying that the letter says \"Call us right away\" but they can't see you for three weeks (LOL). I keep telling myself that even if there is something it is small--can't feel nothing--and the odds are in my favor etc. Sometimes I feel like this is my punishment for skipping a year (LOL LOL). I haven't told my lover yet because why worry him until there is something to worry about\n, right? Positive thinking, that is the cure. (Plus an occassional wine). ",

      "Content": " Hi!  I am 50, and have been having regular mammograms since age 34 or so.  Skipped last year (too busy--now I feel dumb) and last week had one--then got the dread letter that something looks funny and have to go back for diagnostic.  My mom and best friend both died in 2005 within 6 months of each other of BC so I am more nervous than I probably should be.  I do self-exams and can't feel anything (although since the letter my breast hurts--definitely psychological LOL).  Anyway the thing that really worries me is that first they said first appointment available in three weeks--then called the next day and said would I take an earlier appointment--so they gave me one in two weeks.  Do you think this was just because they had a cancellation, or did they look at picture and say \"Hell, better get this one in sooner!\"?  Am I just being paranoid?  Does anyone know how this kind of thing works?  I know the odds are in my favor, but I still have trouble sleeping at night.  Trying to stay positive!!  Any advice would be welcome.  Thanks!
