    "Content": " Hi , I am 37 and last week noticed a bruise on my left breast, I am a 42DD , and the bruise is about\n the size of a nice sized lime. Under the bruise is a hard lump about\n the size of a marble. Its hard and painful, I have a constant burning sensation in the breast. I went to the ER, by the DR just touching it, no mri or tests, he diagnosed me eith a breast mass, and told me to see a breast surgeon. I have no ins, and do not know what to do. Has anyone had this issue? It had been one week since symptoms appeared, the burning and sharp pains seem to get worse later in the day . ",
