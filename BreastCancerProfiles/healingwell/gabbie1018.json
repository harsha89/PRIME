    "Content": " Hi I am 36 years old. I went in for my yearly mammogram (family history of breast cancer). they ended up taking extra films... because of my age the tissue is very dense. As a precaution the DR decided to do an ultrasound of the area. She found nothing in the area of question but upon ultrasounding the rest of the breast she found what she thinks is  a complex cyst. She decided to do a needle aspiration and is sending it to the lab. I will get the results tomorrow afternoon. Does anyone know the incidence of this being cancer or the possiblity of a false-positive occuring. I am very very scared. If nothing conclusive comes back I will have to have a core biopsy. Thanks\n ",
