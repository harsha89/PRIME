      "Content": " Hi everyone!  I've been reading through posts, and it seems that you all have such a nice support group going here.  My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer this past Monday.  She's a mammographer too... what a strange coincidence.  She's taking it really well and has an incredibly positive attitude which I am so thankful for.  I feel bad because I was so scared when she first told me, and I feel like I might have made it worse for her.  She has been getting in touch with family friends that have gone through cancer before to get advice and talk to them about it.  I was hoping that you could all help her too.  Let me know if there is anything I could pass along to her that you could share from your experience.  Was there anything that you wish you had known at the beginning?  I would greatly appreciate your responses.  I am away at school but am going home for the weekend to be with her.  Thank you, Kate ",

      "Content": " Thank you all so much for the responses. I talked to my mom for quite a while today about what she is going through, what she expects to happen, and what she knows thus far. I believe what she has is called infiltrating lobular, and it is a little over one centimeter. She is meeting with her surgeon on Tuesday, and the next step is her MRI and then the actual surgery. She already owns Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book but went to Borders yesterday to pick up the latest copy. She showed me various things in it today while we were talking, and I'm really interested in reading more of it also. I will definitely let her know about this site and message board, I'm sure she would love to join it. Thanks again, Kate ",
