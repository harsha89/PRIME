      "Content": " Hi Alina, \n I hope that everything turns out good for you and there is good news on Thursday or Friday. If the news is not so good I know you will be okay. Just know that you are getting this taken care of. I have my annual mammogram on Wed and I am always anxiety ridden every year. I had a call back last year and they found a benign cyst after an u/s. Please let us know how you are. ",
