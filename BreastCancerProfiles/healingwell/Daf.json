    "Content": " Hi, i am new to this forum and i would like to have some suggestions. I am 30 year old and i have had breast lump all my life(from what i remember) i have had it in both sides but the one in left side disappeared before 6 or 7 years. the other one never disappeared and now its almost the size of a tennis ball. it is not paining most of the time but when it does its a sharp pain. It doesnt always pain around periods. It is of weird shape. I never visited doctor or told anyone because it was not paining a lot and i was a bit shy to see a doctor. now i dont want to leave it as it is i want to know what i should do. can someone help me? thanks.\n ",
