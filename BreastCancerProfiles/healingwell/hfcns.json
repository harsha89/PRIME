    "Content": " Just to let you know, I had the same response when I contacted a breast cancer organisation here in Australia. Very few people recognise the problem. I have been to Pain Management Clinics, Pain specialists, Physiotherapists, Occupational therapists, chinese herbalists, Lymphatic drainage Massage therapists and taken Neurontin, [gabapentin], Efexor, methadone, morphine and Lyrica. So much for \"informed consent\" ! Nobody even mentioned this as a possibility 2 years ago before my bilateral mastectomy and rt axillary clearance. Some warning please for others in the future.. It is difficult being told \"You shouldn't have pain!\" ",
