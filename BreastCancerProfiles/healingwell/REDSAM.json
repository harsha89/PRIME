      "Content": " Thank you Bev as always solid, empathetic and valuable advice and support!\nThey took three additional spot views and then did the ultrasound. The radiologist came and spoke with me on the results. He said the spot they were looking at was really really really tiny and just below the skin. It is not even something I could feel. Even a couple of the mammo shots had difficulty finding it. But the ultrasound tech found it without problems. In his opinion it appears to be benign and wants me to do the follow up in 6 months. I asked him if there was any concerns given my family history and he said the concerns are valid, but he did not believe this particular item warranted biopsy. The area in question may also be fatty tissue.\nI was satisfied with the results and I do intend on getting my written results.

      "Content": " Hi Bev and All.\nLast years mammo resulted in the need for additional spot views for some microcalcifications. Did the spot view and was given the wait and see on them that I could go back to yearly screenings. I was ok with that. Now this year something different. The dr's nurse called Thursday evening to say that I needed to go for an ultrasound, but not to freak out it is most likely something benign. So I scheduled with the breast care center for my US and they asked me for a diagnosis??? I felt stupid and could only say dense breasts. My gut feeling spoke very loud to me that night. No spot view, I had no clear understanding of what exactly they were wanting a second look at. I called the breast care center and ask for clarification. GOOD thing. The radiologist wanted a spot view AND an ultrasound. The report indicates a lymph node or module needs further evaluation. While it may be benign they need to make sure because I do have dense breasts. I told the lady that the nurse made no mention of the spot view so they were going to have to re-do the order. The lady made it a point to say the spot view was required and she would contact my dr office for the change. She called me back to make sure I knew to come early for the spot view and that they were able to fit it in before my US.\nWhile I have anxiety, I am not freaking out like last year. Is it bad that I told my hubby that I did not need him to take off for this. He did so last year as I was told the radiologist would speak with us afterward, and all that took place was the tech ran out of the room while I put my shirt on, came back and said I could go they would watch it and to schedule a 6 month f/u. Here is my thought, IF further evaluation is needed it will be a biopsy and of course he will need to be there. \nQuestion, IF a biopsy is needed I am NOT up for needle anything. With my mother passing away (at my age now) I don't want anything left in that \"could\" turn later. I have already had a lumpectomy through my general surgeon a few years ago (fatty necrosis tissue). IF this needs biopsy do I stick with my general surgeon at this point or should I consider an oncologist type of surgeon given my history? ",

      "Content": " I went through this very tough decision a few years ago. The surgeon basically put it to me this way..... Most of his patients that opt to wait versus just proceeding with the excisional biopsy, are back in his office within 30 days ready to go. Because they find themselves obsessing with checking the spot so often, they end up getting sore or bruised. I went with the excisional biopsy, which was his recommendation.\nThat way I could move forward, instead of worrying about\n what it was. I went in and was home in a few hours. Knock on wood, the diagnosis was B9.\nGood Luck.\nSue \n ",

Without laws in place to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage, I have to wait until that sticks. Especially after what I was exposed to last year when our company was interviewing health insurance companies. One of the companies would only provide coverage to us if they could choose who they cover. This is the honest truth. Maybe some day, but for now I can't risk loosing insurance coverage. That is the reality of where we are at this point.\nI did some reviewing of my last round of mammo results Birads 2, there are already some calcifications they are watching, and have been since 2004. Maybe the new calcifications appear different as I have not had to have a follow up mammo until now. I will have to wait for Wednesday......\nTime will tell.... Susie\nSue \n ",

      "Content": " Happy Thanksgiving all.  I am thankful for you, and all the help and support you have given me in this difficult time.  I had my appointment with my surgeon yesterday and all went well.  He proved to me once again what a wonderful doctor he is.  He has the BEST bedside manor of any doctor I have ever met.   I could hear him go over the reports and films from my mammograms and ultrasounds before he came in.  Then we discussed them, and he said that they were not conclusive, and actually they can miss 10% of cancererous things.  So we proceeded to discuss what was occuring, and my family history, then he went to the physical exam.  When he got to the left breast he was feeling around and then said is this the area?  I said \"No\"... He said are your sure?  I tilted my head up, and to my surprise it WAS the area!!!  I laughed and said \"OOOps, my bad, yes that's it\".  \n   I honestly thought he was palpating the lymph nodes, with floopy breasts as mine there would be slippage.  He lauged.  He then told me he would treat this one of two ways... 1. Wire guided needle aspiration, or 2. He could just remove it completely.  Then before I could even answer, he added, \"With your age, family history, and I can tell how anxious you are, I would prefer to just remove it completely.  \n I didn't even have to ask.  He just knew.  He said that often times women in my position, and even husbands, if he does option one, they are back within 2 months asking for it just to be removed... because as he put it \"She/I just keep poking and poking at it\".. ROF****!  I asked him if he had secretly been watching me over the last month... He lauged, and added, \"As you can tell, I've been doing this awhile\".  So he scheduled me immediately for TUESDAY NOV 27th.  I am relieved.  He said he feels it will be benign, but he is more comfortable with the surgical approach because if it is suspicous, he can do more while I am there, then having me come back.  You know I have to say, that even my gyne has proved again why I love her.  She is on vacation this week, but had her staff call me personally on Wednesday to find out what happend...  I am in good hands with both.  I am glad this is a busy long weekend as I won't have to think to much about\n it.  And obviously I will be busy Monday at work to account for the couple of days off I will have next week.  \n \nSue-Hypothyroid, Abdominal Adhesion Pain, No female parts, no gallbladder.

I was surprised and it was dark, it was just a little, and neither of us saw the contents.  She said sometimes that happens because they are squeezing the nipple area so tight.  Anywhoo, she then got a hold of the doctors office to ask for an order for an ultrasound, (since I was already there she said).  So I waited and waited, finally it came through, and off to ultrasound I went.  She squirted the goo, then scanned, and then asked me to find the area.  So I did, it is difficult to find when I lay flat because it sinks into the gobly gook inside my breast, and everything shifts.  She had the radiologist check her measurments and came back in 5 minutes and said I could go, they didn't see anything.  WHAT??????????????  So am I an idiot?  Am I imagining it?  I am so embarrased and confused.\n \n \n \nSue-Hypothyroid, Abdominal Adhesion Pain, No female parts, no gallbladder.

      "Content": " Hello everyone, I am hoping to get some advice so that I can make good decisions for myself.  I had good results earlier in the year in the heart forum, so I decided to give this a try.  I am 41 close to 42 years old.  My mother was diagnosed with a fast growing malignant breast cancer when she was 40.  By 45 she lost her battle with breast cancer.  Unfortunately when my sister went through a situation where she felt a lump, her surgeon asked her what type of tumor was it that started my mothers journey.  Of course timing is everything and my mothers medical records were destroyed a few months prior to my sisters journey.  And the surgeon was deceased.  So we know nothing. \n   My sister was 28 at that time.  The surgeon she went to, took a invasive conservative approach and removed the lump at biopsy, rather then just sample it and watch.  Turned out to be negative.  He wanted it removed, so that it would not turn into cancer later.  That was 11 years ago.  Here I am today facing something similar.  A lump appeared about\n a month ago followed by a bruise(for no reason), and I have been watching it since I just had my annual mammo in August with no abnormal findings .  Well it did not go away, so I went to my doctor this week.  She confimed yesterday that she feels a mass.  She said based on her experience it feels fibrocystic in nature.  BUT with my family history she wants it evaluated.  So she had the nurse schedule me right then and there for a diagnostic mammo (Monday 11/19), and an appointment with a surgeon (Tuesday 11/20) for second opionion and anything further.  \n \n \nSue-Hypothyroid, Abdominal Adhesion Pain, No female parts, no gallbladder.
