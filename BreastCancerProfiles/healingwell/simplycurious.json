      "Content": " Hi all, i've been reading everyones post and wanted to share my story and hopefully get some insite.  On this past Thursday, I was watching tv and turned slightly on my right side and my left arm lightly fell onto my left breast.  I felt a sharp pain, kinda soreness, that comes and goes still until today. So I checked my breast and to my surprise (not pleasant) felt a large hard lump that I had never experienced before.  Just so happened I had a follow up dr appt for an unrelated reason on Friday morning, she did a breast exam and said it may just be a cyst and asked when was my cycle going to start, well I don't have a cycle anymore due to a rollerball procedure I had in May of last year due to cysts.  \n \n ",
