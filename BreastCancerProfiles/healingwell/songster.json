Hey, about dust bunnies: If anyone but you ever notices (unlikely) show them where the broom is and invite them to help.\nI just finished my second chemo treatment and I really appreciate a real warrior like you. Keep up the good work.\nTracy ",

I hope you can all look at as a source of mutual support and not get too much into who's fighting it which way. I knew from the beginning I'd take whatever measures necessary...my breasts had done their work nursing my child so I wasn't exactly happy to have them removed, but I'm not ready for heaven yet, either. Sounds like chemo sucks, but whatever it takes, I'll do. You sound like you're the same way, and I hope these two women you love come around to that conclusion as well. In the meantime, take good care of yourself. Love, Tracy ",
