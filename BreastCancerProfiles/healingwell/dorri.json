They are also concerned about\n Lymph node involvement, but that isn't definite yet. \nMy mother in law is a very strong woman, which is an encouragement to me when I talk to her. I pray that God continues to grant her peace with a positive outlook.\nShe may have her surgery on Monday but the surgeon said there was only a slim chance of that. They would have to call her today to make arrangements, which they haven't done yet. They said if they don't call her today, she will then have to wait 2-3 weeks to have the surgery.\nThanks again for the response and your support.\n \n ",
