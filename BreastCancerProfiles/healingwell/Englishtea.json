      "Content": " I know the waiting is awful.....I don't have a lot of experience yet myself with any of this, but I also had a mammo, then a second mammo, then ultrasound and now I am finally going to get my biopsy tomorrow (waiting 10 days on pins and needles for this day to come).  I am 43 and have an 11 yr old and 9 yr old.  I am actually very anxious to get the procedure done and over....not scared of the procedure, just scared of the results.  All my report said is that I have a bigger density than last year and they want to see what it is...I'm glad they are being cautious and I want to know, too!  If I was you, I would definately request a biopsy or find a doctor that agrees with you....I don't want to wait for 6 mos.  80% of biopsies are benigh, but just not knowing is what is terrible.  I will find out my results in 2-3 days after tomorrow!  I feel something in there and it doesn't feel right, so I am thinking I have something and I want to know.  Good luck....I will check back for any comments as to what you decide.  Take care.....Isn't Bev great!!  She responded to my earlier post, too, and was the only one......!   It makes you feel like someone is listening and you are not alone.  Benign, benign, right!  ",
