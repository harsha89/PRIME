      "Content": " Hi Simone\nI am an occasional lurker - used to post on another board with some of the oldtimers here, who helped me out when I was going through a very similar time to you. I had no family history, but lots of fertility treatment and miscarriages...which my surgeon explained had probably added to the fibrocystic changes. I had lumpy areas in tne breast (nowadays in both) and was diagnosed with fibrocystic changes after a core biopsy. I still have mammos and u/s every year, and exams - it would be hard to biopsy every lumpy bit these days, but they all feel the same: sort of rubbery, ridgy, and lumpy as opposed to distinct lumps. When I doubt something I feel, I run back to my surgeon - just in case.\nI was told it was quite common for women to develop these changes in their forties (I was 40 when I first had them) as hormones fluctuate more, but mine were not cyclical and never left - in fact, they have increased. Not unusual, in midlife, apparently. \nMy big miracle..I had a daughter at 43, and after that the pains and lumpiness calmed down considerably for a couple of years: again, my surgeon had told me to expect that. Unfortunately, its temporary! Though they are likely to calm down again in menopause.\nAnyway..I do'nt usually chip in here, except to check on old friends, but could relate so much to your situation. I hope this helps even a little, and am glad you found the same amazing support from these women as I did five years ago.\nxxxClaire ps if you are not satisfied with a FNA, you could ask for a core biopsy? If you trust your surgeon, discuss it with him - he may have good reason not to need one, but I would want to know what those reasons were and be satisfied too! ",

      "Content": " Hi IVwife,\nI don't think its being a hypochondriac to have breast changes checked out - that doesn't mean you are at higher risk of breast cancer, it just means you are being sensible and attending to your body! You have every right to a doctor's support on that, too. My breasts went up a cup size after dd's birth...and they are easier to examine now, as they are 'emptier' (lol) and softer. \nIf I were you, I'd tell my doctor that as I'd had a lot of changes, I'd like a new 'baseline' for future reference - especially if your changes are making self-exam difficult. (I found SE hard - hence regular checkups, because I was so lumpy) That means an exam, and a mammo and/or ultrasound - if you have young, dense breasts mammos can be hard to read. \nI certainly wouldn't panic - I read your other post - but if it were me, I'd want to get checked out so I knew where I stood: peace of mind is so precious!\nWishing you luck and health, xxxClaire ",
