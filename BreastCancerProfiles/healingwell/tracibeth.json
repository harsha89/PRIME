      "Content": " Dear Bernadette,\nJust wanted to welcome you as well and to thank you for replying to my post from the other day. As you can see, you'll get a lot of great support here and really practical, good advice from women who've been thru it all and can relate their experiences to you. That has been so helpful to me, I know you will find it encouraging and supportive too. I was dx with invasive ductial carcinoma too, 6 years ago when I was 30 years old. My tumor was just over 4 cm and I had a lot of positive lymph nodes, so I guess a lumpectomy wasn't really an option for me. Incidentally, I did have a lumpectomy when I was 14 (yeah, 14, I know, long story) and in retrospect, I'm so happy I had such a compassionate and intelligent surgeon who had the insight to do a breast-sparing surgery on a 14 year old girl instead of the standard mastectomy of the time. My scar was so small even though my tumor at the time was huge (about\n the size of a lemon). It saved my from a lot of emotional trauma, I'm certain. \nBut I did end up having to have a mastectomy at age 30, and oh how I wish I had caught my cancer earlier and could have kept my breast. Once its gone, its gone, and even though I had reconstruction, it just wasn't the same. I didn't have good success with my implant and had to have it removed. I wear a prosthesis now, and I'm always so self-conscious of it. Always tugging at my bra straps and adjusting myself to make sure I'm not slipping out of place. \nI know you'll make the right decision...the one that's right for you, but I just wanted to share with you my experience. Losing your hair is hard, there's no disputing it, but it will grow back. If it appears you might have to have chemo, remember its temporary. You're breast won't grow back, so just make sure whatever you decide, you're confident in that decision and its something you can live with. \nMy thoughts are with you. Please post again to let us know how you're doing and what you and your doctors have decided for your treatment.\nsending best wishes to you,\nTracy ",
