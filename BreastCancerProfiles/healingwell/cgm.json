So the doctor said since I was only 33 at the time the tamoxifen would not do me any good because you only take it for 5 years and I still wouldn't been readly for menpause. So I had my ovaries removed I have 3 wonderful child and can not ask for a more wonderful husband that supports my decisions 100 percent. I thought that this would be a reliable solution. But my cancer returned in January and The found bc cell in my liver. So now I am doing chemo treatment every 3 weeks. I did 4 rounds of taxatere, carboplatin and herceptin, now I am doing 2 treatments of carboplatin and herceptin then a ct scan to see if it is in remission. But I will continue with the herceptin. Whatever decision you make it is your decision every treatment is can have a different response to each person. My prays are with you\nMany Hugs Christine\n ",

I have had 4 chemo treatments and am doing well my tumor marker has really went down it is almost at a normal range. Have had some problems with acid reflux and my port but getting all that under control one day at a time.\nThe reason I am writing is to find others that have had the bc spread to the liver. When I was dx with this in January it was harder to except then it was the first time because I didn't expect it come back at all. And I still don't know how many tx I will get with this round of chemo. I am hoping just one or two more. And once tx is done and the tumor is gone then what is the doctor going to do to keep it from coming back. Anyone that has been through this please write back......\nMany Hugs Christine\n ",
