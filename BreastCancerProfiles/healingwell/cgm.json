      "Content": " dear dak\nI am 34 years old in 2003 I was dx with bc and was pregnant with my third child. Had chemo and radiation and everything was going great at least that is was I thought. In January of this year I found out through a blood test that my cancer had metased to my liver. I started tx I received carboplatin and taxotere and Herceptin. I just recieved my last chemo about\n 6 weeks ago my tumor marker is at 38 it was 7464 so I am doing well. I still receive the herceptin every 3 weeks for a couple more months but that is the easy part. Keep up the good spirts and pray. And God will take care of us all......\nMany Hugs Christine\n ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone my name is Christine and I am 34 with my second round of breast cancer but now it is in the liver. I have had 4 chemo treatments and am doing well my tumor marker has really went down it is almost at a normal range. Have had some problems with acid reflux and my port but getting all that under control one day at a time.\nThe reason I am writing is to find others that have had the bc spread to the liver. When I was dx with this in January it was harder to except then it was the first time because I didn't expect it come back at all. And I still don't know how many tx I will get with this round of chemo. I am hoping just one or two more. And once tx is done and the tumor is gone then what is the doctor going to do to keep it from coming back. Anyone that has been through this please write back......\nMany Hugs Christine\n ",

      "Content": " Laure' \n \nI was diagnosised with bc may 2003 her2tt. Had the lump removed. Started chemo but still had my menstal cycle the hole time. So the doctor said since I was only 33 at the time the tamoxifen would not do me any good because you only take it for 5 years and I still wouldn't been readly for menpause. So I had my ovaries removed I have 3 wonderful child and can not ask for a more wonderful husband that supports my decisions 100 percent. I thought that this would be a reliable solution. But my cancer returned in January and The found bc cell in my liver. So now I am doing chemo treatment every 3 weeks. I did 4 rounds of taxatere, carboplatin and herceptin, now I am doing 2 treatments of carboplatin and herceptin then a ct scan to see if it is in remission. But I will continue with the herceptin. Whatever decision you make it is your decision every treatment is can have a different response to each person. My prays are with you\nMany Hugs Christine\n ",
