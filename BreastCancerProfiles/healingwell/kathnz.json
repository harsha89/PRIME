This is the only way to be sure that any abnormality is cancer or not. I had a core biopsy which is done under local and is quite bearable the surgeon uses ultrasound to guide the needle to the tumor and a piece is punched out of the core and sent away to be checked - I find that the worst part is waiting for the histology result to come back. My understanding is that microcalcifications can be a precurser to cancer but are not necessarily so. \nBest of luck\nKath from Down Under ",

God bless all my family Wherever they may be, Keep them warm and safe from harm For they're so close to me. And God, there is one more thing I wish that you could do. Hope you don't mind me asking Bless my computer too. Now I know that it's not normal To bless a mother board, Â But listen just a second Â While I explain to you 'My Lord'. You see, that little metal box Â Holds more than odds & end Â Inside those small compartments Â Rest so many of my FRIENDS. Â I know so much about them Â By the kindness that they give And this little scrap of metal Â Takes me in to where they live. By faith is how I know them Â Much the same as you Â We share in what life brings us Â  And from that our friendship grew. Â Please, take an extra minute Â  From your duties up above Â  To bless those in my address book That's filled with so much love! Â Â Wherever else this prayer may reach Â  To each and every friend, Â bless each e-mail Inbox Â And the person who hits Send. Â When you update your heavenly list Â On your own CD-Rom Â Remember each who've said this prayer Â Â Sent up to God.Com.

      "Content": " Dear Tammy,\nJust thought I would give you my thoughts about this.\nYour scared feeling is so normal - everybody has heard some horror stories of chemo in the dark ages. Thanks to modern meds most of us manage just fine - all the others on the board will echo this. watch for consipation & try to prevent this - I hope you like prunes & raisins which worked a treat for me - and just be prepared for cravings for different food - just like when you were pregnant! Some foods/drinks that you really love may temporarily taste horrible - but that passes quite quickly.\nHowever, I am sure you will feel better after you have heard the chemo oncologist talk about why chemo is needed in your particular case. You might like to ask his/her opinion of your survival chances with or without chemo. In my case, to get the \"numbers to stack up\" it was a no contest - Chemo was a must! (if I wanted to be here to see my dgd 21st that is).\nthat said, it is drastic treatment and everyone has a slightly different reaction. Others have said that how you feel after the first treatment mirrors what will happen subsequently - I certainly found that was true.\nBTW I found that although the hair loss was scary, the reality was that it didn't matter at all! I now sport a completely different hair style which everyone admires and I know I wouldn't have been brave enough to do this if it hadn't been for chemo making me lose the hair in the first place!\nWe will all hold your hand while you go through this\nL & H\nKath\nfrom down under ",

But it is really important to get that range of movement back so look on the positioning as additional physical therapy - that might help you put up with it.\nYou eventually get very used to the correct positioning and the actual radiation is over very quickly. Just be sure to do all the skin care suggested - I was given a bg pot of special moisteriser (sp!) BTW you might like to programme a holiday at the end of all the radiation - you can be quite burnt at the end of it all and something to look forward to is also good - I worked all the time thru radiotherapy, but was a mess at the end - my boss made me take a few days off before my programmed holiday.\nI'll be with you (as will all the others!)\nCheers from down under\nKath ",

My hair grew back curly and still has a wave- my pre C hair was straight as the proverbial poker! Also more natural colour. I have kept it short and everyone says it suits me so well. I hope you become just as happy with your new hair.\nBest wishes for the \"journey\"\nKath ",

Yes, it hurts - like H*LL, but there is basically only a small window of opportunity to get the movement back before the scar tissue really starts getting involved.\nBTW regarding chemo - most get through it reasonably o.k. the anti nausea drugs are miraculous. - I did though I must admit I had to force myself to go the last time!\nBest wishes for your journey - we are all with you\nL & H\nKath ",
