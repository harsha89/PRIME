      "Content": " I had the biopsy on Tuesday. After hearing no results, I called today and the hospital where it was done told me that the results were back but that the people reading the biopsy wanted to send it out for a second opinion due to a 1mm area of concern. Then my doctor's office calls me and says the results are in and the doctor would be calling me to discuss them! I told the nurse who called what the hospital had told me and she knew nothing about\n it! I am waiting for my doctor (actually she is a NP) to call me back to explain all this! So I still don't have a definitive answer and waiting through the weekend will truly suck! I just want to know what's going on! Frustrated is putting it lightly. \n ",

He showed me the image and there was a cluster of micro-calcifications (his term) in my upper left breast. \nHe wants to do a Stereotactic Biopsy. I am scheduled for that a week from today. \nHe did tell me that odds are it's benign. He said it's about\n a 15-20% chance it's cancer. He said if it was his wife he would have her do the biopsy. I agreed to it.\nBut, needless to say, I am still scared. I have avoided doctors for over 20 years. Yep...20 years. I recently decided to get an *overhaul* and went in for checkup, and she told me I needed a mammo too. I am 62.\nAnyone know about\n this calcification thing?\nI hope you don't think I am a wimp but I am pretty scared about\n this. ",

      "Content": " Thank you Bev. \nI am nervous and stressed, but Hubby calmed me down some by joking that after the biopsy when they insert the titanium tag, that I would have a \"titanium tit\". LOL! Guess laughing is good right? \nSorry but somehow someway this cheered me up. He is VERY supportive and the best husband in the world. I am extremely lucky to have him by my side. \nI know the odds are against it being cancer, but still, it's very nerve-wracking. The waiting is the worst I think.\nThen, in early November, I get to deal with visiting a gastroenterologist to address those problems. UGH\nAnyway thanks so much for your supportive response. <hugs back at ya>\nBobbi ",
