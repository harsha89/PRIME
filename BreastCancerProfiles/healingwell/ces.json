I don't worry about me though, but about who would care for my husband if I were to need surgery, or became very ill. He requires me for almost anything he does, from bathing to fixing food, getting in and out of bed, getting dressed, etc. \nI do believe I would probably push myself to get home so I can be here for him. And probably would fight the docs tooth and nail to get me sent home if I were to end up in the hospital for anything. \nI believe I can handle any diagnosis no matter what after the last three years with my husbands problems. \nI have educated myself on the BRCA1 gene. And do believe I understand it fairly well. Getting my husband to understand all of it is a different matter. And do believe that if I were tested it probably would be a positive results. I know when my sister was dx she was told by her doctor it was hereditary and to be sure I understood the risk. \nI have taken that statement with me since. Education to me is the key. So I tend to dig and find answers even to questions I have and don't have yet. \nCes ",

I only know so much of her information. I know her bc was feeding on estrogen, that is why they did the hysterctomy, it was after that they discovered the oc. \nAnd yes my chances of being BRCA positive are probably 50-50. \nBut it is because of the 50% chance of being positive I must be proactive in my health.
