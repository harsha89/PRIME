    "Content": " I have dense breast also and have for the past month been having a burning pain in my right breast close to the sternum. It is not a constant pain, but it has been hurting for a month now. I was told by my gyno that I had dense breast and earlier I read a post about\n Inflammatory Breast Cancer and cancer does run in my family. Most of my sisters and my mother have had lumps in their breast that they have either had to have removed or drained and all so far have been benign. I am worried because my breast are dense and I don't feel any lumps, but the pain is bad when it hits me. What should I do? I don't have insurance and not sure where to start. ",
