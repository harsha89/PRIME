    "Content": " Hello,Everyone I am new to this support group and I am very glad that I found this group it is helping me a lot reading everyone's story. well I am 41 years old I got my first mammogram on February 10th I called my Gynecologist office for the results after 3 weeks from taking it and briefly her Medical Asst. says the Dr's has notes for me to go back for another mammogram so of course I was scared and wondering why no one called me earlier to let me know I had to take another mammogram 3 weeks have past and no phone call to let me know I only found out because I called the office so I ask why?she responded and said something about\n a shadow and some dense area all on my right breast they have to determine if it's a cyst she then said don't worry it doesn't means there is something there I'm so worried and stressed out I have no family members with Breast Cancer can somebody please help me any advise will be good to help ease my mind.
