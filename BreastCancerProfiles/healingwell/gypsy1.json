My mother died at 44 from ovarian cancer. I had a carcinoma in situ in my cervix and had a hysterectomy just over 5 yrs ago. And when I say just over, I mean my hyst. was in Mar of 2002. \nI know I should remain calm until I have real reason to worry. *ohm* I try. You ladies are a real inspiration. Thanks again for all your info. I am sure it's nothing, but it has helped coming here to vent. I'll let you know how it goes come Thursday. *crossfingers*\nHugs,\nMel ",

I might add that I have already used up the $750 perscript\nion allowance. So I guess that means anything I get I'll have to pay for out of pocket. Wow I sure hope that I am worried for nothing. The thought of having cancer is scary enough without the added stress of how to pay for it. *sigh*\nThank all you kind ladies for the information.\nHugs\nMel ",

      "Content": " went in today for my spot compressions.  the girl that did it showed me the spot in question on my mammogram then proceeded to take 5 spot compressions.  She said to wait while she developed them and then we would look at them together.  She came back and put the first pic up and showed the spot that seemed even larger than before.  She didn't bother to show me the rest. She said there is definately something there and went to set me up for a sonogram.  Waited 2 more hours had a ultrasound done and was sent on my way.  At this point it is well after 5pm and the first girl is gone home.  So they told me to follow up with my Dr.\n \n \n \n ",
