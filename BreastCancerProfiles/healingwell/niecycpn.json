    "Content": " Hi ladies,\n I'm new here too. I also have sharp shooting pain in my left breast.I also have a burning sensation in just one area of my breast. Last week it got so bad the pain was moving all the way down to the nipple, and it hurt to the touch, it almost felt bruised. I had a mammogram and an ultrasound and was told we just don't know why your having this pain. It's very frustrating and a bit scary. Can anybody help with an answer? \n ",
