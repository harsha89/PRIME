    "Content": " Hi.\nI can't say I'm thrilled to have to be posting here, but so glad to see that there is such a wonderful place of support and so many strong, wonderful survivors here.\nLet me start off by saying that my mother is a bc survivor of almost 20 years. She found a lump when she was only 35.\nBecause of my mother's history and the fact that I am overly anxious about\n health matters, I had my baseline (after some convincing of my doctor) at the age of 27. I just turned 30, we have moved to a new area, I have an almost 3 yo girl and thought it would be a good time to get another mammo. I also had some questions about\n different lumps I was feeling. I had never really performed a good sbe before, so I was never really sure as to what had been there, and not, etc. I was always afraid to do it.\nWhen I went for my clinical, the particular lump I wanted to point out to my dr. I could not find in his office. It was only aferwards that I realized I could only feel it when I was standing, not lying down. Anyways, I asked him if I could get a mammo. and he said sure, if I wanted, and last week was my appointment.\nSix days later I got a call back from the radiologists office, saying they need to take another look. After prying the scheduling nurse (or whoever it was) I found out that they discovered some calcifications that weren't present on my baseline.\nI really can't tell you just how frightened I am. I am practically catatonic with fear. That day I called my ob-gyn, he called over for the report and read it to me. I wish I had written down what he had said, but I'm not in the best frame of mind-basically he said that a grouping of calcifications were found on my right breast (directly under my nipple), and further evaluation is needed. My ob-gyn told me he's not concerned about\n this and I should take it easy. Yeah, easier said than done. Also that lump is near where the calcifications are. The calcs are at 6 o'clock, the lump at 3 o'clock. What I do know about\n the lump is that it is small, kind of hard, but moveable and there are a couple of other similar lumps in that area. Also if you were to feel on my other breast in the same exact spot there is a similar lump.\nAt this point I'm just talking out loud. My doctor suggested that I write down questions, so I'm writing them down here. If you can think of something I should add, or any other advice for me, please feel free to add. I need all the advice I can get. My mother has been a wonderful support, but she's going through other issues right now, and besides she gets frustrated when I'm not able to hold it together (I'm crying all the time now).\n1. Because this mammo was taken digitally and my baseline wasn't , could the calcifications always have been there? Just not noticable on my first mammogram?\n2. Since my baseline, I had a child and breast fed, would these factors cause these changes in my breast?\n3. I also have fibrocystic breasts-would this cause calcs. too? \n4. Did the lump on my right breast show up on the mammo? If not, can I point it out to him and ask for an u/s? (I don't know if the radiologist can or is authorized to do a clinical also)\n5. Could this lump be related to my calcs? \n6. Can a magnified view tell you for certain that this is benign?\n6. Do I need a biopsy?\nThat's all I can think of for now.\nAgain any words of wisdom is greatly appreciated. (and prayers)\nI think you are all a wonderful group of ladies. Light, Love and Healing to you All.\nKari ",
