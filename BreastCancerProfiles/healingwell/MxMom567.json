      "Content": " Thanks Bev for replying. I think everything went well. They did compression views and the radiologist looked them over and then I was sent home. I think that is a good sign. I see my ob/gyn on April 8th. In 2007 when I had my baseline mammo I had to go back and after compression views they walked me over to have an ultrasound right away. Then had to see a cancer specialist. Everything was just fine. I feel pretty confident everything is just fine this time. Guess I feel if they found something they didn't like the radiologist would have sent me for more tests right away. ",
