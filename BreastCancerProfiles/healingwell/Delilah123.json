    "Content": " A month ago I had a needle biopsy done to investigate a lump on my right breast. I was told I would experience a little discomfort but nothing to worry about\n. When he plunged the needle, it felt like I'd been shot from lower breast into the nipple, and I had to take a moment before I dared to \nopen my eyes just in case I had actually been shot. They were surprised at how distressed I was and the amount of pain I was in and just told me to take some ibuprofen and rest up for a day or so. I cried all the way home and all night, only finding relief when I put on a sports bra and strapping. I'm a 32FF so there's a lot of weight to them. \nThankfully my biopsy results came back normal, but the pain still hasn't diminished. I now have to have my breast supported 24hrs a day, even having to support it when I'm changing, so I need help dressing. Every time I lean forward I experience an internal pulling sensation as if something is torn inside.\nThe ultrasound scan showed no haematoma and the tissue looks healthy, but still I'm in an incredible amount of pain, the only relief I get is by being still and having my chest strapped up. \nI was prescribed gabapentin for the pain, but it made me feel confused and intoxicated. I've now hardly left the house for a month due to the pain from even walking for a short while and the fear of being knocked, it's really getting to me. Has anyone else had anything like this and how long was recovery. ",
