Maybe it really does not make much of a difference and it sounds like he was pretty sure he could do the lumpectomy instead anyway. These are questions I wanted to ask.

      "Content": " Hi Jule,\nSO glad to hear you are feeling better than expected. That is wonderful! But take it easy - don't be pulling any stitches out!\nI am still in never never land. Finally got in to see the plastic surgeon assigned to me by my HMO. He was literally over 70 years old (got his med school degree in 1964), he and his nurses put me in a dentist like looking chair then stood totally across the room from me (I felt like I was a spy being interrogated by the gestapo - soooo, you vant a new brrreast...), he did not believe in immediate reconstruction, he did not believe in silicone implants, then he treated me like a total idiot when I mentioned the alloderm reconstruction method being used in New York (I brought an article and he would not even look at it). When I asked to see his before and after photos (remember this is a surgeon who has been around more than 40 years) he showed me a book that had about\n 10 before and afters in it and they all except one looked like something from a boob horror show. \nAnyway, long story short (oops too late for that!), now I can get a referral to another surgeon. But I truly think I am going to try to get a consult with these doctors in New York. I have been on another web site and the women there all seem to love them and rave about\n the results and the fact that it is a one operation reconstruction. I just have to find out if they can fit me in soon to do the surgery and if my insurance will cover any of it at all. What a life huh? \nIt must be such a relief to have the surgery part over with! Do you know if you have to have chemo in addition to your surgery yet? Did you get your path results back? ",

Now all you need is a nice clean node biopsy and you will be totally on your way. How are you feeling?\nHad my appointment today with the plastic surgeon who concurred with my general surgeon that a mastectomy was the better option for me because I don't have enough breast tissue to make a lumpectomy worthwhile. This guy is definitely not doing my reconstruction - I did not feel he was listening to what I wanted at all. He only wanted to do what he wanted to do. He does not believe in immediate reconstruction and would only do it if forced to. Fortunately for me he does not do silicone implants, which means I can now be referred to another plastic surgeon and my insurance will still cover most of it - hopefully I will be able to use the one I wanted in the first place. I just want to get this part behind me, get the surgery done and start healing. ",

In the mean time I am going to do a lot of praying and I will certainly share my story, no doubt about\n that! It's most amazing to me that after all the horror stories people told me about\n mamograms, it was a piece of cake. Not even uncomfortable as far as I was concerned. \nThanks for the advice on keeping reports. I have started a file (in a pink file folder!) I will let you know what happens. I have been a huge booster of the Sunshine Kids for a number of years. Never thought that I might need a support group myself though. Guess you never imagine it could happen to you. And I feel perfectly fine and as full of energy as ever.
