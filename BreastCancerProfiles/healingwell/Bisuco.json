    "Content": " Wow - I just joined the forum and was looking through for the first time and saw your post. I can't believe no one replied to you. I know the pain of having to wait and judging by the dates, your waiting must be over. I can only hope and pray that you received good news. I was just diagnosed with Stage 3 in March and am undergoing chemo before surgery. I tested estrogen & progesterin positive which I believe means that my cancer is fed off of estrogen & progesterin. They removed me IMMEDIATELY from my HRT. There is too many alternatives out there to have to resort to HRTs. Or just put on your big girl pants (like I'm trying to do) and live with the hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, and all that other fun girl stuff. I'm doing it while dealing with the side effects of chemo. I hate to think I brought this cancer on myself by making the decision to use HRT. Either way - it's a decision that you have to make for yourself. Best of luck to you. ",
