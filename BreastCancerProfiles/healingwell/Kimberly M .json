      "Content": " Hi Christine,\nMy name is Kimberly. I'm a volunteer with an organization called Women's Cancer Resource Center in Berkeley, California. I have a client who was informed this morning, over the telephone I might add, that she had \"spots on her liver\". She feels very discouraged because she thought her breast cancer was behind her. I think she could really use some support right now. As could you, I'm sure. Would you be interested in speaking with her? She is 36, has a 2 year-old and lives in Maple Heights, Ohio. If so, please give us a call at (510) 420-7900. Or, please send an email to kimsacher@yahoo.com.\nThank you so much,\nKimberly ",

      "Content": " Hi all,\nAgain, my name is Kimberly. I'm a volunteer with the Women's Cancer Resource Center. Please refer to my reply to Christine, posted today at 12:40 p.m. If any of you are willing to speak with my client, I would really appreciate it. Like I said, she got her bad news this morning and is feeling really discouraged. I think she would really benefit from speaking with someone who has undergone something similar. If any of you are willing, please give me a call at (510) 420-7900 or send an email to kimsacher@yahoo.com or post a reply. \nThank you,\nKimberly ",
