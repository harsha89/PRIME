      "Content": " Oh sorry, I didn't make that clear. She's receiving treatment every 3 weeks- herceptin, zumeta (sp?!) and she's on chemo tablets. She's was put on the chemo tablets around 3 months ago but became so sick from them and lost so much weight, they stopped, but they restarted her on them again because her tumor markers are spiking, but is taking meds for the side effects...she's still really sick tho..Anyway, the other day she was in getting her treatment and she mentioned her back is really sore, so that's why they're sending her for bones scans to check her out...\nI guess I hate not knowing the full extent of her illness. With myself, I know everything there is to know about\n my crohn's and crohn's disease in general, but I don't even know what stage cancer my mom has!! ",
