    "Content": " Went for a yearly mammogram (2nd one/41yrs old) 2weeks ago and the next day got a call back saying \"they needed additionals pictures for the left breast\", I felt sick instantly. From that call until today I was a wreck, it was always on my mind I was going crazy with all the what if's. Thankfully, I have a loving and supporting family/friends who kept me in peace with prayers and encouraging words. I went today for the follow up visit and it turned out as I hoped and prayed it woud. They took about\n 4 different pictues for the radiologist to review and after a little while she came back and said all showed fine with no additional concerns. Praise God!! I hope my experience with the scary call back will ease minds and give some peace to those who are in the same position. God bless to all! ",
