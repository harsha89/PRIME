    "Content": " My Name is Anne and my family has been hit hard by cancer. I've had 2 grandparents die of cancer and my father is currently fighting prostate cancer. Two of my aunts are breast cancer survivors so I decided I want to give back help find a cure.\nI'm hoping to participate in the Susan G Komen 3 Day walk in San Diego, CA in November. Registered walkers agree to raise a minimum of $2,200 for the Breast Cancer 3-Day benefiting Susan G. Komen for the Cure and the National Philanthropic Trust Breast Cancer Fund, in order to walk. It's a lot to raise, in a short time, but I'm determined.\nIf I don't make enough for the November walk I will continue to raise money and participate in the July 2009 walk in Boston.\n \n \n \n ",
