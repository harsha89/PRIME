      "Content": " Well, I just got back from my mamo and sono. The Dr. said everything looks normal! Hooray! (And that I just have to get used to the pain. He said that\u2019s normal, too.) I\u2019m going to follow-up with my regular gyn instead of the specialist. I never knew that you\u2019re supposed to have mamo\u2019s every 2 years after you hit 30, or every year after 40! He told me that breast cancer hits 1 in 8 women! This is scary stuff!\nThank you, MMMNAVY- I never knew about\n the weird pain with IBD, either. I was just diagnosed 8/07. But, I suspected the the meds may have something to do with it.\nI want to thank you all for your advice and I wish you all the best! ",

      "Content": " I will. Thanks for the concern. You're all so nice here!\nThe gyn practice I go to has a doc who \"specializes\" in breast issues. I'm making an appointment with him to talk about\n it this summer when I go for my annual. Even though I just met him, the doc who did the mamo and ultrasound seems very trustwothy to me. He told me that there was nothing strange in the films. He said that everything looks perfectly normal. I'm just not going to the specialist outside the normal practice on 5/12. \nNow, I'm on a crusade to get all my friends and family to have mamograms! ",
