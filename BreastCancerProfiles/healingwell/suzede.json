      "Content": " I agree with JaniceHelp. The process does need to change. I had my yearly mammogram on Aug 27, recieved a certified letter from the hospital that my mammogram was abnormal and I needed to contact my doctor for an appointment. I made my appointment as instructed and was then scheduled for an additional mammogram with special views. Upon my arrival for that on Sept 19, the mammogram tech informed me that a different radiologist had looked at the first mammogram and thought a sonogram would be more beneficial. I had the sonogram and the results were taken to the radiologist. The tech came back and said the radiologist had ordered a second sonogram because he insisted he had seen something in the original mammogram and he didn't think she was picking it up. She did the second sonogram and I was then told I needed to go ahead with the special views mammogram. Two pictures were taken and I was once again told to wait. After awhile, the tech came back in and said the radiologist wanted to study the results more closely and would probably get the results to my doctor by the next afternoon. I talked to my doctor's nurse late Thursday afternoon and she told me they had not received the results yet but when they got them she would contact me to make sure I got the results as well. According to her, I would receive a letter and basically get the results the same time they received them. I have yet to receive any news and of course I'm a nervous wreck and have been since I got the first results letter two weeks ago! I'm trying to stay optomistic but my anxiety level is extremely high right now. \nI know I'm probably rambling but I just needed to vent. My husband is the only person who knows about\n any of this because I don't want to worry anyone else in my family. Thanks for listening. ",
