    "Content": " Hi all!\nI, too, have a family history of breast and ovarian cancer. However, my Mom's BRCA and BART tests were negative. Towards the end of last summer, I got this nagging feeling that I needed a mammogram. A spot was detected, biopsied and came back atypical lobular hyperplasia. It was small enough that the biopsy sucked the entire mess out. My doc put me on tamoxifen and I had a hard crash into menopause (I'm 50). No worries, tho'. At my next checkup (six months after the initial mammogram), my doc wanted me to have an MRI with dye to see if there was anything else was hidden. A suspicious area was identified that did not show up on the initial mammogram. I had two biopsies on this area - first with an ultrasound and the other with an MRI. The ultrasound biopsy's results were negative, but the doctor said something was just not right and suggested a MRI biopsy. The results from the MRI indicated radial scarring and no cancer. This was also small enough to be sucked out with the biopsies. She said that this was very rare, but has seen this in women like me (family history and atypical hyperplasia). She also said that these cells do not change into cancer, but can hide cancer. Also, in my case this is more like a marker that does put me at an increase for breast cancer. I will most likely change from tamoxifen to a drug for menopausal women and will go back in 6 months for another diagnostic exam. All this was caught so quickly in the game that I'm still a bit stunned. My aunt, back in the 60s, had a double mastectomy with rib and arm muscle removed... my mom had a single mastectomy... and I'm having clusters of cells removed. Not to make light of the seriousness of breast cancer, but I'm so grateful for the medical advances and only hope that when my daughters are older, there's a preventative shot that they can take. Take care ladies and forever keep moving forward. xxxooo ",
