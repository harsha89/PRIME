      "Content": " I posted a few times looking for advise for my friend who had a large lump and had let it go for a year and had no job or insurance, everyone of course was wonderful / with advise how to get her to go to a dr. She finally went and she has a lump 80% of her breast and it has broken through the skin, he told her to go to social services and get free help asap, he said she had to have chemo and or/radiation to shrink it before removal. She is going to go on Monday, but I am really doubting this will help, as she has no will to live, and from all the i have read, it is the will and the want to live that can help save you. Her husband died a bit back and she wants to be with him, atleast with a dr. he can send her to hospice and they can help her with the pain. It is so sad for a friend to not be able to do anything, she just wants to die..I cant even get her to write a will or tell her brother in law. i wish I could help...but she doesnt want it, I hope she gets the peace she is looking for, and thanks to all of you who posted coments for me ",

      "Content": " thank you so much for your thoughts and ideas, she has no family at all, she devoted her life to her husband, when he died of alcoholism, she was alone, to make it worse i worked with her and she was let go, been unemployed for two years, i think she has lost her will to live..she has a beautiful apartment filled with valuables, which i think she should sell to get the medical help she needs, she refuses to write a will. She evn has investment money, but wont use anything for medical, I think she is just commiting suicide and this lump is doing it for her, to all of you this lump that has grown for a year and is seeping fluid and blood, is bad, i assume, I have been lucky to not have had breast cancer and I am at a loss as to the symptoms and how bad this is, I have tried for years to have her get a Mammogram, I go every year. I really appreciate all of your insight and ideas, I am at a loss here ",

      "Content": " you are correct, I wish she would fight more to be healthy. She does not have insurance, but she does have funds. I took an agressive step, I called a friend who has had breast cancer, and been cancer free for many years, she gave me a dr name, I called him and gave her all the info, it is up to her, she has my support, whatever happens, but she has to do something..not just let it sit. I am hoping she will make an appointment. I thank you all and wish you all well and good health ",
