      "Content": " Hi All,\nI'm new to this forum and am just looking for a bit of information regarding what to expect. My Mom went in for a biopsy earlier this week and is scheduled to receiver her results tomorrow. As I'm sure you each know, the anxiety and anticipation is brutal. There is a fair dose of anger added to the mix as my Mom is a uterine cancer survivor (she was diagnosed and successfully treated in 2008), and we are angry at the possibility that she may have to go through all of this again.\nSo, here are the facts: She found a hard lump in her left breast about\n 2 weeks ago. She has been very diligent about\n keeping up with her check-ups (still on 6 month appts with her oncologist and she gets yearly mammograms and paps). Her last appointment with her oncologist was in December. Though, of course, he's focused on the lower half of her body, he ran routine blood work, etc. Everything came back normal. She also just had a physical about\n a month ago. Again, all results were normal. When she went to her GYN to report the lump, the GYN thought it probably wasn't anything, but ordered a mammogram and ultrasound anyway. The radiologist said that the lump had ill-defined borders and looked \"worrisome,\" so she ordered a biopsy. She did state that the lump is small (around 0.5 cm) and that if this turns out to be something, it's likely not to be more than a bump in the road for my Mom. She also ultrasounded the axillary lymph nodes, and those looked normal. \nWhile this is encouraging, we're still nervous! I have an interventional radiologist friend who says that it's very rare for uterine cancer (or any cancer for that matter) to recur in the breast. While he has seen patients whose cancers have metastasized to the breast, he said that by that point, those patients were so sick, they weren't walking around without symptoms. He said that if this is cancer, it is most likely a second primary, meaning it's breast cancer, not uterine cancer that has recurred or spread. That being said, I'm still interested to hear thoughts on:\n(1) Possible benign lumps that might present this way (the radiologist did indicate it doesn't look like a cyst);\n(2) How rare is it for uterine cancer (or any cancer) to recur in the breast?\n(3) If the uterine cancer had metastasized, wouldn't this have appeared in her blood work (either in December at the oncologist's or last month at her physical)?\n(4) If it turns out to be primary breast cancer, what's the likely prognosis? Since the lump is small, I would assume it would be better.\nTHANK YOU all so much in advance for your words and thoughts!! I admire your strength and the strength of each individual going through this. Thanks for your support. ",
