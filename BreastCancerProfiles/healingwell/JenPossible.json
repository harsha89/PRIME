      "Content": " Hi Deanna, Hi Lori,\nActually, a cyst can be cancerous. In my case I found a lump in each breast, and had three swollen lymph nodes under my arm. The lumps did not show on mammogram, and for some dumb reason the ultrasound tech couldn't find anything on the right, so she wouldn't do the left (where I had the lymph nodes). The surgeon would not do a needle biopsy, even though I had family history, because they were just fibrocystic changes, according to him. They were cysts, but they had cancer in them, which was found by another doctor six months later - then I was diagnosed with advanced cancer instead of early stage disease. It's been over a year and I'm still in chemo.\nYour doc is on the right path, but don't let up. I had a needle biopsy at two hospitals, the first one did say cancer in both breasts but the second hospital only found cancer on one side, because the cancer cells in the fluid were already removed by the first hospital; A core biopsy was done, and then it was \nfound in the second breast. \nSo what I'm taking too long to say is if you get the news that everything is OK, still get a second opinion. \nAnd get copies of all the medical records (mammogram report, US report, doctor's notes) to make sure you and your doctor have really heard each other.\nI'm really hoping that this is nothing for you to be worried about\n.

      "Content": " Hi Beth,\nJust a quick note - from what you wrote, it says your lymph nodes were metastatic - that means cancer in the lymph nodes. Stage IV is if it gets to collar bone lymph nodes/neck lymph nodes/bone, brain, lung liver. It looks like they are saying just the lumph nodes have cancer in them, too. I'm not sure what extracapular extension is, but just knnow you have a right for the doctor to tell you what everything means. \nAnd ask the doc for copies of doctor/nurses notes, too, because that's where they write what they think and what your treatment plan is.\nThe ladies on this board are great!\n-Jen ",

Please ask your doc about\n taking a med to protect your heart - at the hospital I'm at now in IL, the docs give Zinacarg to keep patients from having damage from adriamycin. They've given patients adraimycin for a year and not seen any heart damage. \nNot to scare you, but at the first facility I had treatment, I was told that heart damage can occur after 7 or 8 treatments, and not to worry, but I had damage after the 6th treatment. That's why I'm advising.\nI had almost no trouble at all with AC - I even forgot ot take the anti-nausea meds after treatment. If I did have small waves of nausea, I ate sugared ginger, drank ginger tea, had gingersnaps, also I have been told of black licorice can help, too, which I like anyways. \nIt helped me too to have some imagery of what the chemo was doing - killing cancer cells - IO visualize a shark, so people visualize pacman eating up he bad cells. Think of what could work for you. Maybe bring some relaxing music, and a friends or relative that doesn't talk too much! Try to relax with your treatment, you need your energy to fight. And, it also helped me to pray and thank God for my life's blessings.\nHave a great day! \n-Jen ",
