    "Content": " Good luck to you doxie. I am a breast cancer survivor 15 years now. It all started with a cyst. Hiding behind it was a .2 centimeter tumor. But without that cyst they never would have found it. You will handle whatever it is that comes your way and be fine. You have been on your toes about\n watching what is going on.; You must know that cysts can calcify, and calcifications can become tumors, I would demand they remove any cysts at the time of biopsy and get on with your life. I hope you get good news and have a wonderful holiday celebration!!! ",
