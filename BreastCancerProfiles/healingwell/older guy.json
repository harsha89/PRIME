    "Content": " i am writing for my sister. She has breast cancer. Today they gave her results from a Mamma Print? She is high risk. I guess this means she needs chemotherapy, which she was hoping very much to avoid.\nright now she is in her room eating. she is overweight and food is her answer to a lot of things.\nmostly i just wanted to check in. i'm scared about\n what the chemo will do to her health. and i don't think i'm very good at caregiving. i'm in al-anon and \"overgave\" for so many years and in so many situations I just tend to withdraw.\nshe does have a circle of friends who support her. so there is that.\nbye!\ndepression, anxiety, upper denture, benign prostate hyperplasia\n-----------------------------\ncymbalta, lamotrigine, zyprexa, klonopin\ncrestor\ndoxazosin ",
