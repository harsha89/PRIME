      "Content": " I've been having routine/annual mammograms for about\n 15 years now. Every one has been nothing more than an inconvenience, some stress while I wait for the results and a letter saying that the results are negative, thanks for playin', see you next year.\nYesterday, I had my 2012 mammogram. Today, the imaging center called me and, in typical information-less fashion, told me that 'a couple' of the images need to be 'repeated'. The scheduled me to come back Monday at a time when the radiologist is on site and can read the films and give me results right then and there. \nHow stressed should I be? I know that I am going to be majorly stressed, no matter what...I just want to know if my stress is warranted or if this is something routine. ",

      "Content": " Sassy12-\nDid you hear anything? I hope you did! But, if not, you may not have to freak if the dr wants to see you in person. Some doctors have gone to a system of having ALL news delivered in person so people don't freak. (yeah, right...like we're not going to freak at \"I have your test results, can you come in tomorrow at 5?\" Please....). So, yep. You're going to freak, but remember that there's tons of support out there and we're all waiting to hear what the results are!\nBecky ",
