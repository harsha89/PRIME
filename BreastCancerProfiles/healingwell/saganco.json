    "Content": " Well wonderful kudos to you all for the perseverence that it takes to do the whole shebang - not to mention how hard it is on your body. My mom had to do the whole package, plus the biopsy of the nodes, and the radiation. She always had lots of energy and never understood my chronic fatigue, but after all the treatments, she ended up with the fatigue. But she's been cancer free for 5 years now - and hopefully is out of the woods now for life!! I hope and pray you guys have the same joyful celebration (each and every anniversary). Fortunately my mom has gained a lot of control over the fatigue like I have, so now with no more cancer and no more fatigue, my sweet old mom should last another 20 years! You guys just keep looking forward, cause looking in the rearview mirror only wears you down. What matters now is the future, not the past - and you guys now have a much brighter future!\nKeep your chins up!\nSharon\nWork from home - I do!\n ",
