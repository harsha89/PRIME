It took 3 peope to try and get the needle in. All that poking and probing. I was crying like a baby. They said it shouldn't hurt like that, but what else could they say. I dread going back but I have to. As for scars, I had back surgery 7 years ago and they cut me 7 inches on my stomach and my back. The back scar is great but my stomach scar is an inch wide and 7 inches long. Now I have a large scar on my left breast and under my are from a lumpectomy. not to mention the scar on my right chest from the port. I look like I was hit by a truck. As long as I can live until my children and grandchild grows up it will all be worth it. I am only 44 years old and I have alot of living to do. My youngest is 15 years old. I hope everything goes better for you. Just keep on fighting someday you will be able to put this all behind you. Lots of hugs.\n Carol from Rochester, NY ",

And I'm sorry if some women go through it but I went thru it fairly good. I did get nauseous on days 3 and 4 but the meds helped alot. No throwing up. Days 5 and 6 started with dizziness and head pain. Went to the docs, they said it was stress, no kidding!!! My mom got in a real bad car accident on that day and I was worried sick. She's 83 and had 4 broken ribs, broken wrist, small bleed in her head and possible both her feet are fractured or something, they still don't know because they want her to stand on them to get better x-rays. She can't, too painful. I guess that was enough stress to handle on top of the chemo. I am taking ativan for that and I feel great now. Back to my old self again. Hope you get thru This as I did. Let us know. My prayers are with you.\nCarol from Rochester, NY ",

      "Content": " Thanks Lori,\nYesterday I went to the docs because my head hurt so bad and I was so off balance so they drew blood. from the port. Didn't feel a thing so the next session of chemo should be a breeze. They put me on atttivan an anti axiety drug. I thought I was handling it pretty good but guess not. It really helps and lets me sleep which I never do. Now I think my body can fight this if I can rest. All my blood counts were great so far. If it's the same every time I CAN get through this like a trooper. More relieved now Thanks Carol ",

I have the mouth sores now but I got a prescript\nion for some swish and swallow stuff and it helps. Same thing they gave me for thrush years ago. Today was a great day. No symptoms of any kind. Feel like my old self. Went Christmas shopping. Just when I feel good I'll have to get another treatment. Sucks. But, it will all be over January 28th. Counting down the days. Will still have to do 6 weeks of radiation but that I think I can handle. Well I have no choice. Hope you have a great holiday.\nCarol from Rochester NY ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone,\nI started chemo on Monday, They had a hard time getting in the port but once they did everything went well. I have been feeling pretty good up until this morning. Pretty sick to my stomach. Today even my coffee tastes really bad and I do love my coffee. I feel for all of you who have gone through this. The hair lose is something that I'm looking forward to. I always had long hair and I got it cut last week short. Love it I probably will never go back to long. Short hair is so easy to manage. No hair will probably be even easier (LOL) I find it very comforting to read the comments that you all have for anyone with a problem. I try to do the same but am quite new at this, so I don't have alot of experience with all the procedures yet, I'm sure someday I will. Not an accomplishment I ever wanted but someday if I can help someone else, I will be glad I can.
