    "Content": " So I am turning 20 soon and have been dealing with a painful breast lump (s) for a year and a half. At first when I went to the doctor in 2011 she said it could just be a cyst and brushed it off as if it were nothing. It did go away for a couple months but soon after it returned and has been around for a year. PAINFUL. I woke up yesterday and today in tears from how much pain. In december 2011 I went to my first gyno appointment and this new doctor brushed it off as if it were normal. Then when I returned in may the male medical student was concerned, not the actual doctor, because of how different my breasts looked side my side. I know I just rambled my how breats story but do you have any idea what it could be? I'm in such pain I don't even want to get up. It's my left breat by the way.... ",
