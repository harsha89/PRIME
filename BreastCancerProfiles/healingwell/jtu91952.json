    "Content": " I take verapamil for hbp, and have been taking it for over five yrs.  Once my dr. prescribed 360 mg.  I immediately noticed a painful lump under my right arm.    As time progressed, I started having breast pain.  At first it was just a dull pain.  Now it is a throbing pain and it starts under my arms and extend all the way to the nipple.\n ",
