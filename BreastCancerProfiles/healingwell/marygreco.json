    "Content": " So I went last week for my yearly mammogram and thought everything was fine but the next day I get the dreaded call.  We need to do additional pictures on your left breast. I felt sick. I had never had a call back before but had heard they are common.  At this point there was no rationalizing with me.  I had myself 20 feet under.  This is the way at times my OCD mind works.  I literally kept touching my left breast cause I thought I found the spot.  Literally my skin was so red and raw from poking.  This is what I did to myself.  Funny only went it comes to my breasts do I freak out.  Maybe cause Pink is everywhere as it should be but the reality is the chances of it being breast cancer are quite slim. So I went back and the technician said here let me show you the spot where  were looking at as we think it is nothing probably just some breast tissue/skin that was folded over.  Sure enough they took about\n five pics and turned out to be nothing and sent me on my way.  So I know I can say it a million times but dont worry.  What our mind can do to us is crazy~~ So next call back I get in the future will be a much less blow~~",
