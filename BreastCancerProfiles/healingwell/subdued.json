    "Content": " \nWhat are the options for people who don't have insurance to get breast cancer treatment? \nWhat happens if someone gets a free mammogram and it turns out to be cancer? Insurance companies will consider it to be a pre-existing condition. How will they be able to afford treatment? Please provide suggestions. Thanks. ",
