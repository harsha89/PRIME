    "Content": " Hi Everyone,\nI am 56yo and have had cysts for 30 years. They used to aspirate them when found, however, this is no longer the practice. I am also post-menopause and was told that the cysts would go away. \n Right. My left breast has at least 4 cysts and is now noticeably larger than the right. It's also painful. (I am deficient in both D and B12. I'm often iron deficient anemic.) \nAfter 30 years, I am so tired of this. I have FBD which is no longer considered a disease. But during these 30 years I increased in cup size from a C to a DDD. (As if the cysts weren't enough trouble). So, I wonder, are the problems we face not considered that important because we live in a society that sees larger breasts as a plus? Think about\n it, if my husband's scrotum increased in size by 200%-300% without malignancy would that be okay? I guarantee it would not. Nor would it be acceptable for him to experience pain due to four (assumed benign) cysts on one testicle. \nLike I said, I'm frustrated. I'm also tired of carrying these things around. Thanks for listening. 0-o ",
