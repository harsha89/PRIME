    "Content": " Hi Everyone,\nI'm new to this website (and to forums in general) and am searching for answers for my brother. He is fighting an undifferentiated Papillary Thyroid cancer. Basically it has been diagnosed as papillary, but is acting like anaplastic. Aggressive and growing. He has just finished his seventh (and final, thank God) week of radiation and they are starting to talk about\n putting him on the radioactive iodine pill as the next course of action. \nIt's encouraging to hear how positive you all are about\n the chances of survival from papillary cancer. The doctors have been all doom and gloom since we came to them. My brother is 23 years old and has so much life left to live...I'm praying hard and believing that he will come out on top, but sometimes it get's a little overwhelming. \nRight now we are doing everything we can homeopathically to make sure he stays as healthy as we can keep him. Before he started radiation, he was given a tracheotomy and a stomach G tube as precautionary measures. We have an omega juicer that we have been using to push fresh juice through the tube and we have also started making our own food (as opposed to the nutren that the doctor ordered). Right now we are looking for alternatives to up his calories though. He has a ton of mucas that has been generated from the radiation, and we are looking for alternatives to help cut the mucas. The food formulas (both nutren and home made) tend towards recipes that seem to create more mucas. \nDoes anyone have any suggestions to help with this...I am at a loss...\nSearching for answers,\nCherrie ",
