      "Content": " Hi, I was wondering if anyone can advise me. In August I found a lump on my right breast on the right side of my nipple at about\n the 10 o'clock position. I was refered to a breast clinic, my mammogram was clear although they could see the lump on the ultrasound. They thought it to be a enlarged milk duct and the lady doing the ultrasound said I would need to go back. When I spoke to the specialist again he said it was nothing to worry about\n and discharged me. In my doctors report it says I have a cyst and was wondering are the 2 the same? The lump is very hard and not squishy. It said it was 1cm although I think it is bigger, I also think it's deep. Sound silly I know. I think the tissue at the top of my breast feels denser than the other side aswell now. I wanted to know if I should maybe push for a biopsy? Has any1 had any similar experience. I am 40yrs old and would just like to know exactly what is wrong. \nThank you :)) ",

      "Content": " Hello, quick update. The test didn't show any cancer which is gr8 :)) Although the specialist said that they don't just go by biopsy results they also go by the ultrasound images? So now I'm booked in, in about\n 6 weeks so they can remove the whole lump and the tissue surrounding it. Then they will test the lump. He said they may have missed the cancerous cells IF there is any. So this is to make sure there is defo nothing bad in there. If there is he said we will then discuss treatment etc. Once again fingers crossed. Can't wait till it's all over with.\nJackie Xx ",
