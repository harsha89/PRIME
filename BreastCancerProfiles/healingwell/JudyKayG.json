      "Content": " I need advice. Not one to worry BUT.... I am 62 years young, in great health. Mammo showed a spot so I went back for a sono. Radiologist sent me to a surgeon with a \"low level of concern.\" I saw the surgeon today and will have it removed next month. I have been on hormones for about\n 12 years. He said it was not a cyst but I couldn't tell how concerned he was or if I should be. The spot is sore and my nipple itches. I'm not one to panic but my husband does. What do you guys think? ",
