      "Content": " Hi I'm new here. I'm 40 yrs old, after I had my second child, during my very cycle after finished nursing I felt a sharp pain on the left side of my rib cage, very close to the left breast. However the pain went away after I was with my cycle. Since then I only have pain on my left breast to the upper part of the breast thru the underarm, and it's only during ovulation to the time I get my period. Is this normal ? Does anyone experience the same? Doctor told me its fine, but I'm still worried. Please share if you experience similar symptoms, thanks. ",
