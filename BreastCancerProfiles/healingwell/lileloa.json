      "Content": " Hello everybody\nI know some of you became friends of Leah through this board before she passed away in 2004 and Lori mentioned that maybe I should write an update on her family.\nHer kids (now 12 and 10) are doing fine, they are growing up very fast especially Riley. They still talk about\n their mom and you can see some traits of Leah in both of them.\nThey stayed with Leah's husband who is taking great care of them, they keep busy through activities (morgan is very good at soccer, and Riley spends a lot of time at cheerleading...and on the phone, lol)\nBoth Alex and I stayed to help out for the past 2 years and an half but we are leaving the house soon. Alex got a job and I am going back to Europe.\nThe situation is still hard at times and nothing can replace Leah for the girls but they are strong like their mom...\nOn another note, my sonogram results showed: \"no underlying abnormal mass. Dense fibroglandular tissue is noted (...) Suggest follow up and management based on clinical gorunds.\" I have my appointment on Friday. Do you ladies have any advice on what I should ask? Thank you and if you want to ask me any questions feel free to write to me \nElodie ",
