    "Content": " I'm so thankful I've found this thread. I've been dealing with this pain for several months. I'm one year post op. I had a prophylactic double mastectomy. Both my mother and sister had breast cancer and I was considered high risk. \nAt first my PS told me the pain would go away which it only got worse. I went back to my PS and was then told I had a torn muscle and it would take time to heel. I gave it time, I didn't do anything, I didn't lift or push anything. \nThe pain continued to get worse. I went back to the PS which is when I was told that the pocket that was holding my implant in... That is what was torn. WHAT?? \nI went for a 2nd opinion which is when I was told I had neuropathy, and referred to a pain management clinic. \nI've received the pain meds, the injection blocks and still no relief. I'm at a loss. \nI can't exercise, I'm unable to lift my arm without my hand shaking because of the pain. \nI'm in constant pain. \nIs this my life?? ",
