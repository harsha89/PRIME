      "Content": " Hi All,\nI am soooo happy that you were all there for Shelley during her battle. You were able to give her the support and comfort that I could not, that only you could, for that I will be eternally indebted to all of you. Shelley was the most brave, beautiful person I have ever known and feel blessed that she loved me as much as I loved her. She was my incredible friend and Soul Mate. I am still feeling very lost...and expect I will be for a long time. We had so much living to do, and I'm really sad that I won't have her by my side for the major events in my life and Kalia's life. I can't wait to tell Kalia about\n her most amazing, brave, beautiful mother.\nThanks again. Keep on swimmin'...\nLove and prayers to you all.\nShelley's Incredible Friend,\nKatie ",

      "Content": " Hi Ladies,\nI find myself coming back to this board....re-reading old posts of Shell's...finding comfort in the words of love and support you gave to her when she needed it....as major events come up in my life, of course, the loss seems greatest...my birthday is coming up in a few days....she and I always made such a production of birthdays (our b-days are exactly 6 mos apart). LOL. A few weeks ago, I visited with Kalia...I see so much Shelley in her....she sure loves getting her picture taken like Shelley and I did!! She is such a smart beautiful little girl....\nI continue to miss Shel on an hourly basis....so many dorky things that happen throughout the day that I want to share with her...\nThanks again for your kind words to ME and all the love you gave my Shelley!! She meant the world to me...it's so wonderful to be reminded how much I meant to her too!!\nLove and prayers to all of you!! \nLove,\nKatie\ngorgonshead411@yahoo.com ",
