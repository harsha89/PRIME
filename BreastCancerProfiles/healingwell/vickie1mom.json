      "Content": " Luci, I am so sorry to hear about\n your tram flap. I can totally relate. Mind deconstructed after just 3 years. First it started with like a stitch in my lower left side then it kept getting worse until I couldn't stand it anymore. So I made an appointment with my dr. and come to find out the mess that they put in after the surgery to hold everything in, broke loose from the clips and the stitches and was rolling in toward the middle. Well before they could get me in for surgery the upper right side gave way and that one put me in the hospital even sooner. I ended up having the entire mess removed, all the tissue and muscle under it had to be sewn together to hold and a whole new tummy tuck from it. Now I can no longer lift anything over 5 pounds and four months later I am still very sore, and swollen. But my tummy looks great again. After this surgury my doctor said absolutely no more surgery unless it is to save my life. This last surgery was another 10 hours and now I have heart and thyroid problems from all the surgeries and being under for long hours over the past 3 years for the BC. This last surgery put my thyroid off the charts. It is hyperactive and I am under going tests for Graves. Just another gift.\nHope you have a happy thanksgiving.\nHugs and prayers\nVickie ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone. I just slept about\n 12 hours after yesterday. My doctor is saying the reason I am not healing is because the fluid from the swelling in the adbomen isn't being absorbed normally thru the lymph system because of all the abdomen surgery that was done. I go back in two weeks and if the swelling is still bad she will consider \nopening the abdomen up and putting a temporary drain back in. She is also running complete blood test on me to check my thyroid, hormones ect. Thank you for letting me vent, I just was very disappointed yesterday with the news. I am still in slow motion at home and th only time I get out is for my sons football games. I already missed a year of them playing three years ago and I wont miss another year. They are growing up to fast and will be on there way to college soon. They keep me going. Their great kids and so is there father. He has the patience of a saint. (Well at least most of the time.)\nThank you all again and I will keep you posted.\nHugs to all!!\\\nVickie ",

      "Content": " postal2, I am new to this forum. I had a bilateral tram flap reconstruction surgery three years ago. I love my new breasts, the tummy tuck I got from it but hate the prombles that came with it. I am a small petite girl and never had much of a tummy. When they did the surgery they put a mesh in me to help prevent buldges and hernias. I was never told I should never lift anything over 5-7 pounds again. This year while putting a case of gatorade on my shopping cart I felt the mess pull and tear. This happened twice. The pain was horrible. I am now at home healing from a surgery I had three months ago to completely remove the mess, stiches the muscles and tissue back together and at the same time have my ovaries removed because of a high risk for cancer. My tummy will never be the same. I hate it now. I need help getting up, I can't even push a vacuum or lift my cat. \nPlease discuss all the pros and cons of this surgery with your dr. before doing it. I wish I could have had the inplants but I have a disease that the dr. wouldnt let me have them\nGood Luck and God Bless ",

I am also going to see a dr. who specializes in natural cures. I really do not want to take alot more of different medicines in my body. I think it is already screaming for what I have done to it.

I went to the surgeon and she told me not to worry that is most likely was calcification. The next day I went in for the biophy and the evening the results were positive for interductal breast cancer. My gut told me the day of the mamo I had breast cancer and I was not going to wait six months. I explained this to my dr. when he called and never questioned me after that.

My doctor is saying the reason I am not healing is because the fluid from the swelling in the adbomen isn't being absorbed normally thru the lymph system because of all the abdomen surgery that was done....My doctor is saying the reason I am not healing is because the fluid from the swelling in the adbomen isn't being absorbed normally thru the lymph system because of all the abdomen surgery that was done. I go back in two weeks and if the swelling is still bad she will consider \nopening the abdomen up and putting a temporary drain back in....Well before they could get me in for surgery the upper right side gave way and that one put me in the hospital even sooner. I ended up having the entire mess removed, all the tissue and muscle under it had to be sewn together to hold and a whole new tummy tuck from it....The pain was horrible. I am now at home healing from a surgery I had three months ago to completely remove the mess, stiches the muscles and tissue back together and at the same time have my ovaries removed because of a high risk for cancer....I am now at home healing from a surgery I had three months ago to completely remove the mess, stiches the muscles and tissue back together and at the same time have my ovaries removed because of a high risk for cancer. My tummy will never be the same....",
