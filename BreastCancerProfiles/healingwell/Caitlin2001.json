    "Content": " Hi everyone, \nI know this forum hasn't been used in a while but this was the forum I related most to.\nI'm 15 years old (young I know) and for the past few months I've had a very hard, very moveable lump in my left breast.\nObviously because I'm so young, the chances of it being anything to worry about\n are sooooo small but I also suffer from anxiety so you can imagine how terrified I am! \nAfter extensive searching and praying for it to be something other than breast cancer, I stumbled upon this site which lead me to believe that I have a breast cyst? \nMy lump is quite large, very easily moveable, quite smooth but with not easily distinguishable borders. It becomes larger before my period and often is tender when I press it. \nI have a doctors appointment on Monday about\n it but I've just convinced myself it is something awful because of my anxiety,\nPlease if you have had or have a breast cyst can you answer my questions:\nHow long after your appointmet do you have to wait for things like ultrasound, mammogram etc?\nWhat did yours feel like?\nDid you have it removed?\nHow big was it? \nAnd should I be worried about\n mine? \nThanks \nCaitlin ",
