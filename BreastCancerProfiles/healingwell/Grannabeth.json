      "Content": " On Monday 3/18/13 I had surgical removal of breast calcifications on my left breast.  Recovery has gone well.  Very sore yesterday, but made it without paid meds yesterday and last night.  Will get to take dressing off tomorrow and shower!!!!!  I am anxiously awaiting my results which I will get on Tuesday.  My question is, since I had the atypical ductal hyperplasia and my mom had breast cancer at age 38, and a double mastectomy what type of followup will I be faced with?  They also found microcalcifications in my right breast 2 1/2 years ago, but sterotactic biopsy found those to be benign.  I am now worried about\n the right breast since this recent diagnosis.  Also, did anyone have a really rough time with the wire placement before surgery.  My calcifications were really close to the chest wall and they had hard time getting me situated into the mammo machine to place the wire.  I have never had so much pain with a mammo before.  I was in tears, and now I feel that a lot of the soreness I am feeling is a result of that plus the surgery.  I could hardly move yesterday (post surgery 2nd day).  Is this normal? Am I worring too much? ",

      "Content": " I just need some advice tomorrow when I go to get the news of my pathology report for the excisional breast biopsy I had last Monday.  What kind of questions should I be asking?  I'm beginning to get nervous here the night before with the what if's????  I want to ask good questions--but not sure exactly what and don't want to leave anything key out of the discussions.  Anyone whose been down this road have advice or suggestions?
