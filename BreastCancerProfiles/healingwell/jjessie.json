They must be pretty sure - and I did beg them to please help me hit the ground running. I know the hospital system is excellent (Cleve Clinic) so I'm confident it is what it is. The surgeon has done work to remove cysts on my mom for years and she seems like the female version of Gregory House (not to take things lightly by comparing a TV show). She has her degrees from MIT, Columbia and one of the nurses told me she is like a concert level pianist. She was nothing like the radiologist/ultrasound doctors who were kind of young, \ncookie cutter, talked way too much. I meet with the doctor on Thurs to go over all the tests results am just praying it hasn't gone any farther. I don't know how to handle any more bad news...this is so out of the blue as I felt I was/am in very good health.\n \n ",
