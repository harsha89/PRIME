      "Content": " Hello, \nI am 27 year old female, A couple of years ago I found a small lump in my right breast. I was very concerned with it at the time as my mother died from breast cancer when I was 18 years old. \nSo I went to my Dr right away and had an ultrasound done. They said it was just a cyst and non cancerous, but because of my family history they think I should get an ultrasound recheck every 6 months just to keep an eye on it. \nSo I've been getting these ultrasounds twice a year for a couple of years, always the same result, until my last one, they found a new lump. The new lump though they assured me was also nothing to worry about\n, and to just come in, in another 6 months to have a recheck.\nMy question is... is an ultrasound enough? Should I be asking for a mammogram? or anything else? \nAny advice or opinions would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance =) ",
