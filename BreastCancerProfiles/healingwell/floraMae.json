    "Content": " Hello everyone! I'm new to this site and glad I found this. I've been always searching information about\n breast cancer because I'm worried about\n my being prone to the disease and also to my sisters since our mother and grandmother both died due to septic shock brought about\n by infection of breast cancer.\nIt's been years already when there are times that my breast is aching and I'm always trying to feel if there's a lump or whatever that would help me try to identify if what is it and some people who knows about\n our family history give me advice to do so because they say that most probably at least one of us would be having the same illness as our mother and grandmother because breast cancer is said to be hereditary.\nI just don't have any idea if my sisters experience it too.\nCan someone please give some information about\n it?\nAny words would be greatly appreciated..\nThank you very much and God bless you all!!
