      "Content": " You may have already had your biopsy already. So this may be too late. First of all, a birads 3 is 98% benign. A birads 4 is very broad but is on the average 80% benign. So a birads 3.5 (which doesn't exist) means your calcs are about\n 80 to 98% benign. A stereotactic biopsy is an outpatient core needle biopsy. You lay flat on your stomach with your breast hanging through an \nopening. A mammogram is done while youre lying down. The calcs are found and the info is sent to a computer. The computer tells the radiologist exactly where to go with the needle. \nThe limitation is that if the calcs are really deep or near your chest wall, that area may not be able to be localized with the compression paddle. Also, the core biopsy needle has to go through the calcs because the cutting chamber is along the side of the needle near the tip. If your breast tissue is too thin, the needle would have to go through the calcs, which means it may go through the other side of the breast and therefore, the metal compression paddle on the other side. So, this would be impossible to do. There are a few tricks to try to thicken the breast compression, but it doesn't always work. \nIf they can't do the stereotactic biopsy, you will have an option to either do a 6 month follow up mammogram or do a needle localization surgical excisional biopsy, depending on how suspicious the calcs look and how you feel about\n it. The needle loc is the traditional way they used to sample calcs before the stereo was invented. A needle and wire are placed through the calcs while you're in compression, and the surgeon uses the wire tip as a guide to surgically remove the lump around the needle tip and also the calcs. It's a fairly simple procedure but the surgeon has to make an incision and a larger lump is taken out which means more scarring. \nI hope your biopsy was benign. Good luck!! ",

      "Content": " I agree wholeheartedly with barkyboys comments. Good advice! I know several people who had a lumpectomy and refused radiation and had a recurrence after 2 years. Surgeons may not tell you this, but there is also a theoretical risk of local seeding with core needle biopsies and surgical excisions, and radiation will kill off any remaining cells. While there are exceptions (some non-invasive cancers (DCIS) and age), most lumpectomy patients will need radiation. Seeing that your mother had a sentinel node biopsy, it seems like she had either invasive cancer or high grade DCIS; so she probably will need radiation, unless she is advanced in age or generally unhealthy. \nRadiation can be pretty brutal and tiring, but is worth it in the end. The other option would be mastectomy without radiation. \nSince she only had 2 lymph nodes removed, I'm assuming they were negative. This is great news and shows great overall prognosis. \nGood luck.\n ",

      "Content": " When you say that they thought that the two were cysts, I'm assuming that this info is based on an ultrasound? If so, sometimes an ultrasound image may appear like a cyst but it turns out not to be. Also, when the surgeon said that they didn't turn out to be cysts, I'm not sure how she can tell without trying to puncture the cyst. In the operating room, you really can't be sure what something is. You can guess by looking at it and feeling it; but this is only a guess. \nIf indeed the two lesions are not cysts, they can be a whole list of things, most of which are benign. It can normal tissue, fibrocystic changes (hyperactive tissue), fibroadenoma, complex cyst (cyst with debris inside) etc. I would not worry at this point until the path is out. \nAlso, some doctors will call you on the phone with results; and some only tell you in person. This is strictly the surgeon's choice. \nGood luck. Don't worry too much. ",

      "Content": " Les, I'm assuming your sister has the typical invasive ductal type rather than DCIS(non-invasive type)?  1)  There are three main types of treatment for invasive breast cancer ):  Surgical excision, radiation, and chemotherapy/hormonal therapy.    Re:  Surgical Therapy.  Most people have a choice between 1) Mastectomy or 2) Lumpectomy with Radiation therapy.  If you opt for mastectomy, you generally do not need radiation, unless there is a possible chest wall, skin or adjacent structure or matted axillary lymph node involvement.  If you opt for lumpectomy (surgical excision of lump only with good margins), you definitely need radiation therapy for rest of the breast.  This is an absolute must because there is always a possibility that there may be a few cells around the original cancer site or elsewhere that can grow later to spread.  So you definitely need radiation to kill the few cells that generally can linger, even with great margins.  Studies have proven this.  I personally know two people who opted out of radiation and had a recurrence 2 and 3 years later. The decision whether you are a candidate for lumpectomy is mainly cosmetic and whether you can handle the many trips to radiation therapy.  If the tumor is too big and you can't get a decent cosmetic result with just a lumpectomy, the surgeon will not offer it.  There is no definite size criteria.  It may also depend on the size of the breast.  Also, if the tumor is big, sometimes the oncologist will offer neoadjuvant chemotherapy to shrink it down before lumpectomy like MK said.  Also, after trying lumpectomy, if the margins are not clear, and the surgeon tries for reexcision and the margins are still not clear, the surgeon will generally recommend mastectomy.  Also, radiation therapy requires multiple sessions monday through friday for 5 to 8 weeks (There is newer techniques to shorten this (brachytherapy)).  The second part to surgical therapy is the Sentinel Lymph Node surgery.  Either a radionuclide (Tc sulfur colloid) or blue dye (or both) is injected into the skin of the breast.  The idea is that the tracer or dye will go the first lymph node in the axilla.  The surgeon will take out only this lymph node (one or a few) and do a frozen section to see if the sentinel lymph node is positive.  If this is positive, the surgeon will go ahead and do a full axillary dissection (take out a bunch more, 10-12) mainly for staging purposes.  If it is negative, we're assuming that the rest are negative as well.  Re:  Radiation Therapy.  Required for lumpectomy.  (Sometimes not if pathology is non-invasive lower grade DCIS)  Generally not required after mastectomy except as above.  Sometimes if you have lots of positive axillary lymph nodes, and especially if they're matted (stuck together), the radiation oncologist may irradate the axilla regardless of mastectomy or lumpectomy.  Re:  Chemotherapy/hormonal therapy.  Most people are recommend hormonal therapy.  Tamoxifen for pre-menopausal women and Arimidex for post-menopausal women, especially if the cancer is ER/PR positive (estrogen, progesterone receptor positive).  The side effects are generally ok and most people should get this.  As for Chemotherapy, this is an option people should decide.  Chemo does prolong life, but you really have to weigh the pros and cons since it is pretty hard to take.  The marker used is her 2 neu.  Positive generally means the cancer is more receptive to chemo.  This should all be discussed the medial oncologist.  2)  Breast cancer aggressiveness like most cancers is measured in two ways.  Grade and Stage.      Grade:  There are Grades I, II, III.  This tells you how aggressive the type of tumor you have, III being the most aggresive.  Younger women generally have more aggressive cancers, and older women can have any aggressiveness.  However, this is not as important as Stage.       Stage:  There are 4 stages (true for most cancers).  Staging takes into account the T - tumor size, N - number of positive axillary lymph nodes, and M - presence of Mets.  To put it simply, Stage I:   small (<2cm) tumor with negative lymph nodes.   Stage II:   Either bigger tumor and/or positive axillary lymph nodes.   Stage III:   Either very large/chest wall involvement and/or multiple positive lymph nodes, matted together.   Stage IV:   spread to distant areas.   This is a very simplified version of staging.   The most important issue is whether you have positive lymph nodes.     I hope this information is useful.    Good luck Les,   Superbigmac   ",
