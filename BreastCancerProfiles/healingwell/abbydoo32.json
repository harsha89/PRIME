    "Content": " My sister had a double mastectomy a couple of years ago due to her breast cancer. Recently she had a fall on a tie out for a dog and broke a rib. When they were doing the bone scan, they found bone cancer. Is this related to the breast cancer? I know nothing of bone cancer but am a little familiar with the breast cancer (4 of my siblings have had mastectomy, single and double or lumpectomy) She goes next week for another test to be able to qualify things, but she is very scared. Is this related to the breast cancer? I did not see a forum for bone cancer for me to post, can someone point me in the right direction? \nKelly ",
