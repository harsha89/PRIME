    "Content": " Tomorrow I go to see the doc and get the results of my lumpectomy and lymph nodes. I am very nervous! I know that I will need radiation but will find out if I need chemo tomorrow. I have had a horrible day today full of depression and anxiety! I just don't want to do this anymore but I know that I have to and I am just being stupid! Any help or advice you can give will be greatly appreciated! ",
