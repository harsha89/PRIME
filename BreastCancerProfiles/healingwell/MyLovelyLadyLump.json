      "Content": " Hello,\nI am 30 years old and I went for a mammogram yesterday bc my left breast I thought was enlarging. My ob/gyn said he didnt feel any lumps but said if I have a cause for concern he would schedule a diagnostic mammogram just in case. And that most women have different sized breasts.\nI went yesterday. The squishing began. I went back in the holding area. The lady came back out and said we need one more film. Then I went back to the holding area. She then informed me I would be going in for a ultrasound next. I had a knock on the door and it was the radiologist and tech. \nHe continued to ask about\n my right breast about\n pain and soreness. Which I didnt really have any. He said my left side was fine. The reason why I went. But, my right breast he has found something in. At this point i'm pretty freaked bc I dont ever think with any test or procedure I ever had the place told me what is happening and not my doctor.\nWent for the ultrasound. Back in comes the radiologist. He says he has found a 2.5cm solid mass. I then go in and speak with a lady to make sure i am \"ok\" and understand the next steps and make an appointment for the surgeon consultation. \nSo Monday, I have my surgical consultation for my biopsy. I know he will go through my mammogram and ultrasound with me. \nIs there any questions I should ask? \nAlso how long is it typically to heal from a biopsy with an ultrasound?\nHow long does it take to get results?\nIf it is cancerous would they tell me on the phone or would they call me back in?\nI am a little freaked. And I know your not supposed to worry till they say you have something to worry about\n but thats not sticking in my brain lol.\nThank you in advance for any help ",

      "Content": " Thank you everyone :)\nI went back to go over my mammagram and ultrasound with the surgeon. He was very informative and showed me the tools they will be using and the titanium marker that will placed inside to mark the lump as biopsied if the results come back fine.\nI go for the biopsy july 6th (this Friday) and should have the results Tuesday. \nI got a copy of my mammagram and ultrasound and this is what it says. If anyone can give me feed back that would be great! Thanks again\nFindings: routine diagnostic mammography of both breasts followed by a limited right breast ultrasound examination were performed. CAD was used to assist with evaluation of this evaluation. Both breasts are moderately dense throught which can obscure underlying lesions. There is a 3.2cm oviod, smoothly marginated mass in the deep tissues of the right upper outer quadrant. There are no nodules or densities in either breast.
