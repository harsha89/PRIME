      "Content": " Hello,\nI am 30 years old and I went for a mammogram yesterday bc my left breast I thought was enlarging. My ob/gyn said he didnt feel any lumps but said if I have a cause for concern he would schedule a diagnostic mammogram just in case. And that most women have different sized breasts.\nI went yesterday. The squishing began. I went back in the holding area. The lady came back out and said we need one more film. Then I went back to the holding area. She then informed me I would be going in for a ultrasound next. I had a knock on the door and it was the radiologist and tech. \nHe continued to ask about\n my right breast about\n pain and soreness. Which I didnt really have any. He said my left side was fine. The reason why I went. But, my right breast he has found something in. At this point i'm pretty freaked bc I dont ever think with any test or procedure I ever had the place told me what is happening and not my doctor.\nWent for the ultrasound. Back in comes the radiologist. He says he has found a 2.5cm solid mass. I then go in and speak with a lady to make sure i am \"ok\" and understand the next steps and make an appointment for the surgeon consultation. \nSo Monday, I have my surgical consultation for my biopsy. I know he will go through my mammogram and ultrasound with me. \nIs there any questions I should ask? \nAlso how long is it typically to heal from a biopsy with an ultrasound?\nHow long does it take to get results?\nIf it is cancerous would they tell me on the phone or would they call me back in?\nI am a little freaked. And I know your not supposed to worry till they say you have something to worry about\n but thats not sticking in my brain lol.\nThank you in advance for any help ",
