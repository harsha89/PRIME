This research aims to further our understanding of how to best support people after they are diagnosed with cancer. The research is sponsored by the Humber NHS Foundation Trust and is being carried out as part of my training in Clinical Psychology at The University of Hull.\n \nI am looking for volunteers who would like to take part in this research! Taking part involves filling in an online questionnaire and should take no more than 15 minutes of your time. The more people that participate the clearer our understanding will be about\n the role of self-compassion in well being after cancer and therefore you participation would be greatly valued!\n \n-*-\nPlease write to the Administrator of HealingWell for permission to post this.
