      "Content": " Hello everyone,\nI had a radical hysterectomy 2 years ago. I was just put on Estrace cream for dryness and hot flashes. I suffered breast and nipple pain a few weeks ago due to overdosage. The doctor had me stop usage for one week and resume with one gram of the cream. \nMy question is how long can you take this cream? I am concerned about\n breast cancer. Does anyone know of more natural substitutes? \nThank you for any information you may have.\nMichelle ",
