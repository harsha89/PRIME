      "Content": " Hello,\nMy name is Pat and I have been a member of this forum for almost two years. I have prostate cancer (see my signature below). \n5 months ago my wife decided to cut out sugar from her diet and she has lost 30 lbs since then. As she lost the weight, she noticed a lump in her breast. The doctor looked at it and found a second one as well. Biopsy was yesterday and the doctor called today with the news - my wife has Invasive Ductile Carcinoma. \nThis is tough, we have been dealing with my cancer and now this. It easier (in my limited experience) to be the one with cancer than the spouse - I don't like her being sick.\nSurgeon calling tomorrow to set appointment for discussion. \nThanks for your support,\nPat\n55 years old, married 28 years, 2 adult children\nAge at diagnosis 53 (2012)\nPSA 3.6 2/09; 7.5 8/12; 6.1 9/12\nBiopsy 1/12 positive Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 11/2012\nNerve sparing Robotic prostatectomy - cancer spread to bladder\nremoved prostate and most of bladder 1/2013\nPathology Gleason 3 + 4 = 7\nPSA 4/13 <0.02; 7/13 <0.1; 10/13 <0.02; 2/14 <0.1; 5/14 <0.02\nNext PSA Scheduled 8/14 ",

      "Content": " Merrida,\nThanks for the response and support. So far the Dr has just said its IDC and the tumor is 2.4cm. Nothing about\n staging, or the other items you mentioned. Is that something they would know just from the biopsy or is that something they learn after surgery? We feel like pro's when it comes to prostate cancer, but this is all new to us. Any help is greatly appreciated.\nThanks again,\nPat\n55 years old, married 28 years, 2 adult children\nAge at diagnosis 53 (2012)\nPSA 3.6 2/09; 7.5 8/12; 6.1 9/12\nBiopsy 1/12 positive Gleason 3 + 3 = 6 11/2012\nNerve sparing Robotic prostatectomy - cancer spread to bladder\nremoved prostate and most of bladder 1/2013\nPathology Gleason 3 + 4 = 7\nPSA 4/13 <0.02; 7/13 <0.1; 10/13 <0.02; 2/14 <0.1; 5/14 <0.02\nNext PSA Scheduled 8/14 ",
