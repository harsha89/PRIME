      "Content": " Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone has heard of BSGI. It seems that with such soreness in your breasts, it would be a better alternative for you. It doesn't compress nearly as bad as a mammogram and it's more accurate, especially in dense breasted women. You should google it and let your doctor know about\n it. They may not know much about\n it. ",

      "Content": " If they think you should get a mammogram, ask them about\n BSGI instead. If you're already having pain, having a mammogram may really hurt. BSGI doesn't compress nearly as much. You can google it and see if it's something you would want to talk about\n with your doctor.\nHopefully, it's just any infection that a different antibiotic can fix. \nGood luck. ",
