    "Content": " I had a thorough breast check, biopsy and mammogram 8 months ago after getting an extremely painful left Breast with a large solid lump almost overnight. (The mammogram was delayed by 3 weeks because of the pain and swelling). I was clear and told I have very lumpy breasts and sometimes you just get unexplained pain or swelling. \nMy mum has had breast Cancer twice and my sister has just been given the all clear after treatment. \nI\u2019m 48 and probably starting menopause soon so I\u2019m very cautious. \n4 weeks ago I had surgery for a stomach problem and after a few days I was aware of a large \u2018triangular\u2019 lump almost half the size of my breast. I\u2019ve lost a stone in weight since my operation (to be expected). There\u2019s no pain to touch it but the opposite side of my breast looks like it\u2019s sunken. I can fit 3 fingers into the dent and If I press it, the flesh stays flattened and I even leave an imprint of my fingers. It can take about\n 10 seconds to plump up again. \nI don\u2019t want to waste my doctors time or get myself in a flap if this something to be expected with lumpy breasts so I just wondered if I should be concerned? If something were to develop would it have been picked up 8 months ago or can a problem occur since that time please? ",
