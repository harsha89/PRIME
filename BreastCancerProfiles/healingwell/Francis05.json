    "Content": " I was recently diagnosed with Abnormal Breast Calcifications, which required a Stereotactic Biopsy, as they were in clusters. The biopsy was done and the results came back benign, thank the Lord. It's difficult to not get anxious when they tell you that the results are abnormal, but have faith that everything will be OK. The biopsy was relatively pain free and the recovery was quick and painless. ",
