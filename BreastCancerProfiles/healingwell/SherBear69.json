    "Content": " Hello.. new to this site.. had an abnormal mammo recently that showed calcifications, had a stereotactic biopsy which showed atypical ductal hyperplasia.  Went on to have an excisional surgical biopsy and got the path report back today which showed Lobular Carcinoma in situ.  I'm told by the surgeon that it is not cancer, but a cancer marker and that I'm at high risk of developing breast cancer.  Anyone have this condition and/or knowledge about\n this?  I'm 41 years old., my mom had breast cancer at age 47 and again at 59.
