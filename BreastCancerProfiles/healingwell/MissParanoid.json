      "Content": " Hi all,\nI am 43, and went for my first mammogram ever last Thursday. Yesterday, I get a call saying that I had some calcifications, and they I was need to come back in for another mammogram. The radiologist said that I had a few clusters of microcalcifications and that he wanted the largest one to be biopsied. He said most likely they were benign, but recommended the biopsy to be sure. Today I had a core biopsy done. Overall, it was uncomfortable but manageable.\nAnyway, the test results don't come back fro 3-7 days. I can't stop crying. I know the chance of it being benign is like 75-80%, but I can't relax. I had a few clusters, not just one. Does anyone know if this is good or bad?\nAny insight or experience on the subject is appreciated :) ",
