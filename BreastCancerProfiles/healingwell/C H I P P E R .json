    "Content": " hello ladies, I too have been \"called back\" can't get in until a week from Thursday! ugh - but at any rate - I found last April what has made my life so much more enjoyable - a program called CHIP - Coronary Health Improvement Project - could just as easily be Cancer Health Improvement Project. I was having GERD, high cholestrol, high bp, high sugar - overweight (still am) but now down 30+ pounds and all those other things have disappeared! I too had hysto, gall bladder yada yada yada, I only wish I would have found this program soon. \nso now I'm 53 and called back, let's hope its for a pretzel or something. Thanks for listening. ",
