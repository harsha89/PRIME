      "Content": " I have started radiation and have 10 done.  I posted on here before that during the mapping process the ct scan showed some spots that looked like there might be some bone involvement (I have been treating for breast cancer). The bone scan was negative. The pet scan showed some spots but they did not react to the nuclear glucose.  The doctor said even though it is considered to be a negative test and nothing else showed that she still believes it is bone mets.???  She had someone who does biopsies look at it and they told her the spots were too small to needle biopsy.  I am in the process of going to another doctor.  I guess my question is has anyone ever had a doctor do this to them?  She makes me a nervous wreck.  I feel fine.  I have no pain and I would think she would be happy about\n that and instead of being relieved that the tests really didn't show anything it is like she is assuming the worst.  ",

      "Content": " I went to my new oncologist  and I learned more in the hour I spent with her than I did in the past few months with my old one.  I now know that I was not a stage 3 I was a 2 b also that the spots that were seen on my ct scan that did not show on the bone scan and did not light up on the pet scan are more than likely NOT bone mets due to the way my other tests came out.  Truth is even if it was it is something that can be controled maybe not cured but controled.  She told me to live my life and that we would keep a close eye on things but that I was through the rough part.  \n ",
