      "Content": " first, i'd like to say hello and thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this or to respond. i am a month away from my 40th birthday. a week ago i had routine mammograms (my last one was at age 35). 2 days laterÂ \"nurse cindy\" called and said that i needed to go to the hospital for a follow-up compression mammogram. i asked if something was found and she said \"all it says is focal density.\" well, i thoght that must be just a reference to my dense breast tissue. figured out online that it means theres something there. also \"it\" says more than focal density. recieved the paper in the mail to take to appt. and it says, \" left breast suspicious focal density subcollar region, increased in size.\" interesting since i didnt know there was anything there to increase in size. i have done regular self checks and never felt anything. after that call it took some time but i finally found a lump. it is to the left of the nipple and shape & size of almond. it is hard to find. i had to lay flat on my back with arm over head and \"trap\" it under my fingers. it is very movable. as far as history, i had 5 fibroadenomas removed at the age of 21. they also felt like almond shape and size. mother had modified radical mastectomy 8 years ago. she responded well to chemo and radiation and is fine now. anyone have similar experience? if i had known what focal density meant i would have scheduled the comp. mamm sooner than aug15th. cant help worrying. thank you for taking the time to read this and my prayers are with you all.\n \n ",

      "Content": " hi ms.kentucky! i am new here as well. the people here are very nice and give good advice! i am also in that limbo position between having had the mams and ultrasound but not yet had the biopsy. hopefully the biopsy will be in the next 2 weeks. i would do it tomorrow if the doctor called! my only words of wisdom are to quit the sticks! i quit smoking 8-9 years ago the day my mom was diagnosed with ibc. granted, i had been looking for that extra push to quit but wasnt expecting such a kick in the head as that. also, if you end up having any type of surgery involving anesthesia (and you havent quit smoking) be completely honest with the anesthesiologist about\n the amount you smoke. if you smoke a pack a day he needs to know that because it affects how they anesthetize you. at least thats what they told me when i had my first lumpectomy. quitting isnt easy. what works for one person wont work for the next. all we can do is keep trying. \n good luck!!! \n Ruthie ",
