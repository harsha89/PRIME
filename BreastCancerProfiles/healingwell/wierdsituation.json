      "Content": " This is a wierd one, I think. I'm in my early 60's and dound a lump beneath my right nipple in January. I just went in for a mamo yesterday and they followed that with ultrasound. Then recommended a biopsy.  All this after the doc told me I needed to lower my blood pressure. Nothing like a biopsy recommendation to help the blood pressure! I'm more than a little shaken up by this. // K ",

The doctor says that, for males, if it's positive they'll do a radical, and take everything. I don't mind the scar, I just want to get it over and done with. ",

      "Content": " Well the results, unfortunately, were positive. Small lump, definately a carcinoma. They'll be notifying me today of when to get blood work, etc and when to enter the hospital. I told the doc I'm ready right now. Just put me on the table and break out the knives. Hoping it's not too extensive. My wife has a cousin who was diagnosed stage IV 6 years ago and is still doing fine so that gives me some inspiration. I'm just going on with my Summer plans, outlining my vacation and everyting,as if none of this was going on. Won't let it screw up my life. ",

If it's positive, then I'll just have to get it out ASAP and start treatment and get on with life. I've got an awful lot to live for so I don't plan to let this get me down, no matter what the results. Plenty of others have gotten through this and so will I. ",

I just want it over and done with so I'm hoping he'll put me on the table and do it immediately. If he can test it then and there and finds it's cancer, then take out whatever he needs to take out immediately, and close me back up and tell me what kind of followup treatment I need.
