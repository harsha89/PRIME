    "Content": " This is my first time posting... I felt that I had to post this to hopefully reassure someone else who received one of those vague call back form letters for a second mammogram. I'm 42 and this was my third screening. On Dec 11, 2015, I had my annual mammogram. However, it was my first time getting it done at that particular imaging center because I moved from IL to TX earlier in the year.... I opted to get the new 3D version. I never received a phone call from my doc or the imaging center staff about\n the results. Ten days after my mammogram, I received the form letter in the mail saying that I had to have another mammogram and ultrasound because there was 'an area of concern' from my screening. I was terrified and angry that I would receive a letter versus getting a phone call. It was stressful to wait for the follow up (holidays were in between and I had family in town). So I just went back to get my additional screenings today (Jan 5, 2016). I almost cried several times while I was getting retested. The staff tried to reassure me that they didn't know anything yet...it was inconclusive...so I shouldn't get upset until the radiologist could confirm the results. I felt helpless. It was the longest 45 minutes of my life!!!\nTo make a long story short, all was clear!! They definitely saw 'something' on the screening mammogram (and showed me)...but it ended up being two small cysts with debris in the them (non palpable). \nMy mom was diagnosed with Stage 3C breast cancer (caused by hormone treatments) and fought it for 8 years....she lost her battle on May 18, 2010. Even though I had many thoughts about\n NOT going back to the follow up appt, I knew I had to because early detection is key!\n ",
