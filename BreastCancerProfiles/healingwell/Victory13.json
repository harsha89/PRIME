      "Content": " Hello Shelmagator.\nThank you so much for your post. I am trying hard not to think about\n it as you said and sometime it works other times not so much. I just hate the waiting. I hear you about\n removing the cyst or not. It's a complicated thing. I hope all works out the best for you. \nTake care. ",

      "Content": " Hello. I am knew here, have been lurking for a bit but after today I need some advice.\nAt a doctor's appt. about\n a month and a half ago my doctor informed me that a CT scan I had of my kidneys actually showed a mass on my left breast. So then I was sent for a mammogram which occurred 10 days ago. I have to travel to have both CT and mamm as I live in a small town.\nToday I was called to now have an ultrasound of my left breast. I have an appt. next week for that. So first the CT scan, then mamm and now told to have an ultrasound. I don't know what to think. Has anyone ever heard of having a CT scan done of another body part and something shows up in an area they weren't even looking at.\nI did have a benign tumor in the same breast 15 years ago. I had no symptoms then. I have had a rash on my chest area (both sides and onto the shoulders so I am hoping it is unrelated) for months that is very itchy which I did tell my doctor about\n when he first told me about\n the Ct scan. \nI am thinking if it this is serious would it take this long to work it all out. Any thoughts, advice would be so greatly appreciated. ",

Ten days later they sent me for an ultrasound, Now they are sending me for an MRI. All they have told me so far is there is something suspicious they want to check out. This has been going on since September, I am starting to worry. My breast does feel heavy and tender and the other day the nipple was yellow. ANyone have any thoughts on this situation or experienced anything similar.\nThanks so much, ",
