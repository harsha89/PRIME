    "Content": " about\n 1.5 years after taking Tamoxifen, I had a slightly elevated fasting blood glucose on an annual visit with my primary doctor. She wasn't concerned, but I was and started monitoring my blood sugar. It's always higher (and above the recommended 126) when I eat simple carbs. It concerns me. I did a little research on the Internet and do read there is a connection between diabetes and Tamoxifen. Has anyone else had this experience, and what did you do about\n it? I walk to/from work total 4 miles daily but sit most of the day at a computer. I changed my diet to low carb (most of the time) and smaller portions. I'm 5'6\" and in 2 years went from 132 to 120 with the exercise snd then the diet change so weight loss didn't improve anything. I could take an aromitase inhibitor, but I don't want the bone loss. I also had terrible joint pain with it. I've got about\n 2.5 more years to go taking something. Anyone with this issue Tamoxifen and Prediabetes? ",
