    "Content": " Hi everyone, I just turned 40 years old last week, went in for an exam today, and the doctor felt a 'thickness' in my left breast. she said it felt like a small \"squishy\" lump in one area. I have now been scheduled for an ultrasound/mammogram on friday morning, and am very distraught. I suffer from severe health anxieties having lost my father 10 years ago suddenly to pancreatic cancer. I am also a hospice patient support volunteer and have seen so many people die over the years. I feel distraught and can't function right now. I am wondering if anyone has any words of support to offer. I have a 3 year old and a 2 year old, want to be healthy for them. In 2007 a lump was detected and they did an MRI and the surgeon said it was nothing after looking at the results of the scan. Future exams resulted in nothing. I have been told in the past that my breast tissue is very 'dense'.   ",
