      "Content": " Some of my women friends on Facebook had posted just a color after their name in a post. My daughter told me that it's all about\n breast cancer awareness and remembering to do your monthly self exam or make a contribution to research. So if you are on facebook just post the color of the bra you are wearing after your name. Anyone of your women friends who knows the story will post her bra color by her name, too. Soon you'll have lots of lady friends asking what the whole color thing is about\n and we can spread the word. Even those of us who have had a close call or a loved one with breast cancer often forget to do our own check ups. If you want to let the guys in on the secret they have to post \"none\" after their name (unless they have a bra on!!! \n )\n~ Jeannie, Forum Moderator/Diabetes & Fibromyalgia\n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello, I'm Jeannie, Moderator on the Fibromyalgia Forum. I don't know if you've read the \"2005 Fundraising Drive: Help Support HealingWell\" post above but I would like to ask you to help out if you can. I'm not talking to the college students or the financially strapped people here. I'm speaking to the ones of us who can afford to eat out more than once a week and who have paid $60 a month cell phone bills without batting an eye. I own and administer to several domains and websites on the net. I know what bandwidth costs and I understand how much IT (internet technician) services can cost. What many people don't understand is that nothing on the internet is free. Someone must pay for it somewhere, either through advertising, fund raising or out of pocket. There is an initial cost for domain registration, domain hosting (the server who actually contains your website in their large computer), bandwidth cost, (the higher the traffic, the more the bandwidth cost), and ongoing administration of the domain and websites. The advertising will only help pay for the site as long as people click on the information and follow the links. If an advertiser sees that his site is not getting any attention from a certain site they will pull it and advertise elsewhere. Basically there is a shortfall in what is coming into HealingWell vs. how much it costs to keep it running. That is why it's necessary for Peter to ask for donations. He's trying to raise $2000 this year. If you feel that you can help out, please do. The post above explains how to do that. If you can't afford to give anything, that's ok, too. You can still click on an ad every now and then and follow the links. They only want you to read their info and give them a chance. That's why they advertise here. Thanks for your time.\n~ Jeannie\n\"As one goes through life one learns if you don't paddle your own canoe you don't move.\"\n -Katherine Hepburn\n ",
