      "Content": " I had chemo before surgery. One of the reasons was because the tumor was large - 6 cm. My oncologist wanted to try to shrink it before surgery with the hope that I could have a lumpectomy rather than a masectomy. He had a great explanation of the reasons behind surgery first. The thing that stuck out the most was that if the first type of chemo that we used didn't work we could keep trying until we found out what would work - hence if it ever came back we would KNOW which chemo would work on my particular cancer. This made so much more sense than the hit or miss approach of chemo after surgery. Later I attented a symposium in Houston with the head of the breast cancer group at MD Anderson. He stated that eventually chemo first approach would become the first line of treatment in cases where chemo was appropriate. He also said that by using chemo first in studies new advances would be fast tracked because they could be approved years earlier than is normal now. \nFor me, after two different types of chemo the tumor size didn't shrink and I wound up having the masectomy, however only a small portion of the remaining tumor had active cancer cells in it so it was considered a success.\nGood luck to your friend.

      "Content": " and I was the first in my clinic to receive the Neulasta shot. I also had chemo before surgery which was really new back then - it was because I had a 5 cm tumor. On my first Taxotere treatment I was in the hospital with low white counts and got the Neuprogen shots - horrible!!! On the second treatment I had low counts and had to give myself IV antibiotics - (gross!) and they gave me the Neulasta shot. The next visit with the onc, he told me that I had to quit chemo - due to \"quality of life\" issues. So I had the surgery, did rads and since my nodes were positive I got to do more Taxotere treatments. Now, knowing what I knew, I decided that yes, I could do this if that's what it took to get rid of it and have a good quality of life again. The onc also explained that all the research was in on Neulasta and promised that I would/could stay out of the hospital with those shots. Yes, it was awful, but only 2% have the really bad bone pain. I was the side effect queen on Taxotere - the pain was almost a relief from the other side effects. Since my onc was able to manage the pain, it was definitely doable and that's the whole point - we can do this! \nHugs,\nCathy\n ",

When my hair finally got long enough to curl, I burned my finger tip on the curling iron and didn't discover the blister for a couple of hours later - I mean I didn't feel it AT ALL. In that my middle name is Grace :) this had me pretty worried. My onc tested me for carpal tunnel which was negative. Then my B12 levels were checked - I guess low B12 can also cause the numbness. Then he prescribed Neurontin. I carried it around for about\n a month because the long list of side effects scared me. Finally, I started taking them and the change was so huge that I was in tears for about\n a week because I could feel things again. As a matter of fact I didn't realize that my toes had been numb until I could feel them again! This is something that you may want to ask your onc about\n.\nHugs,\nCathy\n ",

      "Content": " on Thanksgiving Day.  Don't know what to say - neither does mom.  My appt is on Wed morning - the cancer board says to be there early for a mammogram and sonogram and to take the films with me to see the doc later that day.  The truth is, that I am really scared and no one will acknowledge my feelings and understand how I feel right now.  They all want to change the subject the second that I walk into the room and have \"happy thoughts\"  so that I won't feel depressed.  All that I can think about is that this totally sucks!  Save the happy thoughts for later!  Just let me feel what I feel.  Tell Dh that I just want a pink boah for Christmas!\n \n \n ",

My personal philosophy is that we have to live for today - don't sweat the itty bitty small stuff because it really doesn't matter right now - take care of yourselves (for the first time) and get on with life - there is SO much to see! Thanks to all of you for being there for me!\nL & H\nCathy\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Kathy,\nI wear a prosthesis. I had Invasive ductile - 6 cm tumor with 7 positive lymph nodes. I had chemo, mas, rads and then more chemo. My surgeon had me wait until after rads to get the prosthesis. Until then I wore the soft ones. My rads doctor didn't want me to wear a bra until after rads were done because a bra could have caused more irritation. Since I worked through treatment, I had to figure out a way to look normal. The camisoles with the pockets were too expensive for my budget. I ended up wearing the tanks with the built in bras. I lucked out and hit a sale at Wal-Mart.\nInsurance pays for a new prosthesis every year along with a couple of bras. My doctor said that if I gain more than 15 pounds that I can also get a new prosthesis to avoid the lop sided look. When you do get your prescription be sure that you go somewhere that has the professional fitters.\nL & H,\nCathy\n ",

Sometimes we don't always agree - but we can agree to disagree.\nI think that the probelm lies into when we get away from our point. \nGirlfriend - can we talk breast cancer? Geesh! I hate that word - the big \"C\"! But somehow or other we are all linked by the Big \"C\" word and that's why we are here. Frankly, I don't care if you think that you have \"IT\" or your mother has \"IT\" or someone that you know has \"IT\" - if you need help getting through \"IT\" we are here for you NOW! oh, and forever in the future - or as long as we are here. That is what unites us - that is why we are HERE - or at least why I am here - - - how about the rest of you??? Tomorrow I would like to see a new roll call so that Babyseester knows and feels that we right there with her, holding her hand, a few angels flying above her . . . on and on - we are there to help her get through this experience and somehow or other we will do it together. (It's like having kids and grandkids - hurts sometimes doesn't it??)\nI am going to bed now and hope like crazy that some of you will come to your senses by then!\nLove (actually lots and lots of love) and hugs,\nCathy\n ",
