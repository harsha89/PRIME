      "Content": " Ladies,  I need some help.  12 years after my wife had her breast surgery she has developed lyphadema.    Her condition began 2  weeks after her doctor placed her on Flomax for a UTI.  This was six months ago.  I do not think this was a coincidence.  Has anyone else heard of anything like this?     Thank you and God bless all of you.  Steve ",
