      "Content": " My g.p. said that the etology report came back and said no cancer, he left on a voicemail on my phone but to still see the surgeon on the 24 th saturday. they both took me off work, havent worked since march 7. i asked the surgeon when i was leaving hospital can i go back {im a heavy equipment operator} work?..he said no not till you see me...and another thing. why would the mammo and ulter sound show a mass and the nipple inverted?...not be cancer?...even radiologist said to me it could be?....there is the cross cancer hospital 5 hrs away from me, but i have to get a referral. on the surgeons hospital discharge papers he put i had a i.d. abscess, i said why?..he said im putting that down but we know its not an abscess. after surgery he said he tried to get all the mass....i live in canada its hard to get your paper work from doctors. i feel theres more to it then that...he didnt stitch me up..he used no stitches .just these strips...if no infection then what?...if it was infection the meds would of taken care of it. im 47 im in ok health. im worried cause alot of doctors here are over loaded!!!..the surgeon i had , did about\n 15 surgeries that day alone. also they at first had it written to do surgery on my left boob not right..i pulled my gown up and showed them!!!!..that scared me. since surgery boob feels good. still a lump beside nipple, could be scar tissue not sure. feels different from the other one. like a lump but not as big as it was. my lump was under nipple almost felt like broccoli...that make sense?...im so glad i found this site..i need to express myself....i prepared myself for cancer......and my mom, we did research and stuff. we accepted it.... now?..what?....its very hard to get referrals from the doctors in my small town they get defensive, i can try.\n thanks ",
