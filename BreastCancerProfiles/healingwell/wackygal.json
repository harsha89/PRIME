It's good to be back here. I just passed the 7-year mark this past Feb, and can't believe it. Feeling good, no problems... knock on wood.\nKids are growing... my oldest will be in HIGH SCHOOL in August! (he was 6 when i was diagnosed). How time flies. I am doing work from home as a Technical Writer for a consultant in the Home Automation Industry (you know, those 'smart homes'). Learning all about\n new stuff, it's exciting.. and of course it still allows me to be here when that big yellow bus comes by and drops off my 3 munchkins. Ah life, so far so good.\nHugs to all,\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

But a small step in the right direction is worth something, I guess.....I keep hoping that when (I try to use the word 'if' but its still so hard!) I need it maybe more advancements will be made. And of course my hopes are high for Herceptin if I have to be on that again - I think thats what saved me so far.\nThe family is fine... oldest son just started 8th grade (we're year-round schools here in NC) and became a teenager in the same month! He still says he wants to find a cure for cancer. YIKES! And my daughter just started middle school too...6th grade... someone pass the defibrulator. She just asked us to go to the first school dance. I heard my parents voices in my head when I smiled and said 'NO' ! She's almost 11 and getting curvy... she's been mistaken for 15. (why is it that I am terrified to see her developing a chest?) My youngest just started 4th grade; he's 9. He was just turning 3 when I was diagnosed... my goal was to get him into kindergarten so at least my husband wouldn't have to worry about\n daycare expenses... how time flies.\nHow's married life Lori? Bev I'll have to check out that website!! I see pink everywhere now...let's hope it's funneling money to the smart research Drs so they can find how to MANAGE THIS DISEASE - I'll settle for that while we're working on the CURE!\nHugs,\nStef\n \n \n \n \n ",

I am glad the biopsy came out ok for the other breast. In regards to the operation, you just have to have faith that you are putting yourself in the Drs very capable hands, and by the time you start counting backwards in the OR room it'll be over. Its weird, when you have surgery you have no feeling like time has passed (like when you are asleep)... it seems like it happens in 1 second, and -poof- you are in the recovery room. I did have lymph nodea taken out (49) and 5 were positive, and I woke up with 4 drains... it was yucky but you just get thru it. Good luck, and we'll all be praying for you...

I had 4 drains, 2 on each side, and yes they came home with me, and honestly, they were not fun. Just becuase they were cumbersome...ie. i had to wear a robe with pockets to put them in, and when I took my robe off to go to the bathroom I had to put the drains in my pants pockets, etc. Here's a tip... TRUST ME she does NOT want to get them caught on a kitchen drawer knob, IT HURTS LIKE H*LL ! Those drains are stitched in and will not come out without them removing the stitch, so if you pull on them, it WILL hurt. so beware of that. besides having to empty them and measure the fluid 3x a day, they were ok, didn't hurt when i wasn't messing with them. ;-) I can remember the day I got the last one out though (about\n 4 weeks post-op) I was SOOOOOOOOOO HAPPY!!! I remember whining and complaining on the ivillage board quite a bit about\n it. ;-)\ngoos luck, and many hugs- Stefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

Ask your onc about\n that.... are the hot flashes bothering you all day? or just at night? Mine are mostly a few at night, and I *know* if i've had: spicy foods, caffeine, chocolate, or alcohol, I can expect them to be stronger that night. SO I try to avoid those things in the evenings when I can. They also say exercise can help reduce hot flashes... yadda yadda....so that might help too.\nhugs\nstef\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello Leah- You've gotten some wonderful advice already, and I just want to add my .02 as well... I had just turned 34 when I was dx, with three kids who at the time were 2 (almost 3), 4 and 6. I had a 4.5cm tumor, Stage IIB, er-/pr-, her2neo 3+++ and 5 of 49 nodes were positive. I was given a 50/50 chance to see 5 yrs! Chemo wasn't easy, but not as bad as I had thought it would be. Yes the hair fell out, well actually I zipped it off w/clippers before it fell out all over the place. I wore scarfs and pretty knit hats (wige were too hot, too itchy, and too expensive!), and I just told myself 'its temporary' about\n 10 times a day. I still went everywhere I usually went, Target, the mall, movies, etc. and maybe I just didn't notice, but people really did NOT stare at all. I just told the kids in a very matter-of-fact tone, 'yep mommy's hair fell out because of the medicine I am taking to make me all better, but it will grow back soon!'... they took it in stride and never questioned it after that. Ya just gotta get thru it, and tell yourself that soon it'll be over and your hair will be growing back and you'll start to feel better.....you just have to believe it... yes you'll have your down days, we all do... but keep that chin up, and come here and we'll help you... you can do it!! we're all in the same boat.... many hugs, Stefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

OUCH! i wore a lightweight comfortable robe with the drains in the pockets. you'll have to empty them and measure fluid a few times a day, thats a pain as well. but after 2-4 weeks you'll be rid of them, so just think of that! as many ladies on this board know, i whined and complained about\n my drains quite a bit! ;-) i did not have any reconstr. so i was up and around really quickly. i had staples instead of stiches, which i was not aware i had until i peeked under my dressings after i had gotten home and saw all this METAL! i was not prepared for that. gosh what else... oh yes the not hugging the kiddies rule, that one was very very difficult. but if you can get them to lay next to you in bed for a nap, that might suffice until you can hug them again. hang in there, we will be thinking of you and sending strong prayers on thursday.\nhugs\nstefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi all, question on follow-up appts... I just had my 6-month follow up... (I am 5.5 yrs out from dx).. they took bl00d ... I saw my onc (whom I love!) and we talked for a bit ( I had no problems to report) and she listened to my breathing, checked my scars and that was it.  I went home and a few days later realized I hadn't gotten my little card in the mail with my CA 27.29 numbers on it.  So I waited a few more days, and finally called... of course I have to talk to the onc's PA who is a bit gruff with me because of my history (hey I can't help it, I ask alot of questions!) and she knows I don't care for her.  ANYWAY she says she'll check into it, calls me back and tells me that my onc didnt order the CA27.29 because \"she doesn't run tumor markers for every visit\".  WHAT?!  what the heck am I there for then?  ok, no scans, I got over that one a couple years ago.... even though I would want a CT now and then, but they don't work that way (and many oncs dont)... but NO CA.27.29??!?!  I was floored.  Do you all get that done every 6 months?? I feel like I should call back and reschedule an appt to see the onc again, but I don't want to appear like the whiny patient..... suggestions? other experiences?\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

I was told my a friend who went thru chemo for hodchkins to use a baking soda toothpaste to avoid sores, and since I used Mentadent already, I didn't have to change my routine, but I can tell you I never had a mouth sore. Maybe gettting some of that tooth paste would help? or maybe gargling with baking soda and warm water? i sure hope it helps.... my prayers are with you!\nbig hugs\nstefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi dak - I am sure you'll get lots of good responses... but in a nutshell for me, I was tired on days 4-7 after a chemo treatment... make sure you get some good anti-nausea drugs, zofran worked best for me but some women like kytril. I continued to work part-time throughout chemo; it helped me to feel 'normal' and not like a patient 24-hrs a day... my hair started to fall out 2-3 weeks after my 1st AC treatment, and i didn't like that so i shaved it off and used duct tape (yes duct tape!) to remove the little hairs on my scalp. (you just lay it on your scalp gently, and the hairs come right up... none on the pillow, none on your clothes, i liked that better!) Never did wear a wig (too itchy, hot and expensive) but i loved the little cotton hats and i would wear a scarf around my head with the hat on top, and it looked great. no problems there. Just remember to rest when you want to! and don't be aggravated when, after a few hours rest, you might not wake up and feel totally refreshed. that's just how it is... you need to rest though, and let your body recover. don't forget to drink lots of water, especially right after chemo, to keep those drugs moving and out of your system. i was told baking soda toothpaste helps to avoid mouth sores, and wouldn't you know, i never did get one (and i used mentadent even before chemo). so i would recommend that. check with your onc on an iron supplement, and/or procrit shots to help keep your red blood cells up, that can help with fatigue too. andi had neupogen shots to keep the white blood cells from bottoming out. on the days your white counts are at their lowest (days 9-11 i believe?) you'll want to avoid places like theaters, crowds, the mall... anywhere where there are lots of germs. i usually stayed home for those days to avoid getting extra sick. of course, i wanted to go to the tim mcgraw concert because i had 2nd ROW SEATS but it fell on day 10 of a cycle and my onc highly recommended against it. ;-( so i stayed home.\ngosh, what else? be prepared for a few days where food tastes strange, or has no taste... or you have a metallic taste in your mouth.. thats just the chemo, it does go away after a few days.\nabove all, HANG IN THERE, and just think of all the cancer cells that are DYING with each treatment! you can do it, it seems like it'll never end, but then it does and it's just a memory. i was dx in feb. 2001 with a 4.5cm tumor, stage iiB, 5 of 49 lymph nodes positive, and (KNOCK KNOCK ON WOOD) i am still here.... you can do it too.\nBIG HUGS\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Grammy- I'll re-post some info on Herceptin.... I was dx in 2001 with Stage IIB, her2neu 3+++, very agressive (possibly inflammatory) bc.\nHerceptin has been around awhle, but only recently (1998) was approved by the FDA for use in metastatic breast cancer.... the trial that I had been in (and left) was being run by The Mayo Clinic, and I believe it was one of the largest ones, if not THE one they said they suspended because the results were so good....if you are her2neu positive your onc should absolutely, definitely already know about this drug! I had it in mid-2001 to mid-2002, and did NOT want to stop it, but my onc decided 1 year was adequate (it can produce heart problems). IF (KNOCK ON WOOD) mine ever comes back, I will definitely want to go back on it, and hopefully it would still have a positive effect. It is technically not a chemo, from what I understand. It's a mono-clonal antibody, which shuts down the overexpression of the her2neu protein and thus stops cancer cell growth. Thats why it does not have side effects like chemo (ie. nausea and hair loss). The one side effect is heart-related complications like weakening of the heart muscle, thus you have to have muga scans and/or echocardiagrams to make sure your heart is tolerating it ok. but if you do not take it with adriamycin, the heart problems are much less. Hope that makes sense.\nhang in there, we're all here with you.\nhugs- Stef\n \n \n \n \n ",

Just to know, to be on the safe side if it is nothing or to know for sure if it is cancer. There is an inflammatory support board http://www.ibcsupprt.org that you may want to visit, they may have more pictures for you to see, but only a Dr. can help you with a diagnosis. They can do a skin biopsy (it really doesn't hurt) to see if there are any cancer cells in the skin, and of course they can biopsy the lump(s). Chances are high that it is benign, so you just have to take the steps to get to the Dr. and see what's what.\ngood luck, and let us know how it goes.....we are all here for you either way!\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

(and, at 4.5 yrs with no recurrance so far, and originally a 4.5 cm tumor, I am thankful for each and every day!)\nthanks for posting it!\nHUGS\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Tammy-\nThe treatments are not as awful as people think, they should give you meds to control the nausea (zofran worked best for me, others like kytril) so you should NOT have any 'break thru nausea' (actually throwing up). I did work part-time throught chemo and rads, because it was a part of my routine that kept me feeling 'normal' and not like a cancer patient. The treatments are cumulative, meaning by the last one i was quite tired and feeling like a \nslug \n , but mentally you KNOW it's the last one, so that helps in getting over it more quickly. I had 3 rounds of AC and 3 rounds of FEC, then 4 rounds of taxotere, and herceptin (weekly infusions) for one year, so my chemo phase was longer than average. But you can do it too, just make the decision that you're going to get thru it... that they are giving you all these drugs to make you better, and the time will slide by. Then you'll be recovering, getting stronger, and knowing you got thru it.\ngood luck!\nmany hugs\nstefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

I am doing ok, I have been so overwhelmed lately... just with life....work....kids...hubby..laundry...etc.., but haven't even been on my pc much at all, which is NOT LIKE ME! I have been working 40 hrs per week (hello! i signed up for 30!) , cuz they fired the other webmaster and I am left with all this work til they find a new one!! I am also trying to launch a home-based business doing virtual tours for local businesses... it's a dream of mine to be self-employed, and I want to recruit others in other states who want a home-based business too, so I am putting together that idea as well, and that is taking just so much time. \nAND, it was Michael's 7th birthday yesterday, and I made him a homemade cake, (a green snake!) iced it and everything myself (and I am NOT the martha-stewart-type!!) but this came out pretty good (except dh saif it looked like a worm instead of a snake, ok so it was a chubby snake). At least michael loved it, which was the important thing!! You'd think it had won first prize the way he gushed over it to his other 7-yr-old friends. \n;-) \"cool\" \"awesome\"...ah it was a Mommy-moment! \nI am so saddened by news of Connie, and frustrated and sad about Denise's situation (thank god she is improving!) and I feel like there is so much I want to say to the newbies but I can never get more than 5 minutes at a time... I am wishing/hoping that you all choose myrtle beach for a future get-together but I guess the next one is ohio? I pretty much can only go if it's myrtle beach.....ssiiiggh, i'll wait for that to come around again!\nthanks for asking about me, i even forgot about my 6-month onc appt, which i THINK was last week... i have to call monday and see if i missed it.\njust too hectic lately... but in a good way... i pray every night for all of us; that it only gets better....i want that so bad for everyone on this board, not just myself, and lately reading about the challenges of everyones journey is just so painful (maybe it's the missing ovaries thats making me this way?) i dunno. it just cuts so deep... and i find myself overwhelmed by it all.\nhugs and more hugs!\nteary,\nStef\n \n \n \n \n ",

I would guess that would be too huge to download that way, can you call MicroSoft and get a free Cd for the update? \nYou should be running spyware (Spy Sweeper, Adware AND Spybot Search & Destroy all find different things), Anti-Virus weekly, and don't forget Scan Disk and Defragment (in Accessories --> System Tools). Do you have any weird programs that run during startup? If you do Start-->Run and type msconfig, and then choose tab Startup, you should go thru these programs with a Dell Representative... they will know what each program is, and whether you need it or not. Having unneccessary programs there bog down the pc the minute you start it up, because they load into RAM when the pc comes up.\nGood Luck, I've got to go right now, but let me know how things progress.... wishing you luck!!\nstEF\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Tamaralynn-\nBoy are you going to get lots of opinions on ports! I'll keep my story short (or try to). I didn't want one, no way no how. After 3 rounds of chemo and they couldn't tap my vein anymore they said 'oh we've blown your vein why don't you get a port'... I VERY RELUCTANTLY did, and even under the twilight anesthesia they said I kept asking the Dr. questions as he was putting it in (what an annoying patient I am ! heehee).\nAnyway, it was THE BEST thing I ever did. It took about 2 weeks to settle in (ie. not feel funny/sore anymore) after that I was fine. I would put emla cream over it with a bandage 1-hour before my appt. and I didn't even feel them stick me AT ALL. It was SO EASY. As a mattter of fact, I had it in 17 months but I had to have it out, against my wishes. I didn't get an infection, but where the tube tied into my jugular it was red, like a hickey mark, and my onc didn't like it....so since we were done with chemo (& Herceptin I had weekly for 1 year), we took it out. I miss it!! Now whenI go they have to Tap Tap Tap my arm for the one good vein, and then they can't hit it and they have to use the one on the back of my hand, and that one HURTS! And I still have the red hickey mark, which I have to cover up with DermaBlend cream everyday, go figure!\nSo I would vote YES on the port!! That;s my .02.....good luck with your decision.\nhugs,\nstefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

The only advice I can add to what's already been said is to really try to take one day at a time, not to worry TOO MUCH about the future (which is practically impossible when you're first diagnosed), and concentrate on being a good patient (ie. ASK questions! talk about options! different treatment plans!) and get an onc you have a great rapport with and trust. I can't tell you how many times my onc has looked at me and said \"you're gonna make it\".... that fuels me like no one else; she is my angel! Her hugs give me faith and strength. Find that in yourself, your family, and hold on tight. You are stronger than you ever imagined you could be, and this journey will prove it.\nHugs,\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

I had surgery on the 15th (hernia & ooph) and they wanted to put the cuff on my left arm, like 100 times! Even though the tech put a bracelet on me, no one looked at it, and I had to tell them every time. They ended up doing it on my IV arm but shutting the iv off so as not to blow the vein.

And your poor husband doesn't know what to do for you, yet probably feels guilty for thinking 'how will this affect me'? My husband tried to be SO POSITIVE that he really was in denial... you have to give him time to let it sink in, for both of you. Waiting is so tough, I had 5 weeks between dx and surgery, partly becuase my surgeon's mother died and the surgery was pushed out a week. I was at the end of my rope by the time surgery day came! Yours will come too, and make sure you cry when you need to, but just understand that somewhere inside of you there is a little seed of hope that you need to nourish too... spend some time each day telling yourself that you WILL fight this and win, and watch that seed grow. Today not so much maybe, but tomorrow or the day after.... until then, many hugs and wishes for strength and faith.\nhugs\nstefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

Also, I never wore a wig (too itchy and hot!) I had a couple really soft cute cloth hats and if you wrap your head in a pretty scarf and then put the hat on it looks pretty darn good.

I think the ethics and ramifications of using that information improperly, outweigh the benefits of me knowing if i am brca1 positive... so thats why in my letter i was careful to say that mine had 'characteristics consistent with brca1'. \nmake any sense? ;-)\nwe don't agree on much, do we??

You have every reason to be terrified, I remember my first few days here I thought everyone knew so much and I really didn't want to join this \"club\" at all!! But just take it day by day, cry when you need to, and try to get rest when you can, even if you tell yourself \"I am not going to think about this for 60 minutes\" and try to get thru that next hour.\nI remember saying I felt like I had taken a crash course in Breast Cancer 101. So much to learn, digest and absorb. Don't do it all in one day, or one week, and DON'T READ ANY SURVIVOR STATISTICS!  You are not a number, and statistics in books are old anyway....with all the new research and available in the last 5 years the numbers are improving.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

She agreed that my belly-button hernia has worsened over the last 6 months (which i had noticed, i've had the thing for 8 years) so we need to get that addressed via surgery...AND she supports me having the ovaries removed at the same time.... she agrees that it would eliminate the risk of ovarian cancer, which is an elevated risk because of the bc. \nI asked her about the taxmoxifen for er-/pr- and she looked up my numbers - I am 0% (yes 0!) er positive and 5% pr positive, and she said that the new threshold was around 10%, she thought. and she said she really wouldn't consider giving to to me since \"i was so far out from dx anyway\" (that was nice to hear!).\nso i see a surgeon on 11/2 and then i'll need to coordinate a laporoscopy with both the ob/gyn and the surgeon, that should be easy (tounge in cheek!). i'll probably get a date for surgery in february sometime. ugh.\nthanks for asking.... i am glad i am going forward with the ov. removal... something has just been botherine me about about and i want them out. i wouldn't be surprised if they find evidence of early ov. ca.... just a feeling i have been having....unexplained nausea, bloating feeling, just kind of blah around my ovulation time... and if not, oh well i don't need them anyways. that's how i feel!!\nthanks jessie!\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",

I would only feel mild to medium twinges of nausea and fatigue on days 4 thru 7, but I still worked part-time (helps keep your mind off thinking about cancer 24 hrs a day! lol) I will tell you that for me zofran worked much better than kytril (for nausea). Vicky is absolutely right, you should be getting anti-nausea meds during the chemo and that should prevent you from having any 'break thru nausea'(throwing up). \nThen I had 4 rounds of taxotere, that was much easier than a/c or fec... no nausea just some tingling in the beds of my nails and my toenails, I did however take glutamine (or is it glucosamine?? the amino acid... someone help me out here i can't remember) prior to taxtotere to help alleviate joint pain, and for me it did work well. ask your onc about it.\nI also had neupogen shots during the epirubicin cycles (to keep white blood count from bottoming out) and procrit shots during much of the chemo (red blood cells - helps with fatigue). also took iron pills as well, as prescribed by my onc. and i had herceptin weekly infusions for a year since i was strongly positive for her2neu.\nwhew ! i think thats it, its been awhile (since 2001) for me, so it's getting kinda fuzzy... like a bad dream!

I had a mastectomy, chemo (AC + FEC + taxotere) and also had Herceptin weekly for one year, which is for tumors that are strongly positive for the her2neu protein. Do you know if you are positive for that? I also had 33 rad treatments, and low-dose chemo during rads. I know how you feel about being \"left out\" of the whole Tamoxifen thing... it's hard to read encouraging articles and get half way thru and realize \"oh, thats for hormore positive cancers\". It can get very discouraging!! BUT there ar new for treating breast cancer being approved every day, and so we really have to stay hopeful. \nlet me know if there is anything i can try to help with...i too am struggling with the question of whether or not not have my ovaries out... i am meeting with my onc next week for my 6 month followup and will talk to her about it then... so far I had left them in because I was tired of being a 'patient' for so long and I needed a break from it all, but now I may be ready to take that step. we'll see.\ngood luck and please keep us posted on your situation!\nhugs\nStefanie\n \n \n \n \n ",
