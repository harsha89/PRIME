    "Content": " MMcKay\nI stumbled across this forum and found your post. I hear that you're freaking out and feeling helpless and need some questions answered. I also realized that you had your biopsy on December 2, 2011. I am curious about\n how things are now since your most recent post.\nIn response to your questions, I have a question for you. Have you done any research on LCIS and do you know that LCIS is NOT really cancer, despite the word carcinoma? It is just a noninvasive condition that increases the risk of developing BC in the future. In Situ (IS) means \"in its original place\". I would consider it the best cancer you can have because it doesn't or hasn't metastasized. (I had DCIS-turned Stage 1 in August 2010.) Treatment can be complicated because the condition is not cancerous. I seriously doubt radiation or chemo being necessary but yet the doctor would know after they determine the oncotype.\nTamoxifen is an estrogen blocker to prevent breast cancer recurrence, or reduce the risk of breast cancer in your case if your estrogen receptor is tested positive. I don't like the side effect of Tamoxifen neither. I never had belly fat. Now I do. People are constantly telling me I gain weight, like I don't know and not hurting from it. Anyhow, I still find it a blessing because at least I know for sure one cancer-causing factor is the estrogen. I can't tell you what your side effect will be because everyone responds differently. Losing hair is rare though. One thing for sure is Tamoxifen protects your bone. (Arimidex causes bone loss.) I know that because I was invited by my oncologist as a guest to speak in front of 130 2nd-year medical students at UCSF. Dr. L observed how I deal with and manage my cancer and want me to share my experience. The goal is to teach future doctors how to treat us. It was cancer block that week at UC and Dr. L allowed me to stay for her lecture.\nI am writing you coz I'm concerned about\n you especially when you said you're freaking out being alone and helpless. You need to understand \"it is what it is\". If you can't change the fact, least you can do is to adjust your attitude. Freaking out over uncertainty won't do your health any good. Believe it or not, I did say this in front of the med students: this cancer is one of the best thing that ever happened to me. It has made me look back to my life and allowed me to plan my future differently. I am a happier and better person. I have to leave this earth sooner or later like everyone else anyway. Now I aim for a meaningful and peaceful death. I did not break down once since the dx. (Long story short) I kinda had an idea that something unfavorable was coming my way. And there it was. If you understand the fact that the DNA in our cells mutate and affect normal cell growth and division. Nobody gives us cancer. Our body makes it. No one to blame. Once we come to term with it, we can move on. Never question \"why me\". It's not even important anymore. The most important issue is how you manage these cancer cells. I don't want to fight them. Fighting creates negative energy. I chose to befriend them. They are constant reminder to take better care of myself and value the remaining life span. I become an advocate.\nBelieve me, I'm not taking BC lightly or ignoring your fear. I'm sharing ways to cope and hopefully you can find peace within yourself during uncertain times. I, or we, would like to hear from you soon.\nA little bit about\n myself. I'm 53. Chinese. I went through the standard treatment except chemo. I lucked out. I graduated as a Medical Assistant this summer so I have some very basic medical knowledge. I also work as a medical interpreter at the hospital so I've involved in many cancer cases day in and day out. Just so you know I'm not shooting out gibberish. I'm single and alone in the city. No family support. I didn't even tell them. Yet I don't feel lonely. I have friends, good doctors and a commitment to help others.\nThis is the first time I join a forum to speak publicly. Please don't be offended if I don't sound compassionate enough to some. I feel for those who are suffering from more serious conditions. I'm only upbeat because I was given a chance to live a more meaningful life.\nAKay ",
