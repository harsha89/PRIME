      "Content": " Hi, I had a radial scar removed July 2012 and was surprised at the lack of information on the Internet. Post Op I felt fine and had the usual discomfort but it has lasted, it's now been almost 11 months. The discomfort is not daily but comes and goes and so does my mind worrying about\n what might happen one day. I can not find anywhere any information about\n realistic pain discomfort or follow-up. My surgeon (who is one of the best in Australia) told me that seeing that there is no specific risk factors that I don't need to worry about\n a check up for 2 years. I was told that too many mammograms might be harmful to the breast bone in the long rum. Anyone have an opinion or experience. Much appreciated! ",

      "Content": " Hi, I had a radial scar removed (benign) two years ago. The first six months no pain, then my ribs started hurting, I now have daily pain. The scar tissue is hard and painful. Sometimes I have a deep aching pain in my breast and sometimes a specific pain. At the moment my shoulders pains on and off. I've been to three doctors the last 18 months, all three told me patients and recovery differs and the last one told me I'm paranoid of getting BC. I struggling to find any info online in regards to radial scars and recovery after biopsy.\nIf anyone had a similar experience I would love to know.\nThanks\nCindy ",
