    "Content": " I am new to this forum and not sure if this subject has been covered in past posts. I teach pre-school and will soon be in treatment for breast cancer (lumpectomy or mastectomy -- not yet clear which). I've been out for appointments frequently over the past weeks, but will soon be hospitalized and out for convalescence for anywhere from one to several weeks. Any advice on how much and what to discuss with the children in my class (and their parents) would be appreciated. My colleagues have been very supportive and I would like to be as \nopen as possible with the school community without causing distress. ",
