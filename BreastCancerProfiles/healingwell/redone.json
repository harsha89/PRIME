    "Content": " Brian, \nMy mom went through this last year. We all kind of pulled together to help out as my dad is quite sick and needs care also. My 15 yr old son moved in with them for 3 months, he was awesome, gave up his summer to care for them. My best advice is to not let her worry about\n anything, make sure all her chores are done. There is nothing worse than feeling guilty because your work is piling up while you are trying to heal. Make sure someone prepares meals for her. I used to just cook extra when I made supper and then I'd run over the extra for mom and dad. Try to keep her spirits up, when my mom would start feeling down and starting talking about\n her having cancer I got scared, when talking about\n this to my family, my 12 yr old said...\"well mom, grammy doesn't have cancer anymore they took it out\" So he made her a poster that she put up next to her bed that said \" I don't have cancer anymore\". I think it helped keep her in the right frame of mind to heal.\nLots of love is the best medicine :)\nTake care\n-Red\n37 y/o female. \nDiagnosed in 2001\nCurrent meds: Entocort, Vitamin D & Calcium\nStarting Remicade on November 23, 2009\n ",
