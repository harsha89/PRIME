I was not saying this was my 3rd time with the same type of mass.\nI may be confusing you more sorry! :)\nTO GOD BE THE GLORY!!! ",

I had the stereotactic biopsy on the 18th, I got my results back today, they found a complex selerosing lesion that was benign. I do have to have surgery to have it removed and tested further to be sure it is totally benign, I have had two other benign masses removed from each of my breast. It is so much better to know, I am so glad you are having the biopsy and I hope you come back and let us know the outcome. God bless!!!\nTO GOD BE THE GLORY!!! ",

I can't wait to get it out and know for sure. Doc says it is a very rare thing to have, not a whole lot of info on fourms, most think that it is as it states (scaring) and do not realize that it looks like breast cancer on a screening but is really a lesion. The only way to know the difference for sure is a biopsy, my doc says the protocol is to remove them for further testing. \nI pray all turns out well for you.\n ",
