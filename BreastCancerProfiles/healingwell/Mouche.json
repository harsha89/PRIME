I had the stereotactic biopsy on the 18th, I got my results back today, they found a complex selerosing lesion that was benign. I do have to have surgery to have it removed and tested further to be sure it is totally benign, I have had two other benign masses removed from each of my breast. It is so much better to know, I am so glad you are having the biopsy and I hope you come back and let us know the outcome. God bless!!!\nTO GOD BE THE GLORY!!! ",

It is said to be rare and I was only asking if any on this fourm has ever had this and if so to share their info.\nThe latter of my post was me simply sharing what I have experience in the past, and that I believe that this new diagnoses of this lesion would be benign after it is removed and sent to pathology. I was not saying this was my 3rd time with the same type of mass.\nI may be confusing you more sorry! :)\nTO GOD BE THE GLORY!!! ",

      "Content": " Hi Majik1019, I do understand your post and what you are going through, I am going through the same, got my results yesterday for Radial Scar/Complex Selerosing Complex is another name for it.\nI am meeting with surgeon on May 2nd, it has to be removed and sent to pathology because cancer could be hiding in it or behind it. I can't wait to get it out and know for sure. Doc says it is a very rare thing to have, not a whole lot of info on fourms, most think that it is as it states (scaring) and do not realize that it looks like breast cancer on a screening but is really a lesion. The only way to know the difference for sure is a biopsy, my doc says the protocol is to remove them for further testing. \nI pray all turns out well for you.\n ",
