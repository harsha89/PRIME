      "Content": " I'm 25 and don't really have a strong history of breast cancer in my family. Although about\n 2 months ago a lump popped up in my right breast. It's VERY painful around my time of the month and usually tender any other time. It's a pretty large lump and I can see the swelling around menstruation. I'm very nervous and not sure I want to see the doctor. I've made an appointment 3 times and can't seem to drag myself. Maybe I'm\nBeing hypochondriact? \n \n ",

      "Content": " I'm glad to hear I'm not alone. I haven't seen a doctor yet though. I'm too nervous. I have a huge lump in my right breast and it's always tender but very painful around my \"time\" i can see the swelling when I am having my \"time\" I just don't know what to do. If there is nothing they can do what's the point of going to the doctor? ",
