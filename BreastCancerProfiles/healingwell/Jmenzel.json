It's VERY painful around my time of the month and usually tender any other time. It's a pretty large lump and I can see the swelling around menstruation. I'm very nervous and not sure I want to see the doctor. I've made an appointment 3 times and can't seem to drag myself. Maybe I'm\nBeing hypochondriact? \n \n ",
