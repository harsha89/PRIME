      "Content": " My heart goes out to you for having to go through this. I don't know what to tell you about\n being patient or screaming!! For myself, I would get into ANYONE to do the biopsy to find out for sure what it is, then make the decision (if needed) which surgeon and where to have any necessary surgery. This is just what I would do for myself, you need to decide what is best for you.\nAnother option - CALL CALL and then CALL that surgeon's office again until you get in.....Don't wait for them to call you. Don't be afraid to be proactive in your medical care!\nGood Luck! Rhoda ",
