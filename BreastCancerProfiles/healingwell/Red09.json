    "Content": " By accident I saw you posted in depression forum, so I felt the need to come in here and reply to your post.\nA close friend of mine recently has finished all her treatments, first it was Chemo, then the radiation (just finished afew weeks ago). I remember being with her in the first week after her first treatment, and she was so low, so depressed, scared, full of anxiety, not knowing anything. All I can tell you is, rely on EVERY source of strength in your life! Friends, family, people here, neighbours...Every person can serve a huge purpose in your life to help you through this rough time for you. \nIf you need to cry, cry. If you want to scream, scream! If you need to break a dish, do it! Allow yourself to go through the stages of this, but just know that YOU will make it through to the other side! I don't know you, but I have faith that your inner strength and your desire to FIGHT will takeover and get you through this! \nIf you haven't yet, definately get some CD's on relaxation, and meditation. Do deep breathing daily and find that special safe place in your mind you can go to....\nI'm sorry that you're going through this. My thoughts are with you and your whole family.\n ",
