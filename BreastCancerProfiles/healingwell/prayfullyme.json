      "Content": " My news was good.  My second  mammogram still showed a place on the right breast.  They did the sonogram and determined it to be tissue overlapping and said that to come back for another mammogram in a year.  The doctor did say that any medications  I  take, and I take a lot for the heart, the meds can cause changes in your breast tissue.  This has scared me so much that I don't even know if I'll go for another mammogram.  ",
