      "Content": " Hi Lauré:\nSo kind of you to respond, so long after my original post, I've decided to take a moment to update. There came a point when I had become completely frustrated with \"medicine\". I had been unable to find any doctor able to help other then with pain meds and nerve desensitization meds. I woke up one day and said to myself, that's it! I've had enough with doctors, appointments and bs! I had been seeing a doctor at UCLA that was from Tibet, he was involved in a research project attempting to show that traditional Tibetan methods worked, proving them with the assistance of Western methods---eegs, computers, etc. I continued to see him, until his project ended, but that was it. I went to a bookstore and bought a bunch of books. I had heard about\n Dr. Paul Pearsall, who believed that lots of good sex cured him of his fatal cancer. I decided he was possibly onto something and that was what was missing in my life. I set about\n to try to meet a willing 'victim'! I dated for awhile, and then finally met my boyfriend (we are still together). I have 4 sons and an ex-husband, but sadly and honestly, he was never good in that department and I never felt that I could say anything. Starting a new relationship and moving forward with my 'plan', meant I got to know him for awhile before becoming intimate, made a promise to myself to be forthright and honest, crossed my fingers and hoped for the best! Well, things went great from the start, and before long I went completely off all meds! Which is really quite shocking. I had lost some use of my left arm and I noticed this returning. I had been unable to go for walks without a cane---I walk my dogs 2, 3 times a day now, I never use my cane anymore. I could sleep in a bed again. After about\n a year, I noticed some of the pain worsening and I became worried. It had now been 2 years since my last MRI. I went to my endocrinologist to have my thyroid bloodwork done, and she insisted I have one and wrote the order. I went to UCLA, where all my previous MRIs had been done, for accuracy. \nThe tumors were gone. The radiologist referenced my most current 3 MRIs done there that had shown the tumors and the various changes between each MRI and noted that he could provide no explanation for their disappearance. My endocrinologist theorized that it is residual nerve damage that was causing the increase in pain and that I may always experience that or I may eventually overcome it. She talked me into restarting a couple of the nerve desensitization meds, at low doses. \nBy and large, I have been feeling really good. A few months ago I went to UCLA to see a different doctor I hadn't seen in a long time and I had forgotten that she didn't know about\n the tumors 'disappearing'. When she asked about\n them and told her they were gone, she refused to believe it. She left the room, came back with the Radiologist's report & a copy of the MRI and in a shocked voice said, \"They're gone. I can't believe it. I have to show this to my head of department.\" I was like, \"That's what I told you. They're gone. I can't believe you didn't believe me!\" \nMy ana's are still highly elevated and I am currently going through some skin cancer issues. I had melanoma a couple of times in the past, 15 years ago & 12 years ago, as well as 1 small squamous cell 13 years ago & a basal cell 4 years ago. A couple of months ago I had a marble shaped squamous cell tumor removed from the back of my head where it meets my neck, last month I had a more superficial sqamous cell patch removed from my scalp from where it had started to spread. I am now going through a topical chemotherapy treatment. I am awaiting the results of a biopsy of my left shin, which looks as if it could be another melanoma.\nSomeone else mentioned that their ana's went back to normal once they were cancer free. I wonder if this will be the case for me as well. I haven't always had elevated ana's. I wonder now, if I look through my chart, if my ana's have been down at the times when I had no cancers/tumors.\nThank you, Lauré, for your well wishes. I wish everyone else the best as well.\nd.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi gjt:\n1:80 is an elevated ana result, but it is not really high. Anything less than 1:40 is within normal range. From there, the figure doubles every time it increases (1:80, 1:160, 1:320, etc.) some studies have shown that a range of 1:40 or 1:80 is normal in an older individual. Oddly, when a person's spouse/partner has a condition that involves a positive ana, that person often times also experiences a mildly positive ana in the 1:40 to 1:80 range.\nI hope this information has been helpful,\nd.\n ",

      "Content": " Well, here's my story...it's a long one...so I'm goin to try to cut it down to the abridged version! \nI'd been told I had Lupus and Hashimoto's thyroiditis going back 13 years, but I honestly never really believed the Lupus diagnosis. My ana's were never remarkably high. 1:40. 1:80. In more recent years my excellent rheumatologist has theorized that all I've ever had was the hashimoto's. \nBreast cancer is heavily in my family. Including a great grandfather with a double mastectomy. I've already had 2 breast biopsies, melanoma 2x, basal cell and a very small squamous cell. I am also currently in the impossible situation currently of having tumors growing 'where they are not supposed to grow', and have not been able to find any doctor willing to oversee my care. I have at least 2 tumors embedded through the nerve roots where they meet the spinal cord on the left side at C7/T1 and T1/T2 and possibly a 3rd at C6/C7. There is a mass in the corresponding brachial plexus, which doesn't show up on a mammogram. The lymph nodes under my arm are swollen and tender. I have lost all reflexes in my left arm, function, strength, size and muscle tone. The outside body temp should be at minimum 95 degrees, my left arm is usually between 75 and 81 due to decreased blood flow. The only doctor that has even been attempting to coordinate any care has been my rheumatologist, who was recently shocked when my bloodwork showed my ana's were at 1:640. No one will even attempt to biopsy the tumors, but they do take up the enhancement. She can not explain the ana's because all other bloodwork appears normal and there doesn't appear to be any immune process going on.\nThen I entered high ana's and cancer into a google search and a bunch of papers came back. All stating that basically this is how researchers are trying to develop blood test screenings for cancer (breast and lung primarily) That people with an immune process with have ana's in a certain range, and people with cancer will have ana's in a high range which can thus make it useful for a 'blood test diagnosis'. This is what led me to think of asking if anyone of you had heard if you had high ana's.\nIf anyone has heard of an amazing neurosurgeon willing to operate or even consult with someone that has tumors 'in the wrong place', please let me know! I will travel and my insurance will pay for me too go anywhere!\nThanks,\nd. ",

      "Content": " I haven't been here for awhile, it is a bit odd to take a step or 2 back and reflect on how certain areas of one's health have now improved and others are a work in progress.\nI have a very strong family history of Cancer, including some personal history with melanoma, basal cell, (past) squamous (past) and I am currently undergoing several surgeries for squamous cell, as well as having had 2 previous breast biopsies of the left breast. The first I was told was precancerous, the second, totally benign. I have hashimoto's thyroiditis & lupus (or some other lupus-like auto-immune illness). I'm not really the basket case I appear in writing! (most days \n ) Anyway...about\n 10 days ago my left nipple started to itch insanely, the sensation is like that I have the urge to pinch-pull at it. It is only the nipple, only the left breast. It is also leaking a clear, watery fluid at times. I am supposed to have yearly mammos due to my history, but I am off schedule. The last one was so incredibly painful for my left breast I was laid up on the couch with my arm supported by pillows and taking Rx pain killers for 2 weeks...so I have procrastinated. I've now scheduled the appointment for this coming Friday. I've scheduled it at a different hospital that has the reputation for not causing as much pain after the exam and will go pick up my previous records tomorrow to take with me. \nI know I only have a couple of days to wait, but I am freaking out. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms? Is it possible this could be squamous cell of the breast/nipple? I've tried putting Rx steroid cream, it offered no relief. The urge to 'itch' feels deep, but very localized to the nipple. \nI haven't used any new soaps or detergents, wear a variety of bras and, I would think if it were somehow environmental it would affect both, not just one side. \nDoes anyone know---if this is some kind of cancer of the nipple, can mammography catch that? How effective is mammography? Both of my biopsies were insisted upon after a hands on examination, mammogram was skipped, I was sent straight to the surgeon.\nThank you all so much, be well...\nd.\n ",
