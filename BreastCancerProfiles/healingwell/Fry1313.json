    "Content": " Hey guys I am going through the same thing only thing is I'm 20 and the pea sized lump has grown to double the size. I have an ultrasound tomorrow and I'm beyond terrified. My mother had a cyst removed many many years ago and my cousin also had a benign cyst the size of a golf ball removed at 20. I'm worried that I might be the third times the charm girl ha! ",
