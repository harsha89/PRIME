I just wanted a bit of advise and info I guess. \nI went to see my doc last week as my left nipple has been leaking for a while now. I just put it down to hormones as I have PCOS. \nThe doc examined me and said that the tissue in my left felt different to the right and that she could also feel a hard area in the left too. I haddnt even thought to examine myself. So she decided to refer me to the hospital and do a blood test to check my hormones. \nI got a call yesterday to say my hormones are all normal and I have an appointment a week on monday.\nI did post this already but I want to ask if anyone else has experienced nipple discharge and found a lump and what the outcome was. I don't have any pain or itchiness or anything. \nThanks ",
