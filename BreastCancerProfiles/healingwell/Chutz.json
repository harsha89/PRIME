      "Content": " Since the Holidays we haven't had a forum chat on Thursdays but we're up and running again. So, Thursday at 6 PM Pacific time and 9 PM Eastern time come join us in the Chronic Pain chat room. The chat is for all people who have chronic pain no matter what the reason or cause. We most often just visit but if you would like to talk about\n a specific topic either bring it up during the chat or feel free to list it here or email it to me and I'll see that we talk about\n it. \nChat is more like an \nopen house...come when you like and leave when you must. People are usually there for about\n 2 hours or more so you needn't come right at the beginning.\nBelow are directions for those who are new to the chat rooms. I hope it helps...\nSee you there,\nChutz\nIf you are new and or are not sure how to get to the chat rooms here are the directions....\nTo get to the chat room you just click on the words/button CHAT or CHAT ROOMS. Both will take you to the same place. Where are those words/buttons? Above the Topics list where all of the discussions are listed is a button that says \"NEW TOPIC\". Going up some more are a line of words that read \n Forum Rules | Help Manual | Chat Rooms | Moderators | Volunteer\nYou can just click on the word Chat Rooms and there you are! Or you can go up one more line and come to a thin blue bar. On that bar, is:\n Log Off | Control Panel | Home | Calendar | Chat | Search | Members | Help\nJust click on the word CHAT and it also takes you to the chat room menu.\nOnce the pop-up Chat window \nopens go through the steps. From the drop down menu choose the Chronic Pain chat room. Once chosen you then do step #2 and log in. Then you will see the chat screen in that window. You just start typing in the small window at the bottom of the viewing area (where everyone's words show up) Below where you type is an option you can click on to view the Chat rules and help. \nIf you can't get the chat window to \nopen make sure you allow a pop-up for this particular site. If you have it blocked you will not be able to do chats. On Firefox/Mozilla browser it will tell me at the top of the screen that it's blocked and allow me to let this one place \nopen a pop-up. \nStart time is 6 PM Pacific Time and 9 PM Eastern time N. America. \nI hope this helps and we\u2019ll see you there....\n\"Knowledge is knowing that a tomato is a fruit, but Wisdom is knowing not to put it in a fruit salad.\" \n(\\_/)\n(o.o)\n(> <) Co-Moderator Fibromyalgia & Chronic Pain Forums \nFibromyalgia, PTSD, UC, Diabetic on insulin, collapsed disk, arthritis scattered around and a few other delights.\n ",
