      "Content": " I haven't gotten a response yet to my post last night.Has anyone had a recent ultrasound guided stereotactic breast biopsy for clustered posterior microcalcs? I would be interested in how it went and whether you are someone who is quite sensitive to pain ( I am)  Thank you in advance, I am so scared right now. I cant think of much else besides all the possibilities with both the procedure and the outcome.  ",

      "Content": " I am scheduled for a stereotactic ultrasound guided biopsy in 4 days and I am completely terrified. I just found out last Friday that my mammogram revealed clustered microcalcifications but I didn't really ask all the questions I should have in the moment.  I didn't ask for my BiRads number .I have family history. Would they give this to me? I should just get a copy of my radiology report....have many phone calls to make now that Ive digested this. I have read so many horror stories about\n these biopsies that I am considering searching for a facility that will do it under conscious sedation. We all have enough to worry about\n without worrying that it will be a terribly painful procedure. Anybody else do this under twilight sleep??",
