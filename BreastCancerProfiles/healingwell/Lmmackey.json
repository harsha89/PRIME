      "Content": " Gail...from http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA\nHow do people know if they should consider genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations?\nCurrently, there are no standard criteria for recommending or referring someone for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation testing.\nIn a family with a history of breast and/or ovarian cancer, it may be most informative to first test a family member who has breast or ovarian cancer. If that person is found to have a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, then other family members can be tested to see if they also have the mutation.\nRegardless, women who have a relative with a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation and women who appear to be at increased risk of breast and/or ovarian cancer because of their family history should consider genetic counseling to learn more about\n their potential risks and about\n BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic tests.\nThe likelihood of a harmful mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 is increased with certain familial patterns of cancer. These patterns include the following (15):\n * For women who are not of Ashke**** Jewish descent:\n o two first-degree relatives (mother, daughter, or sister) diagnosed with breast cancer, one of whom was diagnosed at age 50 or younger;\n o three or more first-degree or second-degree (grandmother or aunt) relatives diagnosed with breast cancer regardless of their age at diagnosis;\n o a combination of first- and second-degree relatives diagnosed with breast cancer and ovarian cancer (one cancer type per person);\n o a first-degree relative with cancer diagnosed in both breasts (bilateral breast cancer);\n o a combination of two or more first- or second-degree relatives diagnosed with ovarian cancer regardless of age at diagnosis;\n o a first- or second-degree relative diagnosed with both breast and ovarian cancer regardless of age at diagnosis; and\n o breast cancer diagnosed in a male relative.\n * For women of Ashke**** Jewish descent:\n o any first-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer; and\n o two second-degree relatives on the same side of the family diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer.\nThese family history patterns apply to about\n 2 percent of adult women in the general population. Women who have none of these family history patterns have a low probability of having a harmful BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\nYou also may want to check out this place: http://www.dnadirect.com/web/article/testing-for-genetic-disorders/breast-and-ovarian-cancer-risk/18/insurance-coverage\nBest of luck!!\nLauré\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Jpann,\nI was one of several women on the board who had the Oncotype DX test. I'm sure they'll write in soon. \nIt took 3-4 weeks for me to get the results. It was hard waiting, but my DX was much like yours, although my tumor was a bit smaller and the HER 2/neu was 2+ but was NEGATIVE with the FISH test. I think that would be something I would ask your Onc about\n - getting the HER test through FISH. It's more reliable.\nAnyway, my Oncotype score was 7 so chemo would only give me a 2% benefit. I already approached the cancer very aggressively with a bilateral mastectomy (after the initial biopsy, then a lumpectomy). During the lumpectomy it was discovered that the cancerous breast was filled with DCIS so a mastectomy was highly recommended. The samples for the Oncotype DX were not sent right away, as is the case with you. That's because a different doctor must order that test usually. The good news is that Aetna is now covering Oncotype DX for many, many women, and I anticipate other insurance companies will follow suit!\nWaiting is the hardest part. Know that even just 2 months of waiting, while it seems horribly long, won't change things foryou now. You have a very treatable cancer, and node negative is the best news you could hear! The cancer was removed from your breast with the lumpectomy, so any additional TX is precautionary at best. \nI was considered young at DX almost 2 years ago at 40, and still premenopausal. I chose to take monthly lupron injections to supress my ovaries so that I could take Arimidex (aromatase inhibitor). I did lots of research, and found this to be best for me and my family at this time. Eventually, I may have an oopherectomy to forgo the lupron, but right now this works for me. \nIf you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me directly, and the ladies on this board are filled with such wonderful advice, love, and support! I'm glad you found your way here!!!! Hang in there, and keep the faith!!!!\nL&H,\nLauré\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Jule,\nI don't really notice any side effects from the Lupron, aside from menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. Probably weight gain too, although that could be because I eat too much. At first I was getting the 6mg shot (I think it was that) but it didn't suppress my periods, so we went to 11.5mg which also didn't supress my periods, so now I'm taking monthly injections of the 22.5mg of Lupron and that has worked like a charm. The shot itself is a large shot put in the butt or hip muscle. Now my husband gives it to me to save me the trip to my onc which is an hour away. Sometimes I'm sore from the shot, but I find I'm less sore the way he gives it compared with how the nurses gave it. I see my onc every six months, unless something comes up. I've been on the Lupron for 20 months. It has to be given every 28 days. The first onc I had told me about\n Lupron but when it came down to still having my periods, he was pretty useless. I talked to my surgeon who referred me to this other onc who knows tons about\n Lupron and that's how things improved.\nI still am considering having an oopherectomy, but I think I'll wait and continue with this. It would be a quicker way, I suppose, and there are other women on the board who have had the surgery. I'm kind of a chicken when it comes to surgery. \nI understand your balloon analogy. Even with my score of 7 I had hoped for lower. Plus, all that waiting was really making me hyped up - kind of like when you play bingo or the lottery, but then you don't win the big prize. I think it's normal to feel a let down. Heck, I still worry that this pain or that pain means the big C has spread, but then my onc talks to me about\n the reality of my risk level. \nThe Lupron stops the ovaries from producing estrogen, then the Arimidex keeps the body cells from producing estrogen, so the menopausal side effects are probably a bit more than the average menopausal woman. Also, for some women, Arimidex has uncomfortable side effects (so does Tamoxifen and all other things). Let's face it, none of this is DESIRED, but it is NECESSARY. \nAnyway, I ramble. If you have any other questions, I'm here nearly every day and happy to help any way I can. BTW, what part of the country do you live in? I'm in NJ, although I think we might be moving back to VA this year. \nTake care,\nLauré\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

      "Content": " Hi senseless (sounds so wrong, but you didn't leave your name) \nI have a similar story without the ovary tumor - 2B, ER/PR+, Her2-, had a lumpectomy, didn't get it all and showed extensive DCIS, discussed my options and did not want radiation (long story), so ended up with bilateral mastectomy. I was 40 at dx so also premenopausal so I opted for chemically ablating my ovaries with Lupron so I could take an aromatase inhibitor. First it was Arimidex, but I did have lots of bone pain - mornings were horrible to get up and walk. So, we switched to Femara. I don't think the side effects were that bad on Femara, although I am off all treatment now. My oncologist thought I'd have better quality of life (less depression, mood swings, hot flashes) and she also wanted to see if I was in menopause. Nope. I know that I've read and heard that different people react differently to the various aromatase inhibitors, so my side effects might never effect you.\nHowever, since you have the history of ovarian tumors, and if it were me, I'd take out the other ovary just like the dr. suggests. I've moved so have had different oncologist, and they have all said (and I've done my own research and agree) that aromatase inhibitors have better odds and keep down recurrences with different and less worrisome side effects as tamoxifen. One doc did an online prognosticator while we were conferring and it was a clear 5% positive rate for non-recurrence with the AIs with my stats plugged in. However, AIs are only if you're ER/PR+, which not everyone is, so thankfully we have tamoxifen, too. \nBest of luck with your decision. Please come back often, if you can. The ladies here are wonderfully supportive. It's a club we wish we weren't part of, but are happy we have sister's in health.

He had Hodgkins when he was 19, then 24 years later a huge sarcoma shows up on his arm in the radiation field and he nearly lost his arm and his life with all of the additional chemo and radiation and blood clots. All this while we had an 18-month old! I nearly lost it. Then, when I was dx and had the initial consultation with the surgeon, radiation came up and I nearly begged him to just go and do the mastectomy. No, he said, you're young (39) and he was sure I had an easy cancer to remove. NOT - the cancer went from the nipple to the chest wall. Next surgeon (we moved states) asked me what I wanted, another lumpectomy or a mastectomy and I told her to remove both breasts. Guess what there, cancer in the other breast too! \nSo, my dear friend and sister in this mess, we can be called back to fight the battle even harder. Here, I'm just waiting for the last 6 months of radiation on my DH to claim another part of him. Plus, the harsh chemos he took have left him with some heart issues, although they are minor now. And he's only 47. Geesh!\nKnow that you are in my thoughts - today and every day I come to the board. And you too, Lori, with the repeated gifts from cancer. There is a lot coming out in the medical literature of 18-25 years post-radiation for cancer and it's effects. No surprises there, I guess. Just time we buy, I guess.

One thing I found out from Genomic Health is that the reason the test is considered experimental is because the \"powers that be\" haven't given it a medical code, so they have to bill the insurance companies without a \"real\" medical code. The insurance companies don't like that and so they deny the claim. If the medical board that assigns these codes would hurry up and assign the code, our insurance companies would be more willing to pay. This was verified in a conversation to my insurance company who told me they won't pay unless there is a \"real\" code. \nMaybe it is another entity we need to be pressuring. I just don't know who approves codes - the AMA? FDA? \nBut, I'm going to keep fighting to get it paid for. I was told prior to the test that I would need chemo, but the test proved I was not a good candidate for chemo.

You can reply to me directly if you prefer or to here. I'm at Lmmackey at good ole aol. com. What symptoms were you having? What tests did they do back then?\nIn any case, It's been several months of pain on the left side of the sternum, which was the side of my affected breast. The pain is daily and is fairly constant, but when I apply pressure to that side, the pain gets quite intolerable. I was dx and had the initial lumpectomy exactly 3 years ago today, followed by bilateral mastectomies in May 05. The sentinel node biopsy came back negative, although they only took one and two \"lit up\" from the isotope. Since the mastectomies (no reconstruction), the left side of my chest has continued to \"sink in\" and the right side remains normal. I am probably overreacting, and do plan on seeing the oncologist again. I've never had scans, no markers taken, really just physical exams. I am chemically induced into menopause and am on my 2nd aromatase inhibitor (femara now). I think the other concern is that I've been getting progressively more tired and seem to fade out every afternoon. I've begun to get every cold out there, and am on my second sinus infection of my life, all in the past few months. \nSo, I am so glad to hear this happened so long ago for you...well, not happy it happened, but happy you're doing well.

One thing to keep in mind is that worrying won't change anything. Prayer will help. Sometimes we feel better when we worry and picture the worst so that we prepare ourselves, all human nature. Perhaps it would be good to have a full heart-to-heart with your mother so that she knows how that you are capable of helping her emotionally and any other way if there is a new diagnosis, and she will confide in you like the friend it sounds like you are. Daughters are very important to mothers, and vice versa, so just keep listening and being there for her.

      "Content": " Hi Teresa,\nI'm sorry to hear about\n so much cancer in your family. You are wise to consider genetic testing. \nI was eligible for genetic testing because I was dx with bc at age 40, I'm now 42. While undergoing the testing, counseling is involved. The counselor talked about\n how if I were to test positive, she thought my insurance company would pay to have my children done. Perhaps your mother's insurance would cover you. However, given your history, I would see ifyou could meet with a genetic counselor at an oncologist's office and have him/her look into whether you would be eligible under your insurance plan. There are now laws that require genetic testing when a certain number of close relatives are involved and the insurance companies are required to pay.\nI wish you the best of luck! Be diligent about\n your mammograms, and keep in touch!!!\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

Feb. 05 I found out I had bc, had a lumpectomy which the pathology report showed invasive ductal carcinoma and also ductal carcinoma in situ. My surgeon explained that the DCIS had broken out in one place and had become the invasive part, but the rest of my breast happened to be filled with DCIS. There wasn't much possibility of getting all of the margins clean, and I had already made up my mind to have a mastectomy and chose to go bilateral. Never have regretted it at all!\nI was 40 at dx, highly er+ and pr+. Any questions, I'd be glad to answer. Remember, everyone's cancer is different, and we all choose and respond to treatments differently. My thoughts and prayers will be with you.

Too many young ladies have died and their families have suffered for lack of being taken seriously. I think this might have to be my next project! \nI for one was lucky to have been followed closely because I had bloody discharge from my nipple, even though I didn't feel a lump. I also lived in a very urbanized area with some of the best medical care nearby. This is America and all women (and children and men) should have access to the best medical tests/treatment at the right time (ie: before an issue arises). \nI just ran into a woman checker in my grocery store who was volunteering information that she couldn't go for a mammogram because she couldn't afford the price of the copay because she was paying so much in other medical bills at age 65. To me, this is not acceptable. Her feeling was that she had no BC history in her family, so it couldn't affect her. Even when I told her at 40 I was dx and NO ONE in my family had it, she still felt it was a genetic disease. Something must be done, and maybe that's what God has been showing me all along these last 16 months. Hmmm..\nThanks for letting me vent.

Although I wasn't really cancer free at that time, I really feel this is one of the milestones that mark my anniversaries (I know there'll be so many more!). In fact, this time last year was such a crazy time with DH already living in NJ while the boys and I were in VA. We were also getting ready to move in 8 days, selling one house and driving to NJ to buy another. \nI guess this was such a crazy time that I think it might always be my \"anniversary date.\" However, my double mastectomy wasn't until early May (the 6th), so I'll probably feel that as a very significant date, as well. It's just so hard to put into words how grateful I am to be able to go on each day. Today I had my monthly lupron shot and sat in the infusion waiting room and felt such gratitude for the things I DO have. \nI really appreciate all of you and your support over the last year.

And there are women on here who have had many, many positive lymph nodes and I'm sure they can and will write and tell you things are going well for them today. Remember, everyone responds differently and every cancer is different. So, good treatment is the next course of action for your MIL, as is plenty of rest and good nutrition.

Besides the problems that come with those bone conditions, I'm guessing it is nothing more serious. \nHere is a quick blurb I found: DEXA SCAN: An imaging procedure used to evaluate bone mineral density and evaluate the status of bone integrity as regards a diagnosis of oste\nopenia or osteoporosis. The DEXA may understate the true extent of abnormality by attributing unrelated conditions such as arthritis and vascular calcifications to normal bone density. \nI hope this helps. \nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Lynda,\nI'm glad you found support here, so you must have wireless or other means of connecting on the web. Please keep visiting! I'm 41 (was 40 at the time of surgery) and I had a double mastectomy in early May. I will have to tell you that, against many people's advice, I did outpatient surgery. Surgery was early afternoon and I left before 8pm and went home the same day. I took no narcotics (mostly because they make me very ill) but felt that Tylenol was enough. I was up and about\n the very next morning (even surprising my mom). I sat around all that day and rested, napped when I felt like it, and even the next day. The most painful part of the whole thing was the drains. For me, there were 4 tubes - 2 up the center of my chest and 2 more with one one each side of my ribs on the side. The rib ones were extremely painful. I cannot even begin to tell you how badly those hurt. I had no other serious pain except for the tubes over my ribs for the drains. I was able to move my arms fairly quickly, and had it not been for the drains, I would have been doing light exercises 4 or 5 days after surgery. BUT, I knew and highly recommend that you get rest to let your body heal. \nI was able to get my drains out (mostly by insistence) one week later. However, one side continued to fill with fluid, so 2 weeks later my surgeon aspirated fluid with a large needle that I didn't even feel. I'm glad that I pressed them to take out the drains. Arm movements were not too limited and I began exercises immediately after my drains were removed. Now, I'm not the most fit person in the world, carrying more than 60 extra pounds. I had a partial mastectomy in March (3/30) and then the bilateral on 5/9, and I feel it was quite easy to recover from! Way easier than gallbladder surgery and a c-section.\nIn any case, I hope this helps you. Everyone's experience is different, and our mindset always helps. I wish you the best and hope you'll keep in touch! My love goes out to you and your family!\nL&H,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

She finally got her wish - she died in January of a heroin overdose leaving behind her two children, never learning of my bc diagnosis. Thankfully, they were 19 and 18 and have turned out alright. \nSomeone else posted this and I agree because of all we went through. Get legal custody of the kids. My sister used her kids like pawns and would suddenly take them away and we couldn't see them for long stretches. She left them alone so many times, and they were finally pulled away and placed in foster care for 9 months and we had VERY limited contact with them then. We didn't have custody and she fought hard to get custody away from the father. Then she gave in and he ended up raising the kids. To his credit, he did a good job and was not a drug user (nor alcohol). \nI pray that your daughter does not have serious health issues going on, and that maybe she can get into some sort of counseling. My sister was very involved with AA and was ordered to jail and rehab many times. Always worked for a time. But then it would all start again. Addictions are so very, very hard to overcome and it's even harder to stay clean. \nMy heart goes out to you!\nL&H,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

He's from a large group of 8 oncos and one of them was \"the best in NJ\" last year. They're with the Carol G. Simon Cancer Center which is part of Morristown Hospital in NJ. Like you, I want to find out if I'll need chemo. I'm er+/pr+ and the HER2 by FISH was not applified. No lymph node involvement, and no lymphovascular invasion identified. I had a 1.0cm x 0.7cm invasive carc. removed with clean margins, but I have extensive DCIS. My surgeon who did the (rather large) lumpectomy recommends a simple mastectomy because of the DCIS. I want a bilateral since DCIS doesn't show up so much on mammos and I don't want to go through this again. \nThe onco yesterday recommends TAC which is a heavy duty chemo regimen. I do want to do everything possible to cure myself, but I want to be sure heavy duty chemo is going to help. I'm hoping the new oncologists will be able to order the Oncotype DX. That would be wonderful if your group would know anything about the group here. I'm also trying to find names of good surgeons here in Northern NJ. Do you think they might have any recommendations for that as well? My surgeon in VA didn't have any recommendations here in the area (we just moved on Friday/Saturday). I really appreciate your help!

      "Content": " Hello Ladies,\nI've been holding off on sending this email, but finally decided I'd send it. Over a month ago I found an enlarged lymph node on the cancer side, but thought that since I'd had one sentinel node removed, the surgeon had to be right and there was nothing else. I waited ... and waited. The node waited, too. Finally, I got an ultrasound and the node is larger than the \"comfort zone\" (more than 2.5cm) so I have to see my surgeon, and I've got an appt. tomorrow. I really hope and pray that this is a reaction to something else! I'm supposed to be early stage with NO node involvement and I don't want that to change! \nAlso, I'm dealing with finding out why the Lupron (which is supposed to shut off my ovaries so that I can take Arimidex) might not be working. I'm having my 3rd period in 3 months and I'm supposed to be \"in menopause.\" My GYN says my hormone levels indicate that I am in menopause, but I don't understand why I still have my period. And, she's really no help, and is so laid back that it's hard to even get any confidence in what she IS telling me! \nAnyway, I'm on a terrible roller coaster, and would definitely appreciate any words of wisdom you all might have! I think that if this lymph node needs to be biopsied, I'm going for surgery, not a needle biopsy, so that I can be absolutely sure. I'm also getting to the point that I think I'm going to go \"out of network\" from my insurance so that I can see someone at Sloan Kettering. Any of you gals from nearby care to recommend a great Sloan oncologist? I'd really appreciate it!\nThanks for letting me vent! \nL&H,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

Additionally, she said that it does not feel at all like a cancerous lymph node, plus with the size difference she is not too concerned at this time. I will go back in to see her and get another ultrasound in October. \nGeesh, did I feel like a huge weight was lifted off of me!!!!\nAs for the lupron and my periods, she's referred me to Dr. Michaelson at St. Barnabas, whom she says is very knowledgeable about\n lupron when used with women.

      "Content": " Mia and Julie,\nI'm 40 (until the 25th anyway) and I started on Arimidex last week (an aromatase inhibitor). BUT, because I AM still premenopausal, I have to take a shot (Lupron and there are others) to make my ovaries stop producing estrogen. I started this all 8 days ago. I'd be happy to share my experiences fully, but in general, the shot was a breeze. No pain at all, honestly! Most women do get one more period and I did (or am LOL). Of course, I'm decending directly into menopause (temporary as it may be) so I do have the mood/depression going on. In fact, I'm quite teary and depressed as we speak (or I write) but I guess that's not unlike pms or menopause. Otherwise, the extra advantage that Arimidex gives over Tamox. is WAY worth the extra discomfort. Mia - it gives us an extra 2% advantage. That's 2 more women out of 100 that won't have a recurrence in 10 years. You just have to be postmenopausal which can be accomplished with Lupron or surgery (Lupron is given by injection every 16 weeks). I chose the reversible method. \nL&H,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

I had gestational diabetes x2 and my second son was 10lbs 2oz. I was told then I had a high likelyhood of getting diabetes. Like you, MK, if I lost some weight, that would help. It's a catch 22, however, since even 15 mins gently on the treadmill causes palpitations and freak me out. Hopefully, this new cardiologist will be more aware of all of the issues going on with me and will be able to help!\nTake care, ladies.\nL&H,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

I agree that it's best to share them with at least one person, besides all of these wonderful ladies, that is near to you physically.

There are various stages of it and hers was quite severe with her left side of her mouth very noticibly weakened and drooping. But she told me about\n more milder forms. No treatment and over time it went away on it's own. With all of the new stress you have, it could very well be something like this.

My husband had Hodgkins Lymphoma and all the chemo and rads that went along with that when he was 19. 16 years later (9 years ago now) he was dx with a nerve sheath sarcoma on the back/side of his arm which was on the periphery of where all that radiation had gone way back when. So, more chemo, surgery and rads and he is now considered cured. We did find out during the sarcoma time that it is not uncommon for the earlier radiation to cause a secondary cancer. So, not to scare you, but please continue to demand great follow-up care. I'm so happy that you were treated successfully for your Hodgkins.

I know several of you ladies have diabetes, and it seems that each time I go, my glucose is high, just below a diabetes dx. Also, it seems that these episodes happen often after eating a meal (which was this morning, then after a late lunch more palps.). So, my question is does one with diabetes or prediabetes have heart palps sometmes after eating or just in general? \nI've been on meds for the arrythmia but still have it. Going to see a new cardiologist up here in NJ in 3 weeks, but may have to have a nuclear stress test next week. Never had one of those and I'll probably keel over right then and there. \nI just so tired of feeling ill! I'm 40 (for a few more weeks) and feel like I'm 102. Is this really what it's all about\n?

      "Content": " Interesting point, Frayda. I did a bit of research and here's an interesting article from JHU, presumably one of the better cancer centers:\n\"Johns Hopkins makes it the patient's choice to be an inpatient or outpatient for mastectomy surgery without reconstruction based on input from her surgeon. We are strong advocates that only hospitals who have developed comprehensive patient education programs which are conducted in advance of the patient's surgery should be performing mastectomies on an outpatient basis. We know from experience however that patients prefer going home the day of surgery 71% of the time and do very well. They score us high on patient satisfaction surveys and feel confident that they made the right choice in electing to have their surgery performed on an outpatient basis.\"\nI'm not having any reconstruction, and given the input from the doctor and the choices women in her care have made to go home, I still feel confident that I want to go home. It's going to be much easier than my gallbladder surgery, my c-section, and 25 hours of natural childbirth without any meds.\nThank you so much for your concern. I will have help. Both my mother and my husband, plus my kids are pretty good about taking care of themselves. The cats I hope will snuggle at my legs (well, only Roger ususally does) and that's a wonderful feeling.

She's fabulous, although her receptionist isn't. So, if you can work past that, I really do recommend her. I was having trouble finding a surgeon who would take my insurance, but she takes Aetna (which I have). She saw me relatively quickly, and scheduled my bilateral mastectomy one week later! Love her. Dr. Jan Huston. She has 4 offices. You can find out all of them at www.breastline.com. Her main number is 908-918-0001. She also works with another surgeon, but I haven't met her.\nI wish you the best of luck and please let us know how everything goes for you! \nHuggs,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

      "Content": " An excisional biopsy is one where the doc does remove the lump and some surrounding tissue. If the two lumps are close together, doc will probably remove both together with the surrounding tissue. Here is an excellent article discussing it: http://imaginis.com/breasthealth/biopsy/\nopen.asp\nIt is very much like a lumpectomy, which is what I had for my first surgery. I also had one lymph node taken. I also went home same day and went right to bed (mine was late in the day and I got home at 9pm). The next day I showered and felt good, although I was sore. I have two boys, 10 and 7, and I would not have wanted to be home alone with them because of all of the miscellaneous things that come along. Making lunch, for instance, since reaching etc. is difficult. Also, remember that you will be undergoing anesthesia and that is hard for your body to just instantly recover from. You'll need at least one full day of rest and doing nothing. If you can get help for several days, I would suggest it since your breast will be pretty tender. I was supposed to wear a bra for support and compression on the incision, and for 3 days I couldn't put it on myself. Other than the tenderness, I felt pretty good, had a good appetite, but really just wanted to relax. Listen to your body! What state do you live in?\nFeel free to ask anything else. Everyone here on the board has been through probably every bc experience and can offer loads of information.

I think calling your onc would be my first choice, since he's already aware of the back pain and can quickly order any scans needed. While your GP can help with general issues, I would think this, since it's concerning you as a bc issue, would be best dealt with with the \"heavy duty\" doc. Maybe just a phone call and a scan can be ordered for you to relieve your mind. Do remember that you were placed in a strange position daily for 7 weeks, so your back may just be recorrecting itself now. But, don't spend weeks worrying when you can get something done.

I spoke again with my surgeon about your concerns and they have never had one problem with my type of mastectomy and out-patient surgery. I am having a simple mastectomy without node disection (except for the sentinel node) and no muscle involvement. I've also done a tremendous amount of research about out-patient mastectomies and for women who are otherwise healthy, studies have actually proven recovery time to be approximately 11 days shorter for out-patient care vs. in-patient care. Believe it or not, there are more risks of infection while remaining in the hospital for every type of surgery. The ambulatory care center that I am attending has an entire set of surgical suites (7, my lucky number) and has an excellent record for outpatient surgeries. So, I appreciate your concerns and for helping me see I did make the right decision based on all of the research.

      "Content": " Hi Janis,\nWhile I don't live in NC, I thought I'd give you some more info. Here is the website for the Oncotype DX test: http://www.genomichealth.com/oncotype/default.aspx . Genomic Health is located in California so it doesn't matter where you live. They also claim to deal with your insurance company if there is any problem with reimbursement. They are reviewing my slides right now and I should have them within the week. It takes about 2 weeks to get any information on the slides. I brought the article (there are others if you just google \"oncotype dx\" ) and had no problem with my oncologist giving ME a written prescription and I contacted the pathology lab first thing the next day (my initial surgery was done in a different state).\nThis test does not have anything to do with Tamoxifen, although some literature says the results are based on women who will go on to have Tamoxifen. You do need to be stage 1 or II, node negative, estrogen receptor positive. I do meet these criteria but I will be inducing menopause to go on Arimidex (an aromatase inhibitor) that has been showing more promise than Tam. If the oncotype dx study shows a person would benefit taking chemo, then the chemo is done before Tam or the AIs. My oncologist explained it this way: the chemo durgs are looking for all the cancer cells, but the hormone treatments tend to bind or otherwise mask the cancer cells, so it is not as effective to do hormones first or concurrently. Makes sense!\nYou're right, there is so much to learn and find out. Write down every question you have so you won't feel like you've missed something. The doctors appreciate that - they want to be sure you feel confident in your choices, too!\nI hope I've helped you. I know that there are others on the board who have done the Oncotype DX study (Mia is one) and will be able to give you more information. I wish you luck in your decisions, and if you have any other questions, I'm happy to help, as are others here!\nL&H,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

He talked a bit about inducing menopause (I'm almost 41) so that he could use aromatase inhibitors to keep recurrence away. Has anyone heard of this or gone through this? He talked about taking out my ovaries or giving me an injection every 3 months which also shuts down the ovaries.\nI'm especially concerned about what then happens to the ovaries and other gyn. cancers happening along. I'd love to hear from anyone at all familiar with any of this! It's one thing to read about some of these things online or in books, but it's so very helpful to hear from someone who's gone through this. Last week it seemed we only had one choice and this week it seems like we have too many choices. I have no idea how to choose, where to start, and I just need some knowledge and moral support. Funny, though, my job is an information researcher, but I feel so overwhelmed now and I just don't know where to start and I'm finding it so hard to trust the medical professionals who I'm seeking out to basically save my life.

I chose outpatient surgery - I hate staying at hospitals with the IV still attached for so long. Anyway, if you've got a few minutes I'd love to hear about your experience.

She also has a website with great information: www.susanlovemd.org. \nOne thing that came to my mind in your posts was that you said the cancer was not yet removed, but that the fibroadenoma was removed. Are you sure about that? That's a large mass already removed and to have a cancer that is still in there means more surgery. I would also look into the pros and cons of a mastectomy. I'm 40 and will be undergoing a bilateral mastectomy next Friday. I had the option of more surgery to try to chase the margins, but besides the IDC, I have extensive DCIS. MY choice, MY decision to go for the mastectomy. I also chose bilateral because I am very large sized and want to balance things out and I don't want reconstruction. \nThe first few weeks are loke a roller coaster. In my case, getting all of the facts really helped me feel in control of an out-of-control situation. We're here to help in any way that we can. I hope you'll be able to get a copy of that book. It is now my BC bible.\nTake care and remember to do a few things that will take your mind off of the BC for at least a short while!\nHugs,\nLaure'\nThe finger of God touches your life when you make a friend.\n ----Mary Dawson Hughes---\n ",

Dr. took out an orange size chunk of my breast and got 2 small lumps within that orange margin. The sentinel node injection, while painful, did it's job and one node was very, very hot with radioactivity. That is the one they went for - sent it down to pathology, and it came back NEGATIVE!!!!! No other nodes were take, since they felt so good about how much uptake that one node did. I pray they are right!\nSo, I'll get full pathology results in 7-10 days when I go back in to see the surgeon before moving up to NJ.

      "Content": " Hi everyone. I just joined the group. Last friday I had a comprehensive mammo/US due to ongoing clear, yellow discharge in left breast. Dr. found a 1cmx1cmx1cm irregular hypechoic mass with a suspicious US appearance. Says it is highly suggestive of malignancy.\nCan they tell if it is BC just from the mammo/US?\nI am so scared about all of this, and I know you guys have all had these emotions and things. In 2001 the discharge was tested and I was told it could possibly be a papilloma but that nothing showed on films/US. I've also had a LARGE lymph note in the outside part of my breast not quite into my underarm all this time as well. Docs said it was just an enlarged node, not to worry. I have large, very dense breasts, so I hope nothing was ever missed!\nNow I'm worried because of the radiologists report, the large node, plus since having my non-working gallbladder out in 6/01, I've had pain in left quadrant that has increased and is sometimes in my back. Has anyone else encountered anything like this?\nAlso, assuming this is a new lump (it is small), could it metastasize or spread to the lymph system so quickly? Any help/advise would be great. My husband is out of town during the week as we're in the middle of a move after he was layed off in December. I have two wonderful sons, 10 & 7 and I can't even keep myself together anymore.\nSorry to ramble. \nLaure' in VA, soon to be upstate NJ. ",

Also have extensive DCIS extending from nipple to antinipple. Nodes negative. ER+/PR+ On 3/30 had a partial mastectomy (the size of an orange) removed in VA, but due to the extensive DCIS had mastectomy in NJ on 5/6/05. Chose bilateral mastectomy for prophalactic reasons, and some cells in the non-BC breast already showed changes. Definitely the right choice.\nTook the Oncotype DX test which showed very low score; therefore chemo was not indicated. Anti-estrogen therapy is indicated. Started Lupron 16wk injections on 5/26/05 to stop my ovarian production of estrogen. Also taking Arimidex daily to stop all other estrogen in my system.\n16wk injections of Lupron didn't work. Went to monthly double dose of Lupron and continuing with Arimidex.
