      "Content": " I found a lump at the top of my left breast about\n 4 weeks ago. I had an examination a couple of weeks ago and the doctor said it feels like a cyst and not to worry. She asked if I had any family history of breast cancer, which I don't, and she said to only go back if the lump grows or anything changes. The lump doesn't seem to have changed but I think I can feel a further lump not too far away from the first. I am planning on booking another appointment to have this checked. I wondered if anyone could advise whether I should push for a scan or not or whether cysts are easily identifiable by GPs from an examination. Also is there any particular type of scan that is best- a mammogram or an ultrasound? \nI'm 34 and otherwise heathy and the lump isn't painful and is about\n the size of a pea.\nAny advice is greatly appreciated xx ",
