      "Content": " Hello everyone. I started taken Tamoxifen beginning of 2013. My periods continued as normal for a few months, then they totally stopped, and i didnt see one for almost 6 maybe 7 months. I know this medication can put you into menopause, so i just figured that is what was going on. Last month i started bleeding, not just a normal period, but a very very heavy one, one that i was changing pads every 30 minutes or less, and bleeding all over myself. This lasted about\n 3 to 4 days and then i stopped. This month i started again and same thing, im flooding everything. Is this a normal function for being on tamoxifen or should i go see my doctor? anybody have this issue ,any suggestion will be helpful.\nThanks\nLisa ",
