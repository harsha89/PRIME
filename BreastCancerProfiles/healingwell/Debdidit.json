      "Content": " I was dx with early BC in 2013 plus a strong family history, but tested negative for the braccA test had a double masectomy and removal of a few lymph nodes, was told it looked all good. Over the past year + went through the reconstructive ordeal ( which is a whole other discussion) ,in Jan/Feb had some pre op test done for hernia repair follow up, was never told about\n any spots on my lung. So last week had to do pre-op test for more revisions ,was told about\n the nodule on my lung and that it had grown from 1 mm to 9 mm , did a ct scan, now am scheduled for a pet scan on Tuesday, so far this week has crawled slowly cause we all know the waiting is worse. My team of doctors are all thinking the same thing \" cancer\" One doc said maybe MET cancer, my breast surgeon says since we caught it early it could be regular old lung cancer since I am a former smoker. Now I sit here and all I can do is worry and have panic attacks ,making a bucket list laughing on the out side. But in reality I am scared out of my mind. Mad at my pcm because if I did not have the pre-op stuff done we would have never known that it had grown. At 9 mm it's small and early, but my fear is ...if it's smoking related, the outlook is much better, with the other option not so good. So my question is does any one here have MET cancer or know of someone and if you have any input on whether early BC could turn into Met ( can't spell the word right now) one breast was in situ (spelling) the other was \" early\" . Please, any reply would be great. On a semi- bright thought: Due to the many complications I have had my brother has declared me the poster child for \"if it can go wrong , it will: lol, and I hate this feeling , it's just not fair ",

      "Content": " Hope I say this right. In July of last year I was told I had non invasive ductal cancer. I was going to opt for other ways to deal with it until I found out family history which I had no knowledge of ...... Lots of cancer in my family I had 11 aunts one uncle. My own mom died early from cervical so we will never know , but out of the 11aunts 8of them had breast cancer or breast cancer related cancers and did research on cousins and there it was again a long history so I decided for a double mastectomy with reconstruct at same time. I was a previous smoker and quit about\n 3months before procedure. I had chosen the free flap. Well needless to say my operation was oct25 and here it is jan 2014 had one complication after the other plastic surgeon said it had never happened to him gonna try to make this short. My veins kept collapsing with each sew,he did what he could then because of dying skin 4 days was back in or this time they cut all the dead or dying skin away and cut the muscle from my back and brought them around only a portion of them died so cut that out. The breast area is healing nice but the dying skin across my belly from the tummy tuck from the free flap-just got worse so now I have been on a wound vac and although I am in still in a lot of pain it is healing there is still some dead skin that he clips off but it is very little. So now we are discussing skin grafts and expanders . I tried to keep it natural as possible thinking my body would be better off boy was I wrong. I don't know if it would have went better if I would have done the procedures separately but with all the complications, 2weeks in icu , kidney failure, and problems with my oxygen dropping maybe I should have just kept my cancerous boobs until it turned invasive cause at this point it just doesn't feel like its gonna get better ",

      "Content": " The skin graph healed nicely, still have pain in that area.no hernia thank God. Am scared and depressed.My surgeon was honest and told me that the exspanders often not sometimes but often get infected and if they did he would try antibiotics and if that failed he would remove them them and try again in 3 months and to keep in mind that the rate of infection is higher next time and then we would run out of options. I finally got into a counselor and she referred me to a doctor so hopefully Ican get some meds to help with the anxiety and depression but that's not until next month. It is causing trouble with my marriage, I don't think he knows how to touch me anymore and to be honest I don't know how he is supposed too. I look like a lumpy mattress.... now the ( I don't know the name for it) muscles from my back , up under my arms is swollen and sore I think from me sleeping on my side but I can't sleep on my tummy can't sleep on my back for awhile . I am always on the brink of an all out melt down and enough tears to fill a river. I try not to wallow in self pity but it is hard sometimes not to. Never really know what's gonna come out. Some one suggested a second opinion for the reconstruct, I have had women my age and older tell me I am too old to be worrying about\n having boobs \"your not looking to impress anyone\" way to go to them for making me feel better, and a few of these are survivors. How am I supposed to feel? ",

      "Content": " My double mastectomy part of the surgery went great no problems there it was the reconstruct that went bad and although I quit smoking a few months before the surgery I maybe should have done one surgery at a time giving my body more time to heal both from mastectomy and the damage smoking did to me . I am going in on the 18th to get a skin graph over my belly should be in and out and then one more week of this dang machine, am so tired of the wound vac even though I know it has helped in the healing. Then I will get exspanders later some one asked me if I regretted getting the mastectomy and I said no, they had already found a small area of cancer and I could have had a lumpectomy but but the numbers were not favorable that it would stay home, and this way,I am cancer free with 99.9% of staying that way and no chemo or radiation. I should have just waited a little longer for the reconstruct, but my pride and fear of being without breast for a long time was not something I wanted. It's been along haul and its not over yet, but being around for my grand babies is well worth my tatas lol ",
