    "Content": " I am 66 and very concerned my breast are quite large and I'm having intermittent pain some throbbing some sharp. I had my last mammogram four days ago and am sure I will get a phone call any minute for a comeback. I also just had three weeks of two ct scans and an mri because one of my doctors said I had an 8 cm mass on my ovary and a 2cm on my kidney. It took ten days after mri to tell me there is no cancer on ovary just large fibroids. still have the kidney to be operated on next week. I am so concerned about\n my breasts because of the discomfort. ",
