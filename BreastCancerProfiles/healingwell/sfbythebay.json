    "Content": " I am really in disbelief that I am posting here but here it goes. I went for a routine check up last Friday and told my doctor I had felt a little lump in my left breast, which I wasn't too concerned about\n as I'm so young and it doesn't hurt. She referred me to a breast cancer center right away and after the ultrasound, they have me scheduled for a biopsy on Monday. I have a pea-sized mass. I'm really scared, and pretty emotional at the moment. I probably shouldn't have started googling it as research tells me most malignant tumors don't hurt (like my lump). I'm terrified, my fiance and I are just starting out and getting married next year, excited about\n starting a family etc and I just can't help myself from thinking the worst. I'd appreciate any advice, stories, what to expect from the biopsy. ",
