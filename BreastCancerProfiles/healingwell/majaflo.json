    "Content": " I had bad pain in my left breast for almost 3 years myself. My breast started to deform some and I finally said something had to give. I had a mammogram and biopsy and it showed nothing but fatty tissue. The dang dr..messed up the test and I got a false reading. I really had a tumor the size of a silver dollar attached to my chest wall bone and was hard to find. I had a bilateral mastectomy and the dr was shocked It had not spread. You know your body...find someone that will listen. Remember some Drs are only there for the insurance money...find one that is in practice to help..not hurt. Best of wishes.. ",
