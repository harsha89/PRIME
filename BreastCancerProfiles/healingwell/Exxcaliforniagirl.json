      "Content": " I am 62 yrs old and have had regular mammograms for 15+ yrs. this year the report said a nodule was more prominent than on prior mammo. They did spot compression and that report said the nodule was present in all views and does not efface. I also had an ultrasound that showed nothing. Which has more weight. The mammo or the ultrasound? My grandmother and 2 aunts had breast cancer. Thanks for any input. ",
