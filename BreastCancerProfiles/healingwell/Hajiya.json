      "Content": " Hey, I'm 18 years old and Few months ago,my left breast got swollen and pained a little, I went to the doctor and she said it's because I'm on my period and it will stop .. It actually stopped then yesterday night, the nipple on that same left breast started itching ,and if I scratch,the nipple will go inwards like an inverted nipple and after a while it will cum out and continue itching. It finally stopped and when I woke up from sleep this morning, I felt a sharp pain in my left breast and then the pain reduced like after 5 minutes! Shoul I worry? And could this be a sign of breast cancer/ IBC? \n ",
