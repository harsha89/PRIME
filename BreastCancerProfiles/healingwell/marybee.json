I went back to him and told him I decided which one I wanted: \"the one that got the best chance of getting me better\". So he started me on weekly Taxol. Just had my 4th - 1/3 of the way thru. Started losing my hair last week, so went and got a buzz cut. Also bought a super cute wig and a couple of babushka type scarves. I can't stand going around without something on my head because it's drafty up there. I live in Clear Lake, TX, a suburb of Houston. I'm a very young 63. I just feel so much love for all of you. I imagine that you're younger than I am and have more to cope with; family, job, etc. I'm divorced, live alone with my pets, and am on long term disabililty from work. \nJust wanted to jump in and say HI. and thank you all for the replies I got from my \"no subject\". Not sure I know where that subject line is yet.\nMary ",
