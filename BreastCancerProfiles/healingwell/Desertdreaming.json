      "Content": " this past week my mom-in-law and my sister's sister-in-law were diagnosed with breast cancer.  Can you believe this crap?  My Mom-in-law is severly overweight.  300+ ... so surgery is out of the question since she has heart problems. She has known about this for a couple of months now but we just found out this past week.   She will not do chemo because she watched Tony's father die from leukemia.  So... not looking good.  She is going the Susan Somer's route.   All herbal products.  She is a Cherokee Indian and several medicine men are praying for her.  Hopefully the mass will shrink.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Have lived in Burbank, Hollywood Hills, Savannah, Cordova (Memphis), Scottsdale and now in Morrow (north of Cincinnati, south of Columbus - don't blink you will miss it)\nDiagnosed on 12/15/1999 at age 36 while first and only child was four months old. Apparently the cancer grew as my belly was growing. Double mastectomy done on 12/30/1999. Not the best way to welcome in the new year but thanks to the morphine drip I welcomed in the New year starting in New Zealand and ending with the US. No positive nodes but was stage IIB. Did 6 months of CMF. Did tamoxifin for 6 months and was put on arimidex for sanity's sake. Had ovaries removed in October of 2001 and reconstruction in October of 2000. ",
