My surgeon didn't even call me and the only thing I can think of is that they didn't find any high tumor marker readings and that's that. I see my regular doc next Saturday whom I trust completely. He has been my doc for 20 years and has never steered me wrong. I am going to discuss this with him at length and get all my reports. I'm tired of doing this already. I have a team of docs now for someone who doesn't have cancer. Jeez! After I meet with him I will do what he suggests. I use the what would you do if it was your wife routine. Some of these docs are just awful and they are left to practice medicine on unsuspecting people. She also kept me waiting 40 minutes in the waiting room and her staff didn't tell me she wasn't back from rounds at the hospital yet. If I saw her on the street I would spit at her!\n ",
