      "Content": " Thank you for your response. I go tomorrow to get a mammo and ultrasound done. I think I'll be taking a Xanax before going in. I thing the last time went I saw my images...I hope I can see them this time. My gyno is waiting for the results because I am due to have a different surgery in January. She said she might could get the results faster, like maybe as soon as Thursday.\nIf I get an abnormal result, what happens next? Can they tell me that over the phone, or do I have to come in to the office? And, what would that actually be able to tell fro the US and mammo? Just a mass, malignant, benign, or more info that that?\nSheesh, I have never looked so forward to getting squished before! (Not sure \"looking forward to\" is the right terminology for what I feel.)

      "Content": " Hi all,\n I am trying not to be too paranoid (but as you can probably imagine, I have scoured the 'net looking for info) here, but I found an odd shaped lump in the upper right part of my breast, more towards my armpit. The lump feels about\n 1 1/2\" by about\n 1/2\". Just south of the oblong feeling lump is a \"ditch\" under my skin that seems to go along the bottom edge of the lump. When I raise my arm above my head (standing), the ditch is visually noticeable, and when I lay down, you can just feel it.\n I am large busted, and have a history (mom and maternal grandmother) of breast cancer. My g-ma passed from it a few years ago. I had one mamo a few years ago that showed fibrous tissue that I never knew about\n or felt. This current lump does not hurt or move about\n. It is solid, as well. \n It's sort of ironic. I just had my yearly female exam, and am scheduled to have my annual mamo Tuesday. I had just remembered I had to cal my gyno to have them change the order to a \"screening\" instead of diagnostic, and happened to feel my breast unconsciously. I don't have to have them change the order now. \n Anyhow, I just wondered if anyone has any thoughts on my lump. ",
