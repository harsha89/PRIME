    "Content": " Have you looked in to MD Anderson Cancer Center? My stepdad is a cancer survivor. My mom researched & discovered that was the best place to go. They actually moved there for 3 months. I know it's an expense, but worth it for your life. It can't hurt to look in to it. \nI am so sorry you are feeling so bad. I will keep you in my thoughts & prayers. ",
