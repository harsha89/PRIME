      "Content": " Jo-Ann, I'm glad you had a happy Halloween with your kids. I know they looked just perfect. Also glad you decided to buy this year instead of making them, since it can be hard on the hands. Mine start to cramp, and I haven't had any strokes. I sew some, and had to make a purse for a project of my daughter. I know how the \"all niters\" can go. My prob was, that the first bag I made for her, the handle didn't stay like it should have and rolled the bag into a bloody mess. I had to do it all over again. All nite, since I was just told the evening before it was due. I'm sure you all had a good time, and keeping the box is a pretty good idea. lol Hopeyou have a good day\n ",

The meds i was given seem to have cleared most of it up. Thanks for the response, May God Bless\nDeb, I have some flexaril for the spasms, but, not working so well. However they seem to have eased up a bit. If it starts again, I will call and ask for something else. Seems like almost all my muscles cramp too. But the back is the worst. Thanks for the info, May God Bless\nDonna, I am glad that you are 14 mos. out of chemo. And hope you are feeling much better. The Taxol? Does it make you feel worse than the a/c? Cause that's what I will be on next, once a wk. I really do dread that every week thing.\nI can't imagine working in an elementary sch., but, you are right, lots of kids are more knowledgeable than adults. You know when you counts are down, they tell you to stay away from crowds, people w/ colds, etc. Now how do they expect us to do that, when we are always in a doc off. I had an app yes, and I think everyone was coughing and blowing their noses. I grabbed a bunch of Kleenexes and covered my nose and mouth, lol. Cause these people weren't even covering theirs. Any way, prayers to you, and May God Bless\n ",

I was in pre-op for the port when know it all was like a vampire bat. I do have a bland taste in my mouth, but, since I have only had my first treatment, I really don't know what to expect. I am feeling tired as well,and heartburn, but with the Crohn's and this , I expected that. I can't sleep tonite so i thought I would get up and see what you guys were up to. How far along are you in your treatments? I think I read it somewhere, but, I'm not sure. This is the first nite i have not been able to sleep, and i fell yesterday morning. OH BOY!!!!!!!! Don't need that. I got up to fast, i think. They have me on a lot of anti-nausea meds to keep the chemo sick down, and the throwing up from Crohn's as well. After 4 months of A/C, and Cytoxan, 3 wks apart, I start on Taxol and Herceptin, it appears, then i have 12 wks of radiation, 5 days a wk, then finish a year out with Herceptin. That's the way my calendar reads now anyway. I'm not so sure, cause my doc wasn't there my first app, as is the norm. You meet with a chemo nurse, who takes all your info, well goes over it with you, cause the doc has already seen me, then she takes it from there. I am doing it on an outpatient basis at the hosp. The nurse I had in chemo was very nice to me too, made sure i was warm, wanted anything to drink or eat, and even had lunch. However, hosp food for me isn't much on the appetizing side.LOL((((((HUGS)))))) back at ya, Carol ",

I take 6-MP, for the crohns, and pentasa, but, it comes thru whole cause of my digestive system. So for now I am drinking sprite, and sucking ice to try to get rid of this nasty taste in my mouth.

I also am having fis prob, but I think I will see if the chemo will through it for a loop first. It is not painful at the moment just irritating. And I don't understand why they don't just shut up and listen. This stuff if bad enough w/o a doc who wants to have an attitude. I am looking for my gi not to want to see me my next app either, cause i had to cancel the prev one on count of B/C, and the need for biopsies, then the mastectomy. There are lots of things that can pop up with Crohn's, and i have told them they have no idea. They get mad at me and try to tell me not to be the doc. I wish they could have it for just a little bit, but, they couldn't handle it. I too give them a hard time. \nAnd have told all nurses and docs that a Crohns patient did not make a good patient, i don't anyway. Cause personally, if i am hurting or what ever with this or the B/C, I want something NOW!!! not later, very impatient, and I don't take crap off them. And you sound like you wouldn't either. The port is very vital to my chemo treatment now, as they have already used all my veins. I must have slept on the wrong side last nite cause this am i have a very bad sore throat and the thing is hurting. I hate all of this. After all these years, I never thought I would be here, but, we never know what tomorrow holds. I am just not feeling up to par today.

This catalog has a lot of neat stuff in it. Check it out\nwww.tlccatalog.org\nI haven't been fitted for a bra or prosthesis yet either. I'm just trying to get thru one thing a time.

That is one of the side effects, and the bone pain is pretty bad as well. I defininately know that for now, the Crohns and the B/C is not mixing. I started throwing up Wed., but, there is a stomach virus going around at my daughters school, so that could have been it. \nWhen I find that Mrs. Grass soup, that's not in a feed bag, I will let you know. Something along that line is what I need. Keeping you in my prayers, May God Blesss.\n ",

      "Content": " Donna, sorry I haven't been on for a few days, bad days. I had my 2nd chemo yes. All bones and body parts on alert\n today. I think it was you that told me that this would ease up, and then it would be about\n time for another. I'm not sure. Well, i am up , hurting, you know the routine. (Man I can't type at all after I have these things, keep having to go back and fix things.) Hoping this is not the insomnia again. I did have a big bump of Decadron yes, so i guess i know what to expect.\nMy hair is falling out now, so i already have my wig washed, and i would say ready to go. But basically all i do is go to docs off. Its always back to back, it seems. Really puts a strain on an 'old clunker'. My daughter is taking the hair falling out worse than me, bless her heart. She says she's not used to me with no hair, I told her she wasn't used to me with one boob either, but, oops there it is. I mostly joke with her, when she sees me comb it. I usually keep it up in a clip, but, when you have to brush it, it is going to fall out. I don't know whether to cut it shorter or not just yet, I have all most shoulder length. Was thinkig less weight maybe it could hang on a bit longer. I have no idea.\nThat neupogen worked a number on me. Hopefully my #'s won't fall this time, and I can dodge that. Got a good count yes anyway, 11.6, I think she said. Long enough to get the treatment. Thank you for the prayers as I do you in mine.\n ",

However I had the same prob with being out sick, and knew I had to do something. This was later on down the line when the crohns got so bad though. I always wanted to stay as active as i could. The yo-yo crap would have to stop, and I think you did the right thing by the lawsuit mention. They do tend to get their butts in gear when they realize you aren't kidding. Oh yeah, I am still not sleeping,  Hope the best for you, \n ",

The bad part about\n my daughter's doll, was, early Sun morn, her's died. The teacher put old batteries in the one she had, it got cold here Sat morn, and when they got cold, 'he' expired. I mean this doll was anatomically correct, but, its still a good course to have. This was the class I used to call home-ec, we just didn't have babies, we cooked and sewed. \nLove and Prayers to all,\n ",
