      "Content": " Well, just from looking at ultrasound was told there are 2 fibroagenomas..I thought great!. Then asked how she (radiologist) could tell just by looking at them. She got devensive and abit stand offish. With my mother\u2019s history of Uterine cancer, skin cancer and metastatic breast cancer IDK if I should just say..ok, thanks see ya in a year..get a second opinion b/c the radiologist also said well, an ultrasound in 2008 showed something that almost looks like this..that was how many years ago??. I\u2019m now 54 and 7 yrs POST menopausal. I\u2019m really confused as to what to do. Yes, I know these are benign but they have 85/90% certatainty that these are Fibroadenomas..should I just what a year or have a biopsy done, which no was not offered at all. I just need some direction. I was taking this all in stride but when she was so non comital and dive dive when I asked how she could be 99% sure these were Fibroadenomas by just looking at them on an ultrasound. Sorry to go on so much but..not the appointment I expected. As I said I know these are benign but the radiologist is taking an educated guess and calling it a day. She told me they are trained to spot these things with no other testing. If I want other testing I have to pay for it myself b/c she is confidant in her diagnosis with just looking at the ultrasound. Maybe I should be too. If it wasn\u2019t for my mother\u2019s many cancers and the last one killing her..I just don\u2019t know ",

I\u2019am 54 now and have had ALL mammograms done at the same facility, over 20 yrs..well, I just had this years and it\u2019s abnormal. I am having an ultrasound tomorrow. I am 5 yrs POST menopausal, have no breast pain etc. just looking for advice I guess and the fact that my mom was close to my age when diagnosed is just letting my mind run wild. I know since they are only doing an ultrasound they are looking at what they think might be a cyst..right??? ",

If it were anything really concerning they would have wanted more than an ultrasound. I did a lot, maybe too much, reading yesterday and feel that it\u2019s just a formality. I\u2019ll let you know what they say!. Thanks again!!! ",
