    "Content": " I had a mammogram recently just because I'm 40. I have no family history of breast cancer I don't smoke or drink and am pretty healthy. So when I got the letter saying I needed to come back in for more imaging I was shocked. Ok so I call to get my appointment and they can't see me for 41 days! It's been 3 days now and I'm going crazy. Is it normal to have to wait so long? \n All my nurse told me was they saw a mass on the right breast. She said if they thought it was bad they would see me sooner so not to worry. Sorry that didn't help relieve any stress. In fact the word mass scares me. ",
