This is the first week I haven't cried every day and I think it is because my treatments are finally about\n to start--but the hair loss has to be the worst--I still can't bring myself to get the darn wig! But when I was with friends on Saturday something occurred to me. We were sitting in the sun (which I need)at a concert and it occurred to me that if I get a tan in my \"part,\" when I am bald, I will have a tan line down my head; also, I have a little bump on my head which has always been there. I have always wondered if it is a mole--now I will know. When I told my friend's husband these two things, he just started to laugh. Why not joke about\n it although I still think it is scary scary scary. I figured that at Halloween I would wear one of those colorful tinsel wigs to work and paint my nose red! But I am right with you----------Love and Hugs Sandy\nI hope I can have a sense of humor in a week when my treatments start................................................. I am scared ",

      "Content": " Leah - I am feeling better this week--in a better mood--I will be starting chemo next Wednesday (finally!) and I am trying to enjoy every last minute before I start. It sucks when you feel good and you know the onc will make you feel nasty! \nIt sounds as if we went through pretty much the same thing--first I was stage I, lymph node biopsy was negative, so we operate and I get radiation. Then I get operated on--find out 16 nodes were removed and 6 had cancer (Stage III), and that I had to get \"the works.\" Then the tests, and tests, and tests.........\nI have two grown children - my darling daughter is 24 and we are very close; this is tough on her and tougher on me because now I have to worry about\n her. She was married in 2004 and is no hurry to have children (darn!).\nMy son is 22 and was just married in May. He has one more semester of college left; his wife has her Masters and is teaching. They both go to the University of Pittsburgh and live in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. He wants to have a lot of children, but of course isn't settled yet. He also is a very religious boy and believe me, I need that at this time. His best friend (who is a young minister) is starting his own church and my son has been his right hand helper in this venture. \nI hate to tell you what my age is because I don't think I am \"old.\" But you probably will--I am 53, although I don't feel (or at least I didn't feel) like it. My mortality is scaring me now, though. I have never considered myself a strong person--or a tough person, although my friends say I am a tough egg. \nWhat is your family status? I hope we can help each other. Wasn't it ironic that both of us entered this at the same time? I will keep you posted on what happens.....\nOh, my mother is having an awful time with this (I can imagine, because if it were my daughter I would be beside myself), but sometimes she gets on my nerves - although I love her dearly......mother's do try to help!
