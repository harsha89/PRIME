      "Content": " Hello again Bev\nyes the Herceptin is going well thank you. I've now had No. 6. I get slight side effects - stiff legs, runny nose and intermittent sinus headache but apart from that it's no problem. In fact I quite like going as I still feel supported by seeing the staff at the chemo unit every time. The oncologist comes round to see us as well so I can ask any questions. - I know the triple negative people can feel a bit abandoned when their treatment finishes - and I'm glad to have this support for a bit longer.\nI'm also on Aromasin. I wasn't at all happy about\n taking Tamoxifen with HER2 positive cancer so my onc agreed to put me straight onto one of the AI's. They have made the hot flushes worse in that when they happen they are major sweats - literally pouring off me, but I've got them partly controlled with Effexor so I don't get as many as I used to and they are livable with.\nI look dreadful in a one piece swimsuit and have always worn bikinis. I think that once you get the pale wobbly bits in the middle nice and brown they look better! However, I'm being very careful in the sun this year - factor 30 sun cream - and I'm keeping my lopsided breasts and my affected arm well covered.\nLovely to hear from you\ntake care\nAnthi x ",

      "Content": " Hello. Rads is going fine thank you but it seems to take a big chunk out of each day - the journey is about\n an hour in each direction. Once I'm there though the staff are extremely nice and friendly and very professional. They're also very efficient and so far I haven't spent more than half an hour in the hospital. (After all those months of sitting around doing very little while I was on chemo I suddenly feel very busy again which is good. My students are also in the last stages of their exam preparation so that's keeping me busy as well).\nMy breast is looking quite pink and is a bit sore but I'm putting lots of aqueous cream on and am wearing only cotton next to my skin - I bought some Sloggi cotton crop tops which are blissfully comfortable. Today is the halfway point - I've had 9 rads out of the 18 - so it's going well.\nI had my first Herceptin a couple of weeks ago and that also went well. It was a long tedious day as they need to monitor you for 6 hours after the first infusion in case of side effects and I spent 8 hours in the hospital. I had no side effects while I was there. Since then I've had a few muscle and joint pains but nothing much apart from that. I think I'm still getting the chemo out of my system but I feel pretty well on the whole apart from not sleeping at all well.\nMy hair is continuing to grow but very slowly - I still have some bald patches where the regrowth hasn't started at all. I think I just need to be patient.\nBev how are you and how is your husband now?\nTake care everyone\nAnthi ",

The first couple of swims I had were a bit embarrassing as when I came out of the sea the bigger boob had fallen out of my bikini and was visible to everyone on the beach. After that I had a little check under water before getting out of the sea !

It was her own choice but she isn't settling down at all well and she's calling me several times every day (10 12 times daily) to complain. Plus there are calls from the home to report progress and calls from all her friends and neighbours each time they visit her ! It's been quite difficult to get much done over the past couple of weeks with this going on. \nYes I finished rads a couple of weeks ago. I was very red and sore at first and had a bad attack of prickly heat but it's gradually getting better. I'm still quite tired and if I sit down anywhere am quite likely to drop off to sleep. But I'm finding it very difficult to sleep at night !\nI've had my third Herceptin today - still getting stiff joints from that plus some headaches. And I've just started Aromasin but it's too early to know if I'm going to get side effects with that. \nIt's a great feeling to have finished the main part of my treatment.\nHow is everything going for you Bev?\nBest wishes everyone\nAnthi ",

      "Content": " Hello. \nYes thank you - it seems to take me a full week to get over one of these chemo sessions and this last time I really didn't feel able to do very much at all or even to go out of the house. Just taught a couple of classes and was very glad that the students came to me. Had some extra side effects this time round too - headaches, pains in my head and some quite sharp pains in my affected breast around the lumpectomy site.\nBut I'm fine again now and the cravings for fatty food have gone. I've got back to healthy eating now - I'm back on the fruit and veg - and I've started to exercise again. Trying not to put on too much weight. I'm starting to look like something out of a horror movie - not helped by my now almost total hair loss. I live in a top floor apartment and share a staircase with two neighbours. I now keep a little hat by my front door so that when I run downstairs to pick up mail or answer the door I can cover up and not frighten my neighbours ! \nI've been reading the posts about\n cold weather with a certain apprehension. Here in the UK we've got pleasantly mild weather but we usually get weather from the USA about\n a week after you so I fear it may be on its way across the Atlantic !\nBest wishes everyone and take care\nAnthi ",
