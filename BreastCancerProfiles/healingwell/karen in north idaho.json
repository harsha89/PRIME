      "Content": "    HAS ANYONE DEALT W/ A SEROMA??? On 7/6/06 I had a bilateral pedicle tram breast reconstruction. (included the removal of right breast w/ the left mastectomy 2 years out and radiation 1 year out)  I healed so quickly and nicely! However one week ago a seroma (pocket of fluid under skin) appeared just above my relocated belly button.  It is about\n 2 inches high and 6 inches long. I would guess it holds about\n a cup of fluid!  The ps said we will leave it alone and watch it... it is a good sign that it is soft.  I guess they can get hard from scar tissue.  Not much is none about\n seromas, but one small study found that about\n 40% of women get them after mastectomies! I felt it was due to my mismanagement of those darn drains! My abdomen drain ended up coming out earlier than the ps recommended! Tis what happens. I will see the ps again in a few days, but I'd just as soon leave the seroma alone then aspirate or drain it!  The study also said the seranomas went away in about\n two weeks whether they were aspirated as needed (ie daily)  or just left to reabsorb!  I will keep every one up to date!\n \n ",

You are going through more than I can imagine! \n \n One peice of advice that got me through chemo was to take ambien, because you won't feel sick if you are asleep... it worked for me especially for the hours right after I got chemo. I had nausea meds and they helped, but in retrospect I feel I would not have had so much trouble if I had not been so constipated!! I've had slow bowels even before BC! I still deal with nausea from my antidepressant, Effexor, and the nausea is worse if my bowels are full of crap!! I know the chemo nurses really stressed drinking lots of water to flush the chemo out... so why not get it out of the colon, too!\n There are other sleep aids, too, but ambien is the only one I have tried and it does not make me feel groggy the next morning!!! I still take ambien when I cannot sleep.(due to syptoms from the insomnia that is a result of bipolar type II depression)\n I have learned so much since my dx, but I do worry about\n a reoccurrence! However, I did read that there is percentage of stage 4 BC survivors that do go into remission! That gave me hope and I worry less now. I am only 34 and my son is 12... And I have 3 stepsons so I am planning on sticking around. I am glad you found this website, because these women are amazing!\n Karen in North Idaho ",

I was 1/2 way thru chemo when it was suggested I get a port. I was very week from chemo and I had stomach troubles due to the chemo!! Usually I do great with surgery because i am in my early thirties, but I was so weak that this surgery was just too much! Then accessing the port hurt me, but I found that needle sticks were very painful for me... I wonder if some people just have more nerve endings near the skin surface than others??? I did read that redheads felt more pain than others!!! It was some study!!!! I had the port removed after only about\n 4 weeks and the surgeon was so pissy with me, but I can be vey stubborn and there was no question in my mind so I was determined> the surgeon numbed the area around the port and took it out! I hope you have a good experience with whatever choice you make!

      "Content": " Chantry,\n A pedicle tram reconstruction uses the abdominal muscles for a blood supply. The loss of the muscles make it so you cannot do situps, so you have to roll to your side to get up when you are laying flat. One bonus for me has been that the muscles will support my cute little perky boobs and I believe I will never need to wear a bra!!! I am considering not doing the nipples and the darkening around the nipples so I can wear little white tank tops! However, the Diep reconstruction is a much better surgery because only the fat is used and no muscle. The DIEP, GAP, and SIEP reconstructions are microsurgery and I would have had to travel too far, so I settled for the TRAM reconstruction and I am very pleased with the results! Good luck on your choice! There is alot of info on the web about\n breast reconstructions. There are even some cool pictures of women's before and after surgery!! Bye Karen in north Idaho ",

Do you have that weird tight feeling around the belly button? Since i have always dealt with constipation it is oddly familiar so it does not bother me too much.\n I am bummed that my boobs are not very even. The surgeon had a bugger of a time with the radiated tissue on the left side so the left breast is smaller. The nurse said to give it time, but I can tell that later I will want something done to make them more symetrical. I hope the PS will agree, I will wait and see how everything settles!\n I am glad I did have an \"easy\" time. The surgeon said I healed in the top 5%. However, I was very high strung and I was really pissy when the nurse was going to switch pain medication w/out informing me!!!! So my behavior may have been in the bottom 5%!!! Stress brings out the fight or flight in all of us! (there were a few other issues I was a bit pissy about\n also!!)\n I seem to have hit a rut and am just staying the same, I am not standing any straighter than a week ago and it is buggy... I have had to made an effort to relax because the pain meds have caused me to so feel wired! I am done w/ them now, but the side effects are still here!\nMuscle relaxers help, and I have ambien to help me sleep at night. However, I am making sure I do not do too much!\n thanks for the post!!

      "Content": " thanks!\n I have been looking into the diep surgery and I would need to find out if radiation damaged the blood supply from the top of my chest, because I may not even be a canidate for diep. I will feel so retarded if I end up canceling the tram flap with Dr. Owsley! It is already scheduled for May 9th and I have had 3 visits with Dr. Owsley to ask my many, many questions. He is so nice and he basically will be doing this surgery pro bono because medicaid has such a low reimbursement! One office in Missoula, MT does diep breast reconstruction using Montana medicaid and they do it for charity!!! I really want to do this reconstruction, but it would really suck if the muscle loss in my abdomen ended up making it difficult to lift, carry, or move anything over 10lbs or 20lbs or even 30lbs! I think it will work out no matter which type I end up doing!!! I will make this decision and I will just apologize to this super nice surgeon if I cancel on him!! I so wish he would do the diep, but it involves microsurgery with a surgey microscope or something and he does not do micro surgery. Dr. Owsley did say there is considerable risk that the diep flaps will not take do to blood supply problems!? I just do not know enough and I do not think very many people do have alot of info on the diep surgery! (Maybe on the east coast, and in California, but not here in Idaho) good luck on your treatments! Ambien helped me survive!! Did they warn you that taxatere and taxol cause permanent nerve damage? Some people end having that prickly and itchy feeling in their hands and feet from the nerve damage... what can we do???? Also due to atypical bipolar type II (similar to manic/depressive, but the manic phase is so mild I just feel a bit hyper!) I have opted to not do tamoxifen because I could not find medication that would reduce the severity of the depressive phases I experience about\n twice a year! I get so bad that I lose the will to live...it is so sad and depression has been such a major challenge since I was itty bitty! I did not even know what was wrong with me until I was 28!!!! So very sad and I am so glad depression is coming out in the \nopen and also we are diagnosing it so much earlier! Shoot I am not going to proof read this so I apologize for any stupid errors! take care, Karen ",

I will see the surgeon soon, but I would love to hear personal stories because they are so much more informative!   Thanks.... Karen  ",

      "Content": " michelle,\n My mom was in remission! She was doing so good before she got esophigial cancer. That was caused from acid reflux and should never have gotten out of hand. I hope you feel healthier soon. Have you ever thought you might have depression on top of everything else? It causes alot of physical symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath! Anti-depressants can be very helpful in treating all types of depressions, plus there are natural remedies!! I better get off the net or my husband will think I've met some man on line!! just kidding, but good night from north Idaho! Karen ",
