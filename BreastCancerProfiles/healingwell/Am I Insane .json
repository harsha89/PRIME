    "Content": " Hi, this is my very first post. I am a huge hypo,but have experience with your particular situation. I have had several breast biopsy's and my mother had breast cancer fairly early in life...she is 80 years old now!!!! Anyways, I went to get a mamo because I was having soreness and the doc found a strange mass. I go to a place in Pittsburgh that does imaging and the radiologist read it immediately and do biopsy's right on the spot...gives you great piece of mind. Anyways, they did a biopsy on the strange mass and it came back as a pumped up lymph node....so, no big deal. I would get the second opinion and do a biopsy just for your piece of mind. I get swollen lymph nodes under my arm pit all of the time. I also have fibrocystic breasts and high anxiety-such a lovely combo....hope this helps...and try not to worry!! ",
