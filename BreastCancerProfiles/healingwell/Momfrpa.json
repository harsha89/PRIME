      "Content": " Well I had my biospy Wed. I am more than a little sore, they could only get to one of the calcifications because one was to deep to get to. I'm praying that the one they did get comes back ok if that be the case then they will just follow up with the other cluster with a mammo in 6 months.. God forbid it comes back bad, then they will get it when they go back in to remove the effected tissue.\nI have to wait till mid day tomorrow to hear from them.. this waiting is the hardest part.. They really didn't say much other than not being able to get it all so i'm taking that with a grain of salt. no news is good news..\nget back tomorrow with the verdict.\nLisa ",

      "Content": " Hello,\nI am new to this whole forum thingy, and I am in need of some advice. My family is trying to help me not to be worried and I love them for it. but I've had a Mammo every year for the past 10 years or so and nothing but not this time. There is a history of cancer both breast and other in my family. I got the call that something didn't look right. so I wait a week; a long, long week and go back for a miginified view. but unlike that last where they made me wait a week they told me on the spot. that the microcalcification that was in the first set of X-rays turned out to be two clusters instead of the one they first found. GREAT! now it's taken them a week and a half to schedule me for a bisopy. I guess depending on the area tells how long i'll have to wait on those results?\nI'm not good at waiting and I work at a relatively high stress level job. and worrying is not a good mix.\nbut if anyone out there can give me some peace of mind i'd greatly appreciate it.\nthanks\nLisa ",
