      "Content": " Thank you very much Alcie - I appreciate the advice greatly. The whole thing was a pretty big scare and I think I am probably still harboring some nervousness about\n it all, but it makes me feel a lot better to know that what I'm feeling is normal. Hopefully it will eventually improve; if not, I'll learn to live with it and be grateful of the outcome! ",

      "Content": " I had an excisional biopsy back in December and had a follow-up with my surgeon two weeks later. He said everything went fine and he completely removed the lump. I felt fine (except for the mild discomfort of healing from surgery) up until the past week or two where I've started having what feels like little tinges or pinches every once in awhile in the same area where the incision was made. I thought I felt a lump in the area but I'm wondering if it may be scar tissue - if anyone else has had an excisional biopsy I would sure be glad to hear of your recovery experience. \nDid you have any of these sensations I'm getting? Or should I be concerned and call my doctor to schedule another check-up in case there's a new lump (these twinges are kind of what I was feeling when I discovered the removed lump in the first place, along with nipple sensations/itches)...but it's only been three months, I don't know if its possible a new benign lump could have formed and started bothering me already in that same area and it seems a strange coincidence that it's right where the old incision is. I'm thinking it has something to do with healing from the surgery but as this was my first time I don't really know what to expect. Are the feelings normal, and will they go away with time? \nI also have lost a lot of nipple sensation since the biopsy 3 months ago and I'm not sure if this is normal and how long it should take to return. The skin responds to cold and to touch but I just don't really feel anything.\nAny info you could share about\n excisional biopsy recovery and what to really expect would be much appreciated. :) ",
