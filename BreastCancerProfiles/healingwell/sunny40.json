      "Content": " Thanks Sher! Very helpful to hear this. Feeling better about\n the whole thing hearing from a few people that it isn't causing pain or other problems. It seems like the smarter way to go for the most part but counterintuitive at the same time. A piece of metal in delicate breast tissue\u2026 I'm sure an immune response and inflammation occur but I suppose it all settles down and heals up. ",
