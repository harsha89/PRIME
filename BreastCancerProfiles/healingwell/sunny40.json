      "Content": " Thanks Sher! Very helpful to hear this. Feeling better about\n the whole thing hearing from a few people that it isn't causing pain or other problems. It seems like the smarter way to go for the most part but counterintuitive at the same time. A piece of metal in delicate breast tissue\u2026 I'm sure an immune response and inflammation occur but I suppose it all settles down and heals up. ",

If you don't mind my asking, when you had the biopsy, did you end up with a breast marker clip? If so, is it painful or can you feel it?\nGetting a biopsy soon, also for a 7mm mass and I am not excited about\n the marker clip\u2026 ",
