She was diagnosed on 9/11, said she watched it unfold from her hospital bed...such a sad loss for us all, especially Kalia. It makes me cry to think of the care she put into planning for her daughter's future, I can't imagine the courage it took to do that. \nI hope that little girl can bring the life and light to the rest of the family as they grieve for SHells....she always said that Kalia was her replacement, and now it has come true. \nDamm cancer.\nHugs for us all,\nLori\n ",

I always had naturally curly hair too, and in my dream, it came back straight and I felt as if I had lost my identity. \nWell in reality, it came back exactly as before...hair for hair, color for color. Certain pieces are straighter than the others, just like before chemo. I think it got less curly overall from Tamoxifen, but that has nothing to do with chemo.\nJust for fun, I started documenting my hair growth. When it was visible, I took a picture each Monday afternoon so I could look back and see the progress. It'll be back before you know it!\nLori\n ",

I did not have to change anything during recovery, but if you have kids, it might be harder to pick them for a while. Overall, my surgery was on Tuesday with a local and twilight anesthesia, I went to work the next day. I got my diagnosis of cancer when I left the OR, but had to wait a week for the path report. They did a frozen section which gives immediate and pretty good results.\nJenny, in regards to the wait time for the procedure, it was all prep for outpatient surgery. Paperwork, talk to the doc, start an IV...and yes, no makeup or lotions that can interfere with the monioring of your vitals or how anything works, plus they have to be able to see your fingernails for color.\nGood luck, and hang in there!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Kathy-\nHang in there! I'm in Michigan and have family in the N. suburbs of Chicago, I also lived in Buffalo grove when I was a baby.\nOuch, 6 staples! I had steri-strips on that incision. The thing is that they try for one node, but they sometimes get a lot. In my case, I had the SNB and my doc took out 15! He took out anything that was \"warm\" and \"blue\", although the \"hot blue\" node was identified as the SN. The nodes are in clusters and in my case, smaller than expected, so he thought he submitted a sample with one and found like 4 or 5 each time. He told me the number of nodes removed is not the concern for lymphedema, rather it is the procedure and less cutting with the SNB compared to the full node dissection.\nAs for Cancer Center of AMerica, I have not heard much about\n them except when someone is in final stages of cancer and they are looking for a miracle. Sorry, I have no info. As for the multiple opinions, good idea, always. I had 2 opinions for each, saw indiv docs and then went to the U of M breast care clinic at their cancer center and met with the whole team, ended up switching. Even though the chemo was the same, the surgeon at UM was willing to do a SNB, which in 1999 was not as common. So I ended up doing chemo there too, just to be consistent. I'd consider looking with a university hospital or a comprehensive cancer center, but those who saw private docs at community hospitals would also probably have good feedback. I just felt more secure with a major facility, but it was just my preference. \nRest up and be a good patient. Please ask the doc or nurses about\n stretches for the arm. No one told me to do it since I \"just\" had the SNB and I still have some tightness that improves with stretching. \nAnd great attitude! Yes, your node will be negative! We'll start the benign mantra chant from here!\nLori\n ",

I did chemo and rads, then 5 years of Tamoxifen. Attitude will get you far! There is no way to predict how you'll do on chemo, but starting with a strong and positive approach is a big part of things. I was able to work during chemo, taking off just a couple of tired days each of 4 cycles. I have no kids, so can't tell you how that will go. My advice is to prepare for the worst, but don't expect it. Good chance that it will be pretty tolerable!\nDefinitely consider takinga tape recorder with you to the early sessions, even if you have someone with you, there is no way to get it all the first time hearing it. \nBe sure to ask lots of questions here and at the doctor's office.

By June, I had enough hair to wear caps for outside and yard work, so I never had to wear the wig outside. I would recommend going to a wig shop, preferably one that specializes in treating people going through chemo. In my opinion, it is better to be able to see them, feel them, examine the stitching, etc and especially try it on.

      "Content": " Bern, I do not remember my WBC numbers...they definitely went low, but not so low that I was in trouble. I felt fine all the time, and they rebounded for each chemo. I kept a chart with my numbers to watch the highs and lows and it was very predictable for me. My onc was almost an hour away, so I went to my PCP for weekly blood draws. I would get my results right there and I faxed it to my onc's team. The nurse called me once and asked me how I felt, because my count was getting low...but I felt totally fine.\nOK...now you are going to laugh. I saved everything from my cancer experience, I cannot explain it (I did participate in a video project at our local Gilda's Club about\n saving artifacts...and why we did it...)\nOn week 2 after my first chemo, my WBC was 2.0, gran was 0.6...I think that was the lowest it got. Then it would go back to normal. A week after chemo it was back up to 5.6 and 4.1. The next week it was 2.5 and 1.1...and so on.....\nI have no idea how this compares to anyone else's experience, and I am not saying because I did it you should too,...just sharing my experience....I just know that I was not started on any supplements, where now it seems they do it precautionary. Maybe they will let you try it without next time, knowing that in the old days many people were ok with it. I think there are other alternatives, such as neupagen (sp?).\nHang in there...and don't be afraid to ask the doc if you need help. We all tend to be heroes, it is hard to ask for help sometimes. At least for me, anyway. Please don't let yourself suffer as long next time, as there may be other options.\nLori\n ",

I was given the choice for lumpectomy and radiation or mastectomy and chose the lumpectomy + rads. I did chemo too. I was 30 at dx and the oncotype testing was not available then, so chemo was automatic. I was ER/PR+ (strongly +) and went on Tamoxifen for 5 years afterwards. My tumor was borderline positive for Her 2, so no Herceptin. But back then, only Stage IV cancer was approved for Herceptin. If I had it today, they would have to do further testing to determine if I needed Herceptin. My tumor was a grade III, 2.5 cm. \nSince I was given a choice on surgery type and had the one close margin, I felt it was critical to get another opinion from another team. I wanted to make sure that all agreed I had a choice and no strong feelings one way or another. They all agreed which made me feel more confident in my decisions. I think it is lucky for those of us who get to make decisions (not always easy though!)...but I prefer the opportunity to have a little control over whatever I can. THere is not a lot of things we can control with cancer, so I took control of whatever I could...\nLori\n ",

Having a BRCA 1 or BRCA2 mutation can place you at higher risk for certain cancers, including breast, colon, prostate (men) and ovarian. If you have one of the genetic mutations from the BRCA gene, you probably have other family members with a history of these cancers especially at a young age.\nHowever, many of us believe that the absence of a genetic marker does not automatically mean there is none, just means that there is probably one that has not yet been discovered.\nWith your history, if it were me, I would stay under close surveillance with the medical team, don't let them ignore you and consider seeing a genetic counselor at a cancer center to discuss your options. \nAnd tough as it is, try not to worry too much about\n the mammogram just yet...there are so many people who have to have multiple views taken just to get a better read on something.

      "Content": " Jane, I think you just answered the question....cancer does not grow in a round neat ball, but rather it gets spicules or finger-like extensions. When they tell you the dimension of 2.2 cm, that means the largest part. So it may have invaded farther back than you can realize.\nI had one margin that was close and all the docs I saw (2 medical oncs, 2 surgeons, 2 rad oncs) except for one said to go back and get that margin till it's clear. THey said the chance of recurrance was much higher if I left it. I had a re-excision and let them take another chunk of tissue out, and my cosmetic result is still decent. I am lopsided, but I don't mind that much. My advice to you is get another opinion and ask the doc what he/she would do if it was his wife/ herself. \nSize is not the only indicator here, the fact that you were Her 2 negative and ER/PR+ are good traits to have, and it might influence the doctor's recommendation. \nStats are just stats, and for YOU it is either cancer or not. But I would ask about\n the stats for recurrance if they leave the margins alone and trust chemo/ rads or if you get the extra surgery. Would surgery increase your odds of staying cancer free by 2%? 10%? Once you make your decision, go for it and don't look back. Trust your instinct and feel good about\n your choices and ability to take control.\nGlad surgery was easy, as far as surgery goes.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Jane-\nI think that thyroid cancer is less serious (usually) because it is slow growing and responds to iodine therapy very well, it is just easy to treat. Most thyroid cancers, incluiding mine, absorb iodine....so the treatment is a poisonous iodine, called radioactive iodine. The thyroid cells and tissue are the only cells in the body that absorb iodine, so it is like a magic bullet to kill thyroid cancer. True, there are 2 kinds of thyroid cancers that do not respond to iodine therapy, but they are much more rare.\nI take Levoxyl, 150 mcg. It took about\n 6 months to get the right dose, as the doc moves slowly to increase the meds and then waits 6 weeks to see what happens.\nI don't know much about\n the thyroid report....but it sounds like the mass has inconsistent traits, and suspicious is not a good word in general...but...with anything, no one knows for sure until the tissue sample is examined.\nAnd for chemo related to breast cancer, remember there are many kinds and dependent upon many factors. Some chemo is hormonal medications, with little side effects. Some kinds are the more traditional cancer therapy drugs that include hair loss. And others are targeted to certain kinds of cells and may be taken long term....\nMy lumpectomy in 1999 was similar to others, in that they use a twilight anesthesia and a local, not much recovery time involved and return to work in a day if you want. Thyroid surgery is more involved and did require a one night stay and a general anesthesia.\nGood questions....don't think too much about\n it, but hang in there!\nLori \n ",

Double meaning, of course not really lucky to get cancer, but super lucky to have had a great outcome for both. :)\nWhat a terrible weekend of waiting you are going through, but good news, all the waiting will be over at once.\nSo....there is a LOT on your plate, try to take it one step at a time.\nThyroid cancer is a nuisance, but not life threatening, Surgery is easy, treatment is quick and then life gets back to normal. \nBreast cancer of course is more serious...my diagnosis was nearly 10 years ago. There are a lot of factors that go into determining the course of treatment for chemo, rads, surgery, etc. All are very do-able though! Crummy, yes, but do-able. If cancer has spread to the bones it is more serious, and the treatment may be different than if it is just in the breast.\nAs for timing, with thyroid cancer, they will probably say you have time to travel and do what you need to do. WIth breast cancer, they will likely want to get it out first and then probably a little time (few weeks at most) before starting treatment.\nBut these are all \"what ifs\" if in fact you have breast or thyroid cancer. Good chances that both are benign and this will all be over on Monday...\nI too had no history of either cancer, positive history of thyroid disease in the family. Turns out I had Hashimoto's too. \nSO hang in there....try to stay busy, and try not to let your mind run away with things. 80% of breast tumors are benign and I think the numbers for thyroid nodules are even better. \nKeep us posted!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Jane, some people do not require more treatment for breast cancer besides surgery (maybe oral meds for hormones)....as I mentioned, there are multiple factors that go into that, including type, size, stage, etc. So there is hope that IF it is cancer, treatment may be very easy. And I did not mean to startle you by saying that I had no family history of cancer...what I meant was that most of us have no family hx, very few breast cancers are inherited. So...having no family history is not really a positive or a negative in terms of a woman's diagnosis. Of course a positive family history, especially with close relatives like sisters/ mother/ daughter, there can be an increased risk.\nGlad your thyroid bx was easy. I found it to be uncomfortable, but not too bad. My surgery was last June and my scar is really nicely faded by now.\nTry to have a good weekend and definitely keep those plans to pack.\nLori\n ",

I found that during rad tx, doctors seemed to have different preferences and recommendations on skin care, vitamins, etc. You want to be careful that you don't do anything that will help the cancer cells out by mistake. And many don't burn with rads, so the cream may not be needed. I was lucky, no burns or blisters, and just used regular products for moisture and my own regular deodorant too.\nGlad to see you are doing your homework and finding good uses for wine though!\n ",

As Frayda mentioned, those on a network panel with a carrier have to accept their fees which may be only about\n 60% of their charged amounts. \nSome doctors charge rates that are double or 50% higher than the local \"competitors.\" You may want to call around to other doctors and find out what they charge for procedures. You might also check to see if your plan has an out of pocket maximum, which would offer you some protection once the total has been reached. \nAs for the appeals, definitely appeal everything, it's your right. But be sure you have more information and documentation each time....eventually your appeals process becomes exhausted and if you get more info later, you won't be able to submit it for condsideration.\nGood luck!\n ",

As long as I did not apply pressure to the breast, I had no pain. Cosmetically, it will depend on where the lump is and how big and what tissue comes out with it. I had a lumpectomy twice, and since it was cancer, they took a lot of tissue out. The second time was to clear a margin, but I am much smaller on that side now (too bad, I was smaller on that side to start!).

Yesterday I went in for the radioactive pill, went back today for the scan. 15 minutes for head/ neck and 15 minutes for chest. This was a radioactive iodine, so that only thyroid tissue takes it up and then it glows on the scan, to search for any remnants of thyroid tissue. Tissue in the neck might mean that some tissue did not get ablated last year. Hot areas in the chest would mean mets to the lungs (which is still treatable). \nIf there was any thyroid tissue, then it would mean having to go off my thyroid hormone for 2 weeks (we call it hypo hell) and a low iodine diet (brutal) for the 2 weeks, then another round of radioactive iodone therapy to try again and dissolve any remnants.\nEndo said to have a great summer and I'll see him in October. Unlike BC, this really is it and considered cured. I seem to defy the odds to get cancer but thankfully my cancer has behaved in the positive end of the statistical curve.\nHappy dancin' and hugs to you all!\nLori\n ",

If all things are best case scenario and you have a tiny tumor, they may discuss choices with you in order to give you the best quality of life but also the longest life. You might ask what the chances of recurrence are if you do not do chemo. And if they are great odds, then you may have to make a decision.

That will get you far.\nAnd if, big fat IF, it is cancer, we'll help you through it, I had a lumpectomy almost 9 years ago when I was 30. I did chemo and rads, and it was not fun but you can do it. Keep us posted!\nLori\n ",

Unfortunately that can't buy you peace of mind, but it should not increase your worry either. There are a lot of myths out there. Some docs think if were cancer it would not hurt. Others say if it is movable, it is not cancer. Both are not true and are not diagnostic indicators.

THat is a statistic that is in your favor!\nBe your own best advocate and don't settle till you have a definitive. And let us know how it turns out, we'll be rooting for ya!\nLori\n ",

I used to dream of the day when I would wake up and realize that the day before, I had no thoughts of cancer....having scars and physical changes makes that impossible...so I changed my focus. Instead of trying to not think of cancer, I realized it was part of me...and instead of fighting it, embrace it. It is part of me, physically and emotionally, but I just accept it. I realized my goal needed to be that I was OK with thoughts of cancer.........I could not fight it. Once I made peace with it, life was better.\nBut you are not there yet. My advice is that if the thoughts are negative and overwhelming and persistent and taking over your daily life, then it is time to seek professional help. It is normal to have bouts of it now and then, but when it becomes too much, it is ok to seek help....perhaps just for a short time period, but you might need a little help to get you over the hump of the stress.\nTry backing away from the reading and internet and find non-cancer things to do....\nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks to those that expressed warm thoughts. When she called me on Saturday, she was in tears and could hardly talk. I was instantly taken back 8 1/2 years ago to my own diagnosis and knew that very dark place she was in. Luckily, she is getting all her tests and appointments right away so she is getting answers and taking control, has much less of that waiting game to play. She had MRI of breast and brain. Brain is clean, but she has 2 tumors plus calcs. Bone scan and chest x-ray are clear. That is especially great since she has a cough that won't go away, they are afraid of lung mets. MRI of the nodes looks good so far. ER/PR negative (drats) and Her 2 strongly positive. SHe's looking at probably a mastectomy, AC, Taxol and then Herceptin. \nI brought over my books on Monday and she was in a much better place and I had some peace, seeing that she was moving forward.\nANd Bev, I already told her that you shared the same age and 2 tumor status, and you are one of our LONG term survivors. Thanks!\nLori\n ",

My doc took a paint pen and drew on my breast the outline of the area for the boost, and only that area was radiated for the last few times. I am not a doctor, but it sounds like what your mother is experiencing is normal.\nAs for getting emotional, many of us experience a 'let down' of sorts after treatment is over, now that we're finished with medical attention as often as we're used to getting, sometimes we feel vulnerable or alone.

I am still struggling with the whole thing...so many things that are just not fair. \nAnd thanks for sharing the article. I agree with the idea of hope and the listing of the advances made, but I agree with Bev on the short duration that has been considered a success. Six months is too short....but....I bet those who are fighting that fight and can be thankful for the extra 6 months that has been sent their way. The other major advance that I see is the increased duration from initial dx till mets...that is the real victory, and the real path towards cure. The longer they can keep us disease free, the longer we have to find a cure. I think if they can show us decreased mortality rates for those with stage 0, 1 or 2 then we can also point to progress. \nAnyone that we lose is one person too many, for sure. It is not fair, no rhyme or reason.

My advice to you is listen to your instinct....you are right to not worry but you are more right to question the 5 mont wait. Keep in mind that most of us here were the ones with the BC and our stories are not like most, but knowing from the \"what ifs\" we are all going to suggest that you not wait and get another opinion. There is a very good chance that it is nothing, but it does not sound like anyone can be sure enough. My suggestion is to get a copy of all the mammo reports and u/s reports, not just the letter, and talk to your doctor. Then consider taking the reports plus the films (you can check them out or borrow them) to surgeon or breast specialist for further evaluation. 80% of lumps are benign, so odds are in your favor....but just in case, it is best to be sure.\nKeep us posted-\nLori\n ",

Right now the emotions are raw and there is so much to think about\n and learn about\n...and before you know it, you'll be in control and feeling like you are in a much better place. My advice is to learn as much as you can so you can make informed decisions...but learn it in small doses so as not to overwhelm yourself. You may want to wait till you have more info before telling the kids...this way you'll know the plan as far as surgery and chemo or other medications, and you'll know how to answer their questions. For me, knowledge was power. Once I learned enough and started making appointments and taking charge, I was much better able to talk about\n it with others. \nTake one day at a time and surround yourself with what feels good. Ask us lots of questions and take your husband or friend to your doctors' appointments, along with a tape recorder.\nAnd since you know you have had trouble with depression, be sure to talk to your doctor about\n that and keep it from sliding out of control.\nHugs,\nLori\n ",

That will help your coping in the coming months, as you put your warrior hat back on (with a pink ribbon this time!)

There are usually several decisions to make along the way, and this is just the beginning. The best piece of advice I can offer is to get all the info you can and then make your decision that is right for YOU, not what others tell you to do, and go with your gut. \nIf there are 2 tumors, they may recommend mastectomy. I am not sure they can do 2 lumpectomies. Please ask about\n that. Even if the 2nd one is benign, you may still need chemo based on the size, \nlocation and traits of the first one....so prepare for that too (don't expect it, just prepare for it). It is hard to say just rads from a core biopsy, there is more info they need to know, including lymph node status. \nFor me, radiation was a piece of cake, no real side effects. My breast got tender and pink and more firm, but all normal and tolerable. Chemo was tolerable too, easier than I expected. If you need it, there are lots of great medications to help get you through to ease the side effects.\nMy other bit of advice is to write down your questions and bring a tape recorder along with a friend or spouse to the appointments.

      "Content": " Yes, it is absolutely necessary. If the PCP left it up to you, it sounds as if he is pretty sure that the results are accurate, which is a good sign. But an ultrasound is not 100% sure at all. What it means is that the US looked good and normal, but because there was something there in the first place (clinical impressions), the radiologist feels better safe than sorry. Take this as good news. If it was imperative to see a surgeon, they would tell you that. The only way to be sure is to get a better look at the cells...too many times we hear of people getting a clean US report only to get bad news later...this does NOT mean we think bad news for you, but the point is that too often the doctors dismiss younger women without a proper exam and evaluation. \nThe surgeon may do a needle biopsy or may think that even though it is benign, that it may need to come out. Either one would be an easy procedure and would give you peace of mind once and for all. Think of the breast surgeon as a breast care expert, not just a surgeon.\nYou may also want to get a copy of the US report, for your records. Kudos to your PCP for not messing around!\nGood luck!\nLori\n ",

As for the strength, you will find it when and where you need it, it is amazing. I remember having the same thoughts as you and you will surprise yourself. There is no choice in cancer, you got it and did not ask for it. But there is choice in how you react, cope, present to others and handle the active role in your medical care. Contol what you can, it will help you get through tough times when you know you have not lost the control. The week after diagnosis when I knew I had breast cancer was the hardest week of my life. Once I got the path report and started the process for staging, I knew i was in control. I made appointments, I read, I asked questions and made decisions, so I had a plan. Getting to that point will be a turn in the corner.\nAbsolutely consider a second opinion, even if you like your doctors. The peace of mind is worth it, as well as actually being offered alternatives. Get all the info you can to make your decisions. You may not have to have a mastectomy, some people have a choice. I had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation. Each was easier than I thought it would be, and was all very tolerable. \nMake lists of your questions and take a friend and tape recorder to the doctor's appointments, all will be invaluable. No question is silly, so let us know how we can help.\nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Ruby-\nFirst, let me offer you a tremendous hug...and another. We have all been where you are, and for what it's worth, your feelings seem perfectly normal. The days after my diagnosis were the most frightening, overwhelming and angriest of my life. You WILL get through this, there is simply no choice. Allow yourself to feel what you are feeling, painful yes, but let it happen. Focus on what you can do, take charge of what you can take charge of. Reading, researching, writing, comparing notes....all things you can take control of. Reading her emails...you can take control of that too. Most of us can tell you a story, in fact I think one of our beloveds named it \"The Golden Boob\" award to the most insensitive and idiotic thing that someone else did or said to us. \nMy hunch is that your \"friend\" was trying to join you in your anger by sharing her horror story with her boobs too. No comparison, we know...but to her, and it may be \"all about\n her\", but I bet that she was trying to show you too how boobs are not all they are cracked up to be. One suggestion is to email her back and simply let her know that while you know she is suffering in her own way, you feel that her issues are just not relevant for you at this difficult time and in fact, that her emails are adding to your distress, and that you will contact her when you are up to it.\nAs for a therapist, go for it. Depression is pretty common with a diagnosis of cancer, and not sure they will lock you up...but if your feelings become so overwhelming and life consuming, and last for more than a week or 2, it may be time to seek professional help. No shame, just that some people need a little help now and then. \nGive it time, you will come to acceptance...try to set reasonable goals. It may not be reasonable to \"be over it\" tomorrow, but try to replace the crying with a constructive activity. Or if you cried for 2 hours yesterday, maybe tomorrow can be less. Set a realistic increment to try and reach, but do allow yourself to feel what you feel. \nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

While I do think her book is fantastic and I found the information to be invaluable when I went through my diagnosis and treatment. I did find some things that were not true (like the pattern of tattoos that I would get). But one thing I did learn from that is to take it all at face value and do my own research to validate some things that I might hear that I don't understand or like.\nAnd I do believe that while mets us viewed typically as incurable but treatable, I think there are a percentage of people that do not fit that statistic too,...some people do beat the odds. Look at Lance Armstrong who's cancer had spread to his brain and lungs and he is still cancer free. And look at our own Deb, who is about\n 20 years post mets diagnosis, and has been cancer free for most of those years too. \nLori\n ",

I believe stage III refers to the size of the tumor too, and it may have to do with spread to the nodes beyond the axillary, but I can't remember. \nGrade III is what mine was too, although a Stage IIA. Stage refers to the size and spread of the cancer. Grade refers to the traits of the cells of the tumor. Grade III is worse than II and Grade I is better....Grade III means the cells were rapidly dividing and poorly differentiated....meaning they had mutated more and looked less like normal cells, and it can mean they are more aggressive cells.\nAs for her future, yes, she had a good chance to be cured and never face it head on again. What makes it chronic, in that case, is the never knowing if we are cured.....With positive nodes, she does face a realistic chance of recurrance. The thing is that the stats can tell you the liklihood of recurrance or remaining cancer free...but the stats are just stats, nothing is for sure. \nEven if she never has to deal with cancer again, her life is changed forever, and she may always look over her shoulder with fear, with anxiety or with power and control. No telling how she'll react, how she'll feel or how her health will be....that is what makes the journey. Be there for her and support her, there are a lot of ups and downs along the road. Just because the physical scars may heal, the emotional ones are still there. \nBut...there is every reason to believe and hope that she'll live a long and healthy and normal life.

The tech picks up your breast and puts it on a cold metal plate, moves it and manipulates it, positions it, then squeezes the plates, pretty tightly. I would say it is uncomfortable and hurts for a moment. As soon as the compression stops, so does the discomfort. It is very tolerable for the moment, certainly you would not want to hold the position for more than those few seconds. \nThe medical information and potentially life saving information that a mammogram provides is worth it, hands down. If you've ever had a cavity or any dental work, I would say that you have tolerated similar discomfort. You've given birth, surely that pain is worse than a mammogram.\nAs for your second question, I have no facts to support this, but I am pretty sure that the mammogram would not pose any health risks. If it did, it would not be the gold standard for early detection.\nLori\n ",

We have had people from New Zealand and all over the world at one time or another.\nSorry you had to be here, but all is not lost! This is definitely a shock and a frightening time. Read and research in moderation, you don't want to scare yourself, but take in what you can and take breaks when you need to. No reason you can't do all those things you wanted to do, travel may wait, but the others are great hobbies and no dx has to stand in your way!\nGrade 3 is the worst of the scale (mine was a 3 too), it just means that the cells were more rapidly growing and dividing. I am a 7 year survivor, so it is not a death sentence by any means!\nI definitely agree to do the SNB first. I had the same concern, why not just do it all now and get it over with. But if the nodes are negative from the SNB, then you will surely be saving yourself a great deal of pain and greatly reducing your chance for lymphedema complications. \nMake a list of your questions and consider taking a tape recorder in to the doctor's appointments while you ar getting the consults, you'll be able to go back later and listen closely and rewind and take notes as you need.\nRadiation therapy is usually pretty easy to tolerate. Don't be surprised if they mention chemo too...it will depend on the node status and the size of your tumor, among other things. No vascular lymphatic invasion is a good thing. Not sure about\n a score of 6, but being positive for ER/PR status is a good thing too. There are more treatment options available.\nHang in there! Find things to keep you busy and when things get overwhelming, allow yourself to cry and then know it will get better...\nLori\n ",

I'm in Michigan, and I think most or all of us at the moment are in the US...but that is the great thing about\n a board like this, that it does not matter where we are!\nI had a 2.5 cm tumor, grade III, ER/PR+, diagnosed 11/30/99, a week before turning 31. I had my diagnosis from the lumpectomy and then had a re-excision to clean 1 margin and do the SNB. Then I did 4 cycles of chemo (nodes were negative) and radiation to the breast. Not that I would want to do it all again, but it was very do-able and I was very fortunate in how well I tolerated the treatments. You can ask 100 of us for our experiences with chemo and rads, and we'll probably have 50 different stories...there is no way to tell how you will do based on our experiences, but there is every reason to think that you'll do just great!\nThere is a very good chance you can still visit your mother after surgery. You may not have full use of the arm, but you should be able to get out and about\n just fine. There may be no need to tell your mother if the news is upsetting. I never told my grandmothers, who were in Florida. It would have killed them. By the time they saw me again, I looked just the same and we felt right about\n protecting them from the news. \nStill plan on doing the exciting things you want to, travel may wait a few months, but plan for a great trip and you can definitely work on learning new languages in the mean time.\nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

That does not mean she should put off an evaluation though! At her age, odds are in her favor. They say that 80% of breast lumps are benign....Good chance hers is nothing too, but any lump should be checked out thoroughly. THey can use an ultrasound to get a better look.

Not to sound like alarmists, keep in mind that most of us who post here have or had breast cancer so we are all going to tell you to find a doctor who will take you seriously. You are NOT too young for BC or IBC. True it is rare at age 34, but since I had breast cancer at 30, I'd be happy to tell your doctor to go back to his books and read up on the disease and how to diagnose it.\nCysts are fluid filled and are not likely to be cancer,..but no one can be sure without testing the cells. The other symptoms that you have are probably not related to the cyst and I would hope that the doctor knows that. My tumor was not visible on the mammogram but was evident as cancer on my ultrasound. \nMy suggestion is to walk, no run, to a specialist or at least another doctor. You have too many unexplained issues to be just related to a cyst. Your ability to document your own history and symptoms is great and I would encourage you to keep doing so. It will definitely help in making the right diagnosis. \nKeep in mind that there are many breast conditions which are benign, so there is no way to say that you do or don't have cancer at this point. Odds are definitely in your favor, but your gut is telling you to do the right thing. And be your own best advocate!\nHang in there and let us know what happens,..\nLori\n ",

I too worked throughout chemo, but took a couple days off for each chemo cycle and worked a little from home. I found the side effects to be identical each time, I could set my watch by it. Water tastes bad? Must be THursday. Reflux? Must be Friday at 5:00. It was tolerable and predictable. I learned that when the nurse says eat light, it does not mean a chicken salad. It means toast and clear soup. I learned that salami is considered spicy. Not hot spicy, but herb spicy. Some of it you learn as you go....but I liked to say prepare for the worst but do not expect it. Whatever side effect you have, there is a medication for it...don't suffer with anything, whether consitpation or reflux. You can take something to make you more comfortable. COnsider eating dried apricots the first week too, it will help keep you regular.

My weight fluctuated all of 1 pound during the 12 weeks, my complexion was never better! I refused to let chemo get in the way of anything, and I too worked throughout.\nMany chemo drugs do not impact hair loss.\nBut years ago, when I worked at a mental health clinic, we had a child who's mother was dying of cancer.

They mentioned irregular shape, irregular density of the tumor (not the breast) and irregular borders. Those are typical for cancer. It may have nothing to do with the density of the breast.

The fear can be overwhelming, but try to break it down one step at a time, one day at a time, one hour at a time. If the reading is too much, take a break. I too read what I could, and I tried to stop when it became too much. The first few days are a whirlwind of information, stats, questions, appointments, tests and more tests. \nI bought my first computer in honor of my diagnosis, figuring I would need support. I found this group of women, many of whom still post here today,a nd they cheered me on through surgery and chemo and rads...and we all are here for each other through lifes ups and downs and in betweens.\nYes, the questions and waiting are the worst part of it..tell yourself that you CAN do this and the worst will be over soon. For me, knowledge was power and I needed to be in control. I needed to DO something. Just making appointments and having a PLAN was empowering for me. I cried every day for the first week in between diagnosis and my next surgeon appointment. I walked out of there with several appt slips in hand and a new sense of control. A great piece of advice that I can offer is to make a list of questions and bring a tape recorder with you to the appointments. That way you can go back and listen and take notes and make new lists later, in the comfort of your home.\nAnd as for decisions, take your time. Read, talk to us and get a second opinion if you are not sure. And remember that statistics are just numbers....they tell the overall story and try to predict what should happen, but no one can say what will be for you. JoAnn is a great statistical story....she can tell you what low odds they gave her to live a couple years and she is over 10 years out, still cancer free. Pooey to the stats!\nWhere do you live? You may want to contact ACS or your local hospital for support group information too.\nHang in there...these first days are definitely the worst and things should only get better...\nLori\n ",

Often times, anyway, there are no absolutes here...take the attitude that you will get through this with flying colors and it will help! I worked full time and just took about\n 2-3 days off for chemo each time. We are all different, some have easier reactions and others worse, but there is no reason to think that things will be terrible. The only thing I did not do was go to malls or movies during the time when my counts were low, so if you start chemo soon, definitely plan around that. You may feel great, but it could be risky to expose yourself to that many germs.\nLLBean has a great online system and if you get a credit card from them, there is no shipping fee and all monogramming is free.

Definitely make a list of your questions adn the nurses will answer some, as will we. They will tell you during chemo when to avoid crowded places and stuff you need to know. Just FYI, the pre-meds for chemo (worked great on nausea) are constipating, so plan for that...ask the RN about\n a stool softener or something. Eating dried apricots can help too. I had a sentinel node biopsy after lumpectomy and I was able to use my arm right away, but could not raise it very high. I think I held the dryer in that hand and used my other one to style, but actually forgot. I was allowed to shower right away, but I did not have drains (which you would with a mast). Also ask about\n stretching exercises for that mobility, and follow what they advise. It will help loosen things up. I slept on my side and found a small pillow to hold my arm off my breast worked well. I took just a few days off work, but that was for lumpectomy and SNB. When I had my first lumpectomy, I went back to work the next day.\nAs for books, have fun at Borders! There are a ton out there. I found Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book to be very informative...ans answered a lot of questions. The one thing was that she spoke in absolutes, \" This will happen...\" or \" You will have this....\" and it was not always true. I found myself asking tons of questions and it helped me prepare for the unknown. \nAnd keep in mind too that some books may be a few years old, and things change.

Now I think they give it for stage I or II, and the results are supposed to be pretty amazing as far as keeping people disease free.\nAnd being ER+ is a good thing too, not a bad thing!

The higher the grade, the more differentiated, or mutated they are. it looks like they also found another area that was DCIS, that it had not yet broken out of the duct.

And yes, negative nodes is the most wonderful news you could get! Celebrate it! And then take comfort in your plan...to see the med onc and rad onc. Take that tape recorder too. I would encourage you to read or learn what you can before you go so that you can ask the best possible questions.\nAlso, you may want to ask for a pathology report, it will become your friend.\nEnjoy Thanksgiving and celebrate the negative nodes!\nLori\n ",

Mine developed as first a pain in my side and then a couple days later, I could see the cord-like vein. I was told that it is a side effect of breast surgery or trauma to the breast, and is not related to cancer itself. You can look it up online too, and Susan Love's Breast Book mentions it. I got it again another time, this time you could see the vein in my arm pit and running down my arm. It subsided in a short period of time and never came back. I did take a baby aspirin for a while as a blood thinner. THey did not say it was a clot, but an inflammation of the vein.\nAs far as a sense of urgency, they cannot tell anything for sure from the films, and it is best to have it looked at. It may not mean a thing...but best to be sure. \nPlease stick around and keep us posted!\nLori\n ",

I could read, look up words and just have something concrete to hold on to. \nMy sugery was on Nov 30, and I got my dx that day. \"You have cancer, we need the path results, but you'll need more surgery and maybe chemo and maybe a mastectomy. See me next week.\" Ok, it was not that crude but the message was the same...here is a little bit if horifying news, but you have to wait a week to find out anything else. That was the hardest week of my life, I cried every day and every night. Then I got my path report, cried that day, and then had a new sense of courage and fight and determination. I never looked back from that point.

Try not to think of this as an inconclusive diagnosis...a mammogram is not 100%, it is just one helpful tool to detect lumps or other things that should not be there...including cysts, calcs, and who knows what other junk. The density of your breast would not make you more or less likely to have a malignant condition, it just makes the mammogram less reliable. It is not really a second opinion, the way I see it, as the mammo was just not able to read anything either way. THe fact that it was not conclusive by no means suggests cancer, it just means they could not determine what it is. The best thing then is to always get more testing to figure out just what it is...and if an ultrasound is not conclusive either, do not panic. Sometimes they just need different screening tools to find the right image. And also, don't panic if the tech does not tell you anything...that is totally normal. Only the doctor is supposed to read the films and provide an opinion.\nYes this is a frightening situation, but don't make it worse for youself by trying to read into things. Just take a breath, bring your films and a friend to your next appointment and get copies of your reports for your own records. Rely on your gut and if you aren't satisfied, then seek another opinion. \n 80% of breast lumps are benign, hopefully yours is in that majority.\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " You got it! There are different answers for the same questions.. depending on who answers them. That is why it is important to trust your doctor and consider a second opinion to be sure. And sometimes there may be more than one right answer, leaving the decision making to you. Bev is right in that younger women tend to have mor aggressive cancers...mine was a grade III at age 30. Grade I is the best, it means it is least aggressive, good news for you. Size is a factor in whether they use chemo or not, but so are the cell traits. Slow growing cancers are less likely to respond to chemo...but the larger tumor may have had some rogue cells slip out...try not to second guess yet, just take the facts you have and bring those with your questions to the doctor. Ask the doctor if you can email him or the nurse with additional questions...they are sure to come up at strange hours in the night...or weekends when no one is there. No reason to call and play phone tag each time. I used email with my doctors and it was a real great way to communicate on their time schedule, plus allowed me to have a written record of the Q&A's.\nGood luck!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Hi there...sorry to hear of your recent diagnosis. It really must have taken you by surprise at 34. I was diagnosed a week before turning 31 in 1999 and it was quite a shock. Take one day at a time, one minute at a time,...this will be a frightening and emotional time for you. Know that you may have ups and downs and it is ok....you'll run the gammit of emotions. There is a lot of information to gather for the doctors and for you...reading and researching what you can. For me, knowledge is power, and I needed to learn what I could so that i could converse with the doctors and control those things I had control of.\nI also had to have a re-excision to get cleaner margins. I do not think being 'double negative' lowers your life expectancy...but each one may increase your chance of recurrance. Statistics are just numbers....even for the person who is told she has a 20% chance to survive, SOMEONE has to be in that 20%....so they may tell you your chances for recurrance, which does not mean death. It tells you a way to predict whether you might get cancer again...and even if you do, a recurrance can still be local. And a recurrance that is metastatic does not mean all gloom and doom either, many people are long term survivors.\nBeing negative for Her 2 neu is a better prognostic indicator, but that means that Herceptin can't be used for treatment, sort of a double edged sword.\nChemo is doable! I missed 2 full and 2 half days of work each chemo cycle and worked right through rads. I had no kids to take car of or family duties, but I took care of myself and my home and never missed a beat. \nYou can do this! Where do you live? Someone here may be near you. \nTake care and stick around...\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " (Buried in kiwi's thread)...thought I'd start a new one for ya.\nNone of us here are doctors, but what I can tell you is that no one can tell what the lump is without really looking at it. That means ultrasound, mammography and possobly a biopsy. Try to relax though, 80% of breast lumps are benign. Primarily, people our age get cysts tht are fluid filled and can change with the time of month. Fribroadenomas are benign solid tumors, that sometimes are removed by surgery. While I am guessing that the tumor itself does not change with your cycle, the texture and density of your breast tissue may change, causing you to feel it differently.\nThe mammogram should be offered, but in my case, at age 30, the mammogram was not an effective tool. The ultrasound showed malignancy, but we are all different and one test may or may not show something in different people. They say \"moveable\" is a good sign, but in my case it meant nothing.\nDo not let them dismiss you \"because you are too young.\" I was 30 when diagnosed and we have had gals here diagnosed in their 20's. \nMost likely this is nothing, but absolutely has to be checked out. Make sure you have sufficeint evidence, not just a nurse's opinion, that says it is nothing. Keep us posted...\nLori\n ",

Some people get nervous and upset at their own feelings when they 'regress' but it is normal....just that we tend to get taken by surprise when we step sideways or back.

My advice....cry and yell and know that you may feel pretty overwhelmed and scared...it is normal. Take charge of what you can...which means your attitude, surroundings and getting information. Read what you can so you'll be in a better position to discuss with the doctors..and to understand what they say. Write a list of questions, but don't worry about\n writing the answers. Take a tape recorder to the appointment along with a friend and allow yourself to listen to it later, when you can stop and pause and take notes. Just my advice....you'll get a lot of it, just remember that it is advice and not law.\nIn the mean time, hang in there,...and keep in mind that breast cancer, when caught early, has excellent survival rates!

I switched surgeons because my first one had less experience and was less sure of her ability, but bou did I love her for the first go-round, she was a gem. Any way, the SNB status back then impacted the treatment as well. Positive nodes may not have dictated whether one got a mastectomy vs a lumpectomy but it did mean rads to the axilla area and also it would have meant taxol treatments as well. In 'the old days', standard was 4 AC for negative nodes and add 4 T if positive nodes.\nIt may also influence how screening and surveillance is done afterwards.\nThe SNB also saves our nodes and saves the nerve. I had 15 removed, much to the doc's surprise. Each time he thought it was 1 sample it was 3 or 4 tiny nodes. I have been lucky and have no lymphedema issues, doc said it has to do with what and how much gets cut as opposed to number of nodes. \nAs for the blue dye and radio tracer, I was told that some hospitals did both, just to add an extra bit of measure...they were looking for the hot blue nodes...but some were hot and others were blue...or a combination thereof (warm blue, cool blue...). All I know is that the radioactive injection was the most painful part of the whole surgery for me.\nAs far as differing treatments, we need to keep in mind that there is more than one way to tame the beast...2 teams may approach it differently to get to the same end, and also standards change. We have to trust our doctors and teams or find new ones that we can trust.\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " There are dozens of reasons that are benign that can cause pain. Many cancers don't cause pain, but there is a myth that if it hurts, it's not cancer. You may want to check out Susan Love's Breast Book, she has a whole section on benign conditions. She may have some of that on her website too. Fibrocystic breast changes, mastitis and just normal menstrual cycle changes are a couple that come to mind.\nAnd pain is not necessarily associated with a stage of cancer. People with later stage cancer may have pain where the cancer has spread, such as the bones. Pain in the breast is definitely something to evaluate, but does not mean cancer and it does not mean benign. It is a symptom but it does not point to any one thing.\nLori\n ",

My periods were quite regular on Tamoxifen (more regular than before the Pill, but not as regular as on the Pill), and not heavy. Frankly, since finishing it in June, my periods have been much heavier, but that is my uterus trying to shed the thicker lining, and supposedly it should lessen over time.\nI did gain weight slowly, but I cannot blame it on Tamoxifen alone, my diet is lousy. I felt no different on it or off of it.\nMy advice is to take it tomorrow and again the next day. Keep going...and if your side effects become intolerable, you can talk to the doc or d/c the tamoxifen...no one can force you to take it.\nPlease consider taking it...it is credited with reducing the recurrance rate and mortality rate in younger women with BC. If you hate it, then stop taking it...but if you don't take it, you'll always wonder...\nLike Julie, I am so grateful that Tamoxifen was a weapon in the arsenal that I had available.\nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

I also used aloe Fruit of the Earth gel for moisture. I had no real fatigue, no burning, no scarring, no other problems....\nAs for the damage to the lung, the rad onc will plan and map it carefully to avoid as much of the lung as possible. I was told that in my case, the amount of the lung to get hit would be minimal. \nHopefully your experience will be pretty good too.\nThe anticipation of the treatment is probably worse than the treatment itself...\nhang in there!\nLori\n ",

My periods were pretty regular for all 5 years. My first 2 periods after tamoxifen have been much heavier than they used to be. Is this normal? And if so, can I typically expect them to become lighter after a couple of months, or will it be heavy for the duration? I am seeing my GYN next week for a routine check, but wondered from your perspective. Thank you.\n \n \nA: \n its not unusual for the lining of the uterus to thicken as a side effect of tamoxifen. it now is able to rid itself of that additional lining with menstruation. your gyn will evaluate you to let you know how long to anticipate this happening. congrats on being done!\nHere is the link:\nhttp://www.hopkinsbreastcenter.org/services/ask_expert/\n ",

There are many many benign breast conditions that can cause pain, including changes associated with the menstrual cycle. You are extremely young for breast cancer, although not totally out of harm's way, the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor for this to be nothing to worry about\n. \nYour mom's family has a history of BC....were they young, like unde 40, when diagnosed? If many of them were very young, there could be a risk of a genetic mutation that would place you at potential higher risk...but if they were older, it may be nothing more than random chance. \nPlease insist that your doctor do an ultrasound. A mammogram is not likely to show anything in a woman of your age.

Most likely it is benign, but you do need to get it checked. Don't take no for an answer. We don't mean to scare you, just remember we were the ones on the other side of that statistic.\nWhen I found my lump, I went to the GYN first, just because it made sense.

There are loads of other benign breast conditions too....I do not know much about\n calcifications, so I can't address those questions.\nYou can insist on a biopsy and if there is something there, most of us will recommend that you get one...but not every doctor will do so. Understandably, they cannot biopsy every lump or bump...but if there is something there, please pursue it.

      "Content": " Bern-\nIt depends on what kind of work you do as far as taking time off for surgery. I took no time off for the lumpectomy, just that day. It was easy, but I have a job in an office with no heavy lifting or anything but typing. I took a few days off for my lymph node surgery. See if they will do a sentinel node biopsy first, it potentially can save you from having more invasive and more painful node surgery. I had very little pain from the surgery itself, but it takes a while to regain motion. I used to sleep on my right )surgery was on left) and prop my arm on a pillow to keep it from hitting the sore breast, and it worked great.\nHer2 neu is an oncogene, sort of a protein that can be overexpressed in some breast cancers. They will test yours for it. Positive can mean more aggressive, but it also means that there are targeted meds that can help you a great deal if you need it. \nI also cut my hair before it fell out. I waited till the weekend before it was supposed to fall out and had it shaved. It was more comfortable, but I could not face losing my hair, so I had it cut off on my terms, and I was in control. It was the hardest thing I did, but made my experience better I think. \nTake one step at a time, and yes, waiting is the hardest part. Once you know the extent of the cancer, you know what you are fighting and you'll go into attack mode. Getting a treatment plan is so empowering...in the mean time, hang in there!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Juju, take a deep breath, and another. If I were you, I would gather all my reports, all my films and slides and go somewhere for a 2nd opinion. Most doctors will say any cancer that is stage II, I or 0 is considered early. So even with a 2 cm tumor and positive nodes, if you are a stage IIB, that is still considered early...because it has not metastasized beyond the nodes. It is still treatable and curable! 30% chance of recurrance means 70% chance of remaining cancer free....and even if it did dome back no one says you will die from it. It can come back locally and be treated, or even if it comes back outside of the breast, it can still be treated.\nIf further testing will have implications for whether or not you take Herceptin, it is absolutely warranted. If you are not happy with your medical team, that is another great reason to look for a new team. You deserve to be comfortable with your docs.\nPlease consider seeing another doctor also if you feel your mood really is too low. Oncologists are not specialists in treating depression, and if you have enough symptoms, a psychiatrist is the right one to see. it is very common, especially dealing with what we are going through...\nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

I was lucky and had a relatively easy time with it (AC, 4 rounds). I live alone and was about\n 50 minutes from the cancer center, I also wanted to drive myself. They suggested having someone with me at least for the first time, to see how I felt. Plus, I took ativan before the first chemo, so they did not want me to drive. For the 2nd 2, I did drive myself and it was absolutely fine. I took the ativan when I got home instead of before.\nI did not have a mast, so I cannot address those issues you asked about\n.

Back in the old days, any tumor over 1 cm was pretty sure to have chemo, mainly as a precaution. But now there is a new test that predicts the chances for recurrance and some people get to skip chemo that would have otherwise had it, we have a few gals here who were lucky enough to benefit from that test.\nAs for the type of surgery, no one can tell you what is right. Some people do not get the choice, based on the size or \nlocation of the tumor or tumors. In my case, I did have a choice and chose to keep my breast too. Others just want the breast removed no matter what. Personal decision. You can always have a mast later, but if you get a mast and have regrets, you are stuck. That is why I encourage you to take time to decide on the right approach for you. Others may skip the conservation because they know it will need rads, and they cannot make daily trips for 6 weeks if they live 2 hours from the cancer center.\nChemo is not that bad! Yes it is not fun, and you will most likely lose your hair and you are not being vain! That was very traumatic for me and many others, but then life goes on....losing it was terrible and then I was fine about\n it, just wanted to live my normal life.

I ate a small breakfast before, and they had graham crackers and muffins there. My RN said to eat a light lunch after...so the first time I ate a chicken sandwich. At 11:00 pm I threw up, and decided not to eat that again. Each chemo cycle except one I threw up at around 11:00 pm, but had no nausea or other problems. Next chemo I ate a salad and found that was not good either. So I moved to wonton soup and toast. the stomach just cannot handle much after chemo, so take it easy and see how it goes. I also found that I ate english muffins for breakfast instead of my usual bagel, which I could not eat for some reason.\nAs for head coverings, I wore a wig. I just needed to feel normal and \"not sick\", so it was psychological for me. I did not feel sick and I was not gonna let cancer treatment make me look sick either. You'll figure out what works best for you too.\nGood luck tomorrow....we'll be there!\nLori\n ",

While the doctor seems to be offering reasonable treatments, there is no way that you can be expected to make the decision.

Please consider going to a comprehensive cancer center if you can for a second opinion. Or sit down with your doctor and review the pros and cons of each treatment option...side effects, impact on your quality of life, ability to treat your specific tumors and \nlocations....what does the research show, which would he recommend for his own family member if she was the one fighting for her life?\nWelcome though, glad you decided to post.

This is evident in the follow up protocol for BC, where we go quarterly for the first 2 years, then every 6 months, and drop to annual at the 5 year mark. In some cancers, they use the word cure after 5 years. Like Lauri said, in BC, we just say NED...and NED after 5 years is a very good thing. Each milestone is another one to count, but 5 years is golden to us...plus it means I just finished tamoxifen, another major marker. This is the first time that I will go a whole year before seeing the onc, like a graduation....\nThanks again to all the well-wishers.

      "Content": " Katt-\n\"chemotherapy\" simply means chemical therapy. I used to work with a psychiatrist in a hospital who would start patients on psych meds and refer to it as chemotherapy. So under that definition, any drug could be called chemotherapy, or chemo. Traditionally, in the world of cancer, we refer to chemo as toxic fluids that are injected or given through IV. I think we often equate it with hair loss too, which is not always true.\nMost traditional chemo's that I am aware of for breast cancer are given intravenously. There are hormonal drugs, like Tamoxifen or Arimidex, which are oral. There may also be others, and I know other cancers may have oral meds.\nMy suggestion is to prepare for the fact that they may suggest IV chemo agents, but you may be offered another option....\nConsider bringing a tape recorder tomorrow too, it will help you quite a bit so you don't have to listen as hard.\nGood luck!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Juju-\nThe fact that they are SOOO negative is enough that I would drop them in a second. A hot second. The recurrance is too hard to predict and shame on them for not considering soooo many variances. A recurrance can be local to the breast area, in which case technically it does not change your life expectancy. A recurrance can show up at just one little spot and be easily treated and remain cancer free for years and years. Or a recurrance can be very responsive to chemo or other meds, holding stable for a long time. Also, if, big IF you got a recurrance say in 3 years, who the heck can predict what new treatments may be available that radically change the face of breast cancer?\nCathi has been stage IV with bone mets for over 5 years (or almost 5, not sure the exact date). Connie lived with bone mets for about\n 12 years before it began to spread to soft tissue. Becky lived for about\n 6 years with mets before it took her. And Deb has been about\n 20 or more years with mets to the sternum that was treated successfully and she has been cancer free since then.\nStage IV is serious, but can be managed as a chronic illness and not a death sentence. And years from now, who knows what will be available.\nSHAME on your doctors for talking to you that way and for assuming every case will be the same. It also depends on other variables, such as the tumor pathology and histology.\nWhat do you hope to gain by a 2nd opinion at Anderson? Would you travel there for aftercare and followup? Sue did that, traveling from Florida. Are you looking for a doc to tell you if there is more you can do now? If it were me, I would first contact another onc in your local area. Just make it a regular consult/eval, and see what he/she has to say. if you like the surveillance plan, stick with it. Before going through the hassle of going to ANderson I would encourage you to think about\n what it is you are looking for there.....Usually people go for another opinion like that when they are at a crossroads in terms of chemo or other treatment options. If you are done, I am not sure it pays.\nBut in a hearbeat, I would drop those negative doctors, and find someone who will fight for you.\nLori\n ",

I did chemo on a Tuesday (just had 4 AC). With the hour drive, blood draw, onc appt, the whole thing took most of the day for me. The chemo itself was a couple hours. I drove myself for the second two, but it is good to let someone drive you till you know how you'll react. I felt fine when I got home, in fact, I went out for lunch twice (till I learned that toast and soup was better those days). Not that I felt sick, but I learned that the stomach needs gentle light foods that day.\nAs for missing work, wait and see,.....I did chemo on Tuesday. I worked from home a little on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday and Friday I slept late and went in for a half day. I missed minimal work...so it is possible.\nTaxol is part of the taxene (or taxane??) family...in my day, in 2000, it was mainly given for those with positive nodes, but sometimes negative node gals got it too. I am not sure what the protocol is these days. \nAs for stretches, no one told me either...they said it was not necessary with a sentinel node biopsy. Not true! I wished I had stretched out more, as I had tightness when reaching back for a while. But with some easy stretching on my own, it did the trick. I recall that ACS sent me some material with diagrams and tools for stretching.\nHang in there, you're doing great! \nL&H,\nLori\n ",

I had an hour drive, so there was no point going to work then too. I tookWed off but worked some from home, and on Thursday& Friday, I slept late then went to work for a half day.

I worked normal weeks for the 2 other weeks in between. I did not need a port, but only had 4 chemo's. With a port, they can administer chemo faster. \nUsually the office co-pay applies when there is a doctor to see, and not the other visits. For sure, call your insurance and ask for a supervisor if you need to. Write down the name of who you spoke to, you never know when you need it again.

At the center where I went, they offered beverages and crackers or muffins. I watched tv, others may nap or read or enjoy a good conversation.\nI did AC and after the first one, went out to lunch. RN said eat light, and I learned that meant soup and toast, not a chicken sandwich. I found each treatment to be very similar in the time it took, the side effects, etc. Know that you will hear of a hundred side effects but you will probably only get a few of them. You'll want to drink lots of water and juice the first couple days, as the chemo can be toxic on the bladder. The pre-meds can be constipating, so take precautions at the first sign of trouble. \nChemo was on Tuesday for me, and around 10:00 each chemo night, I threw up. No nausea, just a little wave, and that was it. No nausea or vomiting at all the rest of the time. I was tired for a couple days but worked from home and went in to the office half days on THurs and Friday. Listen to your body...mine said to sleep. My onc encouraged exercise, so I walked a mile a day and I think it helped me to feel better and alert\n.\nI developed acid reflux around Friday of each week and it lasted a few days...other than that, business as usual. Some tastes may change, I was not interested in coffee during chemo but drank tea instead. You'll see what works for you....\nHang in there!

Definitely ask the surgeon about\n whether you can work after lymph node surgery. It is so random as to who suffers from lymphedema issues or not. If you had just the sentinel node biopsy you may be in better luck. My doc had said it was \"what gets cut\", not so much as how many nodes get removed. With a SNB, there is less nerve tissue that gets cut and less risk of complications. \nAs for chemo, I personally have no lasting side effects.

You have not had the mammo or US yet? Those can help in a diagnosis, but with IBC, a biopsy is the only way to tell. Researching is good, it gives you power and allows you to ask the right questions...but there are a hundred other things that this could be. \nAsk the doc why he suspects IBC at this point. If he is right, then getting a surgical consult right away is of the utmost importance. I would see someone ASAP and then if you are not sure, get a second opinion with a surgeon that you choose on your own. There is also a website called ibc.org (I think???)...you may find a link from a reputable source like the American Cancer Society's site. \nLori\n ",

You may wish to check the toll call post at the top to see a little more about\n us and where we are from.\nBreast Cancer is very treatable and even curable in many cases. This is not a death sentence, but the next few months will be a challenge. Doable, but a challenge.\n \nSome advice...take a tape recorder, a list of questions in writing, and a friend to the next appointments. Sounds like you did good though, and got a lot of information yesterday! The chemo does not necessarily depend on how \"bad\" the cancer is, but what kind. There are several chemo routines that cater specifically to certain kinds of cancer, that target certain cells or receptors that it may have. Hormone receptors, for example, are common and exist on 2/3 of breast cancers...and there are specific drugs (oral) that you can take to try and prevent a recurrance. Having positive lymph nodes will likely earn you more chemo, which is standard. 1 cm is a common benchmark for needing chemo, and mine was 2.5 cm...so chemo was given for me.\nThere are several newer chemos out there, but many of us oldtimers had a fairly routine cocktail. Prepare for the worst but do not expect it.....I found my 4 cycles of chemo (AC) to be pretty tolerable and I worked full time through most of it. I had virtually no nausea and no other bad side effects...not that I loved it, but point is it is not like they show on tv, and you may not be sick at all.\nThe docs will probably order several tests to help rule out spread of cancer and then go from there. I also did radiation the old fashioned way, daily zaps for 6 weeks. I am over 5 years out from treatment and doing great.\nOne step at a time, you have lots of info to find out first. Read what you can but not too much, and ask us lots of questions. We're here for you!\nHugs,\nLori\n ",

Like Juju said, there are lots of us \"younger\" women here, but age does not matter here on the internet, we're all here for each other 24/7.\nYour surgeon does the surgery, not the chemo...so he will not be a good resource regarding the treatment plan other than surgery. And if you are not comfortable, or even if you are, consider a second opinion once you see the onc too.\nMore questions to ask/ items to ponder....\n1. Did he get clear margins?\n2. Is more surgery recommended? If so, what? If mastectomy is recommended, can he connect you with a plastic surgeon if you want reconstruction?\n3. Consider getting copies of any and all reports (path, radiology, etc).\n4. Consider taking a tape recorder and a friend/ husband. No matter how clear your mind is, it is nearly impossible to hear it all correctly\nLots of questions will be for the oncologist, who is the one that will have the longer relationship with you. I read what I could handle, and not too much information, so I could ask the right questions. Take it easy with reading though, it is easy to get scared unnecessarily.\nYou sound like you are doing really well! Glad you found us, and please do not hesitate to ask us anything at all...\nLori\n ",

The surgeon is not going to be prescribing nor monitoring your chemo and it sounds like you are getting confusing information from the surgeon. It is hard, with so many doctors involved, but it is important to try and stick with the right doc for the right part of your care.\nChemo regimens vary, mine was one dose, with the next ones 3 weeks later. Some get them after 2 weeks now (under newer protocols) and other chemos have 4 weeks in between. Even others may have 2 weeks of oral meds and 2 weeks off, so there is a pretty wide range out there.\nWhat chemo are you doing? That may help answer some questions.\nLori\n ",

Some of the books describe a side effect from surgery to the breast as \"a cord-like vein\" that can run down your arm. It is called Mondor's syndrome, and from what I read, it can happen after trauma to the breast. It is not related to cancer, but to surgery. It is like a kind of phlebitis. Mine was tender to the touch and my arm was achy for a couple days. The cord-like vein lasted for several weeks but the pain was shorter-lasting. I only needed Advil, if that. I took baby aspirin to help keep my blood thinner, as I was also on Tamoxifen. \nIn the 5+ years that I have been posting, I have not heard of too many people reporting this side effect. But when it does come up, usually others chime in that they had it too.\nYou can go to google and put in Mondor's syndrome, or if you have Susan Love's breast book, she mentions it too.\nLori\n ",

I just put on a hat and bundled up and went....I think it did help my energy level. After tx, I got a dog and he gets me walking every day. SOmetimes we go for 45-50 minutes, other days (like rain) we just go around the block, but I read that those who walked after dx had a less chance of recurrance. You may look up the research on that topic for motivation...but remember that you will most likely be slower and weaker till you finish chemo. \nYou may also talk to a nutritionist at the U to see about\n certain foods that may help your energy and strength. I think I was allowed to meet twice for free with one at the cancer center there.\nMy advice is to take it slow and stay in the game, just to keep the routine going.

I was fine and dandy so I drove myself the other 2 times. They will likely give you steroids to help the side effects, which can cause jitteriness or insomnia.....for me, I slept like a rock the first 2 nights then the insomnia hit in, which is a lingering effect of chemo. I discovered ambien and still use it as needed today. I also found the jitters hitting the second day, and I took a half of an ativan to help with that. See? There is something for every side effect. Clear a space on your counter for pills and know that it is temporary. And remember to talk to the doc or RN if you have any discomfort, there may be no need to suffer.\nhang in there!\nLori\n ",

They are also mastectomy fitters so they are very sensitive and had private booths, most wigs were around $100-$150. I bought a synthetic one tht was curly like my own. Problem is that I looked like a country western singer and I hated it. I learned that longer is not better, it does not flow or hang properly at the collar. I took it to a specialist and she actually cut some of the rows of elastic out to make it smaller for my little face. It was better but I was miserable. I went to another place (the one who cut my first one) and paid $500 for a nice one with gorgeous and natural color, with beautiful highlights. It was straighter and very cute, but not me. I felt better in it though. It was synthetic and natural blend, and was very easy to take care of. I washed it weekly and gave it a quick pick with the brush and that was all. \nI learned afterwards that some wigs have a natural looking scalp for a part, which I wish I had. Mine was just a wad of hair at the part and to me, that made it scream wig. I was just so determined to look as normal as I could. \nI donated the first one to a wig bank and took the tax deduction, and same with the second one eventually. To me, money was no object, it was so important to be comfortable. \nWomen who go natural or wear caps or scarves look wonderful, but I was too afraid to do it. Go with what feels right, and don;t worry about\n what the others will think. You are the most important one here!\nLori\n ",

I am 36 now, never skipped a period or had any mood swings. I have gained weight though, about\n 25# in 5 years, slowly, maybe 5-6# a year. That is why I am eager to be done, but I have tolerated it so well. My onc said that younger women tend to have an easier time on it, and the closer one is to menopause, the more likely to have problems with periods.\nTamox can cause increased growth in the uterus. For sure, some gals have had problems with it, none of us will be the same. I too was not happy to take it, was afraid of side effects. But like Julie, I was happy as a clam to be able to take it and would gladly trade the weight for the added security in fighting the cancer.\nHang in there...you may have no problems at all with this drug....\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

My onc and rad onc had said that there is no reason I could not try to get PG, and that the jury was still out on the risk of PG after BC.\nThey also say that after ending Tamox, you have to wait 3 months to try and conceive.\nIn my case, I was single not even looking at pregnancy, so Tamox was never not an option. I am now in a relationship and we have talked about\n children, but I am not yet married so again, any pregnancy is in the future still for me. \nAnd my friend who was 40 when she conceived did so very easily, so it is not always hard to do at the \"older\" age. \nSome do consider the risk of blood clots and uterine cancer as a deterrant, and some have had problems with thickening of the uterus, but I was told that the benefits far outweigh the risks for me.

You might want to check Dr Susan Love's breast Book, which talks extensively about\n benign breast conditions and what to expect when going through the diagnostic process. But what I know is that the stats suggest 80% of breast lumps are benign, so odds are in your favor. Only 5-10% of breast cancers are \"inherited\", and not all types of cancers are part of that factor. And I think it is very common to get called back for another view, it may be nothing more than a shadow or movement (it is hard to stay still when they squish you like that!). Also, pain can be from anything, including cycle-related. Pain is not necessarily an indicator of cancer, not does it mean it is benign. Just that you need something evaluated, even though it could be nothing.\nDon't let the doctors tell you it is nothing until all avenues have been pursued, and don't settle for them to shoo-shoo you because you are too young. Hang in there, and try not to worry till you have more to worry about\n...\nLori\n ",

You will want to protect the breast for a while, just listen to your body. I slept on my right side (left was surgery) with a pillow to prop my arm and keep it off my breast. I was very alert\n and had little pain after surgery. I took either 1 or no pain pills, can't remember, but I may have just taken advil. Any activity with that arm will be a little harder. With my surgeon's agreement, I went back to work the next day. I could only tolerate gentle hugs but felt no reason to stay at home. Especially since I had my diagnosis when I left the hospital, I needed to be with people and try to remain normal and active. Your attitude and power of the mind will take you far.....I was so determined to get right back up and I have a high threshold for pain,.....so there are some individual factors. \nIt may also depend on the anesthesia. For my lumpectomy, I had a local with a twilight. For the lymph nodes, I had a general, which is a whole 'nother ball game. My surgeon allowed me to shower the next day, no restrictions.

If we all look back and wonder what would have happened if they did it that way, or worry that we did not do enough, we'll make ourselves crazy. You must believe that your doctors did everything they could for you at the time, and celebrate the new advances that may benefit others. I too may have been a candidate for herceptin.

What I am trying to say is there will always be something coming out that we wish we had had, but can't turn back time. Ask the onc about it, but try not to let it bother you if they say it is too late.\nAs for onc appointments, the standard is 3 months for the first 2 years, then 6 months for the next 3 years. After that, annual. Some docs may alter that schedule and differ slightly, but in general, it should be similar.\nHugs,\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Grammy, let me first offer you giant cyber hugs and then a big shout to say \"You are normal!\" IMO, you might tell your DH to back off, and tell him to \"just get on with it\" after going through what you went through. I guarantee he'd crumble. NO one can tell you how you should feel and I bet every one of us has been in your shoes. There is a big \"let down\" after treatment and a tremendous feeling of vulnerability sets in. That is the time we get scared, start second guessing ourselves and our docs and we may even cry a little. I was sure I had mets to bones, brain, liver and lungs within a year after tx ended, and I considered prophylactic mastectomies. (I did not really have mets). And I cried plenty when the fear got to me, and the feeling of \"OMG, did I really have cancer?\" \nI think time is simply one of the best healers in relation to cancer. It will get easier, but it takes time. And you may have a step forward and 2 steps back, it is all ok. I think many here would agree that the first year after cancer is a very frightening time, and no one else understands. They act as if you had a bout of the flu, and you are done so just move on. They don't know how this impacted us and rocks our very core and influences everything we do going forward. \nIn due time, it will be easier and you will think less and less about it. I used to tell myself that my goal was to go a whole day and not once think of BC. THen I thought as long as I post on the internet, that won't happen....so I needed to reframe my goal. I changed it to more of an acceptance and peace, than to trying to ignore it. BC changes every one of us, and we have to find a new normal. It may be hard, but you'll get there.\nAnd if you find that it is too overwhelming or the anxiety is interfering with your life, then it is time to talk to a doc or therapist about therapy or meds.\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Hi and welcome! Take a deep breath, and another...and yes you are normal! Finding a lump is very frightening, no doubt! Let me do my best to answer your questions. First though, congrats on losing 75 pounds! Way to go!!\nTo the best of my knowledge, size at this point has no indication of cancer or not. The larger it is, the more likely it has to come out, even knowing if it is benign. My cancer was 2.5 cm, but a lot of women had much larger tumors and others had much smaller cancers. If it is cancer, size does matter...but cross that bridge if you come to it.\n80% of breast lumps are benign, odds are in your favor. Most breast cancers have been there for years before we find them, with maybe the exception of calcifications found in a mammogram.\nStationary means not moveable, or fixed. It has nothing to do with solid or fluid filled. Fluid filled means a cyst and is most likely benign. A solid lump can also very likely be a fibroadenoma or other benign breast condition, so solid does not guarantee cancer.\nMost of us will agree that the waiting and the fear of the \"what if\" is the hardest part of the whole process. I was terrified during the diagnostic process. I sobbed during my first mammogram, which was at age 30 and after I had found my lump...I could not believe I had to go through that. Your feelings, whatever they are, are normal!!\nSome suggestions...write down your questions and bring a tape recorder to the appointments, as well as a friend or relative. That will allow you to ask all you need to and not worry if you miss what is being said. Also, consider getting copies of all your reports, for baseline purposes if nothing else.\nAs hard as it is, try not to worry. Stay busy and distract yourself. Yes it is scary, but worrying won't change the outcome. It either IS or IS NOT cancer (we'll route for the NOT), and worrying won't help....it will just make you feel worse.\nTell us about\n yourself if you'd like...you can read in the roll call at the top of the board about\n us...\nLori\n ",

Your aunt's dx at age 35 is much more significant. When they do a family hx, they usually ask if the relative was diagnosed early. Only about 5% of breast cancers are \"inherited\", and those diagnosed earlier are more likely than a post menopausal woman to have the \"inherited\" factor. Be sure to let the new doc know that your aunt was 35. Sounds like it may not have been metastatic though, or it would mean it did spread and she'd have likely had some treatment. But at any rate, hooray for 10 years cancer free!!!\nYou're on the right track, and you've taken the steps you need to advocate for yourself. Yea for you! Keep us posted...\nLori\n ",

I think they are beginning to use MRI more and more for screening in high risk women, but it is not the standard of care. I was diagnosed at 30 (now 36) and still get annual mammograms. I expressed the same concerns about the lack of effectiveness of mammograms for us younger gals. My surgeon still felt confident with it and never recommended anything but the mammogram. My other docs seemed ok with it too, so I made up my mind that since I do trust them, I needed to follow their advice...or find a new doc.\nI would recommend that you consult a breast specialist, not just an oncologist. Your local hospital or university hospital probably has a cancer center, which may have a breast clinic. At my cancer center, the breast clinic sees women with healthy breast conditions (non cancer) and high risk women. They will probably want to follow you more closely.\nGood luck,\nLori\n ",

Have not had anything except routine bloodwork and liver enzyme tests since then. I had a bone scan and chest xray when I had pain in my sternum last year, which was determined to be arthritis from rads. \nI found for myself, and have seen it in so many others here over the years, that during treatment, we feel EMPOWERED and strong and invincible. We know we are actively fighting the disease and it seems to be a much easier time. After treatment is a whole 'nother ball of wax. There is such a feeling of vulnerability and fear that sets in, and I think the reality of the whole cancer thing hits us.\nThink of the emotional roller coaster we go on....from learning of the diagnosis, making decisions, having tests and then treatment.....when it is over, all that emotion has to come out somewhere, and anxiety seems to be a common way for that to happen.\nI think my onc and his team subscribe to the point of view that Glenda mentioned. Some docs may do the markers after a diagnosis of mets, to help monitor the effectiveness of chemo. But for a stage I or II, they may have less value. \nMy advice, when you see the onc, ask about\n the follow up/ surveillance plan. There must be one, even if it does not include markers. If the plan is not suitable, interview another doc.\nAnd remember that you are normal! Life after cancer is very hard and not what we expected...and it takes a while to find a new normal.

We used to go to Menlo Park mall, I think that is where Pathmark and Bamberger's were! I was there again about 10 years ago to visit, and would never recognize the mall....but the old Menlo Pizza Sub shop was still there! I was in Livingston on business last fall, never could find Short Hills Mall.....kept missing turns and never figured out when a jug handle launced you another direction....also had trouble manuevering to make left turns when you had to be in the far right to hit that jug handle...still traumatized by it!\nWow, this surely must be a very frightening time, with the lung spots. Please let us know when you are having the appointments, like the one on Tuesday. We'll arrange for our cyber jet, Pink Cloud Express, to be there....so we can all come marching into the doctor's office with you, draped in pink feather boas and hoisting pink libations when they give you good news....\nAnd if the ativan does not do it, you may ask the doc for something else, or take a different dose. The anxiety is awful and there is no sense suffering worse than you have to...\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

I told myself that worrying was not going to change the outcome, and too much worrying was hard to tolerate...\nI think you are right, if they did a CB that it is not a cyst. It does not mean it is cancer either. A cyst is fluid filled and there are other benign solid tumors, mainly fibroadenomas. There are others that I am not sure about, but the fibroadenoma is common. In fact, 80% of breast lumps are benign. They may have an idea from the ultrasound as to what it is, but it is not definitive. In my case, the u/s report was highly suggestive of malignancy. And if it is benign, they still may wish to remove it....so \"next steps\" does not refer to something bad. \nTry to stay busy and wait till at least Monday to worry....\nLori \n ",

I was 30 when I went through it, and it sure was darn frightening. They do say that if it is moveable it is a good sign, but I have to say it is not always right. Mine was \"moveable\" but it was cancer. I am not trying to scare you, as about\n 80% of breast lumps are benign...I just don't want your docs to tell you not to worry about\n it just BECAUSE it is moveable and you are young. \nIt probably is nothing, but the only way to know for sure is more tests and a biopsy. They may do an ultrasound which will tell them if it is fluid or solid. FLuid means it is a cyst. Some people have more cystic breasts that change with their caffeine intake and the menstrual cycle. The doc probably told you to cut the caffeine just so you could see if it changes.\nYou are doing the right thing by checking it out...and when it turns out to be nothing, we suggest retail therapy!\nKeep us posted,\nLori\n ",

I think it was also a way for me to cope, to expect the worst...so that anything else would be like a celebration. Well they did the SNB procedure on me and actually got 15 little nodes, and all were clear. Since your path report mirrored mine, I am going to keep my fingers crossed that the trend continues.\nIn my case though, I had to wait for node results and would have had to do another surgery. Luckily it did not come to that.\nPCE will be there on Wed, you can count on it!\nLori\n ",

Planning to stay active is key too...if you plan to sit home and be sick, you will. And even if you feel punky for a couple days during chemo, you will rebound and be fine for a couple weeks. Yes there are other drugs besides tamoxifen. There are new drugs called aromatase inhibitors, but one must be post menopausal for it, and I am not. \nAsk what procedure they are doing to look at the lymph nodes....if they say they will just take a few, then probably a sentinel node bx. But if they say a full node dissection, please ask about the SNB or seek a second opinion. Your recovery will be faster and much less risk of lymphedema that way.\nAnd not all chemos cause you to lose your hair, but most do. You should set an appointment with an oncologist once they get the lymph node report. Even if the surgeon thinks you dont need chemo, the surgeon is a surgeon. He cuts, he does not treat cancer with chemicals. Let the onc make that call.\nAfter I saw the surgeon with my path report, I saw an onc and a rad onc, also had bone scan and chest xray. THen I took all my films and slides to U of M for a 2nd opinion and met with their team, stuck with that oncologist and surgeon.\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Randi-\nTHe chemo experience seems to be highly individual and unique. Try not to expect that all of ours will be yours, but preparing for some side effects will help.\nI did AC every 3 weeks. Each time was a carbon copy. I ate lunch afterwards and threw it up at about 10pm that night. I learned that soup was a better lunch on chemo day. But other than that, I had no nausea at all. I did feel tired and slept more for the first couple days. Seems there are meds to counter most side effects and more meds to counter those effects. Yes, the pre-meds can be constipating. Ask the RN about taking a stool softener during the week. It helped me tremendously when I did. \nI had chemo on Tuesday and took off work on Wed, then did a half day on Thurs and Friday. I never felt bad, just not always like myself. By 5:00 on Friday, the acid reflux set in and stayed a few days, so I took Pepcid. I used Mylanta for that too, and learned it can cause the runs....so use sparingly. I learned that salami and pizza are very bad foods to eat when having reflux issues, and I learned that bland diet like eggs and cottage cheese worked well.\nI kept a bottle of Purell hand sanitizer at my desk and in my purse to try and keep germs away. I avoided malls and movies during the period when my counts were at their lowest, and had no other real lifestyle changes.\nMy onc advised exercizing, esp during the week of chemo, and it did help my energy and feelings of normalcy. I walked a mile a day and it felt good. \nOn Thursday, my mint gum and water tasted like metal, and lasted for 2 days. My voice faded those days too, which was odd.\nI never got mouth sores, never needed injections and never had any real issues. \nI took a little ativan to counter the jitters from steroids, and then needed ambien to sleep. Insomnia is common during chemo.\nEveryone here will have a different situation, but just know that it can be very tolerable.\nI found the idea of coffee was horrifying and I drank tea instead. For some reason, I had trouble eating a bagel for breakfast and switched to English muffins.\nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

It does not make sense to evaluate new pains, but a chronic one definitely. You may consider calling your PCP. One thing I notice after cancer is that people tend to go to their onc for issues....presenting to your PCP for back pain and tenderness is very appropriate.\nMy doc does not do routine scans or tests or procedures. I have blood work done each visit with the onc and annual mammos. You should be on quarterly onc visits, and it may be alternated onc/ rad onc for surveillance for a while. Any other procedures are done on an as-needed basis. Seems to vary quite a bit out there, some docs do routine scans and other tests that mine does not. So...basically anything can be normal.

Most major hospitals will have a cancer center too, just does not have the CCC credentials. I hear local commercials for different hopsitals that have a cancer center, and with the prevalence of breast cancer, they are sure to have a breast clinic. That would mean that on a certain day of the week, for example, they see only breast patients.\nI go to the cancer center at Univ of Michigan. I know that people just like you come there for evaluation of breast conditions, even if it is not cancer or not known. Same with mammograms and radiology, the waiting room is full of regular screening folks, not just cancer evals. You might even go online for some local or regional hospitals to look up their programs. You would get details about their offerings. \nNot that we encourage folks to be hypochondriacs, but this is your body and your life, and we want you to be comfortable with the decisions made by the doc. \nOregon....you may be a first for us!

      "Content": " Randi-\nNo problem on the questions, that is what we are here for!\nLymph node involvement is different than the vascular/lymphatic invasion. There are tiny vessels that transport lymph fluid and should be the path that the cancer takes if it is going to travel to the nodes. From the path report, they are looking at the vascular system that was feeding and draining the tumor...which is different than the lymph node surgery. (BTW, are you going to have a sentinel node biopsy? It sure sounds indicated in your case and much better than a full node dissection).\nThey can say you are stage II, but there is more to learn. They will probably run some tests to make sure it looks clear in your lungs, liver and bones...which would indicate stage IV if cancer had spread. And the stage II can be IIa or IIb, depending on node involvement. We'll keep our fingers crossed for IIA, which means no node involvement.\nI was diagnosed a week before turning 31. I had a lumpectomy in November 99, and in January I had the re-excision and sentinel node biopsy. In February, I began 4 rounds of chemo (adriamycin and cytoxin, called AC). They were 3 weeks apart. Protocols have changed a little since then, so there could be some variation. Last chemo was 4/11/00, then a month later I did rads to left breast. That lasted till mid June and I started Tamoxifen the next day.\nChemo impacts us all so very differently. I was very lucky and felt that I had a pretty easy time of it. I took a couple days off work each chemo cycle and really never missed a beat. I worked through the whole thing, and managed to take care of my house and then even start the yard work in the spring. I have a desk job and no kids, so some things were to my advantage. I was determined to be as \"normal\" as possible and not miss anything due to cancer. I never felt sick from cancer and sure was not going to let treatment make me feel sick....although my hair did fall out, leaving me to \"look\" like I had cancer. And now....I have about 7 weeks left of Tamoxifen and did well on it too. My periods continued but I packed on about 20-25# during these past 5 years. Well, small price to pay if it kept me cancer free.\nYour prognosis should be really good! I was told that i had something like 85-90% chance of being cured, with chemo, rads and tamoxifen. Those are pretty good odds, and I am counting on being in the majority this time.\nL&H,\nLori \n ",

I don't remember this before.\" When I asked the gyn how he could tell the difference between a cancerous and normal lump, he said you can't, which is why you need to get familiar with the brest \"landscape\" and have changes evaluated. Everything I have read says the same....we are not necessarily able to tell a lump from normal tissue, but you need to know the landscape. Get familiar with every nuance....of course have anything unusual checked out....but if you know you have a lumpy area at 10:00 on the right side, then each month you will check for changes. Change is the key. They want us to know when there are changes...not that we have to know if it is a milk duct or a rib...but know the changes. \nYou may want to check with the American Cancer Society or Susan Komen Foundation. They have information on SBE and you might use that as a starting point. I think Susan Love's book has good info too.\nGood luck-\nLori\n ",

When I went to see the surgeon, she looked at the films and told me it was not a cyst, and that there was some concern about the \"borders\" of the tumor. We scheduled the surgery for the following week, having to wait for Thanksgiving to be out of the way. I got my news the day of surgery. Just be prepared that tomorrow might not bring any answers.\nAs for chemo and rads, if, big IF, you have to do it, you will get through it! I told the surgeon they should kill me rather than have me go through chemo...and well I had very little side effects and worked full time with minimal days off. Radition is a piece of cake and should not interfere with any activities. It is so doable! But 80% of tumors are benign, so odds are in your favor.....\nTavish is half Westie and half poodle, and my special baby.

I was advised to eat a bland diet when it was at its worst. I ate mild foods like cottage cheese and eggs. I also learned that salami, while not spicey, is not bland. I forgot about spices, just had been thinking of hot spicey foods.\nPlease ask the oncologist if OTC meds are not helping enough.\nSoothing hugs-\nLori\n ",

Under the stress and emotion, there is no way to really GET all of the information. I found it invaluable to go back later and listen to the tape recorded session, that way I could ask all my questions and not have to try and write the answers.\nDon't hesitate to seek a second opinion. In my case, I met with the surgeon and then the whirlwind started....meeting with oncologist, rad onc, several tests and then I took all the information to a major comprehensive cancer center...to get their recommendations too. I ended up switching providers because they were eager to do the sentinel node biopsy, whereas the original surgeon was against it. \nFor me, knowledge was power. I read what I could handle, and it helped me to ask the right questions and make decisions. Please don't feel the need to rush into anything either...if you are not sure what surgery you want, take your time and be sure. \nAnother tool is to get copies of all your path reports and test results. You can start a file and I found it very handy to have access to these, plus it was empowering to try and read and understand them.\nTake 1 day at a time....and know that you CAN do this!

      "Content": " Hi Randi-\nMy path report was very similar. I am pretty sure they will recommend chemo, since your tumor was nearly 3 cm (mine was 2.5, grade III, high mitotic rate, ER/PR+. Her 2 2+). They say that 1 cm seems to be the cut off for having a choice on chemo...your cancer is at best a stage IIA (if no nodes are involved and no mets). Plus the tumor was an aggressive little bugger....poorly differentiated is worse, it means the cells were really mutated and irregular....high mitotic rate has to do with rate of cell division. \n I asked \"the expert\" on the Johns Hopkins site recently on whether they could re-test my tumor for the oncotype DX and he said it would not matter, that the test is geared for smaller tumors....standard of care for a tumor of that size, I am betting, means chemo.\nNoting that the cancer was .1cm or .5 cm from margins has to do with getting a clean circle of tissue that surrounded the cancer. I forgot what, but there is a certain measurement that they look for to be clean....if they cannot get clean margins, for example if there is vascular invasion, they tend to do a mast. \nI had all margins clear at the first lumpectomy but 1 was \"close\". It was advised to have that resected and take another hunk of breast tissue, plus rads.\nHormone receptor positive is a good thing, it means you will probably get to take Tamoxifen or other hormonal med for a few years, to offer continued protection against recurrance. Lymphovascular invasion (mine was clear too) refers to whether the cancer cells are seen trying to make an escape...negative is good. I have read that having little to no in situ (encapsulated) is a good predictor, that an invasive carcinoma with high presence of in situ can mean higher chances for recurrance.\nThere are some good books, including Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and Dr. John Link's Breast Cancer Survivor Manaul...both have great resources on how to read and interpret path reports.\nBut seriously, I think yours is identical to mine in nearly every aspect.\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

Mammograms are not effective tools on young women due to natural density of breast tissue. They simply cannot see anything in a mammogram.... I was diagnosed at 30, and my 2.5 cm tumor was not visible in the mammogram for this reason. My opinion is that you should consult with your doctor and ask for a referral to a breast specialist, perhaps at a university hospital or a cancer center. (Cancer centers usually have breast clinics, where healthy breast issues are seen too, not just cancer).\nThat's all I can offer for now....good luck!\nLori\n ",

Partly because I looked rediculous in my wig. But then, it was over. I wore the wig to work and no one saw me bald (I lived alone), and once the hair started to fall out, I could not wait...I was already detached from it, it was just stubble by then anyway. So I never lost my hair, I took it off. Not easy, but for me, it helped me stay in control. That was the whole thing for me, I needed to be the one in charge, not cancer.

Some people are treated with chemotherapy, heavy duty cancer drugs that might likely cause her to lose her hair. Those are typically for 4-8 weeks, depending on the type and other pathology factors from the tumor. Some people take a hormonal medication for 5 years after diagnosis, but it depends if her tumor was positive for hormone receptors. If it was positive, she should be on Tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor, depending on her age and doctor's preference. There is another medication that is infused weekly, called herceptin...but it sounds like her cancer was found nice and early...not everyone is a candidate for herceptin, again it depends on certain traits of the tumor and her stage of cancer.\nBut it is also very possible and appropriate that she is on no meds at all.

Don't worry, it'll grow back.\" I knew it was not the place for me. That told me she really did not understand the emotions of what we experience. I went to a wonderful place in South Lyon but I forgot the name. It was Vanity Room wigs or something....they have private rooms and the ladies are so kind...this is all they do, is fit wigs and mostly for people dealing with chemo. They also are specialists in post-mastectomy fittings. The wigs there were priced well, and were synthetic hair. I tried to match my curly hair, and ended up like Barbra Mandrell or some country star. I hated it. I went to another person to have the wig fixed, after my regular girl cut it. We had to remove some stitching to make it smaller and not so overpowering for my small face. I still hated it, and we ended up getting a new one at Roxy's in West Bloomfield. The wig was half real, half synthetic, but much more expensive.\nWhat I ended up with was a beautiful color and different than my hair, sort of a Jane Fonda wispy look. I have heard that Susan's Specialty Needs in Ferndale is really good. I would not order one online, because you will want to try it on, feel it, see it, etc. You can also talk to the American Cancer Society, and ask for referrals to a wig bank if you need one for free or low cost. \nMy opinion is that if you are going to wear the wig, and not so much hats or scarves, you have to get a wig that you like and feel comfortable in. \nHang in there!\nLori\n ",

My diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma, which is garden variety breast cancer. For those with cancer, they look at whether the cancer has certain hormone receptors. 2/3 of cancers do, and those folks are able to take Tamoxifen to try and prevent or delay a recurrence. \nI do not know much about its use or indication for a high risk person, but you will find a lot out there. SUsan Love has a good book with lots of information too. It would be wise to read and research a little before seeing the specialist, to be prepared with questions, I would also recommend taking a tape recorder just to be sure you get all the facts.\nLori\n ",

My onc's nurse is Gini (short for Virginia), and I found early on that email use to communicate was a great way to go, especially for my surgeon when I did not know which procedure to do. I asked a ton of questions and got them answered when he was ready, and then I had a written document to study instead of relying on my handwritten notes. Yes, once they know the results of all the tests, they can tell you your stage. \nAs for genetic testing, please be sure to carefully consider the pros and cons. I asked about it, since I was 31 but had no family history. About 8 months after chemo, I went for the counseling, and then waited 6 months to do the testing. I needed to be sure I was prepared to handle a postitive or negative test result. Some people choose not to get testing...my opinion is if it will help you in some way, then go for it. If it helps to make a decision for surgery or chemo or future pregnancy, then do it. If you are not sure, you can always wait. I did the testing at the U too, Dr. Marajver was the onc, and Kara M was the counselor, who was wonderful.\nI had asked about doing a mast or full node dissection if they found cancer while I was on the table...my surgeon said they would not do that, since it required different amounts of time in the OR, it had to be scheduled in advance. \nMy surgical nurse was Roxanne, but I did not see her much after I was cleared from surgery. I still see the onc nurse every time I see the onc, and she is my main person with whom I communicate.\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Yes, Michelle, we got a great taste of Spring today, can you believe it? \nWhere are you having the surgery? From my experience, I had the lumpectomy on November 30, and then had a re-excision and SNB in mid January. The biopsy site was still tender, and I went to radiology first, for the radioactive tracer to be injected. Some places use both radioactive tracer and blue dye. The injections for the radio stuff hurt pretty badly, I remember being in tears. And he had to do like 5 of them. But it was over pretty quickly...then the doc used a massager thing to rub it in and move it through the lymph system. Then they took pictures which was very cool to watch.\nAfter that, I went back to the OR waiting area, got prepped and went in for the re-excision and the SNB. The blue dye part was done by the surgeon and I was under anesthesia by then. I had a blue stain on my breast for a while, and your urine will be bright blue at first.\nAs for down time, not much! I had minimal pain unless I tried to stretch. My overall functioning was not really impaired, and I went to work after a couple days. Range of motion was limited, but I could type and take care of all my household chores (dishes were tough since it was hard to lift the arm).\nIf you have activities that require lifting or strenous movement, you may need some help. But my advice is to assume the best....don't assume you will be laid up or incapacitaed. Prepare for it, just in case, but plan on a quick recovery. Ask the RN about stretches to do after surgery, tht will aid in recovery too. I just read an article in U of M's newsletter about fatigue and cancer, and exercising is key. Keep moving and keep busy, it will help you in the long run,....and of course, we'll be here for you!\nLori\n ",

Others here have lobular carcinoma, but most have a ductal carcinoma. Nurse Mikki also had lobular, and she posted a link to her great website on one of the recent threads to another new member.\nThere is much you do not know at this point, which will be needed to formulate the plan. They will need to know more about your cancer in terms of where it is and the traits it has, and whether they can get it with surgery or not. The cancer drug may be Tamoxifen or another oral hormonal based pill, which is not so bad, and can offer you protection from recurrance. Chemo will depend on a number of factors, but we'll help you through it if you need chemo. \nWe have Glenda and Stef who are also in NC, so you might be able to get a real buddy in your area. Lately it seems our new gals are in areas where we are too.\nI would also recommend taking a friend and a tape recorder to the early doctors' visits, you will not likely absorb everything they say at first.

      "Content": " Hi Laure....my real name is Laurel, but I go by Lori (I post under my dog's name, Tavish). You are doing everything you should be, and that includes feeling scared....it is normal. Gail and MK have given you great information. Yes they can make an educated guess from the mammo and u/s, but not for sure until they get it under the microscope. In my case, I was 30...breasts not large, but dense due to young age. Mammo was pretty inconclusive, but my u/s was also highly suspicious of malignancy. Mine was 2.5 cm, no positive notes, and they skipped the core biopsy, went right for removal. I am not sure why they chose that route.\nA benign tumor is more likely to be regular in shape and density and have even edges. Unless you are a radiologist, most u/s will just look like a white spot....try not to get wrapped up in reading the films ( I was sure I had cancer in my lungs, turns out what I was looking at on an xray was just my blood vessels).\nA lymph node can have cancer and not be that swollen, or a node can be swollen due to other issues (like an infection or cold)...so no telling what could be causing that to feel swollen.\nIf this is cancer, we'll get you through it! You will cry and have some tough times, but taking action and getting a plan is very empowering. And if it is not cancer, we'll raise a glass and toast in celebration. One step at a time though, try to focus each day without jumping to conclusions. \nI was diagnosed over 5 years ago and remain NED too.\nHang in there-\nLori\n ",

But sounds like you are handling it well, and your daughter's attitude will make it easier for you.\nI have heard that earlier onset of menses is a risk factor for BC later in life. The more times a woman menstruates, the more times ovulation occurs...or something like that. I have heard that is one reason that a woman who has never been PG is at higher risk...since we stop for 9 months during pregnancy, and if there are more than one pregnancy, then that is a couple years less of having periods and fewer times to ovulate.\nI have heard theories that our American diet contributes to the earlier development, with more fat and unhealthy diets....you might consider talking to her pediatrician to be sure he thinks everything is ok. THere are psychological implications that will come with this for her...being the first to develop, first to mature, etc. And the timing with your BC, she may have fears of getting older or developing further, fearing that she too will get BC. I think that they can even do treatments to delay or postpone menstruation in young girls, but I do not know much about it...and certainly I am not endorsing it,...just encouraging you to check your options for her sake.\nBut also, remember this is a beautiful event, as your daughter is becoming a little adult...\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

Are you with many positive nodes?\nI had great nurses in the infusion area, but obviously one nurse can make or break your experience. I knew that when I went to U of M from Providence that I would be more of a number than a name, but it was more important to me at that point to be part of a major comprehensive cancer center than a community hospital. Yes, I was part of the masses at the U, but each provider has been great. My surgeon was awesome, but he recently left to do a sarcoma program at Moffitt in Tampa.\nMy surgeon at Providence was awesome, but I had to leave her becuase she could not do the sentinel node biopsy for me, which was new back then. I did have my radiation there, loved my doc. They were all great there, and it was on my way to work, so I did not skip a beat.\nMichelle, I suggest keeping the appt at the U. You will be there all day and meet with several docs, and then you will be armed with information. You don't have to stay in treatment there, but it can be a 2nd opinion. Even though it was a 50 min drive for chemo and onc visits, I wanted to do the U because I just felt more comfortable to be with a major player...just in case I developed problems or needed more than the garden variety care. In reality, I got the identical tx that I would have at Providence or anywhere else.\nFeel free to email me if you want, just click on my name.\nLori\n ",

I had the same thoughts related to the what ifs....I immediately chose the lumpectomy, but while I know I can get a mast later, I could not change my mind once having the mast.

My docs thought it was overkill, and I guess I got it out of my system. It took a while, but I coped by saying that if I did not want the masts, I had to learn to live with my decisions and be ok with it.... and if I could not be ok, then I had to make a different decision. \nOnce you make your decision, go forward full speed ahead and don't look back. We can all kill ourselves with the \"what if's\" but it is no way to live.

Only way to know is to try it...but don't believe it if anyone tells you for sure what will happen to you.\nI would also suggest going for a 2nd opinion at a breast care clinic where they can have experts review the report and weigh in. \nGood luck,\nLori\n ",

I do not think it means 2 cancers, just 2 different stages of the same cancer. Just my hypothesis, so please ask the doc. The rad onc will want the results of everything before making decisions, as he may recommend further surgery or chemo. I saw an onc and rad onc pretty quickly after diagnosis, as a consult....then I went back to see him after chemo.\nWell, the good news is the move can take your mind of the cancer?

If this is negative, they may not take the rest of the nodes, and it will spare you a good deal of pain and grief in the form of lymphedema. In my case, they actually took 15 nodes during the sentinel node removal process.

When i was diagnosed, my tumor size (2.5 cm) was an automatic invite for chemo. 1 cm was kinda the cut off I think. Plus they will look at traits such as grade and other cellular details of the tumor, they will also consider lymph node status and margins (clear or not)....and they will probably take your age into account. And with a grade III tumor, don't be surprised of they mention radiation too.\nDefinitely consider that 2nd opinion, as you mentioned. The surgeon has no business recommending a treatment plan of just tamoxifen. He is a surgeon, not an oncologist. The surgeon removes the cancer and surrounding tissue, the onc treats the cancer systemically. Tamoxifen for 5 years is a good thing! \nKeep us posted...\nLori\n ",

Her battle was so short but fierce, I still shake my head and wonder why her and why me. \nIsn't it that Simon & Garfunkel song where they sing \"..there by the grace of G-d, Go I\".... \nL&H,\nLori \n ",

Cysts are fluid filled, and if you notice a change in them with your cycle, then it may be that they are cysts. I know of a young woman who has had several removed over the years, she is just prone to them. My recommendation is to get a copy of the mammogram report and the u/s report for your records. Take them along with the films to a breast surgeon and get a second opinion. Chances are they are nothing, but it is best to get it checked out for sure. You might also consider cutting down/out caffeine before that appointment to see if there is any change. This may help the doc in a diagnosis.\nYou may also want to reasearch fibrocystic breast changes/ disease. It is a common condition in young women.\nLori\n ",

Rads too, although most agree rads is easier. My appt time was 7:15 am, so I went on the way to work, and never skipped a beat. The breast got pink and the tissue was tender, the breast did get more firm. No permanent change to appearance. I had no burns, no blisters, no open sores...wore a normal bra every day, kept all daily routines the same. Today, the breast is still more tender, but is improved from the first days. My physical changes are mainly due to surgery. I had a lumpectomy with clean margins except one, so they did a re-excision and took another hunk out of my boob that was already smaller than the other.

I do not think you have a period while your ovaries are suppressed from lupron. I would ask the onc and ask the gyn.

You may also consider an appeal to Myriad regarding their income limits.

When I need more time or have an emergency, I expect the same special treatment. What I do have a problem with is when you sit for a long time and no one comes to say anything.

For me, I did AC, and had a relatively easy time. All of us had very different responses to chemo, some easy and some tough, most somewhere in the middle. My advice is to not suffer silently...if you have any unpleasant side effects, tell your doc, and they can treat it.

      "Content": " Hi Christina-\nLet me try and help. Breast cancer is breast cancer, regardless of where it spreads. If it spreads to the liver, it is still breast cancer, but it is called metastatic breast cancer. They can tell by looking at cells and determining what kind of cancer it is, through a biopsy.\nBreast cancer is not always easy to detect. The mammography, US and MRI were ways to look at the breast tissue to detect the lesion, or tumor. Not everything is detectable, unfortunately. When breast cancer spreads out of the breast, the first place it is most likely to get detected in in the lymph nodes. They filter the cancer (and infections or other impurities) before it goes elsewhere. We have lymph nodes all over our bodies...behind the knees, groin, clavicle area....\nSome breast cancers are not easily detected by tests, such as lobular breast cancer. Others are seen right away. My tumor was 2.5 cm, and you could not see it on the mammogram.\nYou asked about checking out the breast, the tests you mentioned are the ways in which they checked out the breast. They may have scanned other organs to look for cancer or done blood tests. And yes, if they cannot locate the cancer in the breast, but it is definitely breast cancer in the lymph nodes, then they will probably want to remove the breast.\nSurvival is very high, and usually depends on several factors. More node involvement may mean higher chance for recurrance. Nothing is a guarantee though...some with tiny tumors have it spread, and others with large tumors never have to deal with it again.\nI would encourage you to go with your mom to appointments and ask these good questions, then get a 2nd opinion. A major hospital at a university is a great place to start.\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Tamaralynn-\nYou are right, no one can tell you how you will feel. I did AC treatment 5 years ago, and tolerated it pretty well.\nI felt nothing when the chemo was being infused, and I went out to eat afterwards. Mistake there...I would suggest sticking to soup and crackers, even if you feel fine. While I felt well, my stomach rejected it a few hours later. By night time, I felt tired and a little wierd, but never had nausea. I actually felt a little restless from some of the pre-meds...but there are more meds to counter any negative side effects.\nDon't suffer in silence...whatever you feel or experience, there is probably something to lessen the symptoms. I would encourage you to ask the RN about taking a stool softener, as the meds can be consitipating. That and eating dried apricots worked for me.\nI found my symptoms were exactly identical on each of the 4 cycles...from the time of day that I would reject my lunch, to the time on Friday when I got acid reflux. My taste buds went wacky on Thursday and recovered on Friday....chemo was Tuesday and I worked half days on Thursday and Friday, then worked normally for the next 2 weeks. \nThe anxiety of not knowing what to expect is usually worse than the chemo itself....just be sure to drink lots of liquids and rest when your body tells you....\nHang in there, you'll do great!\nLori\n ",

I found my lump when I was 30 and it took some courage to call my doctor to start the ball rolling...so you have taken a huge first step!\nI have some recommendations.....you may consider making a list of questions, because yes, there is a lot of clutter in your mind at this time. Take a tape recorder to the appointments, so you can listen to the answers later, when you can take notes and have a clear head. My doc also sent me for a mammogram, then an ultrasound (because mammo did not pick up the lump), then to a surgeon. Just because they referred you to a surgeon does not mean there is more concern....just that most lumps need to get removed anyway, even if benign. And while they can tell a lot from films, a biopsy is the best way to really see what it is.\nThe mammo is uncomfortable, but just momentary pressure and discomfort. Nothing you can't handle. In the interest of time, I would see the surgeon the doc refers you to...ask if they would let that surgeon cut them or their spouses first. But take it into your own hands, and do research if you are not satisfied with the surgeon or want a 2nd opinion. I would also suggest getting copies of all reports, for your files, and for the ease of sharing information. \nThe mammo is read officially by a radiologist and a copy of the report gets sent to the referring doctor. They may refer you for an ultrasound too, just to get different looks at the lump. The surgeon should evaluate all the tests and films and then make a decision on what to do next....there are a lot of options.....\nTake a breath and stick around, we'll help you thru it!\nLori\n ",

I had a sentinel node biopsy 5 years ago, and I got a little swelling right by the scar. My scar is not in the arm pit, it is lower and just outside the bra-line, about 1 1/2\" in length. I have no idea how this size and position compares to others. My swelling was like a little pouch, sort of like a small egg or something. It was just a little puffy and it did take a few weeks to resolve. I never had any drains for my lumpectomy or SNB, so I wondered if there was just some fluid buildup.\nThe best advice I think any of us can give is to call your nurse or doctor if you have any questions or concerns at all.\nLori\n ",

Sorry for your recent diagnosis...sherryg was just diagnosed too, you will find great information under the recent thread started by her related to her new diagnosis this week.\nDenise's case is most puzzling to us all. She came to this board earlier this year with a breast lump and terrible luck getting in to see a breast surgeon for a biopsy. Seems in Wales (UK), they do things quite differently than here. After tremendous pain and swelling and months of waiting, she finally paid out of pocket to see a doc. Biopsy was negative for breast cancer. She began having seizures of unknow origin, and no one seemed to be treating them. Problem after problem, she finally got a diagnosis of brain tumors. \nNo one seems to know what kind of tumors she has, they cannot remove them or biopsy until the seizures stop. And they won't stop until they remove them. In the mean time,she has had 2 rounds of whole brain rads and another brain rad procedure, with some limited success. \nTo the best of my knowledge, we do not know if this is BC related or not. No one knows if the tumors are breast cancer that metastasized to the brain, if they are brain cancer, another kind of cancer or just benign tumors causing problems. Her case is most unusual, please try not to let it frighten you.\nAll of us here have had BC, and a few husbands of wives with BC have joined recently. We are in all stages of disease, and someone surely has some similarities to you. Please jump in and ask questions, you may want to start a new thread so that your post gets seen and we can respond.\nHugs,\nLori\n ",

Either have a needle remove some fluid or just have it out. \nI have not tried this, but I hear that reducing or eliminating caffeine can have a big impact on breast pain, as well as herbal supplements of evening primrose.

      "Content": " Sherry, we do understand....and making the medical decisions is so hard, especially when combined with the paralyzing fear that comes with diagnosis. If onc is recommending a mast and surgeon is recommending a lumpectomy, I would definitely consider a 2nd opinion. I went through the University of Michigan for my 2nd opinion, went through the breast clinic there. I brought my slides, path reports, films, everything...and had to watch a film on surgeries, then met with the multidisciplinary team. I met with the RN, the surgeon, the onc and declined the rad onc (had it at a different facility due to proximity).\nI was offered a choice on surgeries for the breast and the lymph nodes, and I got lots of opinions, mostly leaning the same way. I asked the docs if I had been their sister or daughter or wife, would they feel comfortable with the options I chose, and they said yes. Then I spent the Christmas holidays emailing with my surgeon and asking more questions to help me be sure. Most likely, there is no need to rush.\nMy initial diagnosis and lumpectomy was 11/30. All margins were clear except one that required a re-excision. With the holidays adding to the delay, I had my re-excision and sentinel node biopsy on 1/14....I had several weeks in between. Chemo started 2/8, so it was not a quick process.\nAs for the kids, do you live near a Gilda's Club or other cancer support community? or can you talk to the social worker at the hospital? They can offer some guidance and tips on what to expect and how to talk to the kids...mostly the kids will be scared for you, and scared how this will all impact them (if Mom is sick, who will take care of me?) They may also be concered if you will lose your hair or how your appearance may change...but I have never heard of a bad outcome here! Kids ARE resilient and they just need time to absorb and 'get' it. And to learn that cancer will be a chronic illness, just a bump in the road...\nHugs to you-\nLori\n ",

Definitely ask about the sentinel node biopsy instead of the full node dissection. While she may need the full one later, start with the least invasive. Getting a copy of the path report and any other reports is key too...I carried all my stuff in a big folder to each doctor. I also support the use of a tape recorder, and found it invaluable. I went in with lists and did not have to worry about writing down the answers.\nYou will also need to know the hormone receptor status, which has treatment implications. She may be referred to a radiation onc and a medical onc too, and may be referred for more tests (such as a bone scan). \nThere are some good books that help explain the path report. Susan Love's Breast Book and the BC Survival Manual (Dr Link) cover these very well.\nGood luck!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Laura-\nFrom just feeling it, yes, it is common to confuse a fibroadenoma with a cyst. A sonogram should tell the difference thouch. A cyst is fluid filled and a fibroadenoma is solid, so they will look different on the ultrasound. In my case, the sonogram was diagnostic and could easily tell it was cancer. A fine needle aspiration is the first place to start. if it is fluid, it will collapse and perhaps never come back. My thought is to follow through with this doc, and then determine if you need a second opinion.\nThe lump needs to be looked at, no matter if solid or fluid. It may need to come out, but if the ultrasound showed it was a cyst, then a needle may be the best place to start.\n80% of breast lumps are benign, and maybe even more so at your age. But you are smart to check it out, no matter what, and don't let them tell you you are too young.\nGOod luck-\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Yes, this certainly is a concern. There is a great resource book called Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. In it, she mentions this very issue. What I have read is that it is not a good idea. After a diagnosis of breast cancer, usually hormones are not advised. This means birth control pills, estrogen for menopause, etc. In order to harvest eggs (not sure if they can do just eggs), there is a significant amount of hormonal treatment one must endure. It might be hard to find a doctor willing to administer those medications to a BC survivor. In addition, she would have to have injections and hormonal treatments if they were to plant an embryo in her at a later date.\nPlease help her know that there are other options too. First of all, her fertility may not be impacted. I did chemo at age 31 and 5 years later, have not skipped a period. The BC diagnosis is very new to her right now, and she really needs time to get a plan of attack. There will be time to talk about children, whether she can have them naturally, or via adoption, surrogacy, foster parenting, etc.\nLori\n ",

I once heard that 1/3 of all node negative women really are cured from surgery alone, but the problem is that no one knows who fits into that 1/3 or the 2/3....so most of us get chemo. \nI recently heard they are looking at genetic tests that can help determine who is likely to fall into which group, but for now, we follow doctors' recommendations. \nIt is common for chemo and or tamoxifen to put us into menopause, especaially when you are closer to menopause. I was 31 when I did chemo and I never missed a period, but others will tell you that they went into chemical menopause (chemopause). Others go into temporary menopause.

You might consider a local support group, through a hospital or your cancer center, or even a place like Gilda's Club (depending on where you live). Have you had reconstruction? That might help as well, to give you the look and feel of real breasts.\nThere are also a lot of books on the subject that might help too. And you will probably get some good replies here from those that have been there before.\nCombined with the loss of your job and the holidays, you might also consider finding support with a counselor if the above methods fail...you have had some significant life stressors, and no sense in struggling alone if someone can help you get better faster.\nGood luck,\nLori\n ",

Just that initial shock, then it was like, \"OK, let's get on with things!\". I am a take charge kinda gal, and for me, I had to take charge of this too. Before it started to come out, a couple days before, I had someone shave it off. THat was one of the hardest days of my life, I sobbed and sobbed. My wig looked awful. Then when it started to shed in the shower, I rubbed most of it out. I did not want to lose it slowly...but by that time it was just stubble and I was already detached from it, so I did not care. \nGetting ready in the morning was much easier, for sure! Shower, makeup and go! I ended up getting rid of my wig after a couple days and got a new one which made me feel much better. I donated the old one to a wig bank, and and superstitiously have kept the other one. It is 5 years old now, I think it is time to let it go too!\nAnd shame on those that tell you \"It'll grow back!\" Yes it will, but it does not acknowledge the pain you feel now. Allow yourself to mourn if you need to, and then this should be the last hard pill to swallow.\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Sherry, there is so much to consider here, it is just not as simple as getting a blood test. Like Bev said, they only can test for what they know exists. We have BRCA 1 and BRCA2...when will they find 3 or 4? I was diagnosed at 30 with no family history, but my ethnic background combined with my young age placed me at higher than average chance of having a mutated gene. \nI read about it and asked my doctors and nurses. They advised me to wait on testing. In hindsight, I agree. There is soooo much going on now, you do not want to make a decision based on emotion alone. \nIf I had it to do over again, I would do it the same way. Waiting was a good thing, no sense adding to the confusion and decision making. I finished my chemo in APril, and went to a genetic counselor in October. I would highly recommend the counseling. You will learn the pros and cons to learning of a positive or negative test, you will learn how the information can or cannot be used in future, and they will give you an estimate on your chances of carrying a mutation.\nHad I tested positive, I would have had bilateral mastectomies... but I was not prepared to do that at the time of initial treatment and diagnosis. There is time to do the testing and counseling later, it is a tremendous amount to go through right now.\nMy opinion is to wait. If you do a lumpectomy now, you can do a mast later. The size and grade of the tumor will dictate whether you have chemo, the genetic testing will not likely influence that.\nBe careful of information overload.....take one step at a time. You may want to check out FORCE, a website devoted to genetic issues and cancer. i think it is FORCE.com.\nLori\n ",

Yes, she could have a hard time and yes, she could get sick. My chemo was on Tuesday and I went to lunch afterwards (mistake). Felt fine all day till 11:00, then nausea for about 5 minutes, I threw up once, and never had a stich of nausea again. I took off work on Wed and was just tired. I went to work half day on Thursday and Friday. I was determined to live a normal life and not let cancer or chemo take one minute from me. This went on for 12 weeks, 4 times. \nI did radiation, took the 7:15 am time slot and went to work right after. I have no children to look after, but as a single gal, I took care of it all myself.\nI really can't comment on the other issues, but agree with Jo-Ann and Lauri. Make the decisions as if BC was not in your life and carry on. Do check on the insurance though, no sense in going bankrupt.\nAs for statistics, there was less than 1% chance that I should even get diagnosed at age 30, but here I am. Somebody has to be that teeny percentage, and it was me. Even if they give her 10% chance to live 10 years, who says she cannot be in that 10%? Jo-Ann is living proof of that. The stats are just stats, just a way to try and predict what will happen...but your wife is not a stat, just a person. \nIt is my opinion that it is often harder on the caregivers and the family members than those going through it. I was able to fight actively, while others had to sit and watch. Take cues from your wife, and don't hold back. Don't feel like you need to be the strong one, be who you are and be there for her.\nLori\n ",

A couple people just did things, without asking, which was very supportive. I was lucky in that I did not need much, but I had support when needed. One friend just said she was taking me to chemo, she did not ask. Someone else made me a meal. If Amy has kids, you may just tell her you are coming over to take the kids or entertain them. Or bring a meal,or help with laundry. Listening is good too...she may want to talk not so much about feelings, but what is happening to her (on an intellectual level)...and she may want someone who will just listen.\nI also suggest positive stories (like ours)...to help give her hope. And if she gets bad news, listen to her fears. Or offer to go wig shopping with her ....\nAnd of course encourage her to come here if she wants!\nLori\n ",

      "Content": " Oh, Sherry...I hope you can feel my arms wrapping around you now....My diagnosis at age 30 hit me like a ton of bricks. I got the diagnosis when I did the biopsy and had to wait a full 8 days for the path report. Path report in hand, I was empowered. I knew the details, and devised the plan. I needed more surgery, as the lumpectomy got all of it except 1 margin that was 'close'. I had to decide also on mast vs lump, and full node dissection or sentinel node bx. At that time, the SNB was quite new and not as widely used.\nI saw the onc and rad onc to get their opinions on plans, then got some tests for staging (bone scan, chest xray, etc) and took all of them to the cancer center at Univ of Michigan to get a 2nd opinion at their clinic. They confirmed what all the other docs said, but supported the SNB (first surgeon was not in favor of it for me). I took a couple weeks then to make a decision...so in all, a month passed from point A to B. \nPlease ask the surgeon what time frame you have. Usually with breast cancer there is a little time to research and make decisions. Not everyone agrees, but I got great information from Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. I read whatever I could related to my situation, and it helped me ask the right questions and understand the answers. I made lists of questions and took a tape recorder and a friend to my appointments. The recorder was invaluable, and it is my #1 suggestion. My #1 1/2 suggestion is a second opinion. You are being faced with some major decisions right now, and you want as much information as possible.\nI had the 2nd lumpectomy and am lopsided, but I did not care that much. In clothes, you can hardly tell. Bra shopping is tough, but I got some that work. If you are not sure, I recommend going with the least amount of surgery...you can change your mind and get a mast, but you cannot change your mind once you do get a mast. If you are sure, go for it and don't look back. Lots of the gals here had a mast or a bilateral mast and they do not regret it at all...just the key is to be sure in your decisions.\nFor me, information was power. I needed it to take control. You will figure out what you need to cope and be empowered, we all are a little different.\nAnd SHerry, many of us here are several years out. It can happen to you too! You are entering a whirlwind right now, but there is another side. Chemo and rads are very do-able, and we'll walk you through when the time comes.\nHang in there hon!\nLori\n ",

The lump could be normal lumpy tissue, and a coincidence that there is ternderness there. 80% of breast lumps are benign, so the odds are in your favor.\nAnd as JoAnn said, all of us had different experiences. My tumor was round and firm, felt like a walnut in oatmeal. It was distinct, but not particularly tender. 30 of us will probably report about 25 different scenarios, so there is no way to tell.\nChances are this is nothing to worry about...but please do not be satisfied if the doctor just tells you it is a cyst and to go home since you are low risk. Only 5% of breast cancers are the \"inherited\" type, and many of us here are in our 30's. The doctor cannot tell what it is without doing tests, and he should start with a mammogram and ultrasound. \nOdds are in your favor.....but be your own best advocate!\nGood luck,\nLori\n ",

Rememeber, the counseling is just information and discussion, no test. The counselor could provide you the information that might change your mind and decide to do testing, or it might firm up your decision to not do it.\nFrayda is right, with HIPAA out there now, it is hard to even get your own records! I paid out of pocket for my tests so that the results would not get to insurance at all...and when I tested negative, I submitted the claims and got it covered. But that could be another option...pay out of pocket to keep it private. \nMy genetic counseling was done at U of M, through the Cancer Center, but the genetic folks keep a totally separate record. Even my oncologist could not get to see my records, although it was in the same facility.\nAnd even if, big IF, you tested positive, there is no guarantee your kids would inherit the gene. So your test results should have no impact on them. I would encourage you to meet with a counselor in the genetic risk area, and let her/him answer your questions. The worst that could happen is nothing...you can decide not to do the testing after meeting with the counselor. I waited 6 months to get tested after I did the counseling...\nAnd it is OK if we disagree! I still like ya!\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

That is what happened to me, I was 30, and mammograms are not the best for young women due to dense breast tissue. In my case, the u/s gave lots of valuable information, whereas the mammo showed nothing. \nSince you do have a lump, it is also possible that the mammo picked it up, and this is a way to get a better look at what it might be and get the position.

Even in that case, they say there is always the possibility that cancer cells have eeked out...If I recall, 1/3 of women who are node negative can still have cancer cells that are \"out there\"....but when I did chemo, they said they had no way to know who that 1/3 was, so we all got chemo. My point is that your onc may not have told you much different in other circumstances. \nDid they talk about tamoxifen (or femara) and or radiation? Those can buy you percentage points too, to reduce the chance of recurrance. Stats are just that...and can only try to predict what may or may not happen. You may have a 20% chance of recurrance, but that also means 80% chance of being cured. \nDo you have Gilda's Club near by? It was founded by Gilda Radner, and there are locations all over the US. It is a free cancer support community, offering networking, support, crafts, activities, dinners, lectures, childrens' activities, etc. You may want to check online for locations.\nHang in there, you sound great!\nLori\n ",

I am in my last 8 months of Tamoxifen, which followed 4 chemos of AC and rads to the breast (had lumpectomy).\nThis debate to have an oopherectomy or not comes up often and you are sure to get lots of comments and great information. How old are you? If you are pre-menopausal, this will throw you into sudden menopause, which can be difficult on many people. There are long term changes that will be irreversable. My opinion is to talk to your onc and then get a 2nd opnion. You might consider chemical menopause, in the form of injections, to shut down your ovaries, and give it sort of a trial run before opting for surgery.\nHow much benefit will you get if you have an oopherectomy? If your tumor was negative, how much will this reduce your chance of recurrance? Of a new occurance? these are questions to ask the doc. You will have to decide if the consequences and side effects outweigh the risk of not doing surgery.\nThis is not easy, and I would encourage you to research as much as possible, weigh all the pros and cons, get feedback and then do some soul searching. I know of gals who regretted their decision to remove the ovaries and gals who were did not regret it. There is no one size fits all.\nGood luck-\nLori \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Krista, welcome! Sorry you are going through this scare right now. About 80% of breast lumps are benign. Lumps can be solid (tumor) or fluid filled (cyst). Most cysts are benign, and most tumors are benign, called a fibroadenoma. There are a few other benign conditions too, and cancer is one of the least likely situations. You are right, family history has little bearing. Having a history in the family might make you more sucesptible, but regardless, it is most important to check out.\nA mammogram is an x-ray. They will position your breast between two (cold) plates, and they will manipulate and move you to be just right. Then they will apply compression and your eyes will widen, you will say ouch, and then it is over. It is momentarily uncomfortable. \nMammograms are standard as first line in trying to diagnose a problem. Some things are not visible on a mammogram, either due to dense breast tissue, shadows, or for an unknown reason it is not picked up. Don't freak if they need to do a repeat picture..it does not necessarily mean they found something, but often there is movement and they need a clear shot.\nUltrasound is painless. They will rub jelly on your breast and run the wand over the area and take pictures on the screen. The ultrasound can help determine if it is solid or fluid filled, can help locate the location in the breast...in my case, at age 30, my tumor was not picked up on the mammogram but was plainly visible on the u/s.\nLumpy breasts are common. Have you felt these before? Most likely it is nothing, but please don't let anyone brush you off telling you that you are too young or not at risk. If you are a woman, you are at risk. Best to just get it checked out. I would also recommend that you obtain copies of the radiology reports for your own records.\nGood luck,\nLori\n ",

You may also want to ask if the doc or RN will email with you if needed, my surgeon gave me great information that way....and then it was already written down in the right way for me to re-read.\nI asked about every side effect under the sun, and the RN chuckled and just told me to wait and see what happens. She was right, I did not experience most of what I was afraid of. If you do have a single side effect, ask how to combat it...no need to suffer in silence. And for nausea, there are a lot of drugs and cocktails, so if one does not work, please ask for a change.\nMost of us, I think, will agree that the fear and anxiety of the first chemo is worse than the treatment itself.

While I am sure Mel's DH counseled the boys as a wonderful caring father, who also has a social work degree, the value that Hospice could potentially bring is priceless.\nWho knows, maybe the hospice team in her area is not good enough, and they might fear negative comments or substandard care. I don't want to second guess them, as I cannot know what they are going through. I hope that Mel's family continues to have the strength they need to continue to make the right decisions for their family.\nL&H,\nLori\n ",

I would encourage you to keep close tabs on your mood, and maybe ask someone close to help monitor, but I bet you will do great! Most of us that have gone through chemo are likely to say that the fear of the unknown is the worst part of it. Once you get through it the first time, you will pretty much know what to expect. I did 4 AC and was so fortunate, with very few side effects. I was prepared for the worst, and was happy to not come close to it. I worked full time, minus about 3 days during each chemo cycle. It is just me, no kids to take care of, which also made it easier. But I never was nauseous, never felt puny or sick. A little tired the first couple days and then back to normal...with a few extra little side effects, such as acid reflux.\nNo guarantee you will have anything the same as anyone else. Just be aware of what 'might' happen, but do not expect them all. And the fear of the unknown is usually much worse than the beast itself.\nAnd don't forget...we have been there done that, and we'll help you wherever we can!\nLori\n ",

Perhaps ask about the bracelets for nausea? I am not sure the details, but they use them for motion sickness and I think Chris used them to help her with chemo. You might also consider a 2nd opinion after you get your test results back from the CT. \nIf only we could get you feeling better for a couple days, I think you would have a renewed boost of morale and will to fight.

I often would be the one to raise my hand and ask a question if I did not understand. \nOne day, when I acutally did 'get it', my teacher interrupted the discussion to ask me specifically if I understood. I was mortified. She then asked if I knew why she called on me, and of course I said \"no\". She told us that the reason was because \"chances are, if Lori did not understand, several others did not understand too, and Lori was the only one who would ask questions.\"\nSpeaking my mind is not a problem, so don't necessarily count on me to be the voice of reason!\nL&H,\nLori\n ",
