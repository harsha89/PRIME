      "Content": " so my first day. I only take one med (zoloft), hysterectomy 2011 but still have ovaries. As I am reading this its making me nervous. The last 2 to 3 weeks I too thought I pulled a muscle in my left breast because of moving....but now I am re thinking....I had my last mammo 8/2011, I have had dense tissue in my right breast for nearly 7 years with no change. But like I said the last two to 3 weeks have been having this burning sensation that last a few seconds or up to a min of very odd to explain sensation. I had shingles back in 1996 and that is the same sensation I am having in my left breast but no signs of that...but the sensation of the burning is there. I even noticed that if I brush it up against something or remove my bra that sensation happens. I can bring it on, it just doesnt happen on its own. Can you repost what steps I should be talking to my physician about\n: I dont want to miss something Im not familiar with when discussing this with my dr.\nThere is no family history and do annual Mammo's....so now I am freaked out. Im almost 46 I am hoping its nothing but want as much info as I can so the dr. doesnt blow me off either...\nThanks everyone any help or suggestions would help *(and no recent illness or current illness either)\nblessings.....

      "Content": " Cathi, \n \nI came across your story of your daughter having cancer and I am truly sorry. Just know that God is in control. I have to share with you some very important information on something that has been answered prayer. Just recently a major scientific and medical discovery of how the body heals and repairs itself. I have had a life threatening disease that has been totally reversed. This new technology is safe and natural and is very effective in cancer. I just had a friend have her blood work come back normal after suffering from leukemia. I love sharing this with people it could help and I would love to offer more help to you and your daughter, just let me know.\n \nGod bless you both,\n \nKevin ",
