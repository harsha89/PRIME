      "Content": " Hi Jules, Haven't posted here in awhile (hello, everybody!) but I am in the same boat as you.  My five years on Tamoxifen are up this coming summer and my onc. wants me to go on letrozole but I am not menopausal.  I did Zoladex (similar to lupron) for two years after chemo and still had no periods for a year after I finished the shots, then all of a sudden they came back.  The Zoladex was pretty easy for me, I had a few hot flashes in the beginning but that was it.  They inject a little \"pellet\" into your belly and it takes just a minute of two. The main drawback of it for me was the expense (couple thousand dollars a shot!) and the inconvenience. I had to go every three months, but now they are not recommending the 3 month shot anymore and you would probably have to go every month.  My onc said I could do the shots again if I wanted but sounded like she would rather I have the ovaries out.  This is a tough decision for me, because I was trying to get pregnant when my cancer was found, and I think somewhere in the back of my head I still have not given up on that idea. I just met with a surgeon and he said I am a good candidate for having them removed laprascopically and recovery time should be about a week.  I'd be happy to talk further if you want to. Good luck with your decision!\n ",

Stage IIB with 6 positive nodes, ER/PR+ lumpectomy then mastectomy, chemo, radiation, Tamoxifen for 5 years, Zoladex for several years, prophylactic oophrectomy (sp?) in December 2005 so I could take Femara which I started immediately and am supposed to take for five years. Lived in NC when diagnosed, relocated to PA (Philly area) in August 2005. So far, so good! Happy and grateful to be here....I am living proof of the value of a second opinion and getting care at a top-notch facility! Not to mention an incredibly supportive DH, sister, and many friends.....
