    "Content": " Hi I'm new to this site but not to this pain. Had left mastectomy 2009 with recon that had to be \"dismantled\" because of infection. The pain was unreal, and until everything resolved (six months) I had no idea even where the pain was coming from. My PS told me \"you're going to make you crazy...and me crazy if you continue to come in so often\". I believed him and did not return for three weeks but it was torture. Not that he gave me any relief. But i didnt know where to turn, driving hurt so bad, could have anything touch my left trunk/chest, only one boob and no way to disguise that thank goodness I'm small and slim. For three years even my onc told me that this procedure just hurts, i.e., stop complaining? Have tried many things most haven't made a dent, but for me a cold pack on chest, sitting in a comfortable chair, wearing silky pjs, and 2-4 mg dilaudid taken together is the only relief I get once the pain sets. Things that set off the pain are wearing a prosthetic**my version see below** even for 20 minutes while in a car, in weather that elevates my body temperature. I.e., getting into a parked car in a parking lot in summer. That does me in. Stress is real bad and any combination of the above is a killer. So I try to do all my driving together, keep body temp even, wear prosthetic as little as possible. I do take the dilaudid if I need it, 1-2x per week. Am really trying to have better control over my day, work out, and pace myself so as to not take pain killers. But i do appreciate that they are the only real help I have when it's bad. ***if anyone else can't stand to use a prosthetic, I found an easy way to sew snaps on a very light cami to snap on these very soft light bra cups I purchased online. I snap them on the outside of the cami and then wear my shirt over. Not perfect but works In a pinch. \nI feel that PMPS is a travesty, a dirty little secret that the cancer soc. doesn't want outed so that women will continue to come forward with early detection. \nNot fair to us. Most people believe all the celebs on tv that are better than ever after bilateral and boob jobs, that a mastectomy is almost nothing at all, and we suffer in silence. Where is the money being funded to find a cure for this?\nI did not even know this had a name until my pain doc changed a few months ago and she told me. ",
