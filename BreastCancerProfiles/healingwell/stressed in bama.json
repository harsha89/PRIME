      "Content": " Â I can't speak for anyone else but I was diagnosed with breast cancer last year and had a lumpectomy. Said didn't need chemo but about\n 30 radiation treatments. They told me also they didn't see anything more in the realm of margin and my lympnodes were fine.I am sure theyy gave you tons of literature to read. I read it several times and I pointed out to them that their own materials said the chances were the same with or without the radiation. There is no guarntee that it will do what it is intended to do.(radiation). We all have to make our own choices and I wish you the very best in whatever you decide to do. \n ",
