    "Content": " I am 23 years old with one child. I recently found a lump in my breast. I have no health insurance but I will in 7 months after I am married. I am worried about\n getting it checked out before and then it not be covered due to being a preexisting condition. I am a little concerned though. My family has a history of cancers on both sides with three aunts with different forms and two grandmothers and my mother had uterine cancer. It is about\n 1 inch long and 1/2 inch wide with no pain. It does not have easily defined edges and is not smooth. It is hard and moves slightly but feels like it moves with the tissue underneath and not by itself. I recently lost 40 pounds about\n 5 months ago and also stopped breastfeeding around the same time. I'm not sure if that factors in or not. Should I be worried? ",
