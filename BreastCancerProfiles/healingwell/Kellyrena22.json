      "Content": " Hi, my name is Kelly and I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at the age of 29. I have her2+ ductal carsinoma in situ. And I was diagnosed last year. I have had a full mastectomy and I've underwent 6 months of chemo and herceptin. My 1.5\" mass in my breast had eradicated and what had spread to my liver was also no longer detected under per scans,also no detection in lymph nodes where three were removed. however, as of two days ago, my Oncologist decided to take me off the herceptin...says due to the long term heart affects, it's better to keep close watch and go from there. That was also right after he told me that he has never seen a stage 4 breast cancer survivor NOT have a recurrence. And here when I thought I was (kinda) cured....he made sure to scare the crap out of me and said that my cancer is not curable they just have treatments to prolong my life! I know this is a serious and very aggressive disease but I'm now feeling desperate due to being off all treatments. I feel as if I just gave myself a death sentence. Can I please have some opinions? Should I brace for the worst and just accept that I may not be here much longer? Should I at least get back on herceptin and risk the heart problems that it may cause but at least the herceptin was doing its job by keeping the cancer away. I'm just so confused and lost. Thanks for listening. \n-Kelly (San Diego) ",
