      "Content": " If you haven't been diagnosed with breast cancer, a diet rich in soy can be beneficial. Soy contains chemicals that mimic estrogen your body produces, but these proto-estrogens are weaker. Some doctors think that they will bind to any potential estrogen-receptive cancer cells (should a few show up down the line) and not \"feed\" the cancer like your own bodily produced estrogen would. However, don't take a soy supplement! That's too high of a dose. Try to incorporate things like tofu or soy milk into your diet, instead.\nNot sure about\n the hormonal cream, but if you have concerns about\n it and the link to breast cancer, definitely talk to your doctor.

      "Content": " Hi everyone,\nI'm hoping to get some advice from either people in a similar situation to me, or someone who has faced a similar diagnosis and gotten through the issues my mother and our family are dealing with.\nMy mother had a cancerous tumor (approx 1.7 cm in diameter) removed from her left breast in May (no lymph node evidence, though there were some cancerous cells discovered in the lymphatic channels and blood vessels of the breast). She\u2019s since recovered from the surgery and is doing radiation therapy for six weeks. The doctor has also advised her to lose weight to lessen her chances of recurrence. I have been trying to get her to work out with me, to no avail. She tells me that she is scared of the cancer coming back, and \u201cjust doesn\u2019t care about\n anything anymore.\u201d When she says things like that, I get really upset and try to reason with her, but I know she\u2019s afraid and depressed.\nAnyone who\u2019s had cancer, did you feel like this? If so, how did you deal with those feelings?\nThanks to anyone for any help they can offer! ",
