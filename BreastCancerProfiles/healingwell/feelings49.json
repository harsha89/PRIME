    "Content": " maybe you have a benign (non-cancerous tumor )or maybe you have a mass I had a mass but there were skin color changes, it was cancer and it took me a coupke of years to make the doctors believe me so it was a later stage at diagnosis. I MADE IT AND AM A YEAR OUT from chemotherapy and radiation. If you have cancer be as positive in atttitude as you can and if you can learn or know how to meditate do it if at all possible as it helps with the immune system .  EVEN IF YOU FIND YOU DONT HAVE CANCER mEDITATION IS GOOD.  Candied ginger from a health food store will help nausea from the cancer, stress , or chemotherapy if you need it you can buy it at a health food store or some grocery stores.
