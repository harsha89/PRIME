    "Content": " Hello ladies..first time here.My mammo on Monday showed a cluster of micro calcifications in a breast I've never had issues with.I have had biopsies and a lumpectomy in other breast,which appeared OK.\nOn Monday I will be returning for a more diagnostic mammo.\nMy research leads me to believe that only a biopsy can tell if the calcifications are benign or not,so I am wondering several things.\nShould I just insist for a biopsy anyhow,irregardless of the 2nd mammon findings?What is the purpose of this 2 nd mammo anyhow...does anyone know?\nI am presently awaiting a call from my PCP to ask these questions,but I am hopeful someone can give me the benefit of their experiences also.Thank you.
