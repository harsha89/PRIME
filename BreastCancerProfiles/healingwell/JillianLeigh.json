    "Content": " Hey everyone, my names Jill and I am just wondering if there is anyone who would be willing to fill out a simple 10 question survey. This is for my senior college thesis. I am doing a study on the diets of chemotherapy patients, mainly those affected by breast and prostate cancer. My end result is to help create a type of meal plan based on the likes and dislikes of patients and on their nutirional needs. This thesis was inspired by my aunt who has been undergoing chemotherapy for three years now for colon cancer, as well as my godfather who sadly died of stomach cancer four years ago. If anyone is able to fill out this survey I would greatly appriciate it, but if not I completely understand. Thank you all for your time!\n ",
