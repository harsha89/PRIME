    "Content": " Hi all;\nI usually do not post here but thought I'd put in my two cents about\n this thread. Hope I do not anger anyone with this post but I thought I would tell you that I too have Benign fibroid cysts now and then. I have had four removed from right breast. Doc said something about\n the density of the breast tissue causes this or something alike to that. He said the only thing I can do is to keep my reg checks every year and of course do my own self checks each month which I have. He also said that if I take 2 Vit E a day and drink decaf drinks that it will decrease over time, which I do this on a reg basis. \nMy grandmother had breast cancer at a very young age so I am very cautious about\n making sure that I do not come up with this problem. Since I have small breasts it seems that I am susceptible to this problem and I have enough ills over the last 8 years to handle without worrying about\n breast cancer too boot.\nWishing you all the best of health and I am sorry for your ills as well. Wish there was some miracle cure for ya'll's diseases. I walk for my grandmother every year in the local breast cancer walk even though I usually cannot make it very far with my back like it is but hubby encourages me with every step I take and when I stop he is right there with lots of praise \nHEALTH ISSUES: Herniated discs at S-1-L5, L5-L4, L4-L3. Two level fusion (2000); one level fusion (2002); Revision at L4-L3 (2003). Diagnosed with Failed Back Syndrome, Permanent Nerve damage and Chronic Pain \nMedications:\nKadian, Lexipro, Percocet, Temazapim, Lunista, and Robaxin.\n ",
