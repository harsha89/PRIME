      "Content": " HI, im usually on the UC board, haven't been there in awhile because ive been in remission. I recognize Sherbear from the UC board.. Anyway, my wife was just diagnosed with bc today. She got the call to come into the doctor asap and he told her the news..There's no history of bc in her family. Breast feed our kids for like two years..she has an appt with the oncologist on Wednesday. Shes a school teacher, 1st grade..she has had like 4 or 5 other teachers at the school get it.. We have two little girls 8 and 12 and we have to tell them..this is really hard. I guess we just wait and see what the oncologist has to say on Wednesday. ",

      "Content": " Update: wife is done with 6 rounds of Chemo and did pretty well through it believe it or not..The doctors were pleased. Her tumor shrunk alot, almost to where you cant feel it anymore. MRI came back good, but we go and see the surgeon this week. They think she is going to still have to have the mastectomy. Was hoping it was going to be a lumpectomy. Luckily it didn't spread to lympnodes, etc..know more soon. thanks\nLialda 2 a day\nMMJ/Simpson Oil\nPhillips Probiotic\nCurrently in Remission ",
