I am terrified of this biopsy because the 1st one was NOT pleasant in any way. The past 3 years have been bad - early 2014 I had the first biopsy and then my spouse ended up in the hospital 7 times since then and I don't need to add to the burden of me now being sick. My spouse just got out of the hospital last week. What are my chances of this being cancer? ",

Not sure what that means but I need to have a repeat mammogram in 6 months. This is all very confusing to me after reading some of the information on line as to what causes calcifications. Some articles state that it could be residue from powders, deodorants and some lotions and when I asked the Radiologist/MD that did the biopsy about\n this he told me that none of those matter. Some articles talk that it comes from aging. I hope to be able to find some answers out to my questions. ",
