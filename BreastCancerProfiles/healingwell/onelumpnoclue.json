      "Content": " I went to my midwife today for an annual check. I had her check a peasized lump I found on my breasted four weeks ago. It has not went down in size and it has wrinkled skin on the top. She looked really quick and just said \" its just a skin thing\" this was not very relieving. It made me feel very unsettled when I should have been relieved. What do you think I should do ignore it and just hope it goes away or get another oppinion. I'm scared to call another doctor to get the same answer. ",

Who is a breast cancer survivor and was concerned with the answer I received. I was so shocked when she just did a quick check said oh its just a skin thing. No tests to see more nothing. This lump is more toward the surface of my left breast. Its the size of a pea right now. I'm praying its just a cyst. I have a grandmother aunt and cousin who had breasted cancer. My cousin was 30 when she lost her battle. They caught it very late she was already at stage 4. I thank you for your words of wisdom. ",

Its scarey cause ive never had one on my breast. I have so much cancer in my family. The last masses that were removed was 4 around my ears. The surgeon found another but he said it was so small at the time he wouldn't touch it. He said that if he removed it now it could come back cancerous.
