      "Content": " I happened to be reading here -- I normally hang out in the Lupus forum where we have lots and lots of ANA experiance. It's a pretty low, but positive, result. Results are measured in titers, which means the numbers double with each step .... 1:80, then 1:160, 1:320, and so forth. Normal is zero, zip, nada, nothing. Positive means you have something going on...but in your case, not really much of whatever it is. So a rhuematologist is the next right person to see. More specific info on what your ANA test might mean: The homogeneous (smooth) pattern is found in a variety of connective tissue diseases as well as in patients taking particular drugs such as certain anti-arrhythmics, anti-convulsants or anti-hypertensives. This pattern is also the pattern that is most commonly seen in healthy individuals who have positive ANA tests. The speckled pattern is found in SLE and other connective tissue diseases, while the peripheral (or rim) pattern is found almost exclusively in SLE. The nucleolar pattern is found primarily in patients who have scleroderma. All of these mentioned conditions are treated by a rheumotologist -- and that is really the only person qualified to determine what, if anything, is going on. Check out the links in my signature to find out more information, or come on over to the Lupus Forum and post -- we aren't just lupus, but kinda' a generic spot where all the indeterminant/undifferentiated connective tissue conditions are discussed....
