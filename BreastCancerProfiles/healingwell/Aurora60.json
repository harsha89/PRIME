      "Content": " I was diagnosed w/breast cancer in 2005, had a lumpectomy in right breast followed by 33 radiation treatments.  Am now taking Arimidex for next 5 yrs.  I have tried to be so careful with my right arm as that is where I had 2 lymph nodes removed.  No cancer in the nodes.  The other day I was stung in my right arm by a yellow jacket.  At first it just seemed like a regular bee sting. I took benydryl to avoid swelling.  The sting was on top of my elbow.  The next morning my arm had swelled at the elbow and felt stiff, was red and itched to bad I could have scratched my arm off - but didn't as I new that would be bad.  I went to the Dr. and was prescribed some steroid cream and told to use ice packs.  I did but itching, swelling and redness did not improve.  Went back to Dr. and got one of those 21 prednisone packs where you start w/ 6,5,432,1.  The swelling and redness are improving - so far have taken the first 6 and 5 dose pills.  I still have terrible itching despite using the cream.  I see my oncologist in a few days so I am sure she can tell if I have any problems.  I am scared about\n lymphedema as I hear it can be very painful and can not be cured only treated.  My cousin has it and has to massage her arm for 20 min each night and wear a bandage like an ace bandage.  She does not have to wear her compression sleeve.  Does any one have any experience with this or lymphedema and can tell me what to expect?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

      "Content": " Hi,  I have been on Armidex for 2 1/2 years and have not had any weight gain.  This was not mentioned in all my literature that I received before taking the drug as a side effect.  In fact the worst symtom I have is hot flashes because the Armidex blocks all estrogen to your body.  After being out of menopause for at least six years it was hard to be put back into the hot flashes.  I take remeron which helps control them somewhat but not completely.  I sleep with 2 fans and a window air conditioner as well as central air.  But knowing I am cutting my recurrence rate in half makes it worth taking the drug.  I have to take it for 5 yrs.  I think you should talk to your Dr. about\n the weight gain as a possible side effect. I hope this info helps you. ",

      "Content": " I would suggest that you check into your state insurance policy if your state has one.  These policies are expensive but well worth it.  They have to take you if you cannot get any other insurance and you will be covered should you need treatment.  They covered most of my breast cancer costs which were outrageous but I was able to handle the deductible and first 20% costs. I have to keep my state covered insurance as I can no longer get any other insurance because I would now be considered to have a pre-existing condition.  Try to get the COBRA - I think by law they have to give it to you.  What ever you do be sure you have some kind of insurance.

      "Content": " I had 35 radiation treatments for breast cancer 2 yrs ago.  I still don't have my old energy back.  I just can't do as much as I used to.  Has anyone else had this experience?  I had no energy when I was having the treatments - all I could do was get dressed and go to my treatment for the day.  Also, I have lost 30 lbs. and the area where my scar is from the lumpectomy has become indented.  I recently saw my surgeon and she said it was because of the weight loss  To be safe I had an ultra sound which showed everything normal.  The breast where I had the cancer shrunk from the radiation and now with the weight loss I am so uneven! I wonder if this has happened to others.  Would appreciate a reply if you have had this type of experience.  Thanks. ",

      "Content": " I was diagnosed 12/05 with breast cancer - tumor was snall and nothng in the lymphnodes. I know I am very fortunate.  I had two surgeries because the first one did not get all the cells at the margin.  I had 33 radiation treatments and my breast shrunk from the radiation so I am kind of lopsided.  Has this happened to anyone else?  Also, I am on a drug called Arimidex and I have to take it for 5 years - have taken it 2 years already.  The only side effect I have from it is that I get terrible hot flashes.  I don't want to stop taking it because it cuts my risk of recurrence so low.  Anyone take this medication and if so do you get hot flashes?  My oncologist said to take Vitamin E.  Also some people take black cohosh which I tried and it did work but then I heard on the news it can cause liver damage so I stopped it.  Would appreciate any suggestions.

      "Content": " Not being a Dr. I can't say what the lump is but cancerous lumps usually do not hurt.  They are hard and don't move around.  It could be a cyst that moves and hurts her.  This happened to me in 1997. I went to the Dr. and it turned out to be nothing.  I was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005 from a routine mammogram.  I had a biopsy which showed is was invasive ductile carcinoma and I had surgery and radiation, two sentinel lymph nodes removed but not cancerous.  I am on an anti cancer drug for five years.  The worst thing to do is not see a Dr. as you never know what it could be.  I hope your friend will make the appt. and have some peace of mind. It is better to be safe and go for tests than let something go and have it become a big problem.  I hope I have helped some.  By the way,  my Oncologist says I am curable so early detection is the best.
