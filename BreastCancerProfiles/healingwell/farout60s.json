    "Content": " I am 61 years old and post menopausal. I recently had my 2 yearly mammogram and received a letter advising me to attend a local hospital for further tests. I had another mammogram and an ultrasound scan and was advised that I had a cyst and that there was nothing to be concerned about\n. I was copied on a letter to my GP stating the same. I was relieved to say the least but since then I have been having some discomfort in my left breast and arm, particularly when I stretch my arm up above my head. I was advised also that I would be tested in the normal way in another 2 years. I was considering going back to my GP to ask if I needed further tests but having read this thread realise that these cysts are more common than I thought and that they can grow over time. The point of my post is really to say thank you to all the people who have contributed to this topic as it was beginning to worry me. One question though; I have always worn underwired bras which probably don't help the current situation. Can anyone recommend a good comfortable bra without wires please? ",
