      "Content": " Thanks.\nActually my breasts are quite small and had been naturally somewhat lumpy and of uneven texture. Probably because I have so little fat. So for a long time I could not tell if this lump was just normal. But recently my breasts have smoothed out some, and this one lump is more defined. I've also lost a lot of weight recently, though I'm already thin, so now it is easier to feel this lump in my small breast. The lump is long but kind of flat. Not standing out.\nAlthough I am young, I have already finished menopause, since having a hysterectomy for cancer 6 years ago. I also have fibromyalia. ",

      "Content": " I am trying to get an appointment at a local hospital. I am American but living in Taiwan; I'm not sure what the procedure for testing is here. \nMy friend told me that they will probably need to use a needle to take a sample, a biopsy. But she says that, if it is cancer, this test also increases the risk of spread, as the cancer cells can escape out into the body more easily. She said that cancer cells are basically contained inside the tumor, but if the outer wall is broken, then the cells spread more quickly. Does that make sense? Have you heard of that? \nAre there any specific tests I should ask for or expect? ",
