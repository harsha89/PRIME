    "Content": " Hi I'm LoisB,I'm 53, I had a steriotactic biopsy on Aug 5/04, 2 days before my youngest daughters wedding. \nOn Aug 23/04,I got the results that I have a localized mass behind my right nipple and would have to have a right breast mastectomy. Overwhelmed to say the least.Monday was a blur, I still haven't really come into the reality of it all.\nI live in Oshawa Ontario Canada. \nI'm raising my 2 grandsons 5&7, & I'm in the transition of returning the boys back to their Mom(my daughter, we will share joint custody)& I also have 3 other daughters, 32,29 & 24.\nI have a very supportive husband who is now making sure that I don't do anything, that's so funny..how he's doting on me.But I am keeping a stiff upper lip, this thing is not going to get the best of me. I'm a fighter and I'll be a survivor. \nKick me when I'm down, I'll get back up again and fight all the harder. ",
