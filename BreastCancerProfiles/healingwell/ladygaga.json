      "Content": " Wondering if anyone has similar experience.\nI had an immediate Tram Flap reconstruction on 14th December 2010, that's 7 weeks ago, since then had one chemo treatment at week 6. I am very thin only 100lbs 5'2' and was not informed that it was not a good surgery to have if you are too thin. I would not have gone through it if I'd known. The surgeons strongly recommended this type of surgery to me and I wish I'd known what I know know.\nSince then I have had seromas in the abdomen which is still lingering around and trouble breathing and it's really bothering me as I am now not able to eat much at all. How long will this breathing problem stay? I've spoken to my PS and he told me it's early days and it's going to be more difficult because you are so thin. The chemo seems to have made the situation worst.\nI wonder if anyone has had similar problems and if this feeling will go away soon. The muscle is like a rock in the middle separating my body.\nHow long do I have to wait for it to go down? ",

The breathing is probably due to the tightness of the whole area. When I try to take a deep breath the skin along my body is pulled so tight that my lungs are not able to extend to it's full capacity. Yoga may help. ",

They've taken every single oz of fat I had in my stomach and I still can't stand up straight because It feels too tight and if I do I can't breath in properly. Luckily only one of my rectus muscles have been used.\nAfter surgery my stomach was curved inwards for about\n a week then the seromas started to force it out into a bulge which is what I have now. My PS said it's nothing to worry about\n and should be absorbed within 6-8 weeks. It just feels horrible when i am up and about\n the fluid inside just feels uncomfortable.. I'm going through chemo and the healing seems to have slowed down, or in fact made things worst.\nIs it true that you will never be able to do sit ups again?\nI don't think the tram flap surgery is suitable for people as thin as me.
