    "Content": " I live here in yucaipa where one was centered.  It wasn't all that bad nothing broke, or fell off counters.  I think the Lord may be trying to tell people wake up He just might be coming.  ARE YOU READY for him.  How are You living your life. For this world or His.  CAn you stand face to face to him Once He comes for His Church and those that are living in sin will have to stand in judgement before him.  Right now is the grace period, all you have to do is ask for forgiveness, and repent, receive Him as your Lord and Savior. ask him to come into your heart, and then live for him.\n ",
