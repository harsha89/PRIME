      "Content": " Hi all- thank you for being here!\nI noticed on Jan 1 a fairly large lump in my breast (mid menstral cycle). It was highly mobile but freaked me out. My mother suggested I wait a few days and see if there was any change as she has had several lumps herself that were cycle related. Through the next three weeks the lump became smaller and changed shape. First into a marble size and round shape (of which I tried to massage away... Which only made my breast more sore). But then is became even smaller but firm and less defined. It didn't totally go away so I ended up getting a mamm and ultrasound. Mamm showed nothing but the ultrasound showed lots of fluid filled cysts and the lump as solid, not clear edges. So the doc scheduled a biopsy. She had zero bed side manners and said she was \"very concerned\" with the tumor and I saw she put me at \"high risk\" on her little evaluation form. I had no time to process and ask questions while i was there and the woman who ran the ultra sound told me she sees nothing on my lymph nodes (underarm) and that it is very small (pea sized) and that if it is cancer it will not kill me (I literally asked her point blank if this was cancer would it kill me so she did not offer that up).I have the biopsy tomorrow and obviously I am nervous... And even confused. \nMy question is if anyone has ever had a changing lump like this? The very very sore breast was also strange as I know most cancer lumps are not sore. But can't totally say the lump is sore or the breast is... The solid lump also seems to be smaller today than 1-2 weeks ago... Seems to only get smaller. Also still very mobile\nOf course the doctor reading the ultrasound didn't talk to me about\n anything other that how it looked right then... Which I get. \nAnyway... Any thoughts are helpful- thanks! ",

      "Content": " Thank you Sheri! I am a Sheri too!! :)\nI am actually oddly calm. I believe I may have caused some trauma to the area when I was \"rubbing\" the round marble-like lump (pretty aggressively) about\n a week after I noticed a lump (which initially was larger and more fluid-like). Don't ask me why... I think I thought of it more like a charlie horse and I could just rub it to get rid of it... stupid I know! I made it so sore by doing that that I had to have cold and hot compresses in the area for days. \nI have read where \"trauma\" to the breast can cause a kind of scarring tissue that is firm, not clear edges and can look rather cancer -like on ultrasound. So that is what I am hoping this is. And yes- the lump changes almost daily... getting smaller or even changing shape a bit... sounds odd I know.\nThe other thing is that the mam was clear... is it common or typically do you think that the mam is clear but that there is still cancer there? I understand you are not a doctor but I always try to understand the difference between the two...\nThanks again! ",
