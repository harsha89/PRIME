    "Content": " Hi I have a few questions and hope someone anyone can give me some insight. \nI found a lump in my right breast a few weeks ago. I waited about\n 10 days and it was just keeping an eye on the lump. Then about\n 10 days ago I developed and ulceration right around the area that I found a lump. I called my doctor and I went in yesterday for an exam. I have a quarter size ulceration on my right breast and the doctor said that I had very dense tissue in the area of the lump and the ulceration. The ulceration also is oozing a yellowish fluid. I go tomorrow for a diagnostic mammogram and a biopsy. I was just wondering if anyone had ever had the same issues and how things turned out for you. I am scared to death! Thank you for your time. ",
