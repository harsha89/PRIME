    "Content": " Hello,\nI have been having soreness in my breast area for a couple months. I'm starting to wonder if this could be breast cancer, although I am a male. \nI was looking around for information on male breast cancer, and I couldn't find much. There are no active forums for male breast cancer. \nI took propecia/finasteride for 15 years, and I also took injectable testosterone to help another health condition. I discovered that both of these drugs significantly increase your risk for breast cancer. Testosterone naturally turns into estrogen in a male body, and estrogen increases risk of breast cancer. \nMy question is, what are the symptoms of breast cancer? Did you feel a soreness or burning sensation in your breast? \nI know you're supposed to feel for lumps, and I do feel small lumps, but I can't really be sure what cancer feels like. \nWhat is the best avenue to take if you suspect breast cancer? As a male, it's kind of embarrassing. I don't really know how to bring this up to my doctor. I don't know what he could really do for me, anyway. \nThanks, ",
