    "Content": " Hello all!\nI have been in contact with the moderator Peter Waite who gave me permission for this post. Our research team at Tulane University is conducting an online survey of individuals with cancer histories. We are particularly interested in individuals with a history of breast cancer.\n \nThe link to the study is:\nhttp://tulanestudy.com/\n \nThe survey takes about\n 10 minutes and asks about\n your beliefs about\n their health and healthcare, emotions and behaviors, and health history. We hope that the study will build knowledge that can help individuals with cancer to be more satisfied with their care.\nThank you!\n ",
