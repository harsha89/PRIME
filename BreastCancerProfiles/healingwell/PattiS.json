    "Content": " Has anyone ever felt a 'buzzing' feeling in the scar where the lump was removed?\nI had a lumpectomy for a Stage I lump in Dec 2006. No radiation or chemo.\nTwo years ago it metastisized to Stage IV, and I now have it in my torso, neck and skull bones. Had radiation and chemo, and all is in check. Back to work full time, living life, feeling great.\nThis buzzing feeling just started today....weirdest feeling! ",
