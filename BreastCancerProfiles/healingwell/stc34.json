    "Content": " My mom went for a physical yesterday and her doctor said she had a \"fibrous\nmass\" in her\nleft breast. She is going in for her annual mammogram on Tuesday. She's had\nannual\nmammograms regularly for 15+ years and nothing has ever shown up.\nMy mom has never had fibrocystic breasts or anything like that before. She is 66\nand has\nbeen on HRT for many years (very low dose). I felt the lump today and it feels\nlike an oval, in\nbetween squishy and hard, and it's on the left side of her left breast. I can't\ntell if it's movable\nor not. The strange thing is back in October of last year when she went in for\nher annual Pap,\nher Gynecologist didn't feel anything (and never had). She also does weekly\nexams in the\nshower and never noticed this lump. So basically this lump showed up in a 4\nmonth span. I\ndon't understand??\nMy mom's sister and mother had breast cancer. My aunt was in her 50s and my grandmother was in her 80s. My aunt's was found on a mammogram as calcifications. My grandmother had a golf ball sized tumor removed. None of it spread. They were estrogen related, or something like that. \nDoes anyone know what a cancerous tumor feels like? I read that they're hard with irregular borders. Is this true? \nAlso, how can I prepare myself in the event I have to \"hit the ground running?\" Thanks.\nWe are very, very close. She's all I have. I am so terrified I can't see\nstraight. I don't know\nwhat breast cancer lumps feel like, so I can't seem to get any relief and/or\ncalm down until\nTuesday. Can someone offer some advice or encouragement? Thanks. ",
