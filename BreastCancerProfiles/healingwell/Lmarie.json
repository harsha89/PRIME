      "Content": " I'am not sure if I am doing this right but here it goes. Had my first of Chemo last Wednesday. I started on Taxol which I 'l'll take 3 times a month. I was suppose to start Avastin but I have to wait till they put the port in on Monday. Next Chemo is Wednesday the 7th. I will take Zometa once a month to  prevent bone fracture. I had my hair cut really short this week and looked for wigs today. Both made me sick to my stomach. I have been sleeping my days away so I dont have to talk to anyone. I go to work because I have to do. I just dont know how to live with this. Most of friends dont know that I have stage 4 cancer the ones that do say everything will be alright. So lost.... ",

      "Content": " Deb thanks for your wonderful suggestions. I feel so sorry for myself. I do not want to go go out, why bother. if I do start to feel better does the crying stop? I am tired of it. I have wonderful friends but they must not understand what Stage IV stands for and I really do not want to explain it to them. I am trying to join a group now that hows the same stage of cancer as I do, just waiting for an email. ",
