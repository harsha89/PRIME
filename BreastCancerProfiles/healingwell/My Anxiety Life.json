      "Content": " Hello friends. I have been lurking this chat board for months now, mostly the Anxiety forum and have found it to be a great help. I thank you for that.\nI too went for essentially a first mammogram back on April 23 2014.\nI also get the dreaded letter to \"come back for more tests - Ultrasound - both breasts\" on May 2nd.\nI googled and the stats are soooo encouraging:\n10% get called back after a first mammo, (often because there is nothing to compare it too, so they want to be sure).\n90% are FINE after the second check.\n10% of those need biopsies.\nOf those, 80% are benign.\nOK, so the stats SOUND good, but, worry worry me, I think: \nThen how come so many women get breast cancer???\nI had a health scare last July, thought I was having a heart attack, turned out to be stress. I was given xanax which for me is a TRUE lifesaver as the anxiety attacks persisted after that (and I have had anxiety and depression my whole life).\nOK, so I go back yesterday for the ultrasound (they were able to move me up from May 29th!) and I tried to be calm and joke a little, but the gal doing the exam was \"friendly but oh-so professional\" and for some reason, I just laid there feeling worse and worse!! I literally had to fight back the tears in fear,\nShe concentrated on one side of my right breast over and over, then did the other side for comparison I guess. Again, it concerned me and she wasn't going to give me any reassurance AT ALL (I guess she can't) but didn't make me feel better either.\nThey tell me I may or may not get the results but my Doctor will. My Doc is good but her staff sucks big time. They won't call me when the results come in or tell the Doctor, I will have to wait a week or more, see if I get something in the mail, and be calling my Docs office having to deal with those surly gals. I'll have to call every day I guess, THEN make an appointment. Why can't Doc just call me as soon as results come in? Isn't that her job???\nI'm thinking of changing Docs but this is in process now, so I have to deal with it. Changing Doctors might delay results going from one place to another.\nUgh!!!!\nOne nice gal at radiology TOLD me to make an appt with my Doc when I expressed concern over when and how I how I get mt results so she can go over my results regardless. I'm glad she said something because I'm not really being told what the deal is.\nI wish like some of you they could have told me at the same time what my results were.\nPlus this is a new Doc, new insurance for me, and while she gave me the xanax I needed, I'm not sure she will renew them quite as soon as I'll need, since I have been under a LOT of stress over this and other things.\nApologies for the long post, it feels good to share this as I have no family to share it with, and my few friends well, they can only give me so much sympathy.\nI'd like to think all will be well, but heath anxiety is a real problem for me. I will update and keep everyone else in my thoughts.\nThank you for allowing me to share.\nxo ",

      "Content": " I understand you, angelbunnies69.\nI'll skip my looooong story, but I despise going to Doctors and such after caring for my aged parents for 20 years and seeing all the BS they had to go through. AND they had good insurance. \nMy Dad was a WWll Vet, and the VA was worse than the local welfare hospital. Just hate these places and the insensitive people who work there.\nThey are cold, insensitive, rude, uncaring, (with A FEW exceptions) and this is why I hate hate hate going to get these tests now that I have insurance. Something told me, I'd have problems on top of my health anxiety. And ta-da!! I'm the lucky 10% that got called back for more breast exam tests. Sooo freakin typical..... Ugh...\nJust sucks having these people hold the power over us when it comes to our health. I hate it. ",

      "Content": " I can't help it, the fact I got to the biopsy point has me terrified just TERRIFIED.\nI am CONVINCED it will be bad, very bad. I feel as if I am already preparing for my sickness and death.\nI post in the anxiety forum too as I suffer from health anxiety and the worse and worse news get the more it just feeds right into my fears.\nA first, routine mammogram (now that I have insurance)...\nThen, uh oh, call back for ultrasound...\nNow they want a compression test on one side, biopsy on the other. \nThe only reason I learned so fast about\n the biopsy is because I had to go to that Docs office AGAIN for some other reason, (the Doc is great, her staff sucks) and one of them says: \"OH by the way, you need a biopsy\"...\nWow.... \nIt just doesn't sound very good, and I am sick day and night with worry.\nCompression test Wednesday, Biopsy, June 2nd, (of COURSE they can't get me in sooner....) \n...and they do not give you results right away, and I guess I'll have to call my Doc every day until I hear something....\nI'm just torn up, I'm sorry for posting in both forums so much, but I don't know what to do. The waiting is torture. Just pure hell and I have no one who understands....\nThank you for letting me post... ",

Hugs to you, my Dear, you are in my thoughts.\nI had my biopsy yesterday, that went fine except they really had to probe \"hard\" as the spot was \"deep\" and hard to find. Ugh THAT part made me squeamish. \nMy PCP made me feel soooo much better when I went to talk to her Friday. Thankfully I have a good Doctor. Too many did not treat my parents that well when they were alive.\nI don't think I'm supposed to post similar things in different forums? So will generally stay in the anxiety forum as my anxiety \"feels\" the worst...\nThank you everyone for allowing me a place to post my fears. ",

      "Content": " Thanks Merrida, much appreciated!\nI still need to get my biopsy results though my Doctor reassured me I had \"nothing to worry about\n\". Ahhh easy for her to say I suppose.\nThe hardest part are the gals who staff my Docs office. Getting them to do anything (like get notice to the Doc that I called for results) is a bit of a push as they don't seem to like any more work than they already have, but... I want my results!!\nI guess I should start calling Monday. (Biopsy was last Tuesday).\nThanks for letting me express my fears/concerns.\n ",
