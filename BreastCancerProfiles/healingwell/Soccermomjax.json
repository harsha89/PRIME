    "Content": " Hello,\nA couple of weeks ago I was helping my step-daughter move her animal cage. She accidentally hit me really hard in the right breast with the corner of the cage. It hasn't stopped hurting since. about\n three months ago I had a breast cancer scare and after thorough testing everything was fine. I have tender breasts begin with because going through menopause.\nI've done several several breast examinations on myself and I don't feel anything except for pain where I got hit. I am now just a little nervous because of what I went through. Does it take a longer time for breast tissue to heal? ",
