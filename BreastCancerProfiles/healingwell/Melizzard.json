    "Content": " Hi Everyone,\n \nI was diagnosed, 6 and 7 years ago (one for each side) with Stage IIIa infiltrating lobular carcinoma. I've been working with my brother, who is an internet research geek, on a project consolidating internet resources, for specific topics, into one guide ... in other words, doing the searching so the folks interested in specific topics don't have to. We're doing several of these, but the first one was a breast cancer internet guide (for obvious personal reasons! LOL). We finally launched it yesterday afternoon. I would be honored if you would check it out and let me know what you think! You ladies are the real litmus test for it!\nWe have posted to this, and other, breast cancer forums for feedback. For the next two weeks, ending Nov 16, we will be incorporating your suggestions. We'll make the changes, based on your recommendations, and let you know what we have done. \nhttp://www.nichehikersguide.com/Breast_Cancer/breastcancer.html \n \nThank you, so much, for helping make this resource into an invaluable tool! Please email your feedback to me at info@nichehikersguide.com\n \nxxoo\nMelissa ",
