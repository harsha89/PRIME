    "Content": " I found a lump in L breast in February and after mamogram and ultra sound was told had multiple cysts, however they found a lump I was unaware of in R breast. Ultra sound guided fine needle aspiration demonstrated it to be a fibroadenoma. One of the cysts in L breast measured aprox 48mm and Dr offered to drain, I declined as it was not bothering me. Over the next couple of months it became tender and uncomfortable so another visit to Dr where I finally had cyst drained; he aspirated 36ml of a greenish/brown fluid the relief was immediate! I have been informed that annual ultra sound and bi-yearly mammograms need to be maintained. ",
