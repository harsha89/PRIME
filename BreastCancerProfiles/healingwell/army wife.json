      "Content": " Hi, I have gone through therapy with a Lymphadema specialist, and am now able to manage my lymphadema. My arm will never be the same size as my other one, but it's a small price to pay! Be careful trying to wrap without instruction, as you can do more harm than good. There are special bandages used, not just \"ace\" bandage wraps for sprains etc., that are purchased through a Medical Supply Company, along with cotton for padding etc. There are web sites that allow you to purchase a instruction video, however I nver was able to locate a web page that gave 'free\" instruction. The \"massage\" is VERY light, and basically done in small circular motions from the hand up to shoulder. You must \"clear\" the lymph glands in the underarm of the non affected side and collar bone area first. This was how my therapist did the procedure anyway. I now have a custom made sleeve/glove and night garmet (new) that I wear when my lymphadema is under control. Someone might know of another option, this is just what I have experienced. Good Luck! ",

      "Content": " Pam, as everone else has said, you can do this. I was diagnosed March 05, Stage III, Her2+, ER-/PR-, 5 out of 28 nodes positive. Had mast, chemo, rads, and am still on weekly Herceptin until August. Herceptin is a Wonderful drug which will change the \"poor prognosis\" associated with Her2+ cancers.  I had to quit reading all the books, because there were not many surviver stories! At 45 with a 18 year old son, and 15 year old daughter, and new marriage, I have a lot to live for. The port placement was not a problem, and you wont feel it (unless you push on it of course) once it heals. The pre treatment (chemo) meds work very well, and if not, there are many to try until they do. I have to say I had a very easy time with the ac/taxol treatment. I ate well, took vitamins (except for day before, day of, and day after tx), antioxidents, etc. The book \"Beating Cancer with Nutrition\" by Patrick Quillin, has a great deal of information on the subject. I only had one delay for low wbc, but with the help of neulasta ( shots to boost wbc production) there were no other setbacks. Of course my energy level is not as high as it once was, and I gained 35lbs, which now I'm working to take off, before my reconstruction this June, but things are looking up. You WILL get to this point where going for treatment is like going to the \"grocery store\", just like the rest of us! I wish you well, and will keep you in my prayers (like all of us who are dealing with the big C). God Bless. ",

I have researched about\n all the \"medical\" aspects of the procedure, just haven't \"talked\" to many people who actually have had it done.

      "Content": " PS. I forgot to include in my last post that the fear, anger, anxiety, etc. is all normal. Waking up in the middle of the night in tears, scared, wondering 'why me\" is something most of us feel. It takes time to decide to cope, fight, and not give up. I am in tx with women who have had 3-6 different cancers (mets) but get treatment and survive. Many women live with cancer and have long productive lives. This is not the \"death sentence\" of the past. I believe attitude has a great deal to do with survival etc. My faith is strong, and once I got past the \"how could this happen to me\", I know God is with me and will get me through this. It has been quite a year, but I have met wonderful caring people, developed deeper relationships and look forward to \"cheering\" other's on. YOU WILL SURVIVE! ",

      "Content": " Hi, my name is Nancy, living in San Antonio Texas by way of Ohio. My husband is stationed at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston. We are moving to Fort Bragg North Carolina in the Fall. I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer March 2005, at age 43. I am Stage IIIA, Her2+, Estrogen/PR -, 5 positive nodes out of 28. Had Mast, Chemo, Radiation and am on weekly Herceptin until August 06. Developed Lymphadema Aug 05, but am able to keep it managable. I am now cancer free (and with the help of God pray I will stay that way!) I'm in the process of scheduling my Tram Flap Reconstruction in June. I will have the first procedure here in San Antonio, then remaining procedures at Fort Bragg. I have many questions concerning post-op recovery as I will be moving 9 weeks after surgery. The Military provides movers who will pack and move, however my husband and I both have vehicals to drive. I know complications can delay healing etc., but can anyone advise what I can expect after surgery, such as how long before you were able to stand straight, walk up and down stairs, raise your arms, etc. I realize everyone has different pain thresholds, heals at different speeds, etc. Also any advise on what I can do to minimize pain, complications, etc. Thanks so much for any advise. God Bless.\n ",
