    "Content": " Hi. This is my first post, so thanks in advance for listening! I had my first mammogram (I'm 41) in late February and was called back for diagnostic mammograms and ultrasounds. They give it a BIRADS 4. From there I had bilateral core needle biopsies on March 8th. I had to wait almost a week for results, which was excruciating...I know you all have been there. On the left breast hey found extensive LCIS with pagetoid spread in ducts and sclerosing adenosis and a 3.5 cm span of microcalcifications (some layer, some do not.) On the right they found a complex fibroadenoma with flat epithelial atypia and atypical lobular hyperplasia, and more microcalcs. I am scheduled for bilateral wire guided excisional biopsies on both breasts on the 23rd of April. Scared to death that they will find malignancy due to the large span of microcalcs and all of the atypia. I had to miss a few days of work due to severe anxiety while waiting for CNB results. I have a 4 year old with Autism and he needs his mama! Please don't think I'm crazy, but I'm already thinking ahead that if they find anything else, I may want to have bilateral mastectomy. I can't deal with this anxiety over and over again, if they find more in 6 months or in a year. Has anyone had a similar experience with a good outcome (or a bad one?) 2 weeks cannot go fast enough! Also, will they have any answers for me right after surgery? I'm being seen at a well-know breast center at a large university hospital. Thanks so much! Beckie\nUpdate: Surgery bumped up to April 16th...one less week to worry about\n the unknown!\n ",
