    "Content": " Is it true? \nDoes the \"records room\" give patients a different report than they give their doctor? \nI have picked up many reports from hospitals and radioloogy offices. I always read the report and look at the films before my consults. The doctor usually tells me the same thing he reads on the report whether it was faxed to him directly from the radiologist or if I gave it to him.\nSome times the fax is still sitting around my doctors office waiting to get filed, so the report I pick up needs to be accurate for evaluation.\nThank you.\nKatP ",
