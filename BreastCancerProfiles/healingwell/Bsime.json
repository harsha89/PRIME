      "Content": " I am posting this for my wife who just had surgery on both breasts and will receive radiation treatments.  Her oncologist wants her to take femara instead of tamoxifin after radiation.  Of course, there is no generic and it is much more expensive than generic tamoxifin.\n \n \n \nMCTD (lupus, scleroderma, polymyositis).  Diagnosed 2005.  Kidney, liver, GI tract, dysphagia, raynauds, Barretts esophagus, quadriplegic in 2005.  Recovered and now active in skiing, tai, chi, hiking, golf.  Meds: prednisone 2.5mg, imuran 25mg, amlodipine, benazapril, omeprazole, potassium, folic acid, vitamins, maxide and various supplements and vitamins.\n \n ",

      "Content": " My wife has lobular cancer in both breasts.  Tests after surgery were negative but the oncologist is doing genetic testing to see if chemo is also advised.  If the tests are negative he has recommended femara.  She is 70 and in good health otherwise but probably susceptible to osteoporosis due to ethnicity, age, and genetics.  He talked about\n taking something to prevent bone loss but not sure what that was.  It will be another two months until she takes either drug so there is time to research and consider the options.\n \n \nMCTD (lupus, scleroderma, polymyositis).  Diagnosed 2005.  Kidney, liver, GI tract, dysphagia, raynauds, Barretts esophagus, quadriplegic in 2005.  Recovered and now active in skiing, tai, chi, hiking, golf.  Meds: prednisone 2.5mg, imuran 25mg, amlodipine, benazapril, omeprazole, potassium, folic acid, vitamins, maxide and various supplements and vitamins.\n \n ",
