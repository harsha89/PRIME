      "Content": " Thank you for responding to my post. I am having my biopsy tomorrow morning; if I am lucky I will have results back by Thursday, but if they aren't back Thurs I will have to wait until Monday as the doctor does not work Fri\nJust a few questions if you don't mind....\n1. Did reconstruction involve implants? If not, how did they do it?\n2. Do you have to take tamoxifen, and if so, what side effects are you having?\n3. Any chemo or radiation involved?\n4. Will mammograms continue to be useful in following you? Or do they have to do ultrasounds or something else?\nAgain, thanks ",
