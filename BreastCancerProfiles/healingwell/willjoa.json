      "Content": " Thanks BEV and NEIrish for your support, all I can remember from the call is...there will be a dr. there and you will have your results before you leave!!  My mind went blank after they identified who they were.  No family history and very few risk factors (I think....what are the risk factors (freaking out!)).  I've been reading around and are looking at TaTa's differently.  ",
