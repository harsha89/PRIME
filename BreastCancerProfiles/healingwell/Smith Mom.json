      "Content": " It must be the day - Hi angel bunnies, I'm SmithMom - a new member, got my first call back from my first mammogram today, while working from home taking care of my high school senior who is recovering from a tonsillectomy done last week and is graduating in less than a month. I just had the mammogram last week and am scheduled for further imaging on Friday. I'm glad I found this forum - it's comforting to see most turn out ok, but I'm more than a little concerned it took 2 months to get scheduled for the darn thing and only 4 days for further imaging? I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth, just having a rough week I guess. I don't believe there are enough middle fingers in the world for this Monday! ",
