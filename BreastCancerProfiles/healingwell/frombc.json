      "Content": " Hi there, I just recently had a mammo and ultrasound and the report said that I had what looked like 2 fibroadenomas and some microcalcifications that were likely benign. The microcalcs (which were deemed benign) were seen on my last mammo in late 2007, but she thought that perhaps they had changed. She had to consult with another radiologist to decide. My doc said that was a good sign that it wasn't an obvious change. \nThey want me to come back in 6 months for a follow-up. My GP however is sending me to a breast specialist. In his words \"not because I think you have cancer, but because I'm more conservative than the radiologist\". \nI'm 50 and read that in women over 40 they usually just remove the suspected adenoma to make sure. I'm curious as to why they wouldn't just have it removed rather than have me come back in 6 months. Also, how do they know it's not a phyllodes tumor? I noticed the lump in May, but assumed it was just a cyst, so I waited until my yearly physical. The Dr. felt it right away and sent me for a mammo/US which I had on Sep/4. \nMy appointment with the specialist isn't until Nov/18. I don't think the lump has grown since finding it, but I've lost about\n 15 lbs since then and sometimes I think it's larger. I've read phyllodes grow quite rapidly and are quite large. My lump was 11 mm. If it were a suspected phyllodes would they not have sent me to have it excised right away? \nI'm confused as to whether I should be worried about\n it or not. Any words of wisdom or advice would be greatly appreciated. Like I didn't have enough peri-meno anxiety as it was. Now to add this to my plate :( Thanks so much.\n50 year old female\nDx'd with proctosigmoiditis July/06\nSalofalk enemas 4(g) at bedtime every night right now \n...Aloe\nVit B complex/folic acid\nfish oil (pharmaceutical grade)\nVSL#3\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Bev, Thanks for the reply. I wasn't sure if phyllodes always grew quicky, but yes, I would hope that they would have sent me to have it removed. I just find it a little disconcerting, because I know they can guess that it's a fibroadenoma vs a phyllodes, but can't be certain until it's removed.\nNo, I'm not taking any hormones for my peri.\n50 year old female\nDx'd with proctosigmoiditis July/06\nSalofalk enemas 4(g) at bedtime every night right now\n...Aloe\nVit B complex/folic acid\nfish oil (pharmaceutical grade)\nVSL#3\n ",
