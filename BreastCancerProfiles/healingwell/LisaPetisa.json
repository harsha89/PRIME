      "Content": " Hi Lori (Mom_of_Crohnie),\nSounds like you're going through what I went through a few weeks ago. I found a lump and the doctor said that the fact that it was moveable was a good sign that it was probably benign (so I didn't worry much). Then the following week, the ultrasound showed that it was not a cyst so then I started to worry. Then I had a biopsy (week three) and it turned out to be benign. It was a little bit of an emotional roller coaster for a few weeks so I know what you're going through. I think what kept me sane for those few weeks was that I was very busy with work and that helped to distract me. I haven't actually been diagnosed with BC but I joined this forum when I was looking for some information and to just find others who could lend me some advice and everyone here has just been wonderfully supportive! Keep us posted, I wish you the best.\nLisa ",

      "Content": " Thanks for the replies Lori and Laure'. It was actually a breast specialist in a breast clinic that recommended the MRI. This was the first time a doctor suggested I get an MRI for follow-up but I'm glad to hear about\n your experience Lori because now I know that the mammograms I had been getting was also a good screening tool. Laure', you're so right about\n demanding good follow-up care! In the past 20 years when I moved to a new city for college, new job, etc., I've found that doctors didn't always know what sort of follow-up care to offer. Can I ask you what follow-up care your husband gets (I'm glad to hear he's doing well)? The oncologist that originally treated me used to regularly order mammogram and blood work (CBC w/differential and chemistry profile) for me. Then I moved to a new city and saw an oncologist that added a thyroid panel to the blood work order (because of the site of the radiation treatment). Then I went to this breast specialist who suggested an MRI. I'm wondering what else I might add to this list!\nThanks again!\nLisa ",

      "Content": " Hi, I'm new to this community forum and everyone seems wonderfully supportive of each other! I've never been diagnosed with BC but I had Hodgkin's lymphoma over twenty years ago when I was a teenager. My doctor says that the radiation I received for the Hodgkin's puts me at a high risk for BC, especially since I was under 30 at the time. The doctor said that mammograms are not a good screening method for women under 40 because the breast tissue is dense and an MRI would be better for me because it's more sensitive but there's a high rate of false positives. I recently had a lump removed that thankfully turned out to be fibroadenoma. Is anyone here high-risk but never diagnosed? If so, can you tell me what your experiences have been? ",

      "Content": " Hi Frayda, I'm so glad that they were able to find that cancer early when the mammo and u/s was not picking it up! What you described was exactly what my doctor told me - that it's not used for the general population because the high false positives and it's very expensive. Because they detected it early, would you say that your treatment was \"lighter\" than it would have been otherwise or do you go through the same rigorous treatment but with better odds? How often did you go in for the MRI screening?\nThanks for sending me the link to that study Laure'. I was actually looking around on the internet to see if there was a MRI study being done. It doesn't look like I qualify for it though because they're looking for women with a biopsy proven cancer in one breast in the last 6 months. If I did qualify, I would definitely be interested! \nThanks for the supportive and informative messages Lorie, Lore' and Frayda! This is really helping me to think about\n what I need to do and reinforcing the idea of how important early detection and good follow-up is. Best wishes to you all! -- Lisa ",
