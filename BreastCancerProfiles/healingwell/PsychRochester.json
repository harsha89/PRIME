    "Content": " Hello,\nI know everybody is sure to be really busy, but I was wondering if anybody would be willing to take 15 minutes out of their day share a little bit about\n their personal experience dealing with cancer. I am interested in learning about\n what emotions you might experience as you battle the disease.\nIf you are willing to share, please visit: cancerpsych.com. At this web address, you will find a brief (15 minute) survey which will ask you questions about\n your health, and emotions., At the end, it actually generates feedback on your personality too.\nAgain, if you are willing to help out, please visit the site cancerpsych.com. Thank you in advance for your participation.\nSincerely,\nSamantha\nAlso, please note that I have contacted the forum moderators and have received permission to post the link to my survey from Peter.
