    "Content": " i am a 35 year old. i can't remember the last time my breasts have felt normal. i remember telling my mom (about\n my breasts feeling funny) when i was about\n 10. she said that it was probably nothing. since then i've only mentioned it to two doctors, who both felt that there was not a need for a mammogram because of my age. they have checked manually during my annual visits. i have even had two-three chest xrays with recent onset of high blood pressure. i have tiny masses on both breasts, and sometimes they feel painful. what could this be? i feel that there is a need to push the issue. what should be my first step?
