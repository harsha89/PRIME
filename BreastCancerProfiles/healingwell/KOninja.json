      "Content": " I am 44 and just had my first \"call back\" after a routine mammogram. I was told that the images of my right breast didn't match the last set of images. From reading these entries I see that it's \"usually\" nothing, thought that's not calming me down completely. I'm still nervous. The follow-up appointment is tomorrow morning. \nI assume I'll have another waiting period after the appointment before I find out if there's really anything to worry about\n. It sounds like most people here have more images and/or an ultrasound when they are called back.\nSo many people in my life have been diagnosed (or re-diagnosed) with cancer in the last 2 weeks. I really hope I'm not joining them... ",
