      "Content": " Merrida\nMy feeling is that there would be something wrong if you weren't feeling a bit low. The word cancer is enough to cause shock, fear depression and a whole host of other natural feelings. I think you are suffering from a natural reaction to what the last weeks and months have thrown at you. It was bad enough before the word cancer reared it's ugly head. You are bound to go between feelings of thinking you can beat this to the real lows and fear of the unknown. \nI don't know a lot about\n chemo, although I did have a friend go through it many years ago. The methods of delivery and the side effects seem to be better than years ago. And I know you will get through it, it wouldn't be for long and if there is even the smallest chance of the cancer migrating then I know you'd rather accept chemo than take any chances. And you still don't know yet if it will be necessary. You have a great team behind you, trust them. They will be doing all they can to keep you safe. \nTake each day as it comes. Try not to spend too much time on your own thinking. Distract yourself, and above all be good to yourself. You are allowed to be spoilt and spoil yourself just now. And never forget just how strong you are...even if that's not quite how you are feeling just now. Email me anytime, I would love to chat privately with you. \n(((Happy hugs)))\nJane x ",
