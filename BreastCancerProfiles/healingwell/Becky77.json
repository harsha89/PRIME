      "Content": " Hey. I don't have breast cancer, but thought maybe you all could answer a question for me. I had a breast reduction in January, and since, my breasts are very tender and have shooting pain in them that varies depending on what part of the month it is. Usually it is not both breasts, it's usually the right side. The last time I went to the surgeon, he said it was from nerves that were cut during the surgery and it would go away in time.\nI figured some of you have had breast surgery (I know mine was elective, and in no way do I mean to offend anyone here or make it seem like I've been where you are) so maybe you have had similar pain. Does it go away eventually? Should I worry that it's been 11 months and I'm still having \"nerve\" pain? When it does hurt, to apply pressure makes it feel better, so I walk around holding my breast (my friends are used to it, so they don't even notice anymore).\nThank you if you have any suggestions or advice!\nBecky\n31 yr old female-dx with Crohn's in '97 after emergency resection and appendectomy, 2nd resection '05, Bilateral pulmonary emboli 10/09\nCurrently on Humira, Omeprazole, Effexor, Seroquel, Calcium, Vit D, sublingual B12, Coumadin\n ",

      "Content": " I don't think it's the Intercostalbrachial nerve...it's only actually pain in the breast. I don't feel any pain coming from my back, but more from the front where the incisions were. It's not bad enough to need a nerve block. Really I'm just wondering if nerve pain goes away on it's own. If it's a minor nerve that was cut, does it grow back or fix itself?\nThanks to both of you for responding. I appreciate it!\nBecky\n31 yr old female-dx with Crohn's in '97 after emergency resection and appendectomy, 2nd resection '05, Bilateral pulmonary emboli 10/09\nCurrently on Humira, Omeprazole, Effexor, Seroquel, Calcium, Vit D, sublingual B12, Coumadin\n ",
