Was it the radiation alone that stopped the cancer?\n I watched that movie. It is on Netflix. very inspiring. There is also Crazy Sexy Cancer for anyone out there looking for a wholistic approach.\nI get an MRI tuesday. I get results on wednesday. Sometimes I am hopeful and sometimes I am just scared crap!\nI have a friend in a study in NY. they are having great results. I am going to try to get into the study. I expect to know by week end. Thanks for all of your support. Wendi ",

I didnt expect the news that i received. 2 sites that it is in the bones. I am going to get an MRI to make sure and i am going to start on tamoxafin. I am really scared. I was into wheatgrass and raw foods but I cheated a lot in the 2 years. My doctor thinks there is hope and I don't know what to think. It is really hard to sleep. ",

This morning I was OK for a while and when I read your posts it kept me thinking in a positive direction. thank you so much. \nBy the way, fresh vegatable juice has a lot of minerals and vitamines in it and they are easily adsorbed by the body.\nAnd I don't know how to spell tamaxofin either. Thank you for your prayers I will be praying fo ryou too.\nXXOO Wendi ",
