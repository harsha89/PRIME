    "Content": " I just got my second mamogram done after aa call back. They found two spots on my left breast that were not there last year. Went thriught my chane ten years ago and I am 52 years old. They said they didn't think it was cancer and to come back in six months for recheck and see id I had more spots. Said if I had ten or more then they would do a biopsts. Everyone said I should get one for piece of mind. They tell you to forget about\n it but it is. My mom died of a lymth note and then it was too far. Should I be worried and deman one. Thanks ",
