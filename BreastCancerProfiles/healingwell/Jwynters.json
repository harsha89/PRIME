    "Content": " I'm 41 years old. My mom had breast cancer twice, each time a different breast & both types were different also. My paternal grandmother & also my mom's aunt have had breast cancer. I've had 3 prior mammograms that were all normal etc. I didn't realize I was supposed to have one every year so I skipped a year. This time a 5mm possible cyst was found. After a diagnostic mammogram & ultrasound, it was determined to be most likely a complicated 6mm cyst. Another was found nearby on the ultrasound. I was told that both contained a combination of solid debris & a small amount of fluid. The report says that I have moderate scattered fibroglandular densities. Ultrasound report shows \"At the 10:00 position,6cm from the nipple, a 6mm oval circumscribed hypoechoic nodule versus complicated cyst with internal echoes. Incidental additional probably benign complicated cyst versus nodule present at 10:00 position approximately 1 cm from the nipple. This small mass measures 6x4x3mm.\" So, it was explained to me that there is a small chance that it could be Cancer but the radiologist determined them to be \"probably benign\" and wants to follow up in 3 months with another diagnostic mammogram & ultrasound. He said that if they have grown at all at that point, I will need a biopsy. In the meantime, I'm trying so hard not to be worried. I have 2 more months of waiting at this point. How concerned should I be? ",
