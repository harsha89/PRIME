      "Content": " I feel like a stranger because I am male. I just had high dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer in Feb and March of 2013. I had no other treatment. My PSA is doing OK so says my doc. I have a symptom which scares me. I have a tenderness in both breast right at the nipple. It doesn't hurt unless I lay on it or one of the cats walk on me. Then it can be pretty painful. I am not sure if there is a lump or not because I honestly don't know what it should feel like. I have not mentioned this to anyone. \nAny ideas or suggestions? ",

      "Content": " Merrida & Sandra,\nThanks for the comments. I have a follow up appointment with my oncologist in May and will try to talk to him about\n it. It hasn't been bothering me as much as it initially had. I have also read that pain isn't typically associated with breast cancer (in men at least).\nBest wishes to you both in your journeys. My wife has had cancer twice and my sister had breast cancer. I hope you both have a great support system in place.\nThanks again for your thoughts.\n ",
