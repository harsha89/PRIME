    "Content": " I was called back for a diagnostic mammogram last week, and, of course, freaked out. I decided to educate myself by looking for additional information on the internet, since my doctor was largely neutral on the topic (I guess they have to be) about\n whether I needed to worry. I found WebMD, which told me that 10% of all mammograms result in call backs, and of those 10%, about\n 8-10% result in biopsies. So this made me feel a little better. \nThen I found this list and hearing all your experiences made me feel less alone, and I was encouraged by all the positive outcomes. \nSo I had my second screening and ultrasound today and, whoopee! I'm okay (just getting old, 49, and developing fattier breasts with some residual dense tissue). So I guess I'm adding another data point for folks facing this scary moment, that there is a good chance you'll be okay. And, if not, you know they are catching it early. \nI'm a new and fervent convert to regular mammograms as a result. \nThanks to everyone who shared their experiences here to help me better understand what I was facing.
