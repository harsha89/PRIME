I went in last friday for my final ultrasound to see if my infection was gone and it is! there is actually no evidence anything was ever even wrong, thank god. \nI know the plight and worry many of you are going through, anti anxiety medicines are your best friend through this. Prayer is a wonderful tool, but I found the best thing to do is get out, do something you really enjoy and get your mind off of life as much as possible. I think about\n what it was like for myself and say a prayer for all the women out there having to go through this.\nVita1 I am so happy to see you are here and helping others as well i think it may give some a ray of hope to be here and know that no one has to go through this alone.

The radiologist on his first check of it was \"Very Concerned\" it is a terrifying experience and made Christmas very difficult. All I can say is have faith in yourself and if it is to big for you hand it off to a religious thought, or perhaps even a good friend. I know the anguish this breeds and it is so hard on your body. Luckily for me my mass changed in the 6 days between my mammogram/ultrasound to the day I had my biopsy, which was yesterday, it turned out to be benign and just an infection. I have never been one to believe in the man upstairs until I prayed for my Christmas miracle, I did not know what to do, and it would seem he answered me.\ngood luck to you both and I pray you have the same graces I did.\nGod Bless and Happy New year!!
