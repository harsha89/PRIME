      "Content": " I had that same issue as well Kimmymay, I still have the mass they think is actually infection they are treating me with antibiotics. If it does not shrink then they are going to remove it just to be safe. If the results are \"ok\" I am guessing that means it was benign but they want to get it out so there isn't a development of pre-cancer cells or something. Good Luck\nWoogie ",

I am a firm believer in the idol hands are the devils workshop. I kept going through all of the horrors of EVERYTHING. But I found as I did things that I had to concentrate on and less to let my mind wander the better it was for me. \nPlease keep me updated on how things go for you. Thinking of you often. Sorry it took me a couple days to reply had family in town. ",

However, yesterday during the procedure he looked at it again and said \"Huh, that doesn't look the same at all more solid cystic in nature, lets biopsy it just in case.\" I don't know if this is good news or bad news i am still terrified. Anyone tell me what you would take from that? ",

      "Content": " Mimi57 and Vita1,\nI too just went through the same thing of waiting a month to find out what was going on with a mass i had behind my nipple on my left breast. The radiologist on his first check of it was \"Very Concerned\" it is a terrifying experience and made Christmas very difficult. All I can say is have faith in yourself and if it is to big for you hand it off to a religious thought, or perhaps even a good friend. I know the anguish this breeds and it is so hard on your body. Luckily for me my mass changed in the 6 days between my mammogram/ultrasound to the day I had my biopsy, which was yesterday, it turned out to be benign and just an infection. I have never been one to believe in the man upstairs until I prayed for my Christmas miracle, I did not know what to do, and it would seem he answered me.\ngood luck to you both and I pray you have the same graces I did.\nGod Bless and Happy New year!!

I went in last friday for my final ultrasound to see if my infection was gone and it is! there is actually no evidence anything was ever even wrong, thank god. \nI know the plight and worry many of you are going through, anti anxiety medicines are your best friend through this. Prayer is a wonderful tool, but I found the best thing to do is get out, do something you really enjoy and get your mind off of life as much as possible. I think about\n what it was like for myself and say a prayer for all the women out there having to go through this.\nVita1 I am so happy to see you are here and helping others as well i think it may give some a ray of hope to be here and know that no one has to go through this alone.
