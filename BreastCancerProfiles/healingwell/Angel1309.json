    "Content": " I am 39 (family history of breast cancer, sister, 1st cousin, 2nd cousin, gggrandmother died from breast cancer) and I found a lump about\n 2 months ago..... I made an appt with Gyn and \nThe Next Week:\n1st ultrasound - radiologist recommended 6 month follow up but everything appears to be benign.... being the worrying type i had my Gyn call and refer me to a specialist.\nOne week later: \n2nd ultrasound - specialist said it was just a swollen area, no explanation.... follow up in 6 months or mammagram. So, I went back to my Gyn and she wanted me to have an MRI, but I had to have a Mammagram first.\nOne week later:\nMammagram - Radiologist said everything looks normal follow up in six months.\nStill didnt know... so time for MRI.\nTwo weeks later:\nMRI - found lesion/fibroadnoma/cyst questionable... follow up with an ultrasound!!!! Are you joking me is what I am thinking.\nSo Today (2 weeks later),\n3rd ultrasound - I walked in and showed the Tech where the questionable area is and she says \"That is not the area we are worried about\n, did no one tell you that you have another place we are concerned about\n\". I about\n flipped out. So now I have a golf ball size lump on top of my breast that NO ONE knows what it is (just a swollen area)!!!! and a SECOND Complex Cyst (only showed up in the MRI)!!!! I asked to have a biopsy!!! \nNow I have an appointment in 2 weeks and I am scared to death, any opinions????\n ",
