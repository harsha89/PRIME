    "Content": " Hi, can someone please help advise me as I\u2019m very unwell. I\u2019ve been extremely tired for the last 6/7 month and have a swelling in my neck...no lump however I feel like my lymph nodes are swollen when press down. I've been anemic for which I was given tablets and after few months I felt like I was back to the start feeling so ill I insisted on my doctor referring me to Bupa  as my doctors were simply giving me anti depression tablets. I eventually have been referred and am anemic as well as having a very high ANA. I have lost tons of hair in bunches, feel absolutely awful, very weak and feel as though I\u2019m pulled down, drained.   My doc has put me on lupus tabs but I really believe it's not that as all other lupus tests were negative, he also told me to come back in 2 weeks if it didn\u2019t make any difference. Can someone tell me what I should do? My neck inside hurts and is bigger on my right side, I also have swelling on my right arm.   ",
