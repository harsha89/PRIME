In 2005 I was dxed with Mets to the bone and in 2007 with mets to the liver.\" TN Mountain Girl talked about\n liver pain and I want to ask her about\n it. My bone pain is intense and I'm using a cane. Pallative nurses have begun coming to my home to administer pain meds and help me. Will someone talk about\n the pain they have? My mets is to my T-Spine pelvis and ribs. I'm here to help anyone with questios too\n ",
