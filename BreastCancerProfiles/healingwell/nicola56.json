    "Content": " Noticed a small red patch on my breast (when lifted to soap) in shower and went to my doc who said he could feel a 'nodule' which made me feel so terrified like every woman. You are in a sort of state of shock and one doesn't take everything in. He said it felt 'mobile' and try not to worry (!) - I had a mammogram 1 year ago which was clear and he is sending me to have an ultrasound and to a senologist. I am very thin (always have been) so any lump or bump is easily felt. I am so worried guys ... ",
