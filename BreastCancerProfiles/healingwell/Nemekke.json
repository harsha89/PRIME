      "Content": " Hi everyone and Happy Holidays :)\nI was diagnosed with stage 3 IDC in December 05 and went through chemo (AC/T), bilateral mastectomies, and radiation. Because it was ER positive and had positive lymph nodes, I was put on Tamoxifen until October of this year when two \"hot spots\" showed up on multiple scans.\nMy oncologist believes these to be bone mets, but they are not in places that can be biopsied right now. I am on Femara and Zometa.\nMy first question is....does anyone else have pain and muscle spasms after their first Zometa treatment? I was told the side effects would stop, but they haven't.\nSecond question......my potassium level keeps bottoming out when they do labs? I take multivitamins and extra potassium every day as it is.....does anyone else have this or know what it could be?\nThank you very much for your time and answers and again, Happy Holidays :)\nMichelle ",

I have read on other forums that many women have difficulties with Taxotere including severe bone and muscle pain. My oncologist had to prescribe Morphine for me last week because of a pain reaction but I am determined to fight my cancer as aggressively, if not more aggressively, than it is fighting me.\nI wish only the best for you and your mother....\nMichelle ",

      "Content": " Brnadebt,\nI was diagnosed with granulomatous sarcoidosis in 1996 when my youngest son was 1. For me is has been mountain peaks and valleys this past ten years. The doctors promised me remission after my surgery if I took the steroids and antibiotics. Over the years I have chatted with hundreds of sarcoidosis patients and NONE of us believe there is ever a remission from this condition. There are periods of time you feel great.....and other times you feel like a giant slug. The fatigue, arthritis pain, low immune system are always active for me. I don't have the option of sending PM's yet....do you use any other chat programs such as yahoo or msn? Let me know....in the meantime *huggles*\nKaren, I'm sorry about\n your mother. The medications I was on that first year with my sarcoidosis left me with a hiatal hernia (where a portion of your stomach moves up into the esophagus) and seven ulcers. The ulcers eventually healed but I still have problems with the hernia, especially with chemo and nausea. I met a young woman several years ago who had her baby with active sarcoidosis....she said she felt better during the pregnancy....not sure if it was the hormones or the joy at carrying a new life.\nMy support and hugs to both of you....\nMichelle ",

I think my Stage III diagnosis gets to me because I also have sarcoidosis which is similar to fibromyalgia/chronic fatigue syndrome. Sometimes I just want to have \"normal\" days like \"everyone else.\" On the other hand, I believe \"normals\" are furry little woodland creatures that hide from us humans....LOL...(By the way, yes I am certifiably insane :) )\n*hugs*\nMichelle ",

      "Content": " Thank you for the reply Karen :)\nI think I already knew I was at least a Stage III, but hearing the doctor say it makes it a little too real. It helps to see others who were Stage III and now doing well. Chemo has been rough but since I don't/can't work right now, I am just dealing with it day by day and doing whatever I can to finish it as it is definitely shrinking the tumor.\nI am sooooo glad your life is even better now. I have made many serious mistakes in my life....started doing things right almost four years ago....and I would like to hope that I have enough time left to fix some of the mistakes.\nI will keep my fingers crossed that things will get even better for you.\n*Hugs*\nMichelle ",

I was diagnosed with IDC (Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma) 12/29/05, have completed Adriamycin/Cytoxan chemo and will have my second Taxotere chemo on Wednesday. Because of the size of my tumor and possible lymph node involvement, my doctors suggested completing chemo first, then surgery, then radiation. I haven't been told my ER/PR status yet but was told today that I am more than likely Stage III/Grade III and I'm scared now that this means I will more than likely have recurrence and/or mets.\nI have two sons, ages 10 and 24, many indoor pets, and all the outdoor critters one could hope to see in their backyard, as well as a wonderful boyfriend of almost four years now who has been so very supportive and understanding of what this experience does/means to me.
