    "Content": " Hi everyone,\nI joined this forum because of this thread about\n Femara. I was diagnosed w/ bc July 09, had bilateral masectomy, AC-T chemo, and now am supposed to take Femara for 5 yrs. I'm not positive that its the Femara causing my problems, but after reading this and some other \"personal posts\", I'm beginning to think it may be the Femara. I only took it for 1 1/2 months and the pain in my hands was almost unbearable. I had this horrible tingling/numbness/shooting pain in my hands(worse in the right) that would wake me from my sleep. The only way to get it to go away was to get up and walk around. Not fun at 4AM EVERY morning! I quit taking it 3 wks. prior to the next phase of recon. surgery and pain subsided. I started back and after only a couple of weeks the pain is coming back. It does not wake me, but it's the 1st thing I feel when I wake. When I described my symptoms to my physical therapist(was seeing for lymphedema) she said it sounded like carpal tunnel. this is the worst pain, I have other pains, too. My lower back and hips hurt. I'm 38 yrs. old and was really looking forward to getting back to work after a year out on disablity. I teach middle school and have the opportunity to coach gymnastics during the school day this year. But I'm worried IF I'll even be able to. \nI also feel \"mental\" most of the time.(depressed, anxious, stressed out) I'm like wth, here I am finished with chemo, finished with the worst of the surgeries, and now I fall apart! What is up with this? I am definitely NOT willing to live like this. (quantity vs. quality) My tumor was ER-, Pr+ (only 20%). So, I question just how much benefit I would get from any AI. ",
