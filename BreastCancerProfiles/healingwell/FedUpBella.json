    "Content": " Hi,\nI'm 35y/o female with no children and about\n two years ago I started to get nipple discharge (puss) from my left breast after various tests they found a benign cyst and decided that it should be removed. about\n four months after the first operation the infection came back but was now creating an abscess under the scar tissue and eventually bursting through the scar with blood and puss, it was decided that I should have the same operation a second time but about\n 4 months afterwards the same thing is happening. I have seen various specialists but none of them have done or suggested anything. \nNow, about\n once a month usually coinciding with my period I can feel a painful hard lump and as the days progress the lump moves closer to the scar (with increasing pain and the whole surrounding area is red and sore) and eventually I see an abscess full of puss under the skin until it burst through the original scar tissue. Each month where the abscess bursts it leaves a pretty big hole left in my breast, it is healing between outbursts but I'm worried that after a few more months of this maybe it won't heal, am I going to have to put up with this every month for the rest of my life?\nHas anyone else experienced anything similar? Are there any cures except taking antibiotics every month, is there an operation to fix it? Is this a common side effect of having a cyst removal?\nThank you. ",
