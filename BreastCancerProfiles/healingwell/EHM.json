      "Content": " Well.....good news for yesterday!!! The surgeon could not find the lump and he was feeling so hard it hurt at one point. He did recheck the area with ultrasound and could find nothing as well. He feels it may be fibrocystic disease. He didn't feel a biopsy was necessary and since he was so thorough about\n checking, I'm comfortable with that.\nHOWEVER, I'll be keeping a close eye on this area. I thank you ALL so much for answering my questions and concerns and for being willing to share with me. The SAA board that Gail and I write on is like this board----people care and are very supportive! :)\nHugs,\nElaine ",

      "Content": " Is it possible she is still breastfeeding or recently weaned her son? I had a mammogram at the age of 37 due to a lump and I was still nursing my child who was about\n one at a time. They found microcalcifications. A surgeon looked at them and I had a followup mammogram six months later which was okay...everything was stable. Just thought I'd mention that.\nElaine ",

      "Content": " Thanks Bev. I guess the thing that bothers me is the ultrasound missed the lump, but only saw the cysts that I thought were there already. I was a little ticked at the tech who pooh=poohed my concerns.\nI will see what the surgeon says, but I may insist on a biopsy unless he gives me a good reason why I shouldn't. I do want peace of mind. The lump is so deep in my breast and the cysts are closer to the surface. I think that's why it's hard to find.\nI really appreciate your sharing with me. I will be back to let you know what the doc says. Chances are it will turn out to be nothing, but I want to know for sure one way or another!!!\nElaine ",
