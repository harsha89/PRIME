      "Content": " I understand what you are saying... The thing is... because my boyfriend has an illness that has only just taken him 15 1/2 years to come through and has now came back, he needs to see doctors and councilers on his own or at least with his mum and family... we have broken off our relationship for the time being and are not aloud to see, speak or find out how each other are doing so we can consentrate on getting ourselves sorted. Even when I was younger, before my mum died, I used to cope with a number of things alone and that is why I hid from it all of these years, believeing to myself I can cope alone. I parshally blamed myself for my mums death anyway, as the last words I told her as a 12 year old kid, were \"I HOPE YOU DIE!\" as I couldn't get something I wanted. Now I sit here and think and worry about\n the last 6 years. I sit here now while it plays on my mind, unable to deal with anything myself, sitting here crying now as I regret everything I have done over the last 6 to 7 years... knowing that this may be mine and my boyfriends time over for good (loosing him is gonna hit me so hard!!) knowing that I can never see my mum face to face again... all the hard things that have happened over the last 6 years... them all pilling up over time and just exploding out at me all at once... this is why so many time I have just given up, cut my self, running away to find a way to kill myself... because I know for a fact that I can't cope with it any more!!!!!\n \n ",

      "Content": " I was 12 when my mum was diagnosed with cancer. She collapsed and was rushed to hospital with the paramedics thinking it was a slipped disk. When we were told it was cancer, it was quite hard hitting (as it would be in any situation) The thing is... my mum died 8 months later as they had caught it too late but me being so young at the time, didn't relises that there could have been consiquences like there was. I argued with my mum so many time, and ignored her when she asked me to do something (because I didn't understand) 6 years on & now I am 18, I really wish I could turn back time. I wondered why, that because she couldn't walk as well as she used to, I treated her any differently. Now that I am 18, I have been advised to go to the doctors and get scans and tests to see if I also have cancer so it can be caugh it in the earliest of stages (I would advise you to go the the doctors and ask to get tested regularly because it does run in your family) All I can say is don't let little problems ruine your relationship & alway live life to the full because you never know whats round the corner. (My thoughts are with you, your mum & family at this hard time. If she see's you being stong and possitive for her, she will do the same. Don't be afraid to have fun at this time too!\n ",
