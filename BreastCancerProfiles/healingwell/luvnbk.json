      "Content": " I'm 30 years old and discovered a large lump in my right breast last Wednesday. It's probably been there longer but I'm sad to say I'm not faithful w/ the self exams. I say large because it consumes almost the entire breast. I had a mamo and an ultra sound yesterday and have been referred to a surgeon because of the findings which were 3 areas of microcalcifications, a giant complex cyst that contains a large area of matter, a smaller simple cyst, and 7 smaller solid  lumps.  I was stunned when the Dr. told me that he is deeply concerned about\n the calcifications and that we cannot ignore them. I was in so much shock that I couldn't even come up with a single question to ask.  As you might imagine I'm flooded with them today after doing a little research and I'm more scared than ever!  Everything I've read either describes finding one or the other but not all of this at once and I truly do not know what to make of it.  Any words of wisdom while I await my next appointment would be appreciated.

      "Content": " debbiR, thanks for your advice.  My husband and I did have a date night last night, the first in a long time and it was wonderful.  The notebook  and tape recorder are great ideas that I'm definitely going to use.  I live in Omaha Nebraska. Regardless of what my outcome is I certainly am awakened to the reality of it. I've long been a supporter of breast cancer awareness and have sponsored a co-worker in the Race For A Cure for 5 years but my outlook is a lot different now, it includes making myself and all those that I love be faithful with self exams.  I'm off to enjoy the day shopping, you're all very wise to advise having positive thoughts and staying busy. The laughter will be in full force tomorrow when I watch my daughter and all her friends sing karaoke and celebrate the New Year, who knows I might join them! ",

      "Content": " coopfesta and kattbird, thanks for your kind words.  I am married to a wonderful man who himself is a 24 yr survivor of Hodgins lymphoma and have two wonderful children.  Because he knows the fear he could not be more supportive. His family is tremendously supportive because they've all been through the waiting games. If it were not for his insistence I probably would have taken a lot longer to book my inital Dr.'s appointment.  I work in sales and oddly enough have 4 co-workers battling different types of cancer so I get my fill of it on a daily basis which makes it hard to ignore or at least not think about\n the what if's!  I can also say that if my worst fears are realized I do have access to some of the best Dr.s in the country, the surgeon I'm seeing next week is the same one who biopsied my husband 24 years ago, he's a world renowned surgeon and I know I'll be in good hands.  I will keep you updated.
