One more of those little pills and I'm officially done with treatment (knock wood). It's wonderful to see all of the long term survivors in this post. I also grieve for the many wonderful ladies that we've lost along the way. I miss Peggy everyday. There has been so much I've wanted to share with her in the past year. What an adventure the last five years have been. Even though I don't post much it's been wonderful to have you ladies to share it with. Yeah for us!!!\nCarole\n ",

      "Content": " Adding my two cents. Even though you are having chemo only every three weeks, you will have blood drawn much more often than that. A port can really save your veins all that trauma. Even before chemo started it was getting difficult to get blood from my one good arm just from all of the tests. Getting the port in was a piece of cake. True, it was a little annoying at first because of that unacustomed lump on my chest but after a while it became part of the territory. I was prescribed a small amount of blood thiner to prevent any problems with clotting, etc. and a tube of Emla cream to put on the port before it is accessed. The Emla numbs the skin and takes most of the ouch out of the procedure. In any case it's only one ouch, not ouch, ouch, ouch while they dig around for a vein they can use. About six months after I finished radiation my oncologist encouraged me to get the port taken out which I did. I'm coming up on my five year anniversary and haven't had any problems (knock wood) and my veins are in good enough shape to take blood the old fashioned way. I'm pretty sure that wouldn't have been the case if I hadn't had the port. If you do decide to get one, try to get it done when you have your lumpectomy. That was you will save yourself a procedure. Good luck, Carole\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Sherry,\nSorry to see that you've joined the BC club. I saw your original post and could relate so well. I was diagnosed at 39 by a routine mammagram. I had a 2 cm lump and two positive nodes. I had a lumpectomy, chemo, and radiation and am one month away from my five year anniversary. You've gotten excellent advice so far. The only thing I'd like to add is my fervent recommendation that you see a medical oncologist before you make any surgical decisions. They are really the cancer experts and will know all of the stats and pros and cons of lumpectomy vs. mastectomy vs. bilateral mast., etc. I was fully intending to have a bilateral until I talked to my onc. I haven't regretted having a lumpectomy although there has been some down side to it. In the last five years I've needed three biopsies. One on the cancer side and two on the non cancer side. All were negative which is good but they were emotionally taxing to deal with. One other thing you might consider is getting into a study of some kind. Very often you can get cutting edge treatment and you often get more attention too. That's another thing to ask the oncologist about. This is such an intense time. Take a deep breath and take your time making your decisions. Once you've made them, full speed ahead and don't look back. You've come to a good place for support. There are many wonderful women here with a wealth of experience and who know just how you are feeling right now.\nCarole\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Kathy. It will help you to bring a tape recorder to your first appointment with your oncologist. That way you can listen to what you missed later. Also have the oncologist write down the names of the chemo drugs he'll/she'll be using. Ask how he's going to handle any side effects and how to contact him or another oncologist if you have difficulties after hours. Ask about the possibility of getting into a study. Studies can offer cutting edge treatment and sometimes, extra attention. Don't expect to think of all of your questions during the appointment so ask how you can contact him when you do think of what you want to ask. This is a very overwhelming time with lots of information coming at you. Take it easy on yourself and don't be afraid to ask all the questions you want. Good luck, Kathy.\n ",
