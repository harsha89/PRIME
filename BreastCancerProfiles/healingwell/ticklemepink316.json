But this to I shall over come!!!! Just reading your comments has made me feel so much better, and even though I don't have breast cancer my mother did and is fixing to celebrate her 20th birthday of being cancer free. GLORY TO GOD!!! I'm so glad you ladies have such a wonderful friendship. Sounds like you all have helped one another through the good and the bad. It's just wonderful to read such kind words. And I can't wait to continue reading all the stories of hope and most especially those of you who post you are cancer freeeeeeee.\n ",
