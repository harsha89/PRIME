      "Content": " I wrote recently for help on travel insurance, and found lots of helpful replies. It is important to have it because we are travelling to Florida with the children and if anything at all happened to me (fall and injured leg for example) they would access my medical records and I would be done for fraud if I hadn't disclosed my cancer on the travel insurance forms. I was very lucky with a good company called FREEDOM who are based in cambridge and I got a 'bearable' quote for them for the whole family -incase anything happened to me they would have hotel costs etc paid for them. \n \n ",
