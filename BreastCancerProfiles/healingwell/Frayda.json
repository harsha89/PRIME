There may not be a medical reason for the reconstruction, but there is definitely an emotional one. Once my cancer treatment was finished and my reconstruction was completed, I felt whole again. I looked good with and without clothes. I would venture to say that my reconstructed breasts look better than the big floppy original equipment LOL! Don't discount your emotional well being. It is all part of the healing process. Good luck!\n ",

      "Content": " Unfortunately there is not much that you can do.  Your doctor can request a review, but he will have to document that the service he provided was more complex that the routine procedure that the benefit allowance was based. The benefit allowances are set by the insurance company themselves.  Your doctor has no obligation to accept what the insurance company considers \"usual and customary\", therefore you are responsible for the doctor's full fee.  It is very misleading to consumers when the large print on your insurance policy says they will pay 80% of the UCR.  You are then really responsible for everything that is not covered by the insurance which can amount to thousands of dollars in unexpected expenses. That is how an indemnity plan works; there is no panel of participating doctors that have agreed to accept the fee allowances. When a doctor signs a contract with a PPO or HMO the doctor has agreed to accept the insurance fees and the patient is responsible for only his/her co-pay. Hope this is helpful. ",

      "Content": " Hi Tammy! I was in a similar situation 3 years ago. I know how hard it is not to worry, but it is not time yet! There are lots of things it could be other than cancer. A pulmonary specialist should look at the scans and evaluate the situation.  In my case, several small nodules appeared in a routine CT scan. Since I wasn't having any symptoms, he recommended taking another scan in 3 months to see if there was any change. They remained unchanged for a year. (taking CT scans every 3 months.) Then I had an episode of coughing up blood which occured 6 weeks after the previous scan. I had another scan then and one of the nodules grew to the size of a quarter in less than 6 weeks. To make a very long story short, I developed a very rare form of TB called atypical TB from being immunosupressed. It was not the contagious type. I was treated with antibiotics for 18 months and the condition is currently stable. I still have several nodules that have remained unchanged. I have graduated to getting scanned every 6 months as long as I remain stable. I am NOT implying that this is what you have, but it is only an example of something other than cancer! My pulmonologist said if he scanned 10 random people off the street, 9 of them would have some type of abnormal result. Most of these are benign nodules that are nothing to worry about\n. Once we have cancer, everything else that would happen in a \"normal\" person and seem routine, becomes terrifying when it happens to us.  I certainly would not accept waiting a year! Check with your oncologist or find a good pulmonologist and let him check you out. I hope this has helped. Hugs, Frayda ",

      "Content": " Lori is correct: they found invasive and non-invasive cells in the biopsy, which may have led the doctors to do the MRI because they suspect there is more than one tumor. Non-invasive cells are DCIS (ductal carcinoma in-situ). It is not uncommon to find DCIS along with invasive tumor. The MRI is more sensitive than the mammo or u/s. My cancer was not seen on either mammo or u/s, only on MRI. That's why they have to do an MRI guided biopsy: it's the only way to find the tumors! I had the MRI back in 2000 as part of the landmark MRI study for high risk breast cancer patients. When they located the tumors (I had 3) they marked them with titanium needles. Then they took another mammo to check if they could see the tumors with the needle markers. The tumors still didn't show on the mammo, only the needles! Thanks to that study, MRI is used routinely now. I guess I was one of the reasons to support MRI screening for high risk patients! The MRI will help your doctors determine the extent of your cancer and plan your treatment.\nGood luck! ",

Right from the beginning, the right implant had problems: it swelled up twice the size as the left side and took a really long time for the swelling to go down. Then it felt like a rock (compared to the right side). It turned out to be capsular constricture and had to be replaced. My ps said he had never seen that happen so quickly before. He said I had formed a lot of scar tissue around the implant. Maybe my RA had something to do with that (autoimmune response). Then a year and a half later, the same side began leaking (it got noticably smaller) so we replaced it again! That was three years ago, and so far, so good! He said the average life of an implant is 10 years, so replacement must be fairly common and insurance companies have to deal with it. Again, hope all is well! \nFrayda ",

The reconstruction definately added to the recovery and amount of discomfort.  I have also had abdominal surgery and the mastectomy was somewhat easier. You will have drains for a week to 10 days which are uncomfortable. Loose shirts that button down the front and safety pins for the drains are a must!  Even if everything goes well and you are feeling good after two weeks, remember that it is still major surgery and you need to give yourself time to heal. Don't go back to work too soon; I'd give yourself a month to take it easy if you can. I thought I was was feeling good enough to go back to the office after a week, just a few hours a day; not a good idea! After a month I almost collapsed from exhaustion.  I am happy to say that was almost 6 years ago and everything is fine now!

I had a bilateral mastectomy with expanders 5 1/2 years ago. The drains stay in anywhere between one to two weeks, depending on when the amount of fluid gets down to less than 30 cc per day (that number may be different today) One side on me dried up faster than the other but I think they were both ready to come out about\n day 10. Depending on your job, you should try to stay home as long as you can (at least three weeks).  This is major surgery and your body will have sustained quite an insult, so you will need plenty of rest to give your body a chance to heal. I thought I could handle going back a few hours a day after a week.  After three weeks, I thought I was going to crash! I took another full week off just to rest and then came back again part time for another three weeks before trying full time.  I had a hard time sleeping on my back. I did experience muscle spasms in my chest during the expansion period. My dr. gave me a prescript\nion for a muscle relaxer which also helped me sleep. They will show you stretching exercises to do to increase your range of motion in your arms. Make sure you do them! You will start out easy at first , then increase slowly until you can get your arms above your head. Good luck! If you have any specific questions, I'd be happy to help! Frayda ",

Yes, your insurance will pay for the other breast.  The federal regulation requires insurance to pay for any surgery that restores symetry, whether it be mastectomy & reconstruction or augmentation. I had a bilateral mastectomy with immediate recon with expanders and implants. I went back to work about\n six days after my surgery (drains tucked inside!). That was a mistake! After several weeks I was emotionally and physically exhausted! Your body will have gone through a significant trauma and will need time to heal.  Don't short change yourself!

It showed that one of those nodules that we have been watching since last year suddenly got a lot bigger since the last scan 6 weeks ago. Since I was seeing the doctor at Sloan Kettering today, I brought the scan with me. She took the bloodwork for the tumor markers and ordered a PET scan that I waited around for. Thanks,guys, for being so patient! Well, that area definately lit up but I won't get an official report until next week. I brought a copy of the scan to my doctor here in NJ and he sceduled a bronchoscopy for Tuesday. So ladies, please come back here to NJ on Tuesday!

When your immune system is supressed like mine is with long term use of methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis, you can get this infection. My pulmonary doctor started me on a TB drug regimen (4 antibiotics!) and we cancelled the lung biopsy. My doctor at Sloan Kettering is pleased with this news, too!

I was part of that big study that was using MRI for screening high risk women for breast cancer (my mother and sister had bc).  The results found that the MRI is definately a good idea for high risk, but not for the general population because of the high percentage of false positives.  They found a significant number of early cancers that were not found on mammogram or ultrasound.  I was one of them! Both my mammo and u/s were \"normal\"! I was 44 at the time and had large dense breasts. They may not have found anything on a mammo until things  got much larger and I might not be here five years later talking about\n it! Your radiation treatment puts you in the high risk category and I commend your doctor for suggesting the MRI. He really has your best interest at heart.  I am not suggesting that you may have cancer, but this is certainly one of the better diagnostic tools for early detection and that is surely our best defense against this disease.

      "Content": " Hi Laure! I had multifocal and multicentric DCIS with microinvasions.  Multifocal means multiple lesions in the same quadrant of the breast while multicentric means lesions in more than one quadrant.  My cancer was not visible on mammo or u/s. Three lesions were found on an MRI, which turned out to be the DCIS. My surgeon recommended a mastectomy due to the multicentric issue. If the lesions were confined to a single quadrant, she said we could consider a lumpectomy with radiation.  She also felt there was a good chance there would be additional DCIS scattered throughout the breast, which would be likely to result in a recurrence if I chose a partial mastectomy.  Since I was very high risk anyway (mother and sister had bc) I chose a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction (saline implants). I needed reconstruction on the mastectomy, so I felt it was worth the peace of mind to do the prophylactic mastectomy at the same time and the reconstruction would be symetrical. The final pathology revealed 5 additional areas of DCIS in the cancer breast and several areas of DCIS and LCIS on the prophylactic side! For me, this was obviously the right choice. If you have any specific questions, I would be happy to help. Good luck! Frayda ",

My ps wouldn't consider them without the approval of my rheumatologist. I agree Candy, almost everything in medicine has risks associated with it. The medications I take for the arthritis have some potentially dangerous side effects. In fact Bextra is one of them and the FDA has recently recommended it be pulled from the market! This will probably result in switiching to another potentially dangerous drug that may not work as well as the Bextra did. Well, the opposition may have won this battle, but the war is far from over!

Mom had a tough recovery from her surgery and the final pathology has her more advanced than originally thought (Stage IIIC). The onc waited until she was stronger to start the chemo about a month ago. She's had 2 out of six treatments; so far so good. She has since developed a new growth about the size of a marble under her incision which they are removing tomorrow. She is still trying to be upbeat, but I can tell this is getting to her.  I am going to Florida next week for a few days to check up on her. Maybe the PCE can make a stop in Del Ray Beach? I'll let you know how she makes out! You guys are the best!  Hugs, Frayda ",

There is care giving assistance available, but the social worker must make the arrangements. There may be assistance for you also, should it be necessary. You need to let social services get involved and let the system work for you. With your family bc history, you are certainly considered high risk, whether or not you take the BRCA test. Even if this episode turns out OK (and I hope it does!) you will need to be followed very carefully in the future. There are special high risk protocols that you should discuss with you doctor.

Let me try to reassure you that breast lumps are very common, but most of the time they are benign.  The only way to know for sure is to biopsy it.  A stereotactic needle biopsy is one way to do this. A special computer finds the breast lesion and then the technician \"locks\" the breast in position for the radiologist take one or more samples of the lesion with needle, which feels like a bee sting. It may take several days to get the results, which is the hardest part of any test. We will be here to help you wait for your results, which we all hope will be benign!

Chemo can make your gums more susceptible to periodontal (gum) disease and that results in gum recession.  When your gums receed, your roots get exposed and that is what is so sensitive.  Your roots are not covered by the protective enamel, so your teeth become very sensitive to hot, cold and sweet.  You can reduce some of the sensitivity by using a fluoride mouth wash (like Act) daily or a special desensitizing toothpaste like Sensodyne. Exposed root surfaces are very likely to decay, so that eventually contributes to the sensitivity.  Brushing and flossing are the best way to prevent that, in addition to regular visits with your hygienist!

I would caution against using the creams because of the new incisions; many of the anti-itch creams have various forms of steroids in them (such as hydrocortisone) and that can delay or interfere with the healing process. Moist heat from a warm wash cloth will give some temporary relief and you can do that as often as you want. Also, use a moisturizer daily to keep the skin soft. Vitamin E is supposed to help healing and prevent scarring, but don't use it until the incisions have closed completely. Frayda ",

The problem is if anything serious develops, then you have to stay in NY or scramble to find someone in LV. Did the LV doc leave the phone messages himself or was it his office staff? If it was him, then I would guess he was trying to make ammends. My DH genuinely feels bad when patients have to wait a long time for an appointment, but sometimes unforseen things happen that can really throw a schedule off. We always let the patients know if there is going to be a delay so that the patient can decide if they want to reschedule. If it was the office staff that called, then he was just CHA (covering his a**) to document that they tried to reach you about having that test! Either way, you got off on the wrong foot with this office. If you really like this doc, then you have to look past the office staff. Otherwise, you are best getting a fresh start with someone new.

Some cancers are just very difficult to detect with traditional tests, especially if your mom has very dense breasts. The MRI, even though it is more sensitive that mammography and ultra sound, still is not 100% accurate. I agree with Lori that your mom should consult a major cancer center where state of the art and cutting edge technology is available, especially since your mom's cancer is being so ellusive. BTW, loosing her breast is not so awful; it will be difficult at first but if she chooses, there are great reconstruction options. I had bilateral mastectomies with reconstruction and I am very happy with the results. You and your mom should come here with questions. Collectively we have had many different experiences and are able to offer assitance in deciphering all the information that will be thrown at you in the beginning.

The truth is, if aspirin was first marketed today, it would never pass the stringent FDA regulations for release! Any medication you take has risks associated with it; it's better that hurting!

I went through a similar ordeal last year with my ovaries and finally opted for the oopherectomy. Some people thought I was crazy to go through another surgery, but no one but us understand the worry and fear that we can't ignore. Take this for what it is worth, but it did bring me peace of mind.

The women here are a wonderful source of support. Being able to \"talk\" to someone else who has gone through the same thing is so comforting. I found their caring and support invaluable! One of the most helpful books for me was \"Living Beyond Breast Cancer\" by Marissa Weiss, MD. She also has a website, www.breastcancer.org that has lots of info and resources. The depression that follows your surgery is common; many of us have sought some professional help to get through it, as medication can help. Share some more info with us so we can better help you. I had reconstruction w/ saline implants. Once the reconstruction was completed, I felt much better; kind of like Humpty Dumpty who was put back together again!LOL! I'd be happy to share my experiences with you! Here's a big ((((HUG)))) to welcome you to our little corner of cyberspace! Frayda ",

She was warm and gracious and genuinely interested in my story.  She was incredibly talented as well!

That means an invasive procedure such as a root canal, extraction or dental implants. Simple, routine procedures that do not involve contamination of the bone such as cleanings or fillings should not be of concern. Certainly, if you are taking aredia or zometa you need to inform your dentist before any dental treatment. Shells, your symptoms are classic for TMJ and a night guard may certainly help. Your dentist should be able to determine that and make you one. Hugs, Frayda ",

      "Content": " Luci, I am also relieved that a tumor was not detected on the MRI. However, remember that no imaging modality is definitively diagnostic; it just gives the doctor information. Some types of imaging techniques are better for soft tissue while others are better for hard tissues. The new digital imaging techniques are highly specialized and need to be read accurately by the radiologists.  Whether your doctor has or has not seen the films himself may not mean that he is a bad doctor; he most likely cannot \"read\" the MRI and is relying on the skills of the radiologist to interpret the study.  He may not be jumping into surgery blindly, but rather wants to see with his eyes what is going on and biopsy anything that appears unusual.  You know the drill: a biopsy is the ONLY way to know what something really is! Even though medicine has come such a long way technologically, there is still a lot of \"gut feelings\" that guide our physicians to take one coarse or another, and that just comes from experience. A second opinion is certainly in order, especially since you are not comfortable with your original doctor's recommendation. I just want to share with you some perspective from the \"other\" side. I really do hope this turns out to be just another pork chop bone! L&H, Frayda ",
