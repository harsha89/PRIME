    "Content": " Hi Jenny. I don't normally post here but was just browsing active threads and came upon this one. I know it's easy for me to say as I am the queen of worry but I had an ultrasound guided biopsy a few years ago. They put a wire in the lump using the ultrasound as a guide so the dr. knows where it is when he cuts. Mine turned out to be a fibroanginoma (I think that's what he called it anyway) but it appeared one month then started changing and growing. I was a nervous wreck for the week after the operation until I got the results. Chances are on your side that all will be fine. I pray things turn out in your favor \n ",
