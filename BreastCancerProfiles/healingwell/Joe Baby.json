      "Content": " Hi all. So I got my results today. Bone marrow biopsy was inconclusive. So we're going to do watchful waiting for 2 months then do another Pet scan at the end of March. Then I'll See doc again begining of April. they're going to compare this scan with that one and if it still shows cancer in my bones, then Chemo. She showed me the scan and it looks like paint splatered spots in my bones, but they say its slow growing. I'm confused. They called it\nStage IV B Cell Marginal Zone NHL. I looked it up and there is still other classes under that. How do I know which one? I had an area removed on my right chest still have one on my back near the right of my spine, one in my right shoulder blade, and then the splatters all over my bones. She said it's slow growing. i'm so confused. Does anyone have any info, also I have lupus. Don't know if that matters. Feeling a little better though knowing I won't have to go through chemo for at least a couple more months, but scared about\n it spreading...Jo\n. ",

      "Content": " Hi, well the reports are in. The area that they took off my chest showed a b cell low grade non hodgkins lymphoma. So I thought ok its a slow growing type I can handle this then they ordered a pet scan to see if the other areas are cancer and to see if its anywhere else. Went to see oncologist yesterday and scan confirmed the other 2 areas are cancer and it apears it could be on my bones. So I have a bone marrow biopsy scheduled for Friday. On my 33rd birthday. My oncologist said the biopsy results from my chest and the scan don't add up. She's thinking that the low grade is becoming more aggressive. If bone marrow biopsy confirms then its chemo and transplant for me. I'm freaking a little. Ok a lot. I know this is a bc forum but there's not one for lymphoma. I'm so scared cuz I know the disease can kill but I also no as a nurse of many years so can the treatment. Is there anyone that's been through this. Or know someone who's has been and servived. I still know nothing. All I know is I've neen fighting since I was born. Been through a very abusive childhood, brain surgery, lupus,every obstical you can imagine. And I'm gona keep on fighting. I have the greatest husband of 16 years and 3 beautiful children to fight for. My journey here is not over. My oldest just had her 15th bday. They grow up so fast. My middle daughter is little mommy @ 11 and my 8 year old son is amazing. He's blind and so smart. I have to be here to see how they turn out college marriage babies. Well thanks for the ear ill be in touch with the results itl be around the 17th of jan for the results. Thanks again for listening......jo ",

      "Content": " Hi Bev, Thanks for the Hug. I've been doing a lot of research, and I found a NHL support group forum, so I'm starting to understand a little more. I'm more comfortable now with the decission to watch and wait. They will monitor me very closely for any change, and then re evaluate for treatment. It's because it's a slow growing cancer, and though treatment can put it in remission, it will come back. It's a cancer that has to be maintained like Lupus, or diabetes. So I probably will need tx at some point maybe more than once. The side effects ffrom the chemo could make me sicker than the cancer right now. So I'll wait to see what the comparison results show. I'll keep you posted.\nThanks for a;; the support.....JO ",

      "Content": " Hi Bev, no not really. I've been on plaquinel for about\n 3 n half years. Other than that no. That was one of the questions my oncologist asked. I was never a sickly person. I start gradually with the lupus @ 17 after I got pregnant with my oldest. I had a lot of problems with my pregnancy they suspected lupus. I never did get a def diagnosis til bout 3half years ago. It just kept getn tossed around. I had hydrocephalus in 2004 which was rare at my age, later they said could've been from lupus. My oncologist really seemed dumd founded when she met with me and all the tests are showong different levels of cancer. That's why the bone marrow biopsy. I'm really hoping for the best but fearing the worst. The waiting is terrible\nI wont know anything until jan 13. That seems like a million years away. I just want to think of something else but it occupies my every thought. If I knew even if it was the worst. It seems like it would be easier to deal with cuz then I would have a better understanding of what's going on and I could research and get more info on tx and trials. Well I'm living my life as normal as I can. Went shopping yesterday and gonna clean house today. The worst is I still have to be mom and I'm the more disaplinarian in my house. I feel so guilty everytime I have to chastise one of the kids. I want to just give them whatever they want. And let them do what ever. But they still need correct guidance and to stay focused in school and do chores. You know what I mean. Well ill keep you informed when I know more. Thank you for you support it really helps. Be in touch soon ....jo ",
