      "Content": " Hi, first I would like to thank all of you who responded and provided me with suggestions in the best way to help my friend Amy.  Amy is 37 and single without children.  Children are very important to her and it is hard for her to think of life without them.  I spoke with Amy today and she is trying to find out information about having some eggs frozen.  She lives in Iowa and the University of Iowa said they only freeze embryos, which she doesn't have.  She is trying to find out more information about this, but I wondered if anyone had any information to share regarding this.  Thank you in advance for taking time to respond and help me.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, this is my first time to this sight and I'm looking for some advise.  My very close friend Amy was diagnosed a week ago with breast cancer.  She had a mastecomy last Wed. and go the lymph nodes results back Friday.  They removed 9 and 8 were infected.  She goes this week for more testing and will start chemo next week.  She has a huge support system and is being very strong about this.  What I would like to know most is how can I help her?  Everyone says just be there when she needs you, but I would like to know from others who have gone or are going through what she is going through, what was most helpful to you?  What was the best thing someone did for you, the gift that meant the most, ideas for a care package, anything that a friend can do besides just be there.  I will be there for anything she needs.\n \n ",
