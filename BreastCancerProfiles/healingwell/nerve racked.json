      "Content": " Thank you both! Im sure everything will be ok & I am glad that they're being proactive, its just I'm barely an A as it is so what they've done so far has had its effect. \nBtw, have either of you had blood from your nipple after biopsies? It's dark now but its been 2 weeks now....I'm goin in tomorrow but figured I'd ask :) \n Hope you ladies have a day ",

      "Content": " Hi. So glad I found this site! Ive already had 2 lumpectomy's on my right breast. One in 2002 & one last July (I'm 34!) I went in for my 6 month follow up, alil late! Anyway, they found microcalcifications on my right breast during mammo. Met with Dr who performed 2 needle biopsues. He's not really saying much, but results came back pretty much inconclusive. So I am now scheduled for surgery next Thursday. I broke down last nite & told my husband u am tired of being poked prodded & sliced & if i could have my way, I'd go ahead & have my boobs removed! I already gave my right one a nickname, ' frankenboob'. I don't think they will find anything and just tell me to come back in 6 months, its almost like why keep goin thru this emotional rollercoaster? Wondering if anyone else has been thru this. The other reports that I've read said Bi-rad 4. \n ",
