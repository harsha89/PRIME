    "Content": " Hi! I am a 52 y.o. who had a lumpectomy 11/09 for atypical hyperplasia and now I have a complex cyst on the same breast. Frustrated because of density in breasts and negative mammograms for years. Have seen 5 different breast surgeons over the past 15 years with 5 different biopsies. Because of the surgery in November, should I request a biopsy of the cyst vs: watching and waiting? Any help would be appreciated. ",
