      "Content": " Well, I went to an OB/GYN today for a second opinion. He said that I didn't have a breast infection (which I already knew) and did a breast exam. When he started poking and prodding on my left breast, I cried out in pain! But, he said that the pain is not only in my breast but in my chest wall and that I didn't \"feel like I had\" IBC. He said that I probably pulled something or slept on it funny!?! (Even though I've had symptoms for a month!) But, he wants me to go ahead with the mammogram and see what it says. So, now I'm waiting some more and don't know what to do. Most of the time IBC isn't detected by a mammogram, right? Now what?? ",

      "Content": " Well, I just got home from work or I would have posted sooner, but I did see the doctor today. Like I said before, this wasn't my normal woman doctor and I refuse to ever see this doc again! He barely looked at my breast, didn't give me a breast exam, and said, \"Oh, you've probably just got an infection. Here's a prescript\nion for an anti-inflammatory and an antibiotic.\" When I asked him about\n IBC, he looked at me like I had two heads, told me that he had never heard of it, and laughed at me!! GRRRRR!!! If I had not been half-naked, I might have followed him out into the hallway! But, he did schedule a diagnostic mammogram \"just to rule out anything else.\" But, like you guys said, IBC isn't usually detected by a mammogram, so what do I do now?? I personally don't think I have an infection and think it would be silly to take the antibiotics without one. I just have this feeling in the pit of my stomach that something isn't right, but I'm having a hard time convincing anyone else around me of that. Thanks for reading. ",

      "Content": " I was finally able to get to see my usual nurse-practitioner this morning, and when she did a breast exam, she discovered that the place where most of my pain is that there is a thickening of the skin. \n:( Not good news. But, she actually knows about\n IBC, and agrees that I should have a biopsy performed. However, she wants me to have it done at UAB's Kirklin Clinic, because she's afraid none of the doctors in this small town would know what to look for. Also, she said that if it is cancer, she would rather that I be treated at UAB Hospital. Which I can't argue with. So, now I'm waiting again. I've started the process for the Charity Care program at Kirklin Clinic, and I am in contact with a nurse at one of the breast doctor's down there, so between my np's referral, and the nurse at the Kirklin Clinic, I am hoping I can be seen soon ",

      "Content": " GREAT NEWS! The breast specialist/oncologist I saw today, Dr. Bland, is also a breast expert and has written several books on breast cancer. I'm telling you this to say that I believe he knows what he's talking about\n. With that being said, he told me that he fully believes that I do NOT have IBC!! He thinks that it's the amount of Premarin that I take that is causing my problems. (I had a full hysterectomy when I was 27.) I still go back on Oct 18 for the mammogram and ultrasound and after that they're going to figure out what to do about\n my medicine, but I am soooo relieved. It's taken me a while for it to fully sink in, because I was prepared for the worst. Thanks for all the supportive messages and info that I've gotten! YAY!!! ",
