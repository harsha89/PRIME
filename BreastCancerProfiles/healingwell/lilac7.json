      "Content": " \n so surprisingly this site has a breast cancer group but not lung cancer. Anyway, what kind of pains you get as initial symptoms? I have been tested for breast cancer but it was clear, now facing a threat of lung cancer. Which is terrifying like any other cancer, except that it has very little hope of survival compared to other cancers. I think I just don't want to find out it's happening or not. How do you deal with these 'mood' during treatment? Well I got a chest CT scan done, I was just about\n to finish a TB treatment but chest pain is still here. In the scan an opacity was visible. But the dr. said it could be some post-TB scar or inflammation or something. After that I've been having more pain. And I am so pissed off I just don't want to go and get checked. Of course, a biopsy is required, but I don't know if it can damage the lung or something. being sick sucks! ",
