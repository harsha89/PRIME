      "Content": " Hi Chip's mom,\nIf you want to give me your phone number, I'd be happy to call you. (I have unlimited long distance on my phone, so won't cost me anything to call you.)\nBev, yes I tried nuerontin at increasingly high doses but it didn't work for me. That's why my pain doc switched me to Lyrica. More expensive, for sure, but seems to help me.\nI definitely haven't found a magic bullet, though. I have a combination of things that helps keep my pain under control. In addition to the meds and Bellise compression bra, I really have to pace myself and try(!) to minimize my stress level. All of this has helped a lot -- I still have pain everyday but it's much, much improved and I am enjoying my life again.\nI agree that a pain clinic is essential. There, you can get the proper pain meds that a primary care doc might be reluctant to give you. If you can't find a pain clinic, a palliative care doc could help. Palliative care used to be associated with dying patients, but no longer. A palliative care doc will help you get your pain under control so that you can live life to the fullest.\nHugs and hope,\nJulie\n ",

      "Content": " Chip's mom, so sorry to hear you are having this difficult pain. I've had it for 4 years, following mastectomy, chemo and radiation. I, too, have tried everything under the sun. I seem to be pretty stable right now on meds (small dose of methadone 2x daily, plus small dose elavil, plus small dose of lyrica). I see a palliative care specialist who takes my pain seriously. I also wear the Bellise compression bra, which helps me a lot but sounds like it wouldn't help you. Have also gotten some help from a low-level laser that is approved to treat lymphedema. I don't have telltale signs of lymphedema, but even a small amount of swelling can put pressure on your injured nerves, leading to major pain. It's believed that most cases of PMPS derive from injury to the brachial plexus nerve... An unfortunate subset of us have this happen during mastectomy, from what I understand. Please feel free to contact me by email and we can talk in detail. I'd be glad to help you in any way possible. ",

      "Content": " Hi Chip's mom,\nI had a mastectomy on one side only, and I'm a pretty small person. I wear the smallest size Bellise compression bra, which is 32 A-B. I believe this would fit a flatsie person just fine. \nIf you could get your doc to prescribe it for you, I think it would be worth a try. You definitely want to check with your insurance to make sure it's covered. It has to be fit properly by a knowledgeable person. I think the Belisse web site might show providers in your area. Also, there is a customer service person at Belisse who might help you find a fitter in your area.\nI'm like you -- I can't go very long without the compression. I wear it all day long... I start to ache very badly if I don't put it back on soon after shower. I don't wear it for sleeping, though, and have no problem during the night.\nHang in there, I believe you will some strategies that work for you. Will talk to you soon.\nJulie ",
