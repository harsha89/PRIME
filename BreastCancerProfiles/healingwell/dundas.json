    "Content": " I got two cycles of taxotere (not for BC, but another cancer, it didn't work so my doc took me off it). I've been off about\n 7 weeks now and I have no hair re-growth -- just a bit of stubble when I touch my head and it's so short, I can just barely feel it and it's only in some places on my head. I have eyelashes and eye brows although some of the that is sparse. I never lost them completely. Other body hair is gone and doesn't appear to be emerging. I am getting worried that perhaps I am one of those effected by the permanent hair loss. Had another chemo before and my hair started re-growing quickly after treatment ended. \nShould I be worried or am I just being anxious too soon? Since this drug didn't work I feel like I got hit w/a double wammy. My main wish is that if I die of this cancer, I didn't want to die in a hospital \"bald.\" I wanted some dignanity. ",
