    "Content": " I'm a 35 yr old male and about\n a month or so ago I discovered a small white shot right in the middle of my right nipples. I went to my physician and she ordered a mammogram followed by an ultrasound. Both came normal. However, I have pain on the nipple on and off...there is no discharge or redness that I can see, but the white spot is still there and maintains the same size. \nAny thoughts on what this could be?\nShould I be running any other test?
