I grew up with split parents but even after they both married again, we all went camping and had fun together step parents and all, dad played guitar and taught my brothers and their friends so it was also LOUD, I remember mom making pans of lasagna and always seem to remain calm through it all I soo admired her!... I was blessed I guess that there wasnt much friction, or at least I never seen it ~except for my brother's fighting over who was better than who.. heh my younger life was filled with so many birthday parties, bbq's, graduations, anniversarys etc.. that it kept me pretty much occupied from gettin into trouble, well to some extent ;)~ \nLike you, I had tons of different cultures and personalities walkin in and out of my life, so I learned real young not to judge anyone for their beliefs... Being the youngest I got to see things from all angles too which helped me I think to look through other peoples eyes and understand where they were comin from.. \nOh and animals! ~>very important part of my life, we had horses,pigs,geese, chickens..... 3 legged dogs heh jk, not really but I'm sure there was at least one stray we picked up that I think was blind, he kept walking into things...\nMy adult life seems more dull compared to how I grew up, but it don't stop me from being a kid infront of my own kids... I'm sure they will have some crazy stories to later =} hmm like ma lockin herself outta the house in the middle of the night.. still shakin my head in disbelief!!\nHugs right back at ya MK!\n \n ",

I didn't know they go through that much when it's a scheduled one..\nIt's making so much sense right now, I can't tell you enough how grateful I am that you shared with me... unfortunately even though that doctor did his best at explaining things, it was done in under 30 mins before his next patient..\nWouldn't it be nice to have a doctor actually spend the time he needs or the patient needs to be completely thorough? Not the usual 15 min visit or in extreme cases 30 mins visits?? The nurse did write down her number on a card and told me to call if I had any questions, but that day I went in there was soooooo many people in worse situations than me that had been waiting a long time past their appts.. It makes me sad, to think first off there is so many people that need help, second that they have a such a small amount of time to give to those people :( \n \n ",

Asked the lady what would be the best highlighter and she pointed me in the right direction... funny thing is I've had fun with my hair doing all kinds of crazy things but this hit the top of the list today, we came back to my house and started the process after i bent over to rinse my hair, my mom BURSTS out laughing...!! I couldnt see because i was still rinsing my hair, she couldnt stop and I knew then it was funky.. so i stood up and looked in the mirror and 2 inches of my roots were pure white and the rest was a very neon orange.. I ABOUT FAINTED!! I went back and got something to fix it, but we musta laughed for about 2 hours ... off and on, if I seen a sign on the street ~ even remotely close to orange I'd point and we'd giggle again.. Oh what a day, kinda was nice to get my mind off of things.... tehehehee\n \n ",
