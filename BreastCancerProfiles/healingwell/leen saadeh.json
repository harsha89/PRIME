      "Content": " Hey, i am a 16 year old female . And in 2012 i felt a lump im my left breast . A biopsy was done and tested negative for cancer . After the biopsy an abcess occured chronically and puss was draining out of it for about\n 6 months and i had to take many courses of antibiotic thinoing that its an infection. My doctor decided to remove the abcess surgically and she did and after that everything was fine until a lump was formed in my right breast . Since we excluded cancer , there was no need for a biopsy , the lump was more of a cyst and filled withpuss and started inflating and there was redness and soreness. My doctor drained it twice and took the sample to the lab and got it tested and it was not infected . But today , i felt pain in my left breast and my doctor examined it and a lump was formed again under the nipple and when pressing puss comes out of the nipple (that is 2 months after the surgery ) my doctor doesnt know why this us happening and she doesnt want to remove the righr breast cyst surgically after the left one is reoccuring ... has anyone experienced this before ? And is there some treatment for this ? ",
