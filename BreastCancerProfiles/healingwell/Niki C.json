    "Content": " Hi I'm niki this is new to me. I am 28 I found a lump in my breast a few months ago so my Doc sent me to get a mammo but they weren't able to see anything so yesterday they did a ultra sound the tech found what her believes to be a cyst. I'm scared I have no idea what this means. I'm a single mom of 3 Lil girls. I don't know what to do or expect I have set up another appt with my Doc but it's a week away. I'm also confused because my Doc said she felt a number of lumps but all they could see is one. I know this is vague and I'm not asking a straight question but I'm still trying to process everything and don't know what to ask specifically if you know what I mean. ",
