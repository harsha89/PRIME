      "Content": " Hi, it's me again. I really don't know where to start with the questions. I guess I'd like to know what anyone else's experience with what to do before the surgery. Like; should I walk alot so that I build up my heart and circulation more? The PS said to \"not\" lose any weight. Should I continue to eat like I always have? I just want some personal \"lay person\" perspectives on if I should just kick back and not worry. Go on with my life as before until time for the \"boob building bash\". I don't want to get all relaxed and think that I am ready if there is some secret thing that \"those in the know\" feel should be done first. I already have my wedge (as Kathy suggested for sleeping on an incline), I even have a leg wedge for my knees. Got new silky pjs to lounge around in. I have lots of books lined up. Got the insurance all lined up (unfortunately most PS's do not belong to any of the \"networks\" with the insurances but that is one thing I don't think it would be wise to shop \"sales\" on -haha) The insurance companies do not realize how involved these surgeries are and don't \"allow\" much by way of compensation to the PS, so I sure don't blame them. It's just a little more than I had planned on.BUT, I do have the money ready so that I can get on with this. So....I think I'm ready. What do you all think? I keep hearing you all say how painful it is. I have to say that I looked at a website that had actual pictures of the surgery instead of drawings and I had to pause for a second. It really made it real, but I think it was good so that I am prepared for what exactly they will be doing to my body. I can only imagine the pain. I have no doubt that this is what I want to do and it will be great after it heals all up. I'm sorry that I am rambling but once I get started, it just seems to spill. After reading through this I see that I still haven't asked many questions. I just want to share your experiences. My friends are great but can't quite realize the extent of the physical feeling of this experience. Thanks for letting me go on and on. \n \n ",
