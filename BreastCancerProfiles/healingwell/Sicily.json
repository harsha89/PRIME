    "Content": " Just got a \"callback\" and of course am scared to death. Five years ago I had a lumpectomy, they told me I had atypical spindle cells, I had surgery and it was benign. After a whole year they told me the abnormal cells must have come from the scar from the biopsy needle. Everything has been fine up until now. I had menopause two years ago. Just the thought of all this makes me feel ill. I lost two dear friends to breast cancer so the whole subject terrifies me. ",
