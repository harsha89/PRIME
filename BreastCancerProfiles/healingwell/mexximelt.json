      "Content": " My best friend was just diagnosed with cancer.  I need to be there but she is such a private person and I can tell she does not take help well.  I want so much to help her through this.  I feel lost.  She is going to see her oncologist Friday but wanted to go alone.  I thought about\n making up a basket of goodies and leave at her doorstep for when she gets home. I truly don't know what to do.  Her entire family is out of the country so they are not here for her.  Should I just tell her I am here and back off ?  Should I continue to call her ?  Please....................what do I do.  She has told me she doesnt want anyone to know.  \n ",
