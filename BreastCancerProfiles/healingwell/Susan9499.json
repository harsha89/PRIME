      "Content": " Hi Lmarie.... I was diagnosed at Stage IV, five years after my initial diagnosis. My girls were 12, 11, and 3. I was devastated as well. I bought in to the doctor's suggestion to get my affairs in order. All I could do was cry. Then I realized that I didn't want my girls to remember me that way. I had always been a fighter and this was no different....so I chose to live whatever time I had left to the fullest. By the grace of God that was TEN years ago! You can do this...doctor's don't know everything and they have no clue what God has in store for you. Stop reading and keep on living!\nSusan ",

We didn't cut back this year for Christmas and wouldn't you know it, I took my Yorkie to the vet today and she needs to have surgery. Oh well...I guess I will worry about\n that after Christmas. My sister and brother in law, along with their daughters and granddaughter will be here on Christmas Day. My house is where we gather for holidays since my mom died. I miss her more at Christmas than any time of the year. We will go visit my mother in law tomorrow and then back for church tomorrow night. No snow here for Christmas this year...just rain. \nI have been doing very well. For those of you who don't know me. I was first diagnosed in 1994 and then had mets in my lung in 1999. Thankfully, it was operable and I have been cancer free since. I just had to have a lump removed, but it was scar tissue from the radiation. The doctor first did a needle biopsy and the report came back scar tissue and calcifications. But, the actual lump changed so much after the needle biopsy, the doctor decided to go ahead and remove it. \nI'm trying to finish up a graduate degree. Hopefully I'll graduate in May 2010. That's about\n all the updates I have. I have you all have a blessed Holiday Season.\nSusan ",
