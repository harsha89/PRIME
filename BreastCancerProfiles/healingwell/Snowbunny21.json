    "Content": " I'm usually on the Chronic pain board but happened to see your post. I don't have breast cancer but do have very \"dense\" breasts with a lot of calcification and cysts. Every time I've had a Mammogram they usually have to repeat the test while I'm there and even do an ultrasound that takes a good 30 minutes extra but no cancer being detected.\nI'm a bit confused on your comment saying that \"due to your Insurance\" you can't go to the Dr.? If you have insurance, getting a Mammogram should be covered.\nI don't have any insurance and signed up at a free clinic in my area and they sent me to get a Mammogram.\nWithout insurance, there are also programs through Susan G. Komen, or www.breastcancer.org that shows where to get free Mammograms.\n*I don't work or belong to any of these organizations...just suggestions...\nOtherwise, at this point, if your insurance doesn't kick in yet, it's less than a month from Jan. 15th and I would go ahead and make an appt. that day or the next to get a Mammogram. Or possibly talk to one of those organizations and let them know of your issue/insurance story and see what they have to say.\nHopefully everything will be ok!\nSB (Snowbunny) and the pup that snores (my yellow lab:))\n3, two-level, cervical fusions over the past 11 years. The last one was anterior and posterior with lots of fun titanium!\nStill have active herniations along with knee problems and another Morton's neuroma in left foot.\nI try to find joy in each day even with chronic pain:) ",
