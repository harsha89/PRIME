      "Content": " I know exactly how you feel! The waiting is the hardest part when you want to know what's going on with your health! I found three lumps in my right breast back in May----but, they ended up being watery fluid cysts--however, I can't stop thinking about\n them----those lumps caused me extreme anxiety/panic----which has resulted in me going to see a GI specialist---but not until the END OF OCTOBER! The waiting game is so tough. Part of me tries to tell myself, \"there is nothing you can do until you go and see the MD....\" But, then I get pains (long story)---that I start feeling the worst about\n. I usually end of doing a lot of Praying, and talking myself through the frustration I feel having to wait so long! \nI don't know if this helps--but know, others have the same \"wait and see anxiety\" like you do! God Bless! ",
