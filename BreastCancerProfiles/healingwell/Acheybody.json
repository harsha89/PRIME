      "Content": " Hi. I'm not at all new to HealingWell, but I'm usually over in the Fibromyalgia forum.\nI'm having issues with one of my breasts, too....first thing I noticed was a faint purplish tinge on the lower right side - almost like a small, circular \"shadow.\" My gynecologist mentioned IBC as a distant possibility, and said to call in 3 wks if it wasn't gone. \nWell, it isn't. After doing internet research, I decided to try to take a better look - (which isn't easy, because I have a frozen shoulder.) This breast has always been a little bigger than the other, but it sure seems swollen to me. And it's getting more tender. And I believe I even feel more warmth on that side. So, I'm starting to freak out a little.\nBut with all my shoulder area issues, it's hard to say what's tender or swollen because of what....\nThank you so much, Fullenlove, for posting about\n thermography. I'm sure that will help a lot of people - I know I'll definitely keep it in mind! \nMy doc was saying he thought I could probably do a mammogram with my shoulder, but he also admitted he's never actually seen a mammograph done. So he has no idea of the positions you have to get into...there's just no way! And if this kind of cancer doesn't show up on one anyway, what's the point? I may be looking for a new doc soon, this guy has been my gyno for 24 years, and he never seems to take hold or really give a hoot.\nHave a good day, everyone.\nDebbie\nModerator, Fibromyalgia Forum\nFibromyalgia, herniated disc L4-5, (recent discectomy), DDD, frozen shoulder(s?)
