I wondered but thought it was due to swelling from lymphdema as upper left arm has the same rash.  Apparently it's more than a rash.  OK . .surgery not an option, more radiation would be extensive so he says Doxil.  I say \"go fishing\" . .

Well side effect #1 hit about 2 am Saturday.  It has been so long since I took Taxol I had forgotten all about the bone pain, but boy I remember now.  The problem I encountered was I was 2 1/2 hrs from home at an Honor Band.  I had no drugs.  I tried Tylenol, Advil, and Aleve with absolutely no effect.  I have a really high tolerance for pain, yet this was all I could think about all day long.  I finally got home last night about 9:00 and raided the cupboards looking for something to take -- I'm really not a junkie!!!  I finally found some Hydrocodone and had to take 3 over a four hour period before I could sleep. \n \n \n ",
