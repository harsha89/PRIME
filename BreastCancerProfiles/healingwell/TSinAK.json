      "Content": " I stopped Femara after four months. Yes, sex was very painful and lubricants didn't make it any better. Dr suggested other ways ( mouth or hand ) to satisfy but I didn't even want to share a room with him. I went for a second opinion for taking AIs and was told that if I want to be part of that 97% that live 5 years I have to take them. I started Aromasin about\n 30 days ago and the vaginal dryness does not seem as bad as with Femara although I am still trying to control the pain in my hands that started just 2 weeks into Femara. \nThe most frustrating part of all this is the Drs say it's not the drug - must be something else. I found the website askpatient.com and 99% of postings are the same side effects that I had.\nMy new oncologist said if one AI does not work for you take another ( there are 3 brands ) and if those don't work for me then Tamoxafin and if that doesn't work well, hopefully there will be something else on the market by then. \nI take an additional 3 meds to control side effects.\nTalk to your oncologist about\n how you feel and don't be afraid to ask for other meds that will help you through this treatment. It won't last for ever.\ndx 5/2010\nIDC & ILC\n2 lumpectomy \n6.5 weeks radiation\nAI therapy ",

Last year a new radiologist saw something he didn't like - turned out to be two primary tumors IDC & ILC, the same place where I had a cyst drained 8 years before.\nGet a second opinion now!\nBest wishes for good health.
