She said (Duke Cancer Center doc) that she had just started using them because of some study or other re early detection of recurrence, blah, blah; but only used them on patients five years out.\nHowever, I'm going to ask at my next annual appt. in Aug. if they really are necessary, because I've read a LOT on tumor markers in the past year and it seems that the majority opinion is that, yes, they would detect recurrence early, but detecting recurrences early plays no part in prognosis - so my question is, why have them? I'll have that answer this August.\nAll this research on tumor markers occurred when mine went from their usual 34 to 49. Had to go back in, give more blood and retest. This time it came back at my usual numbers. Of course, I asked why the increase if not cancer related, and, guess what, labs make mistakes, the blood could have gotten contaminated, it could have coagulated quickly and --- anyway, lots of reasons.\nMy best to you, Glenda ",

I think it was because before I began treatments had to go over to Duke be positioned using all kinds of lasers (looked like a laser light show) and when I was positioned exactly where they wanted me -- by the way, I was laying on some big plastic thing -- they poured some quick hardening foam stuff around me in that exact position. Each time I went for rads I was placed in this mold on the table which apparently put me in the exact position they wanted me. It even included my arm in an upward out-streached position. Strange to see that 6 foot cast every time I went. There was always some small adjustment I'd make, but the whole treatment never took over five minutes, so suited me. When I had finished treatment, the sweet but silly techs asked if I'd like to take the d*mn thing home with me. Imagine my response! LOL Glenda ",

I had a little blood in my urine and was also urinating more frequently - hence all the tests! The cystoscope wasn't so bad, and it was reassuring to know there was no bladder cancer. So - o, after all these things, the answer was that I was suffering from an irritated bladder. They could see that it was somewhat inflammed by the cystoscope. The reason for the irritated bladder was our friend chemotherapy - surprise. I think I mentioned !!! that to them from the get-go.\nI was very uninformed at the beginning of my chemo treatment and didn't drink a lot of water to flush everything (wasn't told to either). So, hope this helps some on the board who are just beginning their therapy to drink, drink, drink. It might have happened even with the flushing procedure, so they told me, but I'll bet dollars to donuts that the flushing out will help a lot.\nI'll be keeping you in my thoughts, as always.\nLove, Glenda ",

Hoping things get better for you soon.\nNOW, what an interesting discussion about aches and pains, chemo and Femara. I had the chemo and am taking the Femara now and have been having major problems with my knees. I was blaming it on being 56 and maybe it is, but I remember well when my parents were 56 and they didn't have this knee thing. My Mom had arthritis in her hands later in life but not at 56. Maybe it is the Femara. I'll surely run that by my onc. Of course, I blame a lot of things on chemo and rightly so. It changed my immune system. All of a sudden I get warts??? All of a sudden I sometimes break out in hives??? All of a sudden I am alergic to things I was never allergic to before??? And when I was taking Tamox for 5 years, I had leg cramps with some frequency, and since I've been off that for almost 2 years, I NEVER have them now. There must be a correlation.\nEveryone speak up. Are others of you younger, my age or older having similar problems?\nAnyway, hope I hear from some of you. And I'm glad I could get on the Board.

      "Content": " Nothing pathetic about your post, dear Bev. I have to believe that grief lessens over time, but I know in my case, it's always lurking around. I think that we begin to really heal when we wake up in the morning, and the first thoughts are NOT about the fact that someone we love has died. That has been my experience, anyway.\nAnd big congrats on the 10 years!! I celebrate my yearly diagnosis anniversary with more fanfare than my birthday.\nLove, Glenda ",

She was sitting on the sofa at the Inn when Peg Gray and I walked in. Peg had met her and knew who she was. She was excited about meeting everyone, and I was excited about meeting her.\nAlong with the others from this board who met her, I'll always remember her. Rest in peace, Mary.\nHugs, Glenda ",

      "Content": " ...and thanks to you all for your good wishes. I stop in weekly for updates, but those of you who know me know how many \"hats\" I'm wearing these days in the work department. I haven't figured out if I do all this for the money or to just stay so busy so as not to think about bc!! My bd was a good day. I actually didn't even think about work, was taken to dinner, received nice \n surprises, and dd and sil are taking me out to dinner tonight. I LOVE getting older now - just LOVE it!!\nHad my yearly onc exam the end of August. All the blood work, exam and vital signs were very, very good. Went skipping home, and a week later, get the call from the onc saying, \"Your tumor markers are elevated\"!!! He thinks there's some lab mistake. Back in the next day for repeat of test. Ask my friends the nurses if the lab has been wrong before - long pause - and then, \"No.\" I spiral down, down. Ask for their prayers, and doggone if we don't have a \"prayer session\" right then and there. One of the nurses asked in her prayer that I be able to enjoy the upcoming Labor Day weekend without dwelling on this news. God was listening and I was able to put it from my mind. Came back home Saturday afternoon, listened to my phone messages, and there was one from one of the onc nurses. They had put a rush on the lab work, she was there on Sat. administering chemo to someone, saw the results were in and here is what her message said. \"Old buddy, this is Teresa. God was listening. Your tumor markers are back to what they've always been. I repeat, markers are NORMAL. (Laughs) We love you. Bye.\" What can I say?? Although I am one year older, I feel 20 years younger. \n \nLove to you all and in honor of Connie - Seven years and 1 month - Glenda ",
