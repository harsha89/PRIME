      "Content": " Hi MK\nThanks for the reply, I did look into financial help but they say we make too much for any. They dont take into consideration the fact that hubby pays almost 2k a month for child support for his 3 kids. (he was a late starter) so his income looks like a whole lot more than he really brings home. I applied for disability thru my work to try and get some of the money that we lost during my sick time and they said I needed to be off 2 more days in order to get it. Last year I ended up using 2 weeks of my vacation time for sick leave........luckily I get 3 because of how long I have been there. So I guess we will just be poor a little while longer. It gets frustrating some times because we have both worked so long and hard, but can't get help when needed.\nWell enough of feeling sorry for myself I need to celebrate the fact that Im still here and having one more birthday (today) and that for now Im cancer free except for the skin cancer. \nThanks again for all of your support.\nL&H Bernadette\n \n \n ",

I did not think I would ever feel normal again. My Husband stayed home the first couple of days and then my sister came up to take care of me. This is hard because Im such an independant person I hate having to have someone wait on me. But on the other hand I believe one of you told me to let them help because they feel so helpless. I hope Im able to go back to work tomarrow Im missing the interaction.\nKatt The Dexamethasone is a steroid be prepared to stay awake...but its all good. At least you wont hurt from it. Im sorry if I scared you with my post I didn't mean to but maybe you will go into this more prepared than I did and wont have the pain I did.\nAnd thanks to everyone I will continue.....because I want to see grand kids some day, that is what keeps me going OH and you guys too.\nHugs :) \nBernadette ",

      "Content": " Hi Kathy and Tammy\nI had an appointment with the Dr today and she decided that my problems were caused from an allergic reaction to the taxotere I took on my first chemo last Thursday. All of my side effects were consistant with those. She said I could have had a small amount of pain from the actual Neulasta shot bt not have been as sick as I was. Today was my first day to actually go outside after a whole week, I actually got dressed!!!! I lived in my jammies this last week.\nMy Dr says she is going to take the Taxotere out of my chemo regimine. I guess this has happened before but to a small amount of people that react so severly. Lucky me huh! \nTammy I dont know what she will use if I dont have the Neulasta next time, I forgot to ask. Kathy I hope this makes you feel better. I dont want you to worry but I know you will anyway because I was told the same thing and I have still worried about\n all of it. Why is it going to be so long before you start your chemo? I pushed so hard to get it started because I figure the sooner I start the sooner I will be done :) Also I am very impatient.\nHugs to both of you\nBernadette ",

      "Content": " Skeeter\nYou had just AC and still had all of those symptoms, now Im worried that it really was the shot and I will have to go through that again. Were you down completly for days?? I was so sick I could not even sit up for more than a few minutes. Did your Dr say your reactions were due to the AC only? I was doing TAC which is AC plus Taxotere. I guess I wont know for sure until next time. I hope I can trust what my Dr says she too is one of the leading Drs in the Seattle area and works in a very large cancer center. I was given her name from my brother in law who is a retired onc Dr in this area, he was the top of the Dr list but only does consulting for hospitals now or I would have went to him. My sister in law is a Physicians assistant and works in oncology too. I have had some great help from them but try not to ask them too much because of the conflict of interest. I would hae went to my sister in law but she is at a hospitol that is too far for me to drive everyday for treatments when I get to the rads part. I just pray I dont have to go through that again. My Dr hugged me at my appointment and said dont ever let it go on so long please call if you are not feeling well.\nWell it looks like Im the one rambling this time, I really appreciate your friendship even if we have never met!\nBernadette\n \n ",

      "Content": " Stanski\nYes welcome to the club that noone wants to be a member of, we all have felt that way when first diagnosed. You will fin d the most amazing women on this site and all of us are going thru or have been thru breast cancer. There is a wealth of information and there is always someone that can answer any questions that you have. I can not tell you how much this site has helped me over the last 1 1/2 years the women are wonderful. Im so glad that you also have your aunt to lean on she will also have alot of the answers to the questions that you have. Make sure that you take someone with you to your appointments and/or take a tape recorder so that you remember everything. Get copies fo all of your reports too it helps when you look back and try to remember what all of the results were. Get as much info on the web that you can but be careful, some of the sites are very negative. I found this site after looking into a couple others and they had me scared to death. just remember this is NOT a death sentence and you will be fine. There are alot of emotions that you will feel and feel free to express them to us (pitty parties are okay) \nGive your little one a hug for me and remember we are all here for you!\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

After the 2nd day of severe pain my husband made me take some vicodin and even it didn't help totally. It wasnt just pain it was just being totally out of it. I couldn't walk, stand, sit or lay down comfortably. My back still aches but it is getting better and my head is clearing. On top of all of this I got a nasty cough and runny nose My hubby told the nurse he thought that I had pneumonia so they gave me Zpax its a strong antibiotic. All in all Im still here but will have to talk serious about\n taking that shot again. They better send me home with a truckload of drugs this time.\nBernadette ",

I have an appointment with her in the morning that hubby will have to drive me to because Im still too sick. She said she will probably put me on IV fluids for awhile too. I dont know why I hadnt called her earlier, I just thought this was one more thing I had to go through. If you look at the ingredients in the Neulasta shot it has a strain of E-Coli in it!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I see why people call it the Mike Tyson one two punch!\nKathy I really dont want you to go into your treatments scared to death. My first chemo was a piece of cake no pain lots of support from the nursing staff. I really think the shot wold not have been so bad if I had not reacted to it. Please talk to your Dr about\n side effects and what they will give you, I like a dummy thought I just had to take it. Get everything and anything you can, just in case. \nDeb & Lori thanks for your help too. I wish this disease were more cut and dry so that a person could know exactly what the side effects would be. \nLori did your WBC stay high the whole time? It must have if you didnt have any shots. Lucky for you. Deb I too have kept a good attitude until being so sick for 6 days now. I have actually sat and cried a couple times because I dont understand why I have to be so sick. But I still love life and know that God will get me through all of this and I will be stronger for it.\nThanks all!\nBernadette ",

There are several other ladies on this forum that have had it too. Make sure that whatever procedure you have is performed by a plastic surgeon that has done alot of these procedures. I had done alot of research before mine and had heard from MANY ladies who had it done and were not satisfied, only to find out that their surgeon was not as qualified as he/she should have been. The TRAM is like the Diep and neither are for the weak....it has a long recovery process. I went back to work at 5 weeks and that is really too soon. Take as much time as you possibly can.\nI wish you lots of luck, and would answer any questions that you have. Babyseester AKA Kathy had a tram just months before me and is also happy with her results. Im sure she will chime in here too.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Tink\nEach person responds to chemo in very different ways. I too had the shot to help with the blood count too and the first time I had it I was sick for a week. I then found out that it was the combo of the 3 chemo drugs they used and then the shot on top of it that made me sick. I had the shot many times after that with much better results. \nAs far as helping her, talk to her as much as you can help out around her house when she is able to have people in again. The hardest part for me with chemo was the lack of energy and body aches. How many rounds of chemo does she have planned? and how far apart? That will make a difference too.\nMy best advice is to be her friend, do as much as she will let you but most of all be there for her to talk to. I have to say that it was harder on those around me to have to watch what I was going thru and not know what to do, or how to help.\nGood luck and keep us posted, Bernadette\n \n \n ",

I guess the CT does not show the stones but the ultra sound will. I have been in so much pain and been so sick to my stomach that I hope this is what it is. I feel sick if I dont eat and even more sick if I do. The Dr said that Im to go on a special diet No dairy, meat or fried foods. Well I have been dieting for ove a month now (Ive lost 25 lbs) and I have been eating alot of yougurt and apples. I love any dairy product so that will be tough. I dont eat red meat and only eat chicken so that wont be hard to give meat up.\nHave many of you had your gall bladders out? Im not even sure that this is the problem but if it is I just want it out. Thanks everyoe for your concern and answers to my questions.\nI will keep all of you posted\nMerry Christmas!!\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

If you all remember George Burns he lived to be into his 90's and had a drink and smoked almost every day of his life so go figure! My dad who was a heavy drinker for most of his life just had his 89th birthday and is healthy as a horse and my mother died at age 65 from cancer and was a light drink so I really don't give much thought to what the new studies have to say. Im the youngest of 8 kids and the first to have cancer so what did I do wrong????? Okay enough rambling.\nI just wanted to say I have missed all of you but have been having a rough time with my marriage right now and have not had the time nor the energy to post.\nI just wanted to say I just lost my cat (Mattie) who I have had for 16 years and have had a tough time dealing with her loss. I seem to miss her alot more than I thought I would. I did not realize how much comfort she had given me over the years.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I lived in Eastern Washington for the 1st 40 years of my life and spent as much time as I possibly could. I moved to the Seattle area 7 1/2 years ago and have not seen much sun since. I lived outside while growing up and know that is probably why the skin cancer. Also Im a red head with green eyes, 2 strikes against me. When I was a kid we never had sun screen we just went out and got burnt and then wore a t-shirt for the next couple days.....needless to say I have had my share of damaged skin from it.\nAre you just a little scareed about\n the newest addition to your cancer battle?? I have tried to put it into perspective as a very small chance of great danger. It just gets harder and harder to hear \"its cancer for the 3rd time in just over 2 years. Oh well at least its not in the breast again.\nHow are you getting along otherwise? Are you gaining back the weight that you lost? You had us all very worried for awhile there. We miss your posts about\n your adventures. So glad that you got a new PC and that you feel up to posting again.\nTake care and lots of hugs coming your way!\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I have an appointment next week with my PS to have them cut out and biopsied. She told me not to worry because this is not a fast growing or likely to kill you type.......made me feel better though.

I was surprised about\n the statistics too but MK just look at all of the women here that have had mets and are doing great. I was amazed when she said that she is 57 years old I did not realize that she was up there.

I was hoping to work some in between the 2 surgeries so that Im not off for too long. He says that I should be off 6 weeks for the tram. I have to try and remember to not lift anything that will be the hardest part of the recovery. I also don't know how I will walk the dogs either. I have to have them on leashes when they go out and I know I won't be able to hold them back. My hubby will take a week off for the tram and a couple days for the mast so that will help. Im looking forward to getting this done and out of the way. Has anyone heard from Happy Hanna????? I know she had her tram but I have not seen her post. Hopefully she is doing okay.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I woke up to a very sore breast, it feels like it may be infected or something. It feels swollen and very tender, I will call the Dr later to see if it is anything to worry about\n.\nI still don't know what I will do with my dogs, we live in a condo and the rules are to have them on a leash. I don't worry about\n them running off but I don't want to get fined either. I guess I will have to wear a big sign that says \"just had surgery can't use a leash\" for awhile. \nHow soon do you think I will be able to go back to work after the mast? I want to try and get a few days in. I just can't see me staying home for the 2 weeks in between the 2 surgeries. I have heard that the mast is not too painful??? It sure seems like it would be, that is a very large insision.\nWell off to work.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I have been able to get up and move around and hardly any pain. I have 2 great looking perky boobs and a very small tummy now, Im really really pleased with how everything turned out. My breasts are smaller than Im used to but they look great. And did I say PERKY! Im glad to be back home although the hospital was great, I had good nurses and great food. They give you a menu and you order whatever you want whenever you want, and it all tastes good. I have been up and walking everyday and getting stronger all the time.\nI apreciate all of the pink feathers and well wishes, it really helps the recovery.\nLots of hugs to all of you!\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

You will hear from alot of the other ladies here that will tell you the same thing. You have to be an advocate in your health battle because believe me sometimes you have to fight to get the testing done. Is there any other hospital you can go to? another surgeon that you could see? I had my biopsy done by a radiologist who also did my ultrasound. At 40 you are NOT too young for breast cancer.....that makes me mad hearing that another DR would say that, we have alot of women here that are much younger. I don't want to scare you but I do want you to get to the bottom of the problem.\nKeep us posted, we care\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

If you have read my other post you will see I have had yet another problem! \nTo all of you that suggested chocolate, no thanks I dont care for it but a margarita, chips and salsa will do. Since my stomach has been bloated most food does not sound good. My hubby calls before he comes home to find out what I will eat that day and he goes and gets it. Today I was craving tuna sandwich with pickle and BBQ chips so that is what I had! I have had some wierd cravings beef jerkey, margaritas, potato soup, cheesecorn, chips and salsa do you see a trend here???? Salty foods. For 3 days before this all I ate was peaches and toast so I gues Im branching out some. For those of you who have had this surgery did you loose your appitite? I have a tough time eating very much at all.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I had a bunch of test ran and my white blood count was more than twice what it was supposed to be. I also had some problems with my liver enzymes. Last night, well this morning at about\n 2am my temo finally broke and I feel good again. I was totally knocked out and could hardly sit up. I had an appointment with the PS this afternoon and more tests and he said it looks like I had some infection with one of the drain sights. So to make a long story short Im up and going again and ready to tackle the world. I have lost 15 lbs so far.....I don't know how except the only thing that tastes good is fruit.\nKim\nMy breast are almost completly the same size and I dont have much if any swelling. I don't have drains in either breast anymore thank goodness. I still don't know about\n getting a nipple, I may or may not. I feel blessed for the work that my Dr has done he is amazing. I just hope they don't get any smaller!!!\nHugs to all\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Kim\nIt sounds like what you have is scar tissue that your PS will remove when she does the fine tuning. The seroma is quite large, mine covered one whole side of my abdomin and most of the other side. It was more swollen on the left side and that is where they took the fluid out.\nI don't actually know where they get the tissue for the nipple, I guess I never thought about\n it. I should tell him to take it off my butt and take alot extra while he is there LOL.\nMy weight during chemo went up just slightly but then I was diagnosed with a different disease and had to go on steroids, that is where I gained all of my weight from. I have put on 30 lbs.......15 down now and I would like to loose another 30. I finished my chemo over a year ago and my radiation too. You were one of the lucky ones who lost during your treatment huh?\nIm feeling good again but I just wish my tummy would go down all of the way, when I first had the surgery it was so nice and flat and now it is puffy around the rib cage.\nMK\nMy PS said that there is a chance that the seroma will come back but he said he can drain it again, I gues that is not something you can continue to do forever so hopefully I wont have to have surgery to remove the sack. was your tummy flat at first and then puffy after a few weeks? I dont understand why it has not gone down all of the way.\nDid either of you have insomnia after the surgery?? I have had a tought ime for 2 weeks now, I got sleeping pills from him on Wednesday but they don;t even knock me out. Im starting to get grouchy and I dont like it one bit.\nOh by the way Im going back to work on Monday.......that is if I can stand up and drive myself. Im only going to work a few hours a day until I feel good again, Im going crazy sitting home and I think I would heal faster if I were up more. I just got 8 new work shirts that I had ordered before I left and they fit great, it shows off the perky boobs and small tummy quite nicely.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I just worry about\n those drains because the one that I had for the mast was in just over a month. And speaking of the drain, I have a funny story for all of you that have had a mast and can relate to this. My Dr took the drain out last Wednesday and since then the cavity has slowly been filling up with fluid!!!!!!!! I have been slowly getting a booby again! LOL It is so funny to look at it I look like a pre teen getting ready for my first training bra on one side and then a DD on the other. What a contrast.\nYes Bev Im looking forward to my new \"headlights\" and a flat tummy. I feel like that part is a little gift for having to go thru all that I have. And I wont be running the vacuum when I get home, I got the house spiffy before tomarrow so that I wont worry about\n it when I come home. My daughter is coming on Saturday and my sister will be coming next week to help out, I cant wait for the company.\nI will write back as soon as I can, \nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

Kathy I hate to say this but I have a very high pain threshold and I tend to get myself in trouble after surgery. I dont feel the pain like I should so I over do it. When I had my c-section I was back playing softball 10 days later. When I had my hysterectomy I was doing laps around the surgery ward the same day. My Drs have a hard time with me because I dont stay down as long as I should. I do know that I wont be able to walk the dogs but Im not sure what I will do with them after hubby goes back to work. I might have to take them out without a leash for awhile. I will have to figure it out.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

If God forbid it actually gets more than one snowflake they just stop their cars and leave them in the middle of the road. Iam NOT kidding! When I first moved to this area 7 years ago my friend and I had been out and when we came out to leave there was snow on the ground, we were on I405 and all of the traffic stopped!

I then foud this site and have never looked back. You will get lots of good advice here and the ladies truly care. We all hope that you will not have to join our \"club\". I did not get my results back for 3 or 4 days but I knew ahead of time that mine would be malignant. The radiologist was also in on my ultra sound and I asked her point blank what she thought and she said that she would be surprised if it came back negative. So I think there is still a good chance that it will be B9. The odds are in your favor too, 80% of lumps are B9. Try to relax and enjoy your weekend.\nKeep us posted, we care.\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I dont have to wear a girdle or anything, I dont even have bandages on the insision sites. I still am amazed at how many stitches that I have, the tummy part goes from the middle of my hip to the middle of the other hip. I have 2 pretty well matched breasts (smaller) and a very flat tummy. Iam very happy with the results so far. I think Im doing better than I thought that I would, Im able to do just about\n everything I did before just slower.\nI had my surgery Tuesday and got out on Friday, a very short stay. I was up the next morning doing laps around the ward and I think that makes a world of a difference. I slept in the recliner the first night and half of the 2nd but have been sleeping in the bed the rest of the time. Today Im running a temp again which zaps you but I still feel great. I have total feeling in my reduced/lifted breast and minimal feeling in the other. It was never the same after the lumpectomy so I wont miss the sensation.\nLife is good and Im well on my way to recovery and being whole again.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I take tylenol and it still stays at 100, the lowest that it goes is 98.8 and then back up again. I have been on the antibiotics since Friday so I don't understand why they have not brought down the temp. I had my hubby help me with the drains and they are both infected still. I told him I will call the Dr first thing in the am if this is not better. Im sick of feeling sick! I still can get up and move around but I don't have much energy for it. Sorry for all of the complaining but I knew that you would understand what Im going thru. Did you tummy stretch out some after the surgery?

I had the morphine for just my first day there which included 10 hours of surgery so I really did not get to enjoy it as much as I would have liked. I did not get back to my room until 9 pm the day of surgery and I was out the rest of the time in between all of the nurses visits. My Dr does not like to leave you on the drip which was fine with me because I got up alot faster without all of the drugs.\nI really do like my new shape, except my boobs are a lot smaller and Im getting used to that, they were too large to start with so that is okay.\nThanks for the hugs!\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

It sticks out a little too, it is right below my underarm and does not bother me but he said he will look at it when we get to that point. I was told to massage this spot and one other that I had on the top part of my breast where the new skin was added. I have done so every day and the part on the top of my breast has gotten softer. \nI guess I never looked into where the new nipple would come from but I still have yet to talk to the PS about\n it either. Im still having problems with the seroma it has gotten larger again. I spoke with the PS yesterday and he said he would drain it again next Wednesday at my appointment. He said if it continues he might have to put a drain back in. He also said that most of the time they dry up on their own, I hope that is the case.\nI worked all week at 5 & 6 hours each day, by the end of it I was pretty worn out. Did either of you have a tightening in the ribcage area if you did too much. It feels like the skin has been stretched very tight and it is worse if I have done too much. The rest of the time I have very little pain in the rib area. \nIt has been 5 weeks and I finally feel like Im on track again, I just wish the seroma would go away.\nKathy I did not realize you had your reduction and lift 8 months later, I thought they were done at the same time. Im pleased with the match so far. The size is almost exact. \nHave a great weekend!\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

The pain level in this is so small that Im amazed, I expected alot more pain. I know the tram is a much different surgery though. I know my pain level will be alot different. When I had my hysterectomy I remember the worst part was not being able to sit up. This is alot like that because of the insions in the pubic area and I cant use my right arm because of the mastectomy. I started doing stomach exercises about\n a month before the mast but I could have used even stronger muscles. \nTammy there are 2 other women that have had the tram done in the last year that can also give you advice on the surgery (Babyseester & happyhannah). I decided that this is what I wanted and have never looked back. I have what I call my pouch from child bearing and being overweight, this will be gone after the tram. Im looking forward to being able to put pants on and not have to acomadate the \"pouch\" Im trying to loose some weight too.

I like to get an idea of how a surgery will go from someone who has had it (good and bad) I know that the next part will be WAY more painful but Im still looking forward to getting it done. I still have this pesky drain, my output is still above the amount that the will remove it. I went back to work for a few days and ended up getting an infection in the drain area. Iam now on an antibiotic and staying home again. I had a tough time trying to work with the drain anyway. I wore my bra and put the drain inside my empty cup LOL. It worked okay but the bra rubbed right on the spot where the drain comes out and it just made it very sore. I had a rough time even moving my arm it go so sore. I have to go without a bra until I go back to work on Monday. I have my next appointment on Wednesday and I just pray that the drain will be gone. My PS said I will have 4 drains for the next surgery but go home with only 3!!! I jus have a tough time slowing down so that I dont pull on them. I have pulled the tube off of it several times. I sure hope that my next drains will be out at 1 1/2 weeks that will be great, Im going on 3 weeks right now with this one.\nThanks for being there.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I worried at first when he said it would be best to do a reduction/lift, I did not want to come out of it with B cups. Im not a small person...5'9 and I need to loose some weight so I would hate to come out alot smaller. The Dr reassured me that in order to keep them matching he would have to make the left side slightly smaller.\nThanks for the encouragment.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I have had an itch that feels like it did when I still had a nipple but there is nothing there now. I had to laugh about\n something else that had happened, I had splashed water on my glasses and took them off and started to rub them on my breast (old habit) I told my hubby and we both got a kick out of it.\nKatt how are you doing? are you feeling good and back to all of your activities again? How about\n your hair, is it finally grown out again? Mine is about\n 5 or 6 inches and still curly on the bottom, not so curly on the new hair coming in.\nHave a great weekend!\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

Mine is to my shoulders and still curly. Did you get lots of curls? My eye brows are still very thin and my lashes go thru thinning stages still. The hair on my legs and underarms is very thin.....YEAH. I hate to shave. I guess ther is a silver lining in everything if you just look.\nI know how you feel about\n the aches and pains, I have terrible hip, back and leg pains.If I sit for too long my feet and legs feel like lead when I get up. Thank goodnes I don't get to sit for long at work, I would look funny standing half way up like a 90 year old. \nTake care and Happy New Year!\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

My breast that I had the lumpectomy on is now alot smaller than the other and is deformed looking. I like the idea of using your own tissue because I did not want to have implants. I will also have a lift on my other breast so that it will match better and be alot more perky!\nI have wanted to have a tummy tuck for years and this is my way of getting it free. I have had 2 very large children and my stomach was stretched out. I have also had a hysterectomy and so now I have a ledge for the fat to hang over. I will try to post as much as I can after the surgery.\nGood luck\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi everyone\nI have had the most trouble in the world trying to get this surgery scheduled. The original Plastic surgeon that I had chosen is now out of the running. I had an appointment with the surgeon on Wednesday to get her side of the ball rolling. I explained to her all of the trouble I have had trying to get the PS office scheduled, she said she would do whatever it takes to get me in ASAP. She even called me at work the next day to see if I had gotten anywhere with his office!!! To try and make this VERY long story shorter, her office called the PS office and they said I needed to see hime one more time before surgery. That was not the worst of it, his first \nopeneing is Feb 14th!! I asked if we could just schedule the surgery as close to that day as possible and they said NO, I dould not schedule the surgery until after the appointment. I had smoke coming out of my ears. And to make it even worse they said that they could not put me on a waiting list. That was the last straw. I asked the surgeon if she had someone else she would like to work with and she does. It looks like it won't be until March 7th but I don't care. I would not give my business to the other DRs office if he was the only Dr left! I feel for the Dr because I think it his staff that sucks. Iam composing a long letter to him to let him know how I feel about\n the way I have been treated. I started this process with their office in November, you would think it would not have to take so long to schedule a surgery. Anyway now that my blood pressure is creeping up again I need to get off this subject. I will have 2 female Drs to do the surgery and The new Dr does immediate reconstruction which is what I wanted all along. I have an appointment with her on Thursday and they have me on a waiting list for any sooner days for the surgery.\nSorry for all of the complaints but I just had to vent.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

The worst part for me is that I now have a scar on my neck. It looks like I have had my thyroid out. My neck was sore for a few days but that is all. I have had problems with my gallbladder for years but they won't take it out because I don't have stones it just gets inflamed some times.......go figure.

Mine came back very curly too but the color was drab and grey. I colored it with a temp color at first and now a permanent one. I love my curly hair, I always had stick stright hair. I get up in the morning and just put gel in it and go. It is long enough to curl but Im afraid the curling iron will straighten it so Im waiting as long as I can. I had trouble with my eyebrows and lashes too. I think they both fell out 3 times before being permanent. My lashes are now long and thick like they used to be.\nThere is life after chemo, and a good one at that. I still have all of these other health problems but cancer has taught me to be more relaxed and not to worry so much.\nSo glad to see you posting, and on a positive note. Have fun at the beach wish I could be there.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

You will be able to ask lots of questions ans at least one of will have been thru similar events and be able to answer you.\nI was diagnosed just one year ago and let me tell you there is life after breast cancer. I had six months of chemo and two months of radiation after my lumpectomy and lymph nodes being removed. I can tell you the chemo is not nearly as bad as you would think, and yes loosing your hair is the hardest part at first. I found a couple of hats and a wig. I swore I would not wear that wig to work but once I wore it for a day it wasn't so bad. I was another one that had stick straight hair and it came back curly and I love it. It actually started growing back before my chemo was done so I had a head start on it. I love my new hair and it is so easy to do in the morning. I put gel in it and go and that is it, I get compliments on my \"new style\" all of the time. Chemo did not make me throw up, but did make me a little nauseaus and tired. I would suggest that you get a port a cath before chemo it will make it alot easier for you and save your veins. I had one and just had it removed a week ago. If you don't know what that is just google it and that will explain it.\nWhen is your first treatment, and what have you had done so far? Please keep us posted, we care.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

Don't let anyone brush you off when you have questions. You have to be your own advocate in your health care and knowledge is power. Study as much as you can, read lots of books and you will have a better idea of what to expect during your journey.\nAs far as starting chemo I had my lumpectomy, 2 weeks later my port a cath and one week later my first chemo. It can go as fast as you want, and I wanted to get it over as fast as I could.\nGood luck to you and keep us posted.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

Iam so glad that I was able to be there, I would not have been able to deal with not saying goodbye. \nMay I make some suggestions?? There are alot of things I never asked my mom that I wish that I would have, so if there is anything you want answered thank God that you have the chance. I stood next to her side, held her hand and was able to kiss her goodbye when she breathed her last breath.\nJust remember leaving this world does not mean she is gone, she is in a better place resting and waiting for you.\nMany many hugs to you.\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I feel like a 90 year old woman I have joint pains all of the time. My right arm ached for 2 days like it had a tooth ache. I have been on it for a week now and it really shows. They did not list weight gain, I hope they don't because I need to loose weight not gain.\nDonna I'm sorry to hear you are having more troubles with your implant. You sure have had alot of trouble with that. I hope they get it fixed this time.\nLaure' thanks for the input on side effects of Arimidex. I can't believe I have only been on it a week and had so many pains. I did not know that your DH is a survivor, that is great!\nKatt good to see you posting again, I had not seen you in awhile. Yes they do think the spots are cancer, I had a bad feeling that they were all along. They were there when I was first diagnosed they all but dissapeared during chemo and now that I'm done with chemo they are back and bigger. I guess if I have to I will do chemo again but I won't be happy about\n it. I just got enough hair to feel good about\n myself again.\nOh well ladies no more complaining. I need to be positive.\nL&H to all\nBernadettte\n \n \n ",

I have 5 different techs and they are all very sweet. They made me feel comfortable right away.\nKattbird \nSo good to see you posting again, I have missed you. I hope you are getting all of your strength back and starting to feel normal again. Keep us posted on your life without treatments! We care.\nKathy\nSo glad to hear you are healing and getting back to normal. I like the fact that I have my rads at 4 that way I can leave early and get home sooner. I still get almost 7 hours in at work and I just work a little faster to get done on time. I love the fact that I have energy again, I can finally walk up a flight of stairs without feeling like I'am going to pass out. Yes Dh is doing so much better he gets around great with his scooter. \nChantry\nFirst and most important thanks for mentioning my Seahawks. I was in a state of shock after watching the horible job the refs did. They cost us the game. I have been rooting them on for 30 years and then this happens. grrrrrrrr. I'am a HUGE sports fan and follow all of our local teams. Anyway enough whinning. Did your insurance cover the genetic testing? I would like to have that done too. I wish that I knew more when I made my decision for the lumpectomy. I call my breasts the \"TIME BOMBS\" I feel like it is only a matter of time before I will have to deal with this again. I would like to have the mast and be done with it. I know that sounds negative but really I feel like it would be for the best.\nDonna\nThanks for your input too. It really helps to know what others have gone through. Did you get tired from the rads. The techs and my DR said I could expect to get tired by the 3rd week. I hope not I enjoy having more energy. How did you use the Aquaphor lotion without ruining your clothes. My Dr said to use it at night and wear an old t-shirt. It is very greasy. I feel a little tingly after todays treatment, not sure if it is just in my mind.\nL&H To all\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I had some advice from one of the techs she said for me to stop wearing my underwire bra, from past experience people were more prone to burning if they wore an underwire bra. She said she wasn't sure why the connection but would recomend just a cotton bra. Did any of you have problems where the underwire hits?\nI have to admit that rads are soooo easy compared to chemo. I don't mind going there or the time it takes. The women are all nice and polite. I have met a couple that the husband goes at the same time. He was diagnosed with cancer in his tonsils, and then it spread to the lymph nodes in his neck. He is in bad shape and is only in his early 30's. He has a chemo pack that he wears all of the time and has radiation on top of that. He started the same day as I did but now his throat is so sore that he can't eat, so they put a feeding tube. His name is Steve and hers is Polly please say an extra prayer for him.\nL&H\nBernadette ",

Now I have to go back to full time work, I have been leaving an hour early to go to rads. I worked all of the way through and had a small amount of tiredness. The hardest part for me is getting up in the morning, I feel like I could use a couple more hours of sleep.\nHubby is doing so much better he is able to put about\n 1/3 of his weight on it. He gets around on just one crutch most of the time. He would love to be able to dance but not quite yet. \nThanks for all of the posts.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

The love and support from all of the women here has made this journey so much easier. \nNow with all of that said Iam back to Dr appointments several times a week. Since my diagnosis of Sarcoidosis I have been on the whirlwind of appointments. My Dr wants to put me on prednisone for 6 months, I really do not want to because of all of the side effects. The biggest side effect is weight gain, I still have weight to loose and can't afford anymore. Anyway enough complaining.\nI really do appreciate all of the support here :)\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Everyone\nI just had to put my 2 cents in, If you google sentinal node biopsy you will see that the sentinal node does indeed have alot to do with your staging and what type of treatment you will have. I was told that the sentinal node is like a guard to the other nodes and it is the first node that the cancer would attack. That is why they do the dye and hopefully get the sentinal node, instead of having to take 15 20 or even 49 these are numbers I have read from the ladies on this site. That is way too many nodes and causes lymphodema. Anyway correct me if I'm wrong but this is what I have been told. My cancer was stage IIB and grade 3. I had one out of 3 nodes positive and I have had to have alot of treatment.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I wonder why the lashes and brows come in and then fall out again.\nKattbird you have 2 inches of hair? I have about\n an inch. I have went out a few times without my wig but not to work yet. Iam going to color my hair first and then I think I'll stop wearing my wig. I have been comfortable without my wig but working without is different. I feel like people will see my hair and feel sorry for me, and I don't want that.

My last chemo was the end of January. How long was your hair when you ditched the wig? I lost all of my leg and underarm hair and it is just barely starting to grow back. I could handle another 6 months of not having to shave. My lashes, what little I have are coming in thinner too. I still have no brows.

      "Content": " Hi Ladies\nThanks so much for all of the encouragement. I really don't feel afraid of the rads like I did chemo. I know it is alot easier than chemo. I just have one small problem with memories of my mom having her rads. She had lung cancer in 1988 and went through rads. They burned her so bad that her chest and neck looked like a blackberry. She was unable to eat or drink because her throat was so bad. She lost a large amount of weight, and she did not have any to loose. I know rads have come a long way but everytime they put me on that table I just think about\n my mom and what she went through. She fought a good battle but eventually lost it. Okay enough on that.\nChantry where are you in your treatments, have you finished chemo? I hope so. I still have my wig on but my hair is growing and getting much fuller. My DH tells me to go without it but I don't feel comfortable yet. I worry about\n my skin too it is dry and I have fair skin, I hope I don't get too burned.\nSkeeter congrats on your one year anniversary coming up. Good luck on your mamogram. Think positive thoughts, it will be just fine. I feel like I know you too there are so many ladies here that I have formed a bond with. I would love to have a get together. That way we can put faces with names.\nEllen, Judy & Deb thanks for all of your help during this time. I will probably be asking you all kinds of questions in the next few weeks. They sent home some samples of Aquaphor cream for me to use. I guess it works good. What creams worked good for you? \nH&L\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I want to know how you only put 20% of your weight on it? This is the time of year when we are usually out walking every day and he still can't. I need to take some weight off so I will have to walk alone.\nMy chest looks very burnt but with the help of the new lotion it does not hurt anymore. I just keep saying 2 more weeks I can do it.

The techs asked if I minded if he stayed while they got me ready and I said no. He stayed until they were ready to do the actual rads. I think it made him understand a little more about\n what I'm going through. They are doing rads from my neck to the bottom of my ribs. My rad DR wanted to get any lymph nodes in my neck and chest area too. I feel like they are still not telling me everything.....but I don't seem to get them to \nopen up. \nWhen they actually did the rads it was a piece of cake, other than the part about\n being all alone in there with that HUGE machine. I was a little scared when everyone left the room but it is over so quick, it was okay. One down 32 to go..... I can do it, and I will.\nL&H \nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I can't see the monitor so I just look into the machine when it is on that side. I think that rads will be just fine, very quick and no nausea. I do my rads at 4:00 everyday so I just leave work a little early. I have been working my full shifs for awhile now. It is so much easier when you have energy. I do feel so much better these days I hope that rads don't make me tired. \nHow are you feeling? I hope everything is healing well. I bet those drains were a pain in the butt.

I have read about\n lots of women having children after breast cancer so don't count it out. It is okay to cry.....it always makes me feel better when Im done. I wish I could send you one gigantic hug! Sometimes this darn disease just gets the best of us. I hope they get your mast scheduled soon so that you can skip rads. It is really very easy and the time goes by so fast, 3 weeks already.\nKathy\nYou and I do have alot of things in common, hubbys, age and now red hair. Wow we should compare some more things. So you did not burn? That is very lucky because I feel very hot and stingy. They are going to give me a gel pack for my underarm. It seems to be getting the worst part of it.\nTake care\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

My PC had me scheduled for one last summer but I started chemo and never got it done. I had a check up with her last week and she said that she wanted me to re schedule one ASAP. I have to tell you I have problems with my bowels to start with. I have never been been regular and it has gotten progessivly worse.\nAs far as the house goes, I'm sorry that you did not get it but maybe it was just not meant to be. There has got to be a home that will satisfy you and your DH. As far as DH goes have you ever sat down and wrote a long letter to him? Sometimes it helps to say what you need to without our emotions and temper getting the best of us.\nI wish you luck with both of your issues, take care.\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

My chest is burnt from my collar bone to my nipple and from the middle of my chest to my armpit. I also have a huge rash. I got some presciption lotion that has done wonders it hardly bothers me now. I have great nurses and techs I like getting to see them every day. Yes I will be getting the boost on my las week they said that I will probably be pretty uncomfortable then. I still have lots of energy it has not affected me yet.\nI'm glad you are enjoying your new tummy! I really could use a tummy tuck I have had a c-section and a hysterectomy so my muscles are shot. It would help if I lost some weight too, I could stand to take about\n 30 lbs off. Why is your new breast smaller that your other one? Did they do that on purpose so that they could do a reduction? \nSo glad to hear that your work is great, I enjoy my job too it sure makes it easier to go to work when you like the people you work with and the type of work you do. \nKattbird\nYep Im almost done it has went by so fast it has been easy compared to chemo. How are you doing? Have you got your energy back yet? I have lots more energy but still have aches in my bones. How is the hair coming along? I ditched the wig and it feels great. keep us posted.\n \n \n ",

Mine is so sore now that it hurts all of the time, not from being burnt but it feels like it has been hit very hard. The outside is lumpy too. I just had a breast exam on Friday so I know it is okay. Congrats on 6 years!!!!\nKathy\nHubby finally can put some weight on his foot (4 months later) he can put 20 lbs for 3 days 40 for 3 days and so on until he gets to his weight. He would like to go back to work but L&I has not released him yet. Boy this has been a long drawn out thing. He has had a tough time with being down, so when he was told he could start to put weight on it that helped.\nA get together would be great.......who do we put in charge of it???? LOL.

I wrote about\n my ovaries because I have had a hysterectomy and I had the Dr leave my overies because of the amount of cancer in my family and I did not want to go on hormones. My Dr agreed that starting hormones at 40 would be asking to get cancer. I was estrogen positive and ovaries produce estrogen so that is not a good combo.\nI did not realize that you had a recurrance within 17 months, I have to admit that is one of my biggest fears. As for my lungs I don't know if you remember when I went to the pulmonary Dr to rule out the spots and he concluded that they were most probably cancer. My onc said that we would do further tests after my chemo. I don't know if you remeber but I had written about\n this a couple months ago, my pulmonary Dr called me at home on a saturday night with the news, I was pretty upset at first but have come to deal with it now.\nDonna, Chantra & Judy\nI have to admit the Taxol is much easier than AC and my hair starting growing in as fast as my lashes and brows fell out. The worst part is the body aches. I would do Taxol over AC anyday. Chantry there is no nausea at all during Taxol I have not had to take anti nausea drugs in a long time. I know you will find it much easier. I have to agree with Judy on the food issue during Taxol, I eat Tacos almost everyday and they work great for me. \nHappy holidays to all of you\n \n ",

I noticed that my head is stinging again which means it will start growing again. My lashes are coming in pretty fast too. How long did you wait to color it? I have alot more grey coming in now and I will want to get rid of that. It sounds like your hair came back in quickly, how long was it when you got rid of the wig?\nOn another note my hubby has a very sore shoulder since his surgery, he thinks that something is broken in there. I tried to take him to the clinic yesterday but he wont even try to get out of bed. He has been in the same bed since coming home, I tried to get him up again yesterday to get in the tub but he wouldnt. I think he is depressed about\n all of this but Im not sure what to do for him. any suggestions?\n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Everyone\nJust got back from the vets office, they took off his bandages and cleaned and wrapped them up again. I got a chance to see the bad foot and it is ugly. His poor toe nail is just barely there with the help of stitches. It does not seem to bother him today at all. Yesterday he slept most of the day. He looks so funny with his feet bandaged up, and he tries his best to kick them off.\nI still don't know how he kept from getting killed but I think it was Gods will to keep him around longer. I love him so much and it would have been very hard to loose him.\nMK I thought the same thing about\n the bill, no surgery or broken bones and still that much. This is the only place we have ever taken our boys to but maybe we should look around.\nThanks for the extra prayers\n \n ",

I did not mention that he is a miniature Schnauzer. Our vet was so surprized that he was not hurt more or even killed. My husband said last night that if he had been killed he would still be crying for him. That is how close we are to these dogs (2 Schnauzers) By the way what type of dog is Tavish? I understand what you mean about\n not being a vet because of having to see hurt animals. When we were there a couple brought in their dog to be put asleep and the whole office staff was crying with them. Very sad to watch.\nBailey has another appointment this afternoon to check on his stitches but other that that I think he will be fine.\n \n ",

Each Dr approaches it in a way that Im sure has worked for them. We all have had simular but different treatments. (does that make any sence) \nI agree with Lori, the most painful part of all of my treatments was having the dye injected for the SNB. I wish there was a way to do it without so much pain.\nThere are areas on the net for more information on all of this, including staging and treatment.\nJudy pleas don't worry, I know that is easy to say. You had a mast right? That is your safest way of avoiding a recurrance. We all worry too much about\n it coming back, I wish there was a way to just put it behind us. With everyone I have talked to they all feel like it is only a matter of time before it comes back. \nL&H to all\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I don't know when everyone else started getting uncomfortable with rads but my chest stings and itches constantly. I got a prescript\nion for lotion with a type of benedryl (sp) in it. I hope it helps with the itching. The lotion that they gave me to stop the stinging does not help at all. Okay enough whinning about\n my treatments.\nJudy, I don't have to wait for my rads either I usually get in within 5 minutes. I always try to visit with whoever is waiting. Today there was an older asian man and his daughter, I guess they will be my new friends LOL. Some people come in there so down and defeated that it just breaks my heart and I try to be upbeat and positive for them. \nDo any of you ever wonder if life will be normal after treatments, I think I will miss going to the Dr in a sick kind of way. I hope that depression does not set in after this is all behind me, I have read that others have had that problem. Judy & Donna you can probably answer that since you are done. \nTake care\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

I feel like I'm back on the appointment whirlwind again. 2 last week and 4 this week. \nOn another note Hubby is doing much better, he got his rolleraid. I call it his scooter you put your knee on it and steer yourself around. He is so happy to have the crutches gone. He can get around so much better and is able to help some around the house now.\nAs for my dog, he is doing great, got his little casts off and has alot of scabby spots but is getting around almost like normal. He is still not wanting to play as much as he used to but he will. Im glad the casts are off it was a pain having to put baggies over his feet everytime he went outside. We have rain 24/7 here and we had to keep them dry. \nTake care all\n \n ",

      "Content": " Kathy, Deb, Donna & Chantry\nI love geting to hear everyones experiences with chemo, rads and hair loss. \nChantry, congrats for finishing your chemo. Wait just a little longer and your hair will probably get curly. Mine came in straight and thin and as it filled in it got curly, I finally ditched the wig and have went 2 days without. I have gotten lots of compliments on how cute it is. Good luck with your rads appointment, I hope you get a good group of ladies like I did. It does really go fast, I'm already at 2 weeks!!!\nDonna, I love your analogy about\n hair and cancer. My hair is catching up to yours I will send you a picture. I wish my lashes and brows would do the same. I feel the same about\n my wig, I will keep it for awhile just in case.\nDeb, You are right about\n wearing your hair short, I have gotten compliments, my techs even say alot of women keep it that way afterwards because it is so easy. I don't have to worry about\n shaving my underarm because my incision is off to the side, my sureon said she does it that way on purpose.\nKathy, thanks for the encouragement I got rid of the wig and it feels good. \nNow a question for all of you...I asked about\n removing my port a cath and my Dr said lets wait awhile. Did all of you have yours removed as soon as you were done with chemo?? I sometimes wonder, well I wonder alot that I'm not being told everything. Any comments.\nL&H\nBernadette\n \n \n ",

It isnt as bad as I thought it would be and it looks pretty good :) The only thing I dont like is the heat, it definitely keeps your head warm. I wore a baseball cap to work before all of the hair came out and that was okay. The only thing I dont like about\n that now that the hair is gone is that you look bald in the back. I have had two chemo treatments now last Tuesday was my 2nd one. Im still sick from the bronchitis that I got from the 1st treatment. I wish that I could get that over with. Katt I suggest you get a hat because you are doing the same treatment as I did and mine was going at 2 weeks. In fact the nurse that helped me with my first chemo treatment said I would be bald by my second one. It is not as bad as I thought it would be just VERY sad when it started to come out. \nVicky I found it much easier to wear without the cap too. It actually makes me feel whole again when I wear my wig, I know that sounds funny but I dont want to look sick.\n \n ",

They have a specialist that will do the surgery but he has to wait 3-4 days for the swelling to go down first. His foot today is even more swollen so Im not sure how it is supposed to go down. He is in alot of pain and the codeine is not even helping. He gets shooting pains that go up to his knee. They told us it would be very painful and it is. It looks like he will be home for quite awhile because his job requires standing most of the day. So if everyone could say a little prayer I would really appreciate it. I feel better getting to wait on him now since he has been waiting on me since my diagnosis.\n \n ",

She talked to us for awhile and then looked at the x rays and then stopped, she said that she could not do this surgery either. This is the second Dr to look at the x rays and say they could not help. She gave us a name of a Dr at a different hospital in Seattle. This is the same one that the ER Dr gave us so guess he must be the best. I did not realize how bad this break is, but it can lead to permanent problems she said this is the worst break that you can have in your foot. There is a chance that he will never walk the same even with the surgery because the break is so bad. It has a minimum 3 months in a cast and then rehab......Im not looking forward to this at all. It is hard doing everything around the house. It makes me appreciate all that my hubby used to do.\n \n ",

My eyebrows are starting to be almost normal, I just wish my lashes would do the same. You guys mentioned electrified porcupine and cat fur that descibes my hair exactly while it was coming back in. Katt Im so glad your hair is starting to come back in. It goes very fast once you get the original in.\nI wish there was another get together planned, I would love to meet all of the people I have made frieds with on this site. I would be all for doing some kind of a group get together.\nJudy when you did rads did your breast get very sore and tender? I feel like one side is lumpy and sore all of the time.

I still have to deal with my lung and spleen issue. \nI agree about\n the hair issue I still hate the fact that I don't have hair and loosing my lashes and brows made it worse. I just want to feel normal again and not have pain, but that will come soon enough.\nDo you have rads after your chemo? I will start a couple weeks after chemo. Sorry about\n you not having sick time left that sucks having to use your vacation time.\nTake care and keep us posted on your graduation day.\n \n ",

They went into triple overdrive getting the radiologist in there and she talked to me and said I needed a biopsy NOW. I already had thought that I had cancer but during all of that I knew that I did. When she did the biopsy I asked her if she thought it was cancer and she said she liked to wait for the path report. I said what is your gut telling you and she said she felt it would be positive. I liked the fact that she was \nopen and honest up front with me. Somehow I was not scared because I had already accepted that I had cancer.\nWell that is my story, I definatly think they know what is on there.\n \n ",

      "Content": " Donna\nMy chemo schedule started out with TAC and I could not tolerate the Taxotere so they took it out. That made my treatments every other week too. Im sure you have read my other posts and have seen that I have been sick again. I have never been like this in ALL of my life and now Iam sick all of the time. Before BC I was never sick never missed work, it was very rare for me to even get a cold so being like this has not been easy.\nI still cant decide if I will do the Neulasta again, I had it after my first chemo and I was sick for a week then I had Neupogen on my 2nd chemo and had NO problems. Went back to it on my 3rd chemo and have been sick again. \nI was supposed to do a BC walk on Sunday but was too sick to do it. My best friend came over to do it with me she is a survivor too. She had BC 3 years ago with lumpectomy and rads. Just this last year she had thyroid cancer they took it out but did no more treatments for it.\nI hope your rads will go good for you.\n \n ",

I was just diagnosed in July and have spent alot of time on this forum. You will never find this kind of support anywhere else, these women have been a godsend to me. \nI also did alot of studying I did not want to have anything come up that I had not heard of or did not understand. Read everything you can get your hands on, but be careful of some other forums they can be very negative. With this one you can get all the information good or bad but done in a positive way. Having a positive attitude does help.\nI had a 4 cm tumor but had a lupectomy I also had one out of 3 lymph nodes positive. My Dr did not recomend a mast because she thought the tumor was smaller. I think if I had it to do again I would have done the mast. (we have alot of cancer in my family) I did 5 months of chemo and am getting ready to start radiation.I would never tell you that chemo is easy but it is doable.\nPlease know that we will all be there for you. We will be standing as close as we can to you on Thursday :)\n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Chantry, Judy, Deb, Kathy & Donna\nThanks to all of you for the posts. First of all Chantry I have never shaved my hair completly I have always at least a thin layer of peach fuzz. Are you on Taxol now too? I would say just let it grow, my wig does not bother me with the amount of hair I have. I don't know if shaving it will make it grow faster but if it is anything like your leg hair it will.\nDonna \nSo glad to hear from you again. I was starting to worry about\n you. Im so sorry that you lost ALL of your hair during Taxol. I understand about\n the \"funk\" that you are in I had chemo today and we discussed my options after chemo. I still have my ovaries and that has been a concern to me. I was pre menopausal before all of this but will be tested after my last chemo to see where I'm at. She said that we will either take them out or put me on drugs to keep the estrogen from producing. I also have the concerns with the lungs and spleen to deal with and 6 weeks of rads too. Im scared that I will have to do more chemo I have 3 more to go I should have been done next week but have had to miss a few weeks here and there.\nBack to the hair issue my hair is darker on top than it is on the sides they have much more grey. I don't care what color I'm just happy to be getting it back in. It has that stinging feeling it had before I lost it, I guess that is an indication of new hair. From what all of you have said it only takes about\n 2 months for it to grow enough to ditch the wig YEAH. I can stand it during work but as soon as Im in my car off it comes.\nKathy\nFINALLY got hubby out of bed last night and back into the real world. I nagged long enough for it to sink in that he needs to move to help it heal. My Dr said that there is that chance of blood clots too without movement.\nI have finally got the Christmas itch!!!! I went shopping and crossed alot of people off my list. I'am making my chex party mix right now and will start on my special \ncookies later. I make sugar \ncookies and decorate them for friends family and my guys at work. I also make chocolate peanut butter \ncookies that are great. The sugar \ncookies have been a holiday tradition since my daughter was little, now that she is grown I have the step kids help. They enjoy the decorating. \nLove & hugs to all of you!\n \n ",

I worked today and everytime I got up to help someone my hips and knees hurt very bad. This is our busy time of the year so it is even harder. I feel the same way about\n it coming back too, everytime I get a new pain I think it is more cancer. I also feel like Iam being punished for something. I feel so unatractive with no hair, eyelashes and eyebrows and then all of my scars and a boob that is way smaller than the other. I have tried to be positive too but sometimes it just gets to you and you just want to throw your hands up and say forget it. \nPlease dont stop posting because this is a great therapy for you. we care.

      "Content": " Hi Katt & Donna\nIm still coughing like crazy and to top it all off my boss called and said he wants me to just stay home at least another month!!! I have already missed so much work and I usually never get sick. They are going to try and hire a part timer to help out while Im gone. My boss is just worried because he thinks I will get more sick as the chemo treatments go on. I swear I would have sailed through this if it were not for the cough. Iam so depressed right now because I dont feel like I have any control of my life. I want to go back to work but I cant while Im coughing all of the time, and Im sick to death of staying home. And to make it even worse I go to long term disability and it only pays 60% of my wages. I hate this disease and what it has done. Sorry to be so negative its not usually like me to be this way.\nKatt I walk around the house bald all of the time as soon as I come in whatever is on my head comes off, you might change your mind on that one. I have 3 step kids and when they were with us last weekend I showed then my head and they were like cool...it didnt even bother them. The middle one came up and rubbed my bald head and then gave me a hug :) \nOn a different note my daughter sent me a book called BOOBS it is a great collection of breast cancer survivor stories. I have read almost half and I just got it today.\nDonna you said that you have had a reacurrance in less than a year, Im so sorry for you that must be very hard. Were they both in the breast? I guess I dont have alot of history on you yet :)\n \n ",

Alot of the women here have had it come back so that worries me. Why did you have a mastectomy? Did you already have chemo and radiation? I sure hope you have not had to do this twice. I know how you feel about\n being lonely, I have actually isolated myself some because I just get tired of talking about\n my sickness.\nIam usually a very positive person but the last few days I have been very down I think it is because I dont have enough to do. I want to go back to work I know that would help.\nThe author of the book is Ann Kempner Fisher I have just about\n read it all and it is good. My daughter is having a hard time with all of this. She lives 3 hours away and cant come to see me us much as she would like. \nSorry for all of the questions but I like to get to know people.\n \n ",

We have a cat and 2 miniature schnauzers (they are my babies) \nAre you taking only taxol? I started out doing taxotere, adriamycin and cytoxen but the taxotere made me very sick so Im doing just AC I think I will be doing taxol after the other 2 are done. Then I will have radiation. \nI had a very tough time loosing my hair, it started coming out at 2 weeks. I had bought a wig but didnt want to wear it. I finally put it on and I really like it. I feel whole again when I wear it. It is alittle darker and shorter than my natural hair but I like it.\nThanks for your reply\n \n ",

I have had lots of styes too I figured it was because of my lashes falling out.\n \n ",

Now Baxter is a totally different animal he is a black and silver in color but his personality is another issue. He is always into something constantly looking for something to tear up. When we first got him I was not sure if he would ever be friendly he did not like to be picked up much or held. He still growls when you pick him up for some reason but will let you hold him for hours after that. He has gotten more lovable he will come up to me and put his nose on mine and wait till I scratch his ears. They are the love of our lives and I cant imagine not having them now.

I have to tell you what happened today I was leaving to pick up my step daughter and had the dogs with me when a bull dog attacked Baxter I was down in the gravel and dirt trying to get him off of Baxter. I had to put a choke hold on him to finally get him off. I skinned my knees and got dirt all over me but Baxter came out with just one little bite. I was so mad at that dog. We live in a condo and we have had problems with him before, I was just waiting for him to bite me so that I would have an excuse to smack him. The people that own him are in their 80's and cant handle him I wish they would get rid of him he is a menace. Sorry to go on and on but it scared me to death.\nI would love to hear your dogs sing it sounds cute.\n \n ",

I was taking neupogen but I dont like having to go back everyday for 3 days I live 40 minutes from there. I will still get it after my next chemo because it does work better. My Dr sent me to have a chest xray because of this cough I have had for over a month. I think I have pneumonia just want I needed! Other than that I feel okay I think Im going back to work tomarrow so that will help my attitude. I like to keep busy.\nWhen all of you lost your hair did you still have some stubble??

I also had a shot of Neulasta and it has made my whole body ache. I had changed and had Neupogen and did not have body aches but they wanted me to take Neulasta so I went back to it. Never again I had a bad reaction the first time and again now no more Neulasta. I could not believe how tired I was yesterday I could not stay awake for more than an hour, I feel like I slept the whole day away.\nHave you had your first rads yet? I hope you dont burn like they saud you would alot of the women here have gone thru it with no burning at all I will pray that you will be one of them. It is bad enough everything else we go thru and then have to deal with more pain. \nI still have a little cough but Im on my 4th antibiotic and it is finally getting it. The hardest thing right now is that my work wont let me come back yet. My boss says that he dosn't want me to get more sick. I understand how he feels because of the type of work I do but Im going nuts staying home. We are going into the cold time of year and I will have to be in and out alot and that worries him. Also the guys I work with have got colds so he is afraid of me catching it. I love my job and miss it alot so hopefully he will let me go back soon.\nTake care\n \n ",

      "Content": " Katt\nThere is hope for your hair because mine is coming back in during Taxol too. I had that itchy burning feeling and then I noticed blond curly hair coming in. Now I have brown mixed in with it. My natural hair color is auburn so this is quite a shock. I still have 4 more Taxol to go so I hope it does not fall out. The only bad thing is that you will loose your eyelashes and eyebrows during taxol. I have just accepted it and it is just one less step in getting ready in the morning. as for hair on the rest of my body it is all gone too. The upper pelvic area held on the longest. I have no trouble looking at myself without hair, for some reason I have just accepted it. I really look like a cancer patient now without eyelashes though. I usually have thick long lashes so that is a little harder to cover.\nKatt when are you starting Taxol?? You didnt mention that you were scheduled for it.\n \n ",

I try to hide my \"cancer\" while at work but not on my days off. I go shopping with just a baseball cap on and everyone stares but I just act like I dont see them, but it still bothers me. I still think loosing my lashes and brows really makes me look like a cancer patient. Please take Deb's advice and hold your head high and don't let it get to you.\nI went to Walmart yesterday and there were so many people there that I was getting overheated and I felt claustrophobic, I wanted to take my wig off so bad just to cool down. Could you imagine the look on everyone's face if I had. I have to agree with you Deb sometimes we should use it to our advantage. Maybe people would have been nicer while getting through the isles there. WHAT A ZOO.\nDeb \nI thought you were done with your chemo treatments? I still have 3 Taxol left what are you taking?\n \n ",

I have had mouth sores too and everytime I would smile it would crack \nopen on the sides of my mouth. They are gone now thank goodness. \nI have to tell you my first chemo and shot of Neulasta knocked me for a loop too. I was completly down for a week. I had severe back pains and complete body aches, nausea and headaches. I could not function at all. I didnt call my onc because I thought it was normal after chemo to be so sick. Come to find out I had a reaction to the Taxotere. So dont be afraid to call and tell them the problems you are having.\nThe Mrs Grass soup comes in a two pack blue box. It has just noodles no chicken or veggies, it really is the best I hope you can find it.\nI went in on Tuesday for my first chemo of Taxol and my blood counts were too low for chemo so I had another shot of Neulasta and told to come back next week. I have had back spasms all day yesterday and today from the shot but it does the trick. So I have nothing to report on the Taxol yet. I also have problems with my skin, right now I have a rash on both arms, my back and face. My Dr says it is from the chemo and to put hydrocortosyn creme on it so far it is not helping.\nI have another dillema I am dealing with. I had a temp and a sore throat last week so I missed 2 days of work and my boss put me back on long term disability. I have had it with the merri go round of working and then being told I could not work so I contacted the EEOC (equal employment opportunity council) and the ADA (american disability act) and they both say I have every right to work. I called my zone manager to tell him what my boss had done and at first he sided with me until he talked to my boss and then called me back to say that he felt it would be better for me to stay home and get well too. I then informed him that I had spoke with an attorney at the EEOC and he said he would look into it some more and call me back. I dont know if you remember all of this happening around a month ago but here we go again. All I want to do is work. This disease is depressing enough without sitting around all day worrying about\n it not to mention the fact that on long term disability I am making $1,100 less a month and to be honest I cant afford to make that much less. Im sorry to go on and on about\n this but it is driving me crazy. My boss thinks he is helping me by keeping me away from all of the germs but I could catch something going to the Drs office. He has said that he wants me to be able to work full time or nothing and that he wants to hire a part timer to help while Im gone. The EEOC siad that would not be smart because Im able to work and if he hires someone else that I will have a very good case. The bad thing is I dont want to sue I just want to work. Anyway any and all comments appreciated!\n \n ",

The youngest had to stay home last time because of a temp. My hubby picked them up last night and when they got here I found out the oldest had stayed home from school because he didnt feel well. Hubby knew it and still brought him. I had a few words with him, in fact quite a few words. I took one look at my step son and he looked sick. I could always tell when my kids were sick because of their eyes and he had that look. I told hubby what were you thinking??????????? Do you want me to be sick for another month????? I have not been in public for a long time and have tried to stay away from anyone that might have a cold I just dont want to risk it. What does Herceptin do?\nThanks for the post.\n \n ",

I was mis diagnosed 2 years ago and it cost me alot of pain and suffering not to mention the stress.

I remember Judy saying that hers started falling out as soon as she started Taxol and I thought maybe mine would make it but they didnt.\nMy nose hairs are gone too and my nose drips constantly. I have allergies too so that does not help matters any.\nMy treatments are a breeze now I go once a week and really other than the first week I had some body aches and the problem with my back but that is gone now too. I dont have any nausea or aches anymore. I had my 3rd treatment on Monday and so far nothing I feel great.....finally. Im so tired of feeling sick and achhy so this is a nice change. So Chantry there is a light at the end of the tunnell. I hope the rest of the treatments will be as easy. I cant believe I will be done Dec 19th!!!!!! It really has gone by fast. I cant believe that you have already done 3 AC that went by fast too. Are you scheduled for 8 Taxol? I hope the rest is a breeze for you too.\n \n ",

Did any of you try that?\nChantry you are only scheduled for 4 Taxol treatments, and 3 weeks apart. Iam scheduled for 8 and they are every week. I guess every Dr is different. \nHey on a different note I was told I would go through menopause too but I have not had any signs of it yet. I had a hysterectomy 4 years ago but I still have my ovaries. I was reading that women who are ER/PR positive should not have their ovaries. I dont remember if my Dr knows about\n the ovaries or not. Hopefully someone will have an answer to this.\n \n ",

I like most women hate to shave. \nI had a small area at the end of my scar in my underarm that just didn't heal and I was looking closer at it yesterday and there is what looks like fish line coming out of it. I tried to pull it out but feels like it is attatched to the other side of the scar. I had two purple threads come out of my port scar too. I dont know if these were left of were supposed to dissolve wierd huh?\nI have adjusted nicely to having no hair, I even went to friends house yesterday and took my wig off for most of the time.

I have my first one on Tuesday. Everyone says it is easier I hope so.\nLori \nbefore my surgery my right breast was already smaller too so this really did a number on it. I like the idea of a padded bra because it wont loose its shape. My bras now look so funny they have a big crease on the right side......and fine on the left.\nDonna\nYes Im done with my AC treatments I actually had one treatment of TAC Taxotere, adriamycn and cytoxen but the taxotere made me terribly sick so my other three treatments were just AC. Iam scheduled for 8 Taxol treatments Im not sure why 8 most people have 4.

I had a stomach ache and a terrible headache. I think not feeling good has put me in a not so possitive mood it has been a long time since I have felt really good. I keep telling my hubby that I just want to feel good again!!! Im also worried that my chemo treatments will be extended I have only 1 more AC left and then I was supposed to go onto taxol. \nThanks again for the support.\nPS Kitty and Donna I have seen your posts and appreciate the welcome too.\n \n ",

My Dr put me on Z pac and then Levequin I also took steroids during that time. The Levequin helped the most I had 2 cycles of it. I have been so tired this last week after my first dose of Taxol and my body has had aches too. I hope Im not tired every week because we are in our busy season at work and I have been working lots of hours. By the time I get home Im dead tired, I have gone to bed at 9 every night.\nI am so jealous that you have grandkids!!!!

I want to know 100% that this is mets. I feel the same way about\n knowledge I have studied everything I can get my hands on. My Onc Dr was surprised when she met me and I had alot of knowledge she said it was much eisier to work with people who had a better understanding of what to expect.\nThanks Lori I appreciate that fact that you are always there and always positive for all of us.\n \n ",

I have been sick for a month now and I finally got an antibiotic that is starting to work. This will be my 3rd day on them and my cough is slowing up. I didnt know that most recurrances were within the first 2 years. I have decided that I need an attitude adjustment I have been feeling sorry for myself. Im going to start walking everyday and that should help too. I have not been taking care of my body like I should have. No more pity parties for me!\n \n ",

I would think they will be able to do the surgery this week. He has alot less pain now so that has helped, but I still have to do everything for him. It is hard having to do all of my chores and his :) The Dr in the hospitol said there was nothing that they could do for him because it was crushed so bad. They recomended a surgeon from another hospital thatspecializes in this type of break. I just want the surgery to be done so that we can get on with it.

They had me climb up on the table and then they put all of the sterile dressings around my breast and then they got a call that a large accident happened and they would be needed in ER so they ran my bed back to my room and then left me. It was about\n 3 hours before I saw anyone again, then I finally had my port a cath put in. It was actually funny watching the nurses running down the hall pushing my bed...I slept until they were ready for me again.\nOn another note my daughter and I have been at each others throats for years until just this last year we have finally gotten to be friends. She has finally grown up enough to realize that mom is not all bad. We had some very bad fights when she was younger and now we can finally sit in the same room for more than an hour without fighting. I just hope your daughter grows up enough to realize that your advise is good. My daughter calls me all of the time for advice now (I never thought that would happen) it feels good to friends with her.\nI will be praying for her and you...\n \n ",

      "Content": " Carol\nI had my port-a-cath put in before my first chemo and I had almost no pain. They sent me home and said to take tylenol if I had pain. Hubby and I went to dinner after coming home, went back home watched some tv and went to bed. I did have alot of bruising all the way from my shoulder blade to my breast, I looked a mess because I was still bruised on the other side from the lumpectomy. Since then I have had some pain while trying to sleep. I sleep on the same side as my port and somtimes it puts too much pressure on it. I could not imagine not having it, it makes chemo so much easier. You can put medicine on it to numb it before chemo but I never have and it dosn't hurt.\nI just finished my treatments with AC and will start Taxol in a week. I have had some aches but very little nausea. I have a harder time with the shots (Neulasta or Neupogen) that they give you the next day to build your white blood cells up. As far as your first chemo the not knowing is harder than the actual treatment. I always eat a sadwich before and then take a bottle of water with me. I take a nausea pill before treatment and another 4 hours later and I have never thrown up. \nGood luck with your first treatment and keep us posted.\n \n ",

I get achy after that one, in fact I had neulasta again and Im very achy now. For the dry mouth you might want to get some hard candy to suck on it helps and it will keep you from eating too much. The sore throat can be from the dry mouth. I get a sore throat when I get moth sores. I hope your Dr appointment goes well tomarrow.\n \n ",

Iam amazed at so many young women that are in their 30's. If I would have been diagnosed in my 30's I would have really freeked out. I tend to be on the impaitient side when it comes to waiting for all of this to get going. I was only diagnosed a week ago but I want to get my surgery over so that I can get on with treatment. How many of you have been diagnosed with infiltrating ductal carcinoma? I have read alot of the bios and almost all with my diagnoses have had chemo too. I know I have to have radiation but wont know about\n chemo until after the surgery. I really dont want to have chemo because of the chance of loosing my hair. (dont I sound vain) \nBy the way I am married have 2 grown children 26 & 20. I live in the Seattle area. I have the most amazing husband who is so supportive in all of this. He lost both of his parents to cancer so he understands alot of what I have been going through. Sorry to ramble on so much but it feels good to talk to people who understand. I started a journal so that I could keep track daily of my progress. It feels great to write down things that bother me. I had a ekg and the tech was very cold and uncaring he \nopened up my gown and just left my breast exposed during the procedure, I finally just grabbed my gown and covered myself. It made me feel like a cow being herded off to auction. That was the first time I cried since being diagnosed It really upset me. I would love to hear more about\n all of you and thanks again!\nBernadette ",

I love all the green, everything here is green Tuesday in downtown Seattle looking through all the shops and going to the aquarium. My best friend met me there and surprised me with a cruise around the Seattle waterfront, it was great except I got sunburned. Then we went to Ivars (famous here for seafood) to have fish and chips. It was a good way to keep my mind off of surgery the next day. I can understand why your sister drives so far just to put her feet in the sand there is something about\n being at the beach.\nIs taxotere a steroid? I tried to look it up but it didnt say. That is one of the drugs I will be taking for my 18 week chemo treatments. It sounds like you had treatments a little different from mine. Good luck with the rest of them and keep me posted.\nHugs:)\nBernadette ",

I had my pet scan yesterday and the tech scared me when she mentioned the Dr had made a note to her to get a good look at the right lung. Now Im worried that it has spread there too. I told her that the pet scan was supposed to rule out some larger lymph nodes but she didnt have any info on that. This is the part I hate the most WAITING I can handle what they tell me but I wint know anymore until after surgery on Monday. Michelle you did not mention if your hair is back or not. MK you mention that you daughter has had breast cancer too, and that you both are cancer free now that is great. My daughter is only 20 but she is aware of her chances of getting it and does her self exams even before I was diagnosed. My family history contains only cancer deaths nothing else so my chances were great that I would get it too. I lost my own mother when I was 28 she had lung cancer. I like the idea of cutting your hair before it all falls out I think that would be easier. \nI know I have talked alot about\n loosing my hair but I remember my mom saying that was the worst part of the treatment. She couldnt stand to wear a wig so she wore bandanas instead. I work full time with 20 men they have been so supportive and worried about\n me. I took the last 2 days off to prepare for the surgery. How much time did each of you take off after your lumpectomy? My Dr suggested 3 weeks if I could take it. I do have to have some lyph nodes but I wont know until then.\nOkay I have rambled enough for now. I hope all of you know how much I appreciate the support.\nThanks again\nBernadette ",

Then ask if she has had to take some of your slack while you have been sick, and she probably will say NO tell her very sweetly that you are sorry if it has inconvieneced (sp) her but you are working as hard as you can, Believe me she will feel like a heel for even making that comment! Sometimes the best approach is head on. I used to be in management for almost 20 years and when they would come to me and say so and so said .....blah blah blah.......

I will try to work through all of this as much as possible, I feel lost without something to do everyday. Is your job still \nopen when you feel good enough to go back? I hope so I really like my job. And I think it will help to keep busy. Juju and Cathi how old are you? Im 45. \nWell Ill write back tomarrow after my surgery to update you.\nBernadette ",

I will be doing that. \nI think you are the 2nd person to tell me they could not stand coffee during chemo, I love my coffee too. The idea of Mcdonalds hamburger is not bad I like those. Did you loose any weight during chemo? I thought Taxol was given after chemo was done. I still have a million questions, Im sure when it is done I will feel like I know all there is to know about\n breast cancer.\nYou have been off completly during chemo? Im going to try to work as much as I can, but worry about\n being around all of the customers and their germs. I dont want to be even more sick. As far as indigestion goes I already take Zantak but will take anything to keep from having a sick tummy.\nTake care\nBernadette ",

Talk to your DR about\n all of this and see if he will give you something to PEP you up for the first few weeks if you have to do 12 hr shifts.

Im glad you decided to do the port I love mine it will save alot of pain and I will have my veins when all of this is done. I have heard that having it through your regular veins kills them and we are too young not to have our veins. It wont hurt your vein for just the one time so dont worry about\n it K. \nNot that it is my business but is your boyfriend giving you good support? sometimes lack of support or knowledge can cause distress too. It looks like you have been doing more studying on all of this I think that helps too. As soon as I found out I got on the net and looked up everything so that I would be prepared. \nDont be afraid of getting the port it has been the easiest thing I have had done so far. I came home after having it done cleened up my house some and then went to dinner with my hubby, I did wake up in the am with a small amount of pain but took one pill and that was it for the entire thing. Mine is completly healed and the scar is almost invisible so dont worry about\n that either. Do you live in a large area where you have good Drs and hospitals? Im lucky to live in the Seattle area because we have some of the best right here.\nSorry for rambling but i finally feel good enough to do this so I have lots to say.\nHugs:)\nBernadette\n \n ",

Unfortunatly I did not have a mammogram in 2004 or Im sure this would have been caught earlier.\nDid I tell all of you that I start my chemo in 2 weeks? I will be taking taxotene, adrizemycm & cytoxan I was informed that adrizemycm is the one that makes you loose your hair so hello wigs here I come! How many treatments until you start loosing your hair?? I still have not found a wig store but Im going to get at least one before I loose my hair. How many days did you feel sick after treatments? I have lots of questions don't I? Did all of you have a porta cath put in? That is what I will have done. Did all of you loose weight? She also told me this will push me into menopause Oh joy one more thing to deal with.\nAs you can tell by my post this has not been a good day actually Im just kindof down.\nAny info on where to buy a wig would be great, I sooooo appreciate the encouragement an total friendship from all of the breast budies here, Im not sure how I would be feeling if I could not sit down and write to all of you.\nA friend is like a good bra.....its all about\n the support!\nHugs:)\nBernadette ",

The Dr reports said the area that I came in for was nothing to worry about\n, but stated that the other spot needed further testing. To make it more understandable my tests in 2003 were for a completly different lump that I felt, but when I asked for copies the typed reports show the other spot (which was the same spot as tumor I just had out) as being the only area of concern. I was never told abount the area of concern, which is why Im in this dilema in the first place. I hope that clears p the quuestions.\nBernadette\n \n ",

My hubby and I just got home from going out to dinner. Iam getting tired though so will be heading to bed. Did any of you have the (super glue) instead of stitches? This is great they say it stays on for 7-10 days and as it comes off you just peel it off. \nSkeeter thanks for your post too, I always like hearing different peoples adventures through our cancer journey. You sound alot like me, I too feel guilty about\n not being able to work like I used to. At this point I have not been back but will try to go on Friday. Thank goodness for short term disability or we would be broke already. My work covers you for as long as you need to be out with 100% pay. \nDid any of you bruise from your surgeries??? I look like someone used me for a punching bag, I still am not healed from the lumpectomy and now this. I should take pictures so that I remember how awful it looks. You know life is still good I worried about\n the port and it was very easy, so maybe the chemo will be too :)\nHugs\nBernadette ",

You will be able to go to work the next day see if they can schedule it on your day off. You didn't mention if you are single or married Im sure there is some financial help out there for you. Contact your local American Cancer Society to see if they could help or give you a list of someone who could.\nYou will be doing the very same chemo as Im on and I had my first round yesterday with very little nausia did not throw up at all! Hopefully you will breeze through it too. I hate to say this but attitude has alot to do with this, somehow you need to keep positive and believe that it wont be that bad and remeber that it is all temporary.

His foot today is even more swollen so Im not sure how it is supposed to go down.He is in alot of pain and the codeine is not even helping....Kim\nMy surgery has been moved to January because I went to a new PS, the first one I went to I did not like. I will have the mast and then 2 weeks later I will have the tram....I did not realize how bad this break is, but it can lead to permanent problems she said this is the worst break that you can have in your foot. There is a chance that he will never walk the same even with the surgery because the break is so bad....Hi Everyone\nWe decided to go to a specialist closer to home so we had an appointment today with her. She talked to us for awhile and then looked at the x rays and then stopped, she said that she could not do this surgery either....When I had my hysterectomy I was doing laps around the surgery ward the same day. My Drs have a hard time with me because I dont stay down as long as I should....Lori \nbefore my surgery my right breast was already smaller too so this really did a number on it. I like the idea of a padded bra because it wont loose its shape....I know I have to have radiation but wont know about\n chemo until after the surgery. I really dont want to have chemo because of the chance of loosing my hair....Hi everyone\nI have had the most trouble in the world trying to get this surgery scheduled. The original Plastic surgeon that I had chosen is now out of the running....I have read alot of your bios and it sounds like most of you had your breast removed and had reconstructive surgery. I dont know if I have made the right decision or not to save my breast....Tammy there are 2 other women that have had the tram done in the last year that can also give you advice on the surgery (Babyseester & happyhannah). I decided that this is what I wanted and have never looked back....I know what you mean about\n over eating, I have been eating very small amounts since the surgery because my tummy just wont allow large amount. Now that I feel better Im going to get out and get more exersize....We sat in the ER for 6 hours for them to tell us that they could not help us. They have a specialist that will do the surgery but he has to wait 3-4 days for the swelling to go down first....It should be an easy surgery so don't worry. I had a hysterectomy but left my overies because I did not want to take hormones....There is a chance that he will never walk the same even with the surgery because the break is so bad. It has a minimum 3 months in a cast and then rehab......Im not looking forward to this at all....",
