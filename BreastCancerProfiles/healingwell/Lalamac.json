      "Content": " I am 51 and no family history of breast cancer. I had a cyst needle biopsy in my late 20's, but other than that have had no problems. I have very fibrous breasts, so lately have had to follow up with ultrasounds after mammo's. This month, I was called back for 3-d mammo and ultrasound, then had a needle biopsy on 4/14. Today I got word that it was not cancerous, but is a radial scar and needs to be removed. I have been told that my information has been submitted to a surgeon, and now awaiting call to schedule. I so frustrated that now that my breast is no longer sore from the biopsy, but now am told it will be even sorer. Can you tell me what your recovery was like? I'm hoping I'm not going to have to miss work, etc. I've had so many surgeries in the past that I really do not look forward to it. Do they remove the tissue thru the same area they did the biopsy, or do they actually have to cut it \nopen???? ",
