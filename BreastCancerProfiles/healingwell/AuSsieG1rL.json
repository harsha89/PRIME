      "Content": " I don't know how to react, how to show emotion to the news I received from my parents today.  My grandfather on my dad's side has Liver Cancer.  This December-- December 2004 he will be 94 years old.  Janny-- his wife my grandma and my uncle his son Bill hasn't and isn't going to tell him until Monday.  He had surgery the other day to remove what docs had thought was a benign tumor in his intestine or somewhere, only to find out that it was actually malignant.  The surgery to remove it was a success and my grandfather told my uncle that he will live until he's 100!  Docs have told that he can live 2 more yrs. comfortably or 5 years with intensive treatment that may not be quite as comfortable.  He has one other brother adn was 1 of seven in his family (g-pa's family).\n \n ",

      "Content": " My best friend is in therapy, has a psychologist, a psychiartrist, as well as family docs. I just don't think it's fair that she has to deal with all that she's dealing with. Her grandfather recently passed away and the funeral was a week ago tomorrow. \nI've never been close to my grandfather who now has cancer. One reason is because he lives in Memphis, TN. Another reason is that he was affilated with church and is somewhat too religious for me. I'm not one who is into religion and such especially with everything that I've gone through since 11th grade (3 yrs ago.).\nMy grandmother with Alzheimer's is gone.... she's had the disease for 5+ years so there isn't much left of her.... it bothers me to see her have to still be here and be suffering. I wish she would already go like my friend's grandpa did. All I do besides going to school 3 times a week is stay home and babysit. I don't go out I don't have fun. I stay here, at home, in front of the computer. It's been getting so out of hand that I have almost, if not already, a dozen or so email addresses.\nI have now pretty much given up on everything and keep to myself-- especially my feelings and emotions. I have practically lost everything in a way because all of my friends are scattered around the US because of college (Ole Miss, MSU, NO, WI, AL, etc.) and I only have really 2 friends left-- my friend with FMS and my friend Casey who \"engaged\" to her boyfriend. I don't want to intrude when it's the two of them because I feel like the third wheel-- plenty of experience with my sister. I don't think I'll ever really find someone who will love me for me and understand what \"sickness(es)\" I do have adn not let that \"scare\" them away. In a way, I think that I ruined a pretty good chance of starting a relationship with a pretty cool guy... yeah.... he was about 4 years older than me but he was gentle. I think the main reason I didn't really go for it was for the fact he worked wiyth law enforcement and I don't trust law enforcement... the only person I do trust who works for police is my friend with FMS husband; however, I'm still somewhat scared of him... :/ I have not much of a reason to carry on; to accomplish my dreams (become an ADA) and get away from my mother's grasp. With this site and these forums was by accident when searching for information on FMS adn other \"diseases\" that some of my friends have. I have nothing! ",
