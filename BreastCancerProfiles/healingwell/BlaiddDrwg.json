    "Content": " In the morning I noticed a red spot on my breast. It wasn't there before. It's tender and it feels as though there's a small lump at the center of it. It looks a lot like a rash, I don't know if it could be a bug bite too, I've had spider bites appear in the mornings on my hands and legs, but not there before.\nI was ok with it until I got home and found out, after some Internet searches, that it could be a sign of breast cancer, now I just don't know what to do!\nI'm only 18 and I'm very worried! Should I be concerned or see how it goes during the weekend? \n \n \n ",
