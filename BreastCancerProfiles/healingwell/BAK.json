      "Content": " Hi Eveie,\nI haven't posted here in a LONG time but came by tonight and saw your post. Welcome to the club and I love your attitude!\nI was dx'd with metastatic breast cancer...but have gone 1 1/2 years almost with no further recurrence so far. I had a left mast and lots of stuff under my arm, etc. removed. I kinda wish I'd had a double so I would match. \n \nI don't want to get a reconstruction.....I don't mind being flat since I was only an AA to start with.....but the falsie sometimes moves around and my bra gets twisted a bit and I work with a lot of men. LOL I have stories I could tell!!! I always go braless at home so it would be nice to match I suppose. I hate to scare people who come to the door. \nMy boyfriend also has agoraphobia and severe panic attacks so I can very much sympathisize with you. He rarely leaves the house but went with me to chemo (but so medicated that I had to drive!) and he has been very supportive. I'm SO sorry you have to go through all this! BUT....it has changed my outlook on life and priorities. Stumbling Blocks can be Stepping Stones depending on how you use them, right?\nI'm also on Tamoxifen and Effexor for the hotflashes so they aren't too bad anymore. \nGod bless you and find the things to laugh at...it helps LOTS!\nlove,\nBeth ",

      "Content": " Hello everyone!\nI haven't posted here in months but read it as much as I can...maybe once a week. \nAnd I'm praying for all of us!\nI'm VERY busy posting ...sheesh!...I mean working 40+ hours a week. It has been very draining for me.\nI finished RADS in the first week of Dec. I had to take a week off from rads because of the major mess under my arm. It is still not all healed yet. I went for a month without wearing a bra at work...thank goodness it was getting cooler and I could layer and wear baggy stuff. I felt so ...well....uh...icky. \nNow if I could just lose the 20 lbs I gained in chemo. \n \nI'm supposed to be taking Tamoxifen....I got 3 at Walmart....they had to order more. So two weeks later i remembered I was supposed to get them. I FINALLY remembered to do it...they put it back since it took me so long to come back! Actually, I'm afraid to take it. Today....I realized I better start....and now I can't remember where I put them. It must be here somewhere........but more hormone inbalance sounds pretty scary to me........what if I freak out?????\nJust this week I started stressing over silly stuff.......\n2 more months til my DX date anniversary..... what if it shows up somewhere else? \nWasn't I supposed to go back and have my port flushed? I forget.\nWill my house ever be clean again? Was it ever before?????? Do some people wash dishes?\nAnd what if I want to go swimming.....how do I hide my UGLY armpit???? Will it ever heal up?\nWhen will my hair every stop sticking straight up and WHY isn't it curly???? \nI would NEVER have agreed to chemo if I knew it would be straight again..my goodness......and I had to color it. It came in white and gray ...actually silver. Now it is reddish blondish...of some kind...rather unusual. \nAnd the big question......how do I get my bra to stop twisting to the right???????\nToday I spent lots of money. I bought a leather rocker/recliner and rocker/glider for $1000 ...that was 1/2 price. And then an electric guitar and AMP for my boyfriend...$360 at a pawn shop.\nI'll try to come back more often and post. I finally remembered my login name!\nGod bless you,\nBeth ",

Taxol is chemo....are you thinking of tamoxifen?\nNope....didn't loose weight...I just gained! lol\nI know what you mean about\n questions...new ones pop up all the time.\nI have not worked since surgery....6 months now. My first chemo AC was every 2 weeks with nuelasta shots the day afterward and I really didn't feel good with it.... Flu-like symptoms (aches and pains and fever) and extreme fatigue. I had short term and long term disability so I got by financially ok....still LOTS of bills though.\nBut many people are able to work so you could do just fine! I work with dual diagnosis (developmentally disabled and mentally ill) adults..mainly men..who can be quite aggressive. And I'm a supervisor of 8 staff too. My job can be demanding physically and mentally and I had chemo-brain pretty bad. I even forgot names and what my job title was! LOL But I will be returning in a week and I am pretty nervous about\n that. \nI had 3-4 kinds of anti-nausea meds so I wasn't sick too much. Mainly I was just sleepy all the time.

I had 4 sessions of AC 2 weeks apart and then 12 sessions of taxol (similar to taxotere) 1 per week for 3 weeks then one week off. I think I have 4 or 5 treatments left. Then rads.....6-8 weeks and hormone therapy for 5 years. It seems like forever.......\nI've never been to Seattle but have heard it is wonderful. I was born in NY, then lived in Illinois, Arizona and CA...and now have been in Kansas for 5 years. It is very pretty where we live in the Flint hills near KState U.....not flat like people think of KS. \nIf I had lots of money I would prefer to live by the Pacific coast somewhere. I miss vacations to Moro Bay, Cayucas, and Monterey areas.....and the feel, sounds and smells of the beach, surf and air. My sister from CO drives all the way there just to stick her feet in the sand! lol She used to live in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.\nI'm glad you have good insurance and disability.....that helps alot with peace of mind.\nI think my chemo brain is getting better but some days I'm not too sure! : ) \nTake care,\nBeth ",

I felt quite sick that first time but used all the nausea meds and things and the other times were ok.\nThe port itself doesn't cause me pain, Bernadette,...it does stick out a bit though. Don't be afraid of it. I don't know why people were saying they had a lot of pain from it. And I am a big baby!

      "Content": " Hi Bernadette,\nI'm sorry that you have to go through this with us but it is so comforting to have others input and to know that we are not alone in our feelings and fears.\nMy hair started coming out 2 weeks after starting AC ...( I started Taxol after I finished the AC). I had long hair that came out in BIG clumps when I brushed it. It was like the brush just grabbed it and it fell off. I felt like I had cobwebs all over me and it was awful. The next day was worse, I started crying and had my boyfriend shave my head right then. \nI mourned the loss of my hair but it sure is easy to take a shower and get ready to go somewhere now. I'm still wig shopping...I have 2 I don't like. Mostly I wear baseball caps if I go out but I just go bald at home. \n I got a lot of good ideas from people in here in another thread about\n wigs too.\nI've had quite a bit of depression going through all this......also was \"thrown\" into menopause by the chemo. But I still think it is good to educate yourself about\n your type of cancer and all the info. Ask for your Pathology report and surgery report for more details. You need to remember that alot of the information that is online is outdated so don't get upset when you see things that sound negative. Many, many people go through this and we can help each other. My doctor says that you should not listen to negative people and that you need to pray. He says that new treatments are found every couple of years so if the cancer recurrs or something doesn't work then don't worry because another treatment will be available. He said people are living WAY longer than many doctors expect and that no one should tell you how long you will live because they don't know what God's plan is for you! (Another doctor I saw was very negative and gave me about\n a 50% chance of living 5 years....with chemo. I could not accept that!) \nI do have a port that I got on my first chemo day and the 4 sessions of AC chemo was not the most fun i ever had. I survived it though.....I don't remember alot of what happened then...I think I slept through most of it! I felt bad for about\n 3 days afterward and the days increased with each treatment. I thought I would never feel good again. LOL I didn't feel good and was SO tired.\nWhen I started the Taxol life improved alot! I've had hardly any side effects from that...just some numbness and tingling and pain where I had surgery and the ongoing tiredness. Just remember that the chemo will end someday...you won't feel like that forever.\nAnd the hair will grow back.........it seems like a long time I've had no hair though! LOL \nI gained about\n 15 lbs so far.. 130 lbs....yuck! The steroids with the taxol and going through menopause are what is doing it maybe? I never had this problem before! Usually I weigh 110-115 and I'm only 4' 11\" so I don't want to gain more weight!\nAlso, don't be afraid of feeling down...I think we all have our bad days. I went to the Post office yesterday and saw a young man who I supervise at work who had not seen me for 5 months. He hugged me and was very concerned about\n how i look. I just started crying when i got in my car and got scared about\n going back to work in a couple weeks. I hope it goes okay. \nTake care and keep us up to date on your progress!\nGod bless you,\nBeth ",

Then I went to the American Cancer society and they loaned me one that looked a bit better but made me look older and it was itchy. lol (I guess i am hard to please, huh?)\nSo I found this place that sells hi-temp wigs (heat resistant to 350) that says they are \"soft and silky to the touch\" and I'm thinking about\n trying one of those. Has anyone ever tried one before? Is it really soft and silky?\nWell, I could just wear my baseball cap or scarfs but hair might be more appropriate now and then.......but if I got itchy or sweaty I'd have to just take it off. Now that could be funny! At home I just go bald...it is growing on me (punny lol) and I love how fast it is to take a shower and get ready to go!! \n \nBeth ",

      "Content": " Hi JUJU,\nI'm glad you are feeling better. You have been through alot! \nI also had trouble with insurance. I was referred to a med onco but my insurance said he had a different address then what they had so he would not be approved. I called twice with the same answer. Insurance referred me to another med onco closer to me so I went to see him. He was AWFUL! He had a dirty office, a nurse with long designer fingernails and smelled like smoke, told me I had a 50% chance of survival and was just not positive at all. I was shocked and my nurse friend who went with me said he had a bad bedside manner and I should find another onco. I just sobbed in the parking lot and went home so depressed. Two weeks and several phone calls later, I find out that my insurance company had not updated their records for 2 years and the med onco that I was supposed to go to was covered afterall!! I lost 2 weeks that I could have been in treatment and was using sick leave too. \nI LOVE my med onco! He is SO positive and encouraging.......and said if I had a recurrence not to worry about\n dying because new treatments are always being found. He says live one day at a time and remember to pray. He tells me all the time that I am going to be okay and to remember that when I start geting doubtful. He even said I was cute bald! lol I still have very bad days when I get depressed but I try to remember what he said...and not to give up hope. \nI pray that you will find a good doc and support staff at a cancer center that will give you hope. No one should be told they will die for any reason...it just is not true! No one knows when or from what you will die except God.....and He gives us the grace to go through way more than we can ever imagine.\nDon't you dare to give up on yourself. You are a beautiful person and being yourself is all you have to be! \nLots of hugs!\nBeth ",
