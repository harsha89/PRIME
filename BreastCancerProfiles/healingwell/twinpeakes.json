I am deathly afraid of iv's and having them once a week is causing me to have nightmares!!! I am such a baby about\n iv's. The unfortunate part was that I asked my doctor about\n herceptin before I took my port out and he said that it wasn't for me. Now three weeks later and my port surgically removed...I am now taking it. ",

I am currently taking herceptin and I swell a lot but the heart test keeps coming up okay. I also feel tired, but I don't know if I have lingering effects from chemo or if it is herceptin.
