      "Content": " I have moderately dense breasts and have had over the past 6 years mammograms and ultrasounds every two years. They have found multiple cysts in both breast and each year they always seem to multiply and I am use to them hanging around. I am 45 years old and the only breast cancer in our Family is my Aunt on my dads side.\nOn the last Mammo and Ultrasound that I just received back show combination of simple cysts and multiple complex cysts, now since I have such dense breasts the Mammo isnt really showing anything not even the cysts and I put that all to the mammo and dense breasts dont work well together. I am scheduled for a MRI in August upon the Tec's request not my family doctor, Now my fear is that I always seem to have simple cysts hanging around but this is the first time they tell me I have MULTIPLE complex cysts as well and over the past six years there is always some mention of cysts in my Axillae , in the 2006 report it mentions about\n two lesions with the larger lesion measuring 2.4 cm in length saying it may represent large lymph nodes? over all in three reports spanned over the past six years it refers to my axillae and cysts of lymph nodes. I had a family doctor for years and he never really seamed concerned about\n it and when i would push for more info about\n it he would walk out of the room and tell me to make another appointment (small northern town in Ontario and not many doctors) so we didnt have a choice but to keep the one we had. \nEvery two years the reports changed and each one sounds a little more worrisome than the previous one. Now with this many cysts and complex cysts how is it possible that they test each one to find out if its non cancerous ? If I get every cyst removed to be safe I fear I will have no more breasts left or they will look like pancakes. With all the complex cysts showing up this time I am extremely worried, I am petrified to go for the MRI with contrast fearing they will tell me its cancer. Has anyone else gone through this or something like this?\nI know 80% of cysts are B9 but complex cysts worry me a whole lot more :(\nI have tried to push for more answers from my family doctor but he just didnt seem to care more than that. Maybe I should of pushed a whole lot more and its my own fault but my doctor was so intimidating and everyone kept telling me that cysts were normal for women :( \nAny information or help would put my mind at ease if only for a little while. \nFeeling anxious and lost at the moment. This is the first time they ask for MRI ..... \nThanks for listening ",

I will cross my fingers and hope nothing has changed. The last report showed a Bi-rads 3. I know they say that before menopause our breasts become busy with cysts which seams to be the case with mine as well they have told me I have fibrocystic disease (lots of cysts). I have very dense breasts even for a 47 year old lol so its hard to see anything in that mess. Six month follow up for you is always good this means they are keeping an eye on you and to make sure they are stable and no changes. Before each Menstrual cycle you may find your breasts will become very sensitive and that is what happens to me each month and about\n a week after my period they hurt much less. I wish you luck and hope everything works out ok for you HeatherH.\nSorry it took so long to get back to you on this one. ",

      "Content": " Hi Bev\nThanks so much for replying and thank you so much for sharing your story, \nI just feel a bit lost with the newest reports in :( I know many say dont worry but how can you not worry when you have so many cysts and complex cysts laying around, the normal cysts dont worry me so much but this is the first time they tell me I have multiple complex cysts and the cysts that keep showing up in the axillary also make me nervous :( I seen that on the ultra sound two years ago and it was not black cysts it was very gray and long looking, it just seems its not adding up. When they did the US this year I could see one cyst that looked like it had a wall down the middle and she marked that one but I am no doctor lol \nUsually I am not easily pushed around and I can have a bite to me when pushed to hard but sometimes just every once in awhile I get someone that can shut me up and intimidate the heck out of me and my Doctor was one of them :( you couldnt tell him anything or tell him you thought it could be this or that ... he would be very insulted, in the end I could never have any type of conversation with him at all. \nWhen this all started in 2004 with my first mammo and US and they found a couple of cysts I had one removed by a surgeon in an office and it came back fine but since that cyst I have never had any of the other cysts aspirated and as the report states Multiple cysts and multiple complex cysts this year. I think I will take your advice and ask for a Breast Specialist. Should I wait until my MRI is done before asking or ask for a Breast specialist even before that?\nThank you so much for talking with me :) I already feel a bit better :)\nI will keep you informed and again thank you \nTam ",

      "Content": " Hi \nIm back again after a year with a couple of questions \nPast history, I have multiple cysts that I have had for the past 6-8 years and as of last year I know have multiple complex cysts so I am required to do a six month follow but I waited a year before I went back in. Now I just finished a Ultrasound of both breasts and I have the report back and I was hoping someone could give me there opinion of whats written.\nOk here it goes and this is whats written on my report from ULTRASOUND\n* compared to to study of 2011 and correlated to MRI of breast of 8.17.2011 which showed no evidence of neoplasm-bilateral cysts were seen\nFINDINGS:\nBoth breasts today contain numerous cysts. Also, in the left breast at the 3 and 6 o'oclock positions,there are nodular type structures. The 3 o'clock lesion measures 6mm . I truly do not appreciate this finding on the previous examination. This lady has numerous lesions in both breasts, making interpretation by ultrasound somewhat difficult.\nBecause of the interval of time since the previous examination of nearly one year, for reassurance I would recommend a repeat MRI of the breasts for surveillance and also to evaluate the apparent new Solid nodule in the left breast at the 3 o'clock position.\nNow I am use to the cysts since I have many, Im still trying to wrap my brain around the complex cyst issue but now they have found two solid nodules. I will be going for a MRI on the 19th of August, I went for one last year with the rest of the tests and it states it cant see everything because my breasts are too dense and the Mammo states the same thing :( so I am a bit more upset about\n the new solid nodules showing up and would like some input from others about\n my latest report :)\nThank you so much in advance ",
