      "Content": " Is there an active breast cancer forum other than healing well. I love the format, but it does not seem to active. I suffer prostate cancer and enjoy the healing well forum and the numerous active posts. However, the healing well breast cancer site is not nearly as active. Our daughter has been diagnosed with breast cancer (today) and I am trying to find an active forum for her.\nThank you,\nMr Bill ",
