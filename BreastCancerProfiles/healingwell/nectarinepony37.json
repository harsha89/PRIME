      "Content": " dak,\nI was diagnosed in Stage IV inflammatory breast cancer 9 months after my clean yearly mammogram. To this day I still don't have a traditional brest lump. Keep your spirits up. The docs told me I probably wouldn't last a year and yet here I am, a year and half later. I had to change oncs once because the first one I had was hoping I'd die faster. Every time I went to see him I could see it in his eyes. Also he didn't have any plan for my care, which was the something my present onc did right away. \nKeep planning for the future and make sure your doctors are too. There are plenty of sites out there that can give you more info on diet and exercise appropriate for your type of cancer.\nTake care.\nPrayers and Hugs,\nMaggie ",
