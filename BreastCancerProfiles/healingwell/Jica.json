    "Content": " Hi\nI'm glad I found this thread. I just received a call back (went through something similar four years ago with a positive outcome) as there are two areas--one in each breast--that they need further shots of and a possible ultrasound. I'm 48 years old--so I am still considered in the denser breasts age range and the woman I spoke to on the phone told me that it could very well just be extra tissue folds over these areas and to \"please don't be alarmed\". Easier said than done I guess as its hard not to feel semi-terrified--mostly because there are two suspicious areas this time instead of just one. I've read many of the posts and they are reassuring--as statistically most outcomes are benign and call backs really aren't that uncommon. Obviously, having a mammogram every year, despite the accompanying anxiety, is all part of making sure any problems are caught as early as possible--so a part of me should welcome this extra screening--and since it most likely isn't a problem--getting that extra peace of mind that it was checked out more thoroughly. That said, has anyone had two suspicious areas --at one time-- in question before? many thanks for any comments or insights.....\nJane ",
