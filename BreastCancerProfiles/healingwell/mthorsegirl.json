      "Content": " Bev, thank you for your reply. I am on immunosuppressive therapy, which I was worried about\n that. It is my breast soft tissue that hurts though it is definanitely not my bones and it has been almost 2 months since I had the horse kick me. Every where else that hurt from it quit hurting about\n 2 weeks afterward. I just feel so stuck, because I know I should see a doctor. But I just can't afford it. ",
