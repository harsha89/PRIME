    "Content": " I'm 22 years old female. Last week I went for a normal checkup, and my doctor ended up giving me a breast exam. Well the doctor scared me when she said she felt something on my right breast and she is ordering me my first mammogram. That was this past Thursday. Today I get a phone call from the imaging center saying that I need to come in for a ultrasound on my left breast. They found a mass that they need to look at. I'm a nervous wreck. It wasn't anything on the right breast that the doctor felt but not it's my left. I'm so scared of cancer. I have two small children. I have no clue how to call myself. Crying and just a mess. My ultrasound is this Thursday. ",
