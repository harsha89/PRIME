      "Content": " Hi Simone,\nI also am from CO. Was in your shoes almost 5 years ago. Dr and surgeon both told me they were 95% sure it was nothing. My tumor was hard, like a pea, didn't move and didn't hurt. Also didn't show up on the mammo or ultrasound. Keep pushing, the only way to find out for sure is biopsy, if it is benign, Great! Don't let them make you feel this is unimportant.\nHugs, Pam ",

Hopefully the onc won't be needed but if you do I have a great one at Rose Medical, at the Rocky Mtn Cancer Center. We have terrific docs here.\nHugs, Pam ",
