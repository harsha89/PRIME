      "Content": " Thanks, Marianne, I will certainly let you know.  I am assuming your score was low, and that you chose not to do chemo.  Right?  My doctors are recommending ovararian suppression with tamoxifen -- is that the therapy course you are doing? ",

      "Content": " Marianne -- I had the EXACT same pathology report as you did, which I received 2 weeks ago.  My surgery was on January 19th.  I am waiting for the results of the Oncotype dx test -- should come in any day now, in order to determine whether I should add chemo to the recommendation that I have tamoxifen with lupron (for ovarian suppression).  I am also 48 years old.  How did you reach the treatment decisions that you made?  What did the oncologists recommend?  Thanks!  Susan ",

      "Content": " Hi Marianne -- the only difference is that my Estrogen receptor is positive 95, other than that, it is an exact match, including the grade and our age.  Still waiting for the results of the oncotype dx test.  I've seen two oncologists -- very prominent in their field -- one from Hackensack Hospital, in NJ -- known for agressive treatment....pushing four founds of AC together with ovarian removal and arimidex -- and one who only specialized in breast cancer from NY Presbyterian....she favors only hormonal therapy with ovarian suppression. (starting with tamoxifen).  The oncotype dx test will be the great decider........ ",

      "Content": " Hi Marianne -- Believe it or not I STILL haven't received my Oncotype results yet....and it's been 4 weeks.  Not because the testing is slow, but I found out on Thursday that my breast surgeon had NOT submitted the correct paperwork for the test.  As you can imagine I was livid to find out that she had received three phone calls from the pathology department advising her that the paperwork needed to be resubmitted, but she did not respond to their repeated requests.  When I confronted her with this information, she said that even though I had signed the consent forms in her office, it was my oncologists responsibility to send through the paperwork to inititate the test.  A classic case of \"he said, she said\" -- and I'm the one who is suffering!  I now must wait ANOTHER 10 days to get the results, and I can't begin treatment of either radiation or chemo until the results are in -- seven weeks after my surgery.  I am so angry!  And to add insult to injury, she was completely unapologic and unsympathetic to the situation, taking a very defensive position that it was not her fault!  So, I wait.....  What was your number?  Does it matter what the number is, as long as it falls into the low or intermediate range?  Thanks!  Susan ",
