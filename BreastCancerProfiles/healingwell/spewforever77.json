    "Content": " \n Â I am 36 years old. They found a 1 millimeter lump in the left breast at the 10 O Clock position. Going in for biopsy Thursday. They kept telling me it was nothing, it was no big deal. I was shaking so bad they thought I was being a drama queen. Will know the results Monday. I am so scared. I am a single mom to 3 awesome kiddos, one that is handicapped. I don't want to die or have anything happen to me. Any ideas? thoughts? Is 1 millimeter pretty big? Also, should I tell my ex about\n this now or wait for the results Monday? The divorce did not go well and there is a protective order in place. I don't need any drama from him or him wanting to take my kiddos away due to my illness. Thank you. \n ",
