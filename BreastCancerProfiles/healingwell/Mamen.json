      "Content": " Hi, I am a new member and I would like some advice. I am 29 years old and I went to Hospital because I had a lump on my breast and after a revision and an ultrasound I was found at least 7 or eight cysts!. Most of them were 5 and 6mm and I've got a larger one wich it should be 7/8mm. I was told they were all cysts and they were common in young girls. The doctor said it was hormonal. I asked the doctor if my irregular periods could be the cause and he said that it was probable and that i had to come back to my clinic and had that seen by my GP becuase they don't specialize in this!.\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Dear friends,\nTHANK YOU ALL. I am thrilled to get so many replys and so quickly!!!. I think this forum really is useful. I am going to get an appointment with my doctor and ask for a copy of the ultrasound and consult and ask for a second opinion (may be when I go to Spain, back @ home you feel more safe!). I'll also try to cut down caffein, let's hope I don't fall sleep!\nAs soon as I know anything I will let you know. Thank you so much! ",
