      "Content": " I got in to see another doctor last night...she did a breast exam, I showed her the general area where I found the lump before I got undressed.\nWhen she did the exam she started with the left one, and found some of my fibrocysts which I told her about\n and I told her those ones do the normal fibrocyst stuff in sync with my menstrual cycle.\nThen she came to my right breast, I wasn't looking at her face while she was doing this kinda trying to not think about\n it I guess. Then out of the corner of my eye as she came to the lump her eyes got bigger her mouth \nopened slightly...then she said \"is that it?\"\nThey are scheduling me for a mammogram, i am waiting to get a call this morning.\nMy fear has only heightened....

      "Content": " Hello, I am new to this area on healing well. \nI was diagnosed when I was 19 with Fibrocycstis (ok I dont know how to spell it, its the lumps in the breast that after biopsy says non-cancerous).\nI am now 31 years old, the major lump I had at 19 is the same no changes. I have found a few stranglers here and their, they do the typical grow around menstrual and disappear shortly after, creating pain that came and went.\nI found a quite large mass on the outside of my right breast, on the surface of this large mass I can feel long nodule like bumps which do not move. This part of my breast is painful as of the last few weeks, not during my typical painful breast time. Not only that but there is a small bruise the size of a dime which has not gotten worse, but not gotten better. My veins are seen very easily, and my lymph nodes in my armpits and one in the inside of my elbow are swollen but not hard.\nThe pain is very overwhelming by the end of the day, and I have to pray that my 5 year old crazy son doesnt try to jump on me while Im on the couch. He did that yesterday and it sent me into a sharp pain localized to my right nipple and the area of the large mass.\nHeres my question, should I go to the ER? Urgent Care? Or wait to get into see my regular doctor?\nFamily history: Mom had ovarian cancer, full hysterectomy at age 38 because it was so advanced, my moms sisters all have been diagnosed with breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer, my fathers mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer as well. \nHelp please!
