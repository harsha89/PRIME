    "Content": " I am a 65 year old postmenopausal female. I've had painful, lumpy breasts since my early 30's. Every mammogram I've had since my mid-30's has shown both breasts to be severely fibrocystic. Not much has changed since then...the pain, the heaviness, the mammograms. I did take HRT for perimenopausal symptoms, most noticeably night sweats and hot flashes. I continued the HRT even after the announcements that they caused breast cancer. However, as a high school teacher, my hot flashes were so severe, I had to bring extra underwear to school to on change most days, so I refused to quit the hormones. Eventually, the hormones ceased to work, though I tried patches, creams, foams, troaches, and I eventually began bioidentical hormone implants. They helped with my menopause symptoms, but my hot flashes have never stopped. (My mother had hot flashes till she died at age 76.) My libido was greatly helped, at least for awhile. I am currently in the process of stopping these as they are expensive and I have to travel quite a distance for them. Plus, they don't seem to help much anymore. I have had increasing breast size and breast tenderness and pain as I get older, rather than the opposite being true. The pain is constant, not intermittent. I have tried evening primrose oil and vitamin E with little to no help. I have cut my caffeine to one cup of regular coffee in the mornings. I used to be an avid exerciser and runner, but I have multiple bulging discs in my neck and lower back and have degenerative disc disease so I don't exercise as I used to. It seemed like the year I turned 64, my body turned on me. I hurt everywhere...neck, shoulder, ribs, back, leg, hip...but only on one side. I am so tired of being in pain all the time. Who said these were the golden years? ",
