      "Content": " The lump feels kind of soft, sort of oblong, maybe about\n 1/4 to 1/2 inch long. Don't worry, I check it every day. I am waiting for my Dr to call me back with the ultrasound results (although the radiologist said she couldn't see anything). I have just received notice from my insurance company that we no longer need referrals to see a specialist so I think that will be my next step. I live in Denver, CO so should have a good selection.\nThanks to everyone for their concern. I will keep you all informed.\nSimone ",

      "Content": " Okay - I spoke with my surgeon yesterday. He explained that fibrocystic changes were very common, occuring in most women at some point in time. The lumps can come and go. They can have a dull pain to them, or a sharp shooting pain (as mine does) or no pain.\nHe also said that the FNA can have a false negative. As mine was not ultrasound guided he had to \"feel\" to get the lump, although he is certain he did. He said that with the FNA there is about\n a 3 in 1000 chance of it being wrong, assuming that he got the needle in the right place and the cells from the right place. \nI don't really know how much this helps, as it seems to be all the info I can find on the web about\n it anyway.\nI am strongly leaning towards having the lump removed.\nIV-Wife - good job on making the appointment, make sure you let us know how it goes.\nMK - thatnks for your input, it is greatly appreciated.\nBest\nSimone ",

      "Content": " Hi there:\nI'm confused too. I just got my lab results back from a biopsy I had done on a lump in my breast. It shows fibrocystic changes. The nurse tells me it is very common and benign. She is also having the dr call me next week to discuss further. I was confused as to whether or not this could change to something else at a later date. Also confused as everything I read shows that it comes and goes with hormonal changes and usually occurs in both breasts.  My lump has been there constantly and doesn't seem to change any.\nSorry I am not much help right now but might have more info after the surgeon calls me next week.\nWill keep you updated.\nSimone ",

Both my ultrasound and mammogram didn't show anything (I am 33 with dense breast tissue). I just had a biopsy done yesterday and am awaiting the results.\nI would agree that additional tests be performed. U/S and biopsy.\nMy question is this: How did the doctor know it was just a cyst by feeling it? I don't know, maybe they feel different from anything else.\nDon't wait, the worry is not worth it.\nGood luck to you.\nSimone ",
