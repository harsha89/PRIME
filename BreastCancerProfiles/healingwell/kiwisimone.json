      "Content": " Okay - I spoke with my surgeon yesterday. He explained that fibrocystic changes were very common, occuring in most women at some point in time. The lumps can come and go. They can have a dull pain to them, or a sharp shooting pain (as mine does) or no pain.\nHe also said that the FNA can have a false negative. As mine was not ultrasound guided he had to \"feel\" to get the lump, although he is certain he did. He said that with the FNA there is about\n a 3 in 1000 chance of it being wrong, assuming that he got the needle in the right place and the cells from the right place. \nI don't really know how much this helps, as it seems to be all the info I can find on the web about\n it anyway.\nI am strongly leaning towards having the lump removed.\nIV-Wife - good job on making the appointment, make sure you let us know how it goes.\nMK - thatnks for your input, it is greatly appreciated.\nBest\nSimone ",

The nurse tells me it is very common and benign. She is also having the dr call me next week to discuss further. I was confused as to whether or not this could change to something else at a later date. Also confused as everything I read shows that it comes and goes with hormonal changes and usually occurs in both breasts.  My lump has been there constantly and doesn't seem to change any.\nSorry I am not much help right now but might have more info after the surgeon calls me next week.\nWill keep you updated.\nSimone ",
