      "Content": " I used the Chantix when I started my chemo. It worked where nothing else did. I was on my 4th week when I had trouble with nausea, so I cut down to 1 per day then eventually 1 every other day and finally at 6 weeks stopped. I am 8 months smoke free now and feeling great about\n it. Good luck, if it can help a smoker of 40 years it can help you! ",

      "Content": " Hi~\nI just finished 6 months of chemo. The first course was Adrimiacin+cytoxin and the second course Taxol. I had no trouble with the first course [be sure to take your Emend and they gave me Aloxi before my treatment]. The Taxol gave me a lot of muscle aches that have lingered, but everything is doable. Good luck and hang in there!!\nKaron from Illinois ",

      "Content": " Hang in there Laurie. I was diagnosed this last April. In May had a mastectomy and reconstruction done. Not bad at all. I had wonderful drs and they helped me thru all of it. I was also on HRT and I agree--tell everyone you know STAY OFF IT!!!!!!! I was estrogen+ [985] and progesterone+ [97%]. Sentinal nodes clear. I'm now on my second course of chemo [AC dense dose first and now Taxol] I have good days and bad days with that, but it's doable. Just remember-you are a survivor! ",
