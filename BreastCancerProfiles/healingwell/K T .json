    "Content": " I'm stuck with a doctor that feels that because an ultrasound and mammogram didn't show anything its in my head. Can you guys provide any advice or suggestions?\nHistory - I'm 37 now. I had a breast reduction at 27. All went well - reduced to a 38C but gained all my weight back and they grew back also I'm now at a 40D. A few years ago I noticed breast tenderness. Left breast outer to lower quadrant. I can feel lumps there. My breasts are not dense at all. It is very painful to press the area - the ultrasound and mammogram were very painful. And I'm achy for days after - if anything bangs it. Like one of my cats walking on bed and stepping on it. I never go braless - wearing supportive cotton bras 24x7. \nI was on depo provera for 9 years. The painful breast showed up at about\n year 6 or 7. I went off of it a year ago. No improvement in the breast pain. It is not a cycle thing. Its there all of the time. Just one breast. The other feels fine. I can pinpoint a specific spot where it is most tender. If it was fibrocystic breast disease it is hormone related and I was on depo. And its only one breast not both.\nMy doctor doesn't seem to care that I don't have a reason for this soreness.\nI went to a naturopath and today she recommended castor oil on a white flannel fabric with heat for 30 minutes a day.\nI really want answers but I'm unsure how to approach my doctor or what I should research on my own to find out more. Something is nagging me that I need to be more assertive. Breast cancer doesn't hurt she says. So I don't think its cancer, but wondering if you guys can point me in the right direction?\nThank you.
