    "Content": " Hi all, I am having the same nightmare. I just turned 50 in Dec. Went for yearly mammogram and ultrasound. I have been having mammograms since mid 30's for benign cysts. This time they decided they wanted a biopsy. I did it on Thursday March 6. Dr calls me Monday and says all it fine. They did find the crystallization they were looking for and I have fiberous breasts but all is ok. She then calls me Thursday of the same week and says oops they sent me an addendum to the report saying there is a radial scar formation in left breast and they want to remove it. I then call the breast center where I did the biopsy to find out what to do next. I end up speaking with the dr who did biopsy. She then tells me that yes she did say take it out but she has now changed her mind and recent studies indicate we should just watch it and besides there is the issue of putting me to sleep and recovery time. Hell I would expect this kind of logic from a man but come on a woman. Who cares about\n being put to sleep and recovery time if it can save your life? I too had done some research and found very little info and what I did find said it was very rare..something like .04 in 100 women and it can hide cancer since it is basically a dark star looking thing. Needless to say I told her I was not waiting. I have custody of my 2 yr old granddaughter and I do not want to die. I saw the surgeon and told her was the biopsy dr told me about\n waiting. She said no way. I also mentioned what I had read about\n hiding cancer. She said it could be cancer. I am scheduled this Friday on the 4th. Supposedly recover is minimal but I am concerned as I am still having problems with the biopsy site. redness around area and pain inside. Any suggestions ladies? My grandmother on dads side had one breast removed but other than that no other family history of breast cancer. The same grandmother battled several different types of cancer throughout her life but she lived until she was 93. I did start my period early. Within a month of turning 11. Apparently all this matters. Any ideas, thoughts, suggestions?? ",
