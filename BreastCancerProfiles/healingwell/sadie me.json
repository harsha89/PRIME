    "Content": " hi, doesn't seem as if anyone has posted here for a while but any info or conversation i can get on microcalcifications will be greatly appreciated.  specifically, i just had a digital mammogram where microcals were spoted and biopsy was suggested.  a surgeon was recommended but i can't get in for at least one month.  i simply can't wait that long -- i'll go crazy.  i've tried to call others but have to wait til monday to try again.  is there some secret to getting in to these doctors and is the biopsy usually done on the first visit or do they refer you to someone else?  thanks for any help....i'm pretty nervous....the biopsy is supposed to be to rule out any cancerous cells.
