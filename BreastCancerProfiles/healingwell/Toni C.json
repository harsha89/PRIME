      "Content": " Thank You Mary K and DebbiR\nI am in Lafayette, Louisiana. We have several Hospitals here. I just don't know where to begin or what questions to ask. My husband said that becuase my blood work did not show and signs of cancer cells that I should not worry. But there are too many things to consider. Judging from other situations I have been in over the past 6 years when it comes to me an my body when things go wrong I, in the past did not have \"normal\" symptoms. I appreciate your words of advice. I apreciate the both of you and the willingness you have offered in helping me find a solution to what may be occurring as we speak in my life. \nGod Blesses us in many ways when we least expect it. I fully appreciate the help the both of you have offered.\nThank You\nToni C ",
