Being that it has been stated that bc and colon cancer have some correlation, this is a good time to remind all ladies to have your colonoscopies. No one has to die from colon cancer. It is a preventable disease. Colon cancer is a slow growing cancer. It takes 5 years for a polyp to grow and become precancerous. It takes another 5 years to become cancerous and another 5 years to spread. If you have a colonoscopy and all is clear...if you continue to have your routine colonoscopies on time, you will never suffer colon cancer as they will get to it before it has a chance to cause harm. The test is not that bad. I wasn't even put to sleep and watched the entire process on the camera. Don't let fear keep you from getting this test. \n \nWhere is the cure???\n \n ",

There is one photo where a car is sitting on top of a cyclone fence. One person told us he could look out of his window and see the fish swimming around his porch. How scary.\nIt was a lot of work, I'll tell ya. We all slept in shelters. Our days started at 5:40 in the morning and ended after 9 at night. We would go into headquarters and get briefed and be handed our assignments for the day. Some days we had to travel 4 hours, each way, just to get to our destinations. Dog, dog tired.\nThe people were some of the most friendliest. It was an experience I will never forget. Thankful I got the chance to go through it. When I got back home, I was on tv for an interview segment. I told them I was very impressed by the strength of the people. I wish you well.\nCindy\nWhere is the cure???\n \n ",

As you know, there is no further treatment for us, so I supplement and eat lo-carb.

There are two types of tram flaps...the pedicle tram, where all of the rectus abdominus muscle is dissected from the abdomen, one side or two, and tunneled up to your chest to create the breast. The second tram is the free tram, where only a portion of the tummy muscle is cut free and reconnected to the vessels in the breast. The DIEP does not use any muscle. It is the newest surgery. Basically the same as the free tram, except they do not take/use any muscle. Because it does not remove the tummy muscle, there aren't any lifting restrictions, once healed. The recovery is quicker with less pain. Here is the link to a page that you can read about\n it and more. Hope it helps: \n \n \n ",

I cannot imagine your total emotions, right now. Unfortunately, starting periods at a young age does up the risk. I do think, however, that by the time she is at an age, where bc may be possible, this disease will be manageable and not the disease that we know, today. I worry about my girls, too.

I guess you can read all about me in the roll call above, as I have only been on board since December. I had bilateral mastectomies, prophlactic on the left. If you do choose mastectomy and you plan on having either immediate reconstruction or delayed reconstruction, you may want to look into having the skin-sparing mastectomy, as it will leave your breast skin and allow for a better reconstruction. Learn all that you can learn and do lots of research so that you are well informed. It will do much to help in your decision making. I wish you the best. \n \n ",

Take a deep breath and calm yourself. The biopsy may not turn out to be cancer...but if it is...cancer does not necessarily mean that is going to be the end of your life. They have so many meds they can treat you with. Many women with breast cancer go on to raise their kids and have good, productive lives, for many years. You will too. Sending you giant (((((((hugs)))))), thoughts and prayers for the very best outcome with your biopsy. Please let us know how you are. Blessings. \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Rita. Hi Ellen. Thank your for the welcome. The AC, for me, was a piece of cake. Many women say AC was horrid and taxol/taxotere was easy. I found it just the opposite. I had good anti-nausea meds, with AC (Kytril) and did quite well. Painted the interior of my house while going through AC. Taxotere was a different story. I worked all through chemo and would manipulate my days off so that I didn't have to use sick time. I saved all sick time for surgeries. Anyway, my crash days on taxotere were on days 3 and 4. I work a 4/10, with my normal days off on sat, sun and mon. On chemo week, I would work on Monday and take Friday off, instead. I would have chemo on tues, work wed and thur...take friday (crash day) off, with sat being the second crash day. I'd start coming back to life on sunday and had monday to recoop and would go back to work on tuesday. When I would crash, every bit of energy would be zapped out of my body. It was an effort to walk to the bathroom or to open a zip-lock bag. Then I would bounce right back. I remember laying so listless in bed and watching tv. \"The Nanny\" became my 1:00am show. I had never seen the sitcom before and came to love it. The tv stayed on all day and all night. It kept me company. Now, I have to sleep with it on, whereas I never did prior to chemo. Couldn't sleep with the noise. I watched the start of the Iraq war. So many memories. Outside of \"crash\" days, I never lost any energy all through surgery, chemo or rads. I've always kept my energy level and did not have fatigue. I was lucky in that respect. \n \n ",
