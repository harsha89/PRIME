      "Content": " HI everyone\nI hope you are all well, I'm from the prostate cancer forum but I have a family member who is looking into getting a second opinion in NYC and I was wondering if anyone can recommend a medical oncologist preferably MSKCC or similar. She is not based in the USA so if she was to look into treatment over here we would want it to be with the best! (Who doesn't!) \nThanks in advance for any replies ",
