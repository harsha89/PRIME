Fortunately my pain is not constant. Please keep me informed if you find out anything new and I'll do the same. I had a follow-up mammogram & ultrasound in September that still revealed the cysts, but no concern from the radiologist. I go back in another 3 months. Take care! ",

      "Content": " I am a 62 year old post-menopausal woman and am not on hormone replacement. Recently after getting a mammogram, I received the dreaded letter from the imaging center that further investigation of one breast was needed. I scheduled the first available appointment which was for the next week & of course, worried the whole time. When I went the technician did a diagnostic mammogram of my left breast & asked me to wait until she showed it to the radiologist, so I had several more minutes of worrying. She came back & said the radiologist wanted her to do an ultrasound. I almost could have told her the spot to check because I have been having pain there. She said she saw two small fluid-filled cysts & went back to talk to the radiologist. She then came back & said I had nothing to worry about\n and to come back in 6 months to have the breast rechecked. At the time I was so relieved that she said I had nothing to worry about\n that I couldn't come up with any questions. Now I wonder why I would have cysts at my age which are rare since they are estrogen driven and why aspiration was not suggested? Also if there is nothing to worry about\n, why do I need to go back in 6 months instead of my normal annual mammogram? Has anyone else had the same situation? ",
