    "Content": " i have found a lump in my left breast roughly 6 weeks ago. it is hard and round and about\n the size of a 50p piece. i went to my doctor and they sent a recommendation for me to be seen by a specialist. i have been waiting now for 2 weeks. i finally received a letter from them telling me that they would be in touch with me within 3 days of the letter. when they still didnt call i got in touch with them only to be told that there is no appointment available for a few weeks and that they cant even book me in for a few weeks time because they have no idea as to the availability of appointments. Is it normal for hospitals to make you wait so long. My head is spinning with thinking about\n it all and nobody is telling me anything at all. what is even going to happen if/when i manage to get an appointment. please can someone help me. ",
