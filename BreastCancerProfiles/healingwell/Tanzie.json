      "Content": " Hi y'all\nI am 32 years old and started experiencing breast tenderness in certain spots late in 2016. Early in 2017 I noticed that when I squeeze my nipples (I kept on lactating after having my son and breastfeeding him for 6 months) a light-green goo would come out. It has progressed to very dark murky green and since about\n August last year, when I ovulated, the pain would start. My breasts would be extremely tender, so much that a rogue elbow from my son would almost have me in tears. \nI was diagnosed in December 2017 and it is a hereditary thing. What gets me is the pain and all the entries on the internet don't really go into detail on the pain. They say pain. Or just breast pain. What I need is for you gals to describe your pain in detail for me, so I can know it it's normal.\nYou know how it felt in high school to lug a heavy backpack around on your shoulders all day? Well... the pain I experience is in my upper back, between my shoulder blades. A burning, aching combination of pain. It spreads around my torso in a band and that same aching and burning happens in my sides (under my arms) and of course in my breasts, as well as in my ribs and breastbone. It is a searing pain, a heavy pain and the only thing that helps is a hot water bottle. Of course, at work I can't sit with a hot water bottle all day. The pain in this whole region radiates, right to the tips of my nipples. \nPlease ladies... please share your pain, literally. I don't know if this range of pain is normal. ",
