    "Content": " Hello everyone. My name is Melissa and I am 37. A little breast history. 2 years ago I thought I found a lump and the ultrasound was clean and the specialist didn't feel it. I was nursing at the time and his thought was I was feeling a ridge. I no longer feel it. I went for my annual check up 8 months ago and the OB said both breasts felt normal. about\n 3 weeks ago I found a lump in my right breast. I can't tell if it is tender to the touch or if I have just aggravated the area. the breast has been generally sore since finding the lump. I went to the dr and she felt this one as well as 3 others. I am still nursing but have no other symptoms of mastitis. I have not noticed any other physical changes in my breasts although I am sure if I keep looking at them I will see something. I go for an ultrasound on the 29th. I have 3 young children and have never been this scared in my entire life. Any advice would be appreciated. the Ob said she didn't feel one distinct nodule and that the breast was diffusely bumpy. She marked that were 4 sub centimeter lumps all on the inside portion of the breast. they are in pairs. Thanks in advance. ",
