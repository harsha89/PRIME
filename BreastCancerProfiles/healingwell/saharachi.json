    "Content": " Hi! Did anyone here have \u201cbreast deformity\u201d after breast reconstruction surgeries with implants placed under pectoral muscle? Can this be avoided? How do you find the silicone implants? I read that it puts women at risk for a type of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Did you experience other side effects? I\u2019m doing this research for my twin sister who was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. She is thinking of getting silicone implants after surgery. Kindly share your thoughts on this. Thanks!
