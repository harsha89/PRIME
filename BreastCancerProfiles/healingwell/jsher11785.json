      "Content": " Hello,\nMy last mammo was in 2012. I just recently had one done and it showed a calcification that wasnt there in 2012. They want to do a stereotactic biopsy with a titanium market left at the site. Most calcifications are nothing to worry about\n from what I read, my breast are very dense and hard to read, they said there may be a cluster in another area that they may be concerned about\n but will keep a watch on it by checking me in 6 months...should I get a second opinion reading the mammo results by someone else first before having this done...or wait until my insurance kicks in May 1st and go to someone completely different and have another mammo done, or just get the biopsy and see what type of calcification it is and get a marker and be done with it? Im scared, worried and dont know what to do...I know doctors air on the side of caution, so that doesnt always mean you gotta be a pin cushion each time....there is no history in my family and I have never had problems before with my mammos...any thoughts?

      "Content": " thanks M...I guess its denial, I guess its also not wanting to make fear based decisions about\n it, Calcifications are common, mine are not tight clusters but spread out a bit, which 98 % is benign and indeterminite so its not suspicious and can wait it out to see if any changes occur..but after alot of googleing and re-reading comments and post, I have to say I have been over thinking this like you said...thank you for your directness and concern and time you took to reply. I appreciate it more then you know... :) wish me luck, my biopsy is 8:30 tomorrow morning. thurs. ",

      "Content": " I found out I need two biopsys, they see the cluster on the second set of pics and want to biopsy those...I was thinking of telling them I will do the biopsy on the clusters, but not on the single micro calcification...im not being sliced twice in two different areas...if the cluster comes back ok, then I can assume the other one is harmless but will get checked in 6 months for that and if no changes then IM good...it makes more sense to me that way then to have two biopsys in two different \nlocations...lets just check the clusters for today. Any thoughts? Or I can wait 6 months and maybe there will be no changes and i will be fine...I have no history of any breast cancers in my family...Im at a low risk rate.. ",
