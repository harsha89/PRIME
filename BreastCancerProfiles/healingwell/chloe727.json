      "Content": " Hi everybody, had my mast and sent node on wednesday, it was a long day for both me and my family.  Got back to day surgery after recovery asked the nurses to give me some gingerale a \ncookie let me pee and get me the hell out of there, they laughed and called me a gritty old broad (although I am only 46).  I am feeling well today, still a little sore, but I am trying to keep semi active, even went for a short walk today.  I am quite an active person so it is bit difficult to learn to adjust to winding down some what.  I have not talked to the surgeon but was told that they removed the tumour and took 1 node.  That is what I have the question on, would they have taken more if there was more or did they take the one node and do a path on it and didn't have to remove more.  I know I will find this out at my followup appointment but I was just curious on this one point.  Thanks again to everybody for your kind words and prayers.

      "Content": " Hi, thanks to all of you for your words of encouragement.  Last night was probably one of the toughest/days of my life.  I spent from 3:00pm till 9:00pm going over everything with all my family.  Telling my boys who are 21 and 20 was the worst, I was positive in my approach but you could still see the pain, fear etc.. in their eyes.  It was almost to much for me to bare.  My DH was wonderful and offered me that additonal support when telling everybody.  First of many steps is done.  I have been reading alot of posts regarding lumpectomy vs mast and it seems most people inretrospect wish they had done the Mast.  Can somebody explain this to me so I completely understand.  I am to meet my surgeon on Thursday and what to be as informed as possible so I ask the right questions and make the right decisions.  I have been very lucky here in London, Ontario because my medical attention has been amazing todate but I think preparation and information overload will be the key for me.  If anybody could answer my question I would really appreciate it.  Thanks again to everybody ",
