    "Content": " Songbird, I was reading your posts like they were my own.  I also have the feeling of tenderness/pain, plus itchy left breast, going on for the past month.   Did a mamm and it showed no difference from two years ago, even with the new digital mamms which are supposed to detect better scans.  Then I read that people with dense breasts (like me) will need an ultrasound with a mamm to really see what's going on.  I'm glad to hear your news is positive, but I know exactly what you must have been going through last month.  Tomorrow I am calling my dr.  to insist on an ultrasound.  My maternal grandmother died of breast cancer at 39 so it's always on my mind.  \n ",
