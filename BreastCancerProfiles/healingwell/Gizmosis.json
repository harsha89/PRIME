      "Content": " Its been such a whorlwind! Got my first mammogram(42 cause everything happens to me!) had to get another two days later, now a biopsy. You know as soon as they say they find something, your mind goes right to cancer. I'm not afraid of losing the girls or my hair, I'm afraid of how hard chemo seems. I don't have the best immune system and I'm afraid that I'm not going to be physically strong enough to pull through. \nDo you ALWAYS have to go through chemo?\nAny info would be great, seems that once its diagnosed, it goes really fast. Nervous... ",

      "Content": " Feel like I'm being jerked around. Had first mammo four o'clock. Got a call eight am the next day that they found microcalcifications, will need biopsy. Had my \"consultation\" before biopsy which was almost word for word what I was told after second mammo. Called for my schedule of biopsy but \"she's on vacation this week but I'll be sure to have her call you just as soon as she can\". Was / IS very scared because it all happened so fast, I thought I had reason to be afraid but now everyone seems to be dragging their feet. Maybe I shouldn't be so worried??\nAny thoughts?\nThanks\nLaurie ",
