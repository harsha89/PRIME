    "Content": " I had a surgical biopsy 5 days ago after core biopsy showed what they called DIN1a and focal DIN1b. I read up on these and they look like they mean atypical cells of some sort. I had been having mammos every 6 mos. for microcalcifictions for past 2 years, so always worrisome every 6 months. The last mammo, the radiologist said some of the calcifications looked like they started to layer which is a sign to check for cancer I presume. I don't see the dr/surgeon for results for another 2wks. Does anyone know of any kind of statistics for the likelihood of these being cancer as I don't really understand the new terminology of the DIN categories. Also if it is cancer is this usually catching it really early stage? I had a biopsy 3 years ago on other breast which came back benign, thank god. But as many others say on these posts, the waiting is so difficult. I am thinking positive and just hoping someone has info to possibly ease my worry. Thanks for all the information you provide on these posts! ",
