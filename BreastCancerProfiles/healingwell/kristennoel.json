    "Content": " about\n a year ago I found a lump in my breast but I really didn't think anything of it because the next day I got my period. So about\n at the beginning of this month I started having weird sensations in my breast, then I would start to get a burning sensation but right after that started to happen I got my period. I'm only 19 so I don't know if this is something I should be worried about\n because I don't have any insurance. ",
