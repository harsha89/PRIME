      "Content": " Hi Tammid. Did you see your surgeon today? If so were some of your questions answered? I had a second mammogram today and a sonogram is supposed to be scheduled within a week. I am freaking out with worry and I know you must be feeling the same way. \nFor me, it helps to share the worry with someone who knows exactly what it's like. Thanks for sharing and being on the forum. ",

I am still awaiting results from tests after masses were found in both my breasts. \nIf you have a good support system within your family, listen to their suggestions about\n if and why they might support one of your options over another. That may give you peace in making the final decision. ",

The sonogram showed nothing at all, and the 2nd mammogram, the close-up of the \"trouble spots\" in each breast, were diagnosed as benign macro calcifications. I was told not to worry, and just be sure to get an annual mammogram to make sure there are no changes. It had been 5 years since my previous mammo and you can be sure I won't let that happen again. Thank you to everyone who listened to my concerns and responded to my worries. You are all strong women who I admire very much. ",
