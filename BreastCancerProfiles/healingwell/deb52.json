      "Content": " Hello. New here, but I have noticed the high level of knowledge and genuine corcern for each other. I am 53 and seem to have dense lumpy breasts. At my last checkup there are lumps in both breasts that seem somewhat symmetrical. My regular mammagram is scheduled for March. One day I am so worried of what this is and can think of nothing else and then another I say well it is ok. Is there anyone out there that can give me some experience, guidance, or help with some information about\n lumps in both breasts. My doctor was very vague and said they seem moveable and that I was to have a mammagram in March anyway. Sometimes I think the lumps are pretty equal and then sometimes I think may be similar in each breast but not exact in size or shape. I guess I am a worry wart and waiting a whole month for the mammagram has me pretty much stressed out.\nI wish everyone on this board all the best. You all have such great spirit and I admire all of you so much. I wish I had just a small percentage of your courage. Thanks in advance for any input you can give me.\nDebbie ",

      "Content": " Hello everyone. I am 53 and have a lump in my right breast--had mammo and ultrasound. Scheduled for biopsy on Wednesday. The Dr that read the ultrasound said I have a mass in right breast and need biopsy. Do older women such as myself with ongoing hot flases and such have benign masses such as fibroadenomas, etc.? I have been on an emotional roller coaster these days. The closer the time comes, the less I can sleep or even think clearly. \nPlease let me know any information you may have--it will be much appreciated. I really need to pull myself together and most of the time I am ok---but I do have some moments that I am not very proud of.\nThanks\nDebbie ",
