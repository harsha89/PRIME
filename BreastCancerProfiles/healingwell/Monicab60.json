    "Content": " My situation might be a bit different because I am a survivor of Hodgkins Disease... I had radiation to treat that as a teenager. I have had regular mammograms since age 30. After one yearly Mamo, they saw what they thought was a distortion in my left breast, and sent me for an ultrasound. They were sure that it was just a cyst, but my oncologist wanted definitive proof, so I had a breast MRI. From that it showed a definite spot. I had a core needle biopsy and it was confirmed as very early cancer. I was very lucky that it was just an insitu tumor...lumpectomy and here I am eleven years later, still clear. I had one other spot that looked equally suspicious, biopsied a few years later, but it was negative. My advice is to have a good team you trust, and listen to your own instincts. But also know that there is just as much chance that it can be negative, even after you've had a positive. Blessings. ",
