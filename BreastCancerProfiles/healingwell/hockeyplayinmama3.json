      "Content": " Help.... I am trying to work through my options for a biopsy that I thought would have been done by now and hoping to get some input! I am so confused.\nLast week I went in for a stereostatic core needle biopsy at local state university/med school. The radiologist who recommended the biopsy for my clusters of microcalcifications recommended I get it on an upright machine stereostatic machine, due to the \nlocation of the microcalcs - close to chest wall and the fact that I have itty bitty boobs. But I got scheduled for the prone position, so the radiologist, the same one who recommended the upright mentioned the mess up but then, tried to make the prone machine work. and then tried ultrasound. 4 hours later, we called it quits...\nSo, I got thinking I needed a second opinion. So, i went to a very well renowned hospital that does cutting edge everything... had a second opinion visit and they found more microcalcs and their opinion concurred with umass, I do indeed need a biopsy. BUT, here is the catch, to my astonishment, they recommended I get it on a prone table! Two radiologists reviewed all the films, including the ones from the failed prone procedure at the other hospital and they are CONFIDENT, those were their words, that they can have success using the prone table. After seeing me, with all their experience, etc... \nI let them know about\n the failure at the other hospital. They didn't give me the upright option. Either prone stereostatic machine or surgery. But they seem really confident that it will work.\nARe there different prone tables that would make one more successful with tough cases like me? Should I ask the new hospital that question, or are they all prone tables pretty much the same?\nany help is appreciated!!! thanks so much, I hope to have this figured out and done before christmas and hopefully have the results before then too. this is so stressful!!\nThanks so much :)https://www.healingwell.com/community/emoticons/confused.gif\n \n ",

Scared, but doing okay when I heard something about\n 99% chance of it not returning? Guess I will get better info. at the meeting tomorrow. ",

      "Content": " Thanks so much! I never thought that was a possibility. I would totally do it with local anesthesia and it makes me less scared to have it done. I really appreciate your input! I am hoping to have the biopsy scheduled next week or the following week. The wait is torture!\nSteph ",

      "Content": " Hi BEV,\nJust had the biopsy done! Sore, but relieved that they were able to do it. They did say that from now on if I have more calcifications, that it would need to be done surgically, and, just as you said, it is all local anesthesia, and I would get to sit in a chair! So, total relief on all counts if I need to do this again. So, now I am keeping my fingers crossed the sample is ample and benign! 3-5 days... \nSteph ",

      "Content": " BEV- Thanks for the reply! I would absolutely consider doing it the surgeryÂ way ... my only question about\n that is do they check to see pathology right away so they know if they need to remove everything, or do they just go ahead and remove everything strange so that they have less need to go back in there? I am just a little more scared of the \"\nopen surgery\" route but, due to anesthesia and just being more \nopen... I would do it in a heartbeat if that is the best way to do it.\n \n ",
