July 22.  We leave on Sat. morning for Seattle, there we will embark for an Alaskan cruise on the Princess cruise line.  Yes, it's going to be a busy couple of weeks.  I've been trying to make sure we have clothes for all three events, and room to pack them all as we won't be home again until July 31th.  I'm sure that we will have a great time but trying to prepare for three completely different events is hair-raising!!!  But, just glad that I finally have hair to raise!!! HA HA  When, I return it's back to school on Monday.  Bummer!!! But glad that I am facing a new school year without chemo treatments this year!!!!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Hope this proves to be a good New Year for all of you!!!  I know the disase is always on  our mind but we are SURVIVORS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n \n \n \n \n ",

He really tries to be there for me.  He's cleaned the house and cooked most meals, washed most of the clothes since April 19th when I had mast. and then thru the chemo.  DH's get upset because it's not them and they really want to do more and they are limited.  They're not GOD....I know they mean well - they want to make this go away and they can't.  Oh well, enough defending the men.  Hang in there girl!!!  You are a survivor!!!!
