    "Content": " I'm a new member and don't know what I am doing but this topic is similar to the one that concerns me in that I had my annual mammogram done a couple of weeks ago and I got the call that I needed to do a second mammogram and US.  Went last Friday and had this done and was told by the radiologist that I had 3 cysts -- 2 were simple and 1 is septated (sp?) and to schedule another US in 6 months.  That's it?!!  What should be my next step?  I haven't a clue.  Thanks for any help.
