    "Content": " Nulasta, I was told I had to have the shot in order for them to give the Chemo every two weeks instead of three. Of course the shot is $6,000 so they must be making a bundle on it. It was my first Chemo treatment AC. I was so sick I ended up in the hospital with a heart rate of 48, severe chest pains, not bone pain, tingling arms, after my heart was checked and rececked I was sent home with WC at 1.0 only to go into the most severe GERD blowup I have ever had. I couldn't even swallow, or eat for about\n 3 days, so they did a scope. No nothing wrong there. I think I will skip that lovely treatment this go around. All it takes is just waiting a little longer between treatments. Nothing could be worse than Nulasta.................Although I am getting better, I still have a sore throat, two weeks after. I really thought I was dying and none of it was bone pain so I bet I too was allergic to the shot. Not worth another chance.. You feel pretty bad when your heart rate is 48 and oh yeh then it shot to 170 in the hospital...No Thanks.\nCray ",
