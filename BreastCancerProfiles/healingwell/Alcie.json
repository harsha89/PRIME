Is it all there?\nI gave up on Femara, couldn't stand the pain. Was switched to Aromasin. Pain was incredibly worse and after three days i got trigger fingers! I've been off all AIs for a couple of months now. I can't use the computer mouse with my right hand, 3 fingers triggering there, one on right, having trouble typing. I'm scheduled for surgery to release trigger fingers next week. I've also been getting spinal injections for sciatica since on AIs. I also have gotten pinched nerves in my neck causing arm numbness.\nI believe if you have preexisting conditions like arthritis the AIs will dramatically make it worse. Just a casual observation. I only have a tiny couple of spots of arthritis in my hands, but have had it in my spine. I didn't have serious problems until starting AIs.\nI'll talk it over with my onc. I like being off everything, but I'm scared silly the cancer could come back or another one could pop up. I printed out your post to study,\n \n ",

      "Content": " I finally just stopped taking any of the AIs, with the unenthusiastic OK from my oncologist, whom I have stopped seeing. The last one, Aromasin gave me such pain that I didn't want to live after only 3 pills. It gave me 3 trigger fingers, which I have just had operated.\nI'm concerned with not taking anything, but I don't tolerate any of them. I would as soon die as suffer horribly like I was doing. \nWhat makes me mad is that the Femara website says that the drug is effective even at 1/5th the dose we are forced to take. I don't believe in one pill fits all. I'm old, don't have much estrogen to begin with, and I am not very heavy. But no matter, I would have to take the same dose as some young person 500lbs. Or nothing.\nI stopped going to the oncologist, not because he was bad, and he was very good, but he was in a clinic that charged me a clinic fee when I got no service but a chair. Medicare doesn't pay for it either! I'd go to another one if I could find one that only charges for an office visit, but all the oncology practices have been bought up by the university and do the same thing.\n \n ",

      "Content": " Bev\nThanks for the support.\nI went to the oncologists office - 2 hours through horrible snow, accidents all over the place, including right in front of me! My BP was a little high by the time I got there.\nI told the onc I couldn't tolerate more than taking Femara every other day and even that was making life not worthwhile living. No, I way not suicidal! But the Femara pain was getting as bad as the Arimidex pain, which I refused to take after only a month. So he put me on Aromasin. I was so exhausted after 1 1/2 hours driving home that I just collapsed and got the pills the next day.\nFirst Aromasin pill was nearly as bad as the first Arimidex, which caused me to pass out. I had headache, severe nausea (scarey because I can't vomit since stomach surgery to pull my stomach out of my chest after car wreck), horrible muscle cramps in thighs, chest pain, and severe dizziness from low blood pressure to the point where I couldn't get off the couch long enough to get a phone across the room to call for help.\nSecond pill, today, much better taken with a large breakfast. Nausea a couple of hours later, but tolerable, dizziness, severe tinnitus which hasn't stopped, but other symptoms better. I'm hoping the muscle pain from the Femara will eventually subside, but this one can cause pain too. At least I have not had to take Vicodin for 2 days! :)\nI've been informed of two reliable (according to people who have used them) places to get cheaper meds: Xubex.com in FL and Alldaychemist.com. I simply can't get help, because I am on Medicare, so I'm going to buy my meds wherever I have to. I'll try out Aromasin from my local pharmacist first for a month to see if it's any better.\nAlternative is tamoxifen, but I have all my pieces-parts, and stroke and heart attack run in the family, so that is a fair-size risk. But I won't just keep taking pain meds for whatever life I have left!\n \n ",

By the time the real approval or refusal comes in, maybe 2 weeks later, the tests have been run and the patient may be in for an unpleasant surprise.\nYou can't make much of an impact complaining to your insurance. I've tried. Your doctor can appeal the decision for you though.\nOne thing you can try if insurance doesn't cover something is to talk to the billing department and ask if they will accept as payment what the insurance would have covered if you pay it right away. They like it lots better than taking $20 a month or so. This often comes out to 60% savings. Borrow the money somewhere and pay the bill off if you can get this kind of deal. \n \nWe need to complain to our legislators to stop this insurance company practice.

He's doing blood work every 3 months. My Dx was just old lady IDC with a low oncotype, rads only, but I didn't tolerate any of the hormone-reducing meds, so I have to just hope nothing shows up again.\nI sure hope they caught yours before it really went anywhere. Can you talk to your oncologist about\n your anxiety? If not, maybe your family doc would help you. There's an anxiety forum here too.\nBest wishes! ",

Onco score's for chemo, not for Aromatase inhibitors anyway. \nDon't be afraid of TRYING the meds!!! Most women do fine with them or have mild side effects. I probably didn't do well because I didn't have much estrogen to reduce in the first place. I'm a senior, had estrogen tested years ago, found very low then, was put on estradiol, which probably caused the cancer.\nI'm saying that if your score is low, and you don't tolerate ANY of the meds - Arimidex was the first I tried and lasted 3 months - it's a choice to not take them at all. I chose to risk a recurrence and be able to get out of bed. \nFemara was by far more tolerable for me - you might ask the doc about\n that one. See if you can research tolerances.\nAromasin, after only 3 pills, gave me trigger fingers. It was so bad I needed surgery in 3 fingers after trying everything for several months.\nTamoxifen was absolutely no better. I can't see why they say there is any difference. I could tell it was hitting me hard after the first pill. I really tried, but it just wasn't worth living crippled up with super-arthritis symptoms.\nI'm scared, but rationalizing I've had a life.\n \n ",

I've looked at some of those and they all turned out to be completely off base for my symptoms.\nI would ask for another consultation to get things explained or maybe a referral to another doctor for the cough or the anxiety.

I didn't tolerate ANY of the aromatase inhibitors. Femara was the best, but still made me feel like a 99 year old with unbearable arthritis. 3 pills of Aromasin gave me trigger fingers, needed surgery last summer. I haven't completely gotten over the arthritis-like effect of the AIs, and it's been over a year since I stopped the last one. My oncologist said I could just quit the inhibitors. Then I had to leave him because he moved too far away. \nI haven't seen anyone for a year and a half. Having trouble finding anyone not connected with the local hospital which has bought up all the oncology practices and charges a \"clinic fee\" on top of my insurance - for an office visit. My ins co told them they can't do it and it's in the contract they signed, but they do it anyway. They threaten to send me to collections and ruin my credit if I don't pay. I can't be the only one who has this problem, but nobody's doing anything about\n them.\nI only get 1 check a year, from my gynecologist. I'm concerned but not hysterical. I'm not going back to the AIs.\nIf you check the Femara website, it says it's effective at 1/5 the dose given. There is no choice of doses though.

Will a doctor prescribe something that is not an approved dose?\nRight now I don't even have a medical oncologist. I stopped going to the really good one I had because he sold out his practice to the big name hospital here and got moved to a dumpy little hospital another hour away from where I was going. Also the big hospital's system of billing is to make the patient pay a \"facility fee\" for sitting in their chairs, just because the practice/office is within the hospital now. I had no services, no blood drawn, no treatment. My insurance went to bat for me, but I still had to pay it because I was threatened with collection and ruining my credit. I'm supposed to have all the bills sent to the insurance now, because under the contracts the clinics can't charge me this fee, but I am not sure it's going to work. Since ALL the oncology practices are now in one of the two big name hospitals or their outlying clinics, the billing is the same.\nSo I'm dithering about\n finding a new oncologist. It's a big pain to have all the records copied and sent to a new one - before I even know if I want stick with him or her.\nI'm still suffering from pain and arthritis-like effects, even after 3 trigger finger surgeries, all brought on by these estrogen suppressors. It takes me a couple of hours to get my right hand usable in the morning - stretching in hot water, pain pills ...\n \n ",

Versed doesn't do anything for pain, just makes you forget. (They'll probably lie and say just something to make you relax) Fentanyl always makes me vomit for 8 hours after a procedure.

      "Content": " MK\nYes, I have other healthissues: fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis in spine only with radiculopathy, 5 month ago operation for stomach shoved into chest from car wreck, which caused severe pain in wrist (continuing) from radial artery line. No mastectomy or chemo, just rads which caused axillary cording (cooked the lymphatic system on left side). I only had old lady IDC, so no reason for mastectomy. Lumpectomy = biopsy. One node - negative, oncotype only 7.\nActually the radiation caused some bad effects that are continuing: I had extreme pain and nausea requiring meds, and my blood counts dropped. This was because it was left side and the rads were hitting the ribs and the stomach. I nearly stopped, probably should have, 2/3 of the way through it. The last day I couldn't even drive myself to treatment, had to ask my DIL. The pain mostly went away after about\n 3 months, but I still have low white count a year later. I'm told it is likely permanent. \nIt truly is the aromatase inhibitors causing the increase in pain. It just got worse a little at a time over months while I was on Femara. I keep a detailed journal and that's clearly when pain started getting unmanageable. The stomach operation was healed after 4 months, off Vicodin after a couple of weeks. I have had fibro for years and pain was manageable until starting the estrogen-removing meds. I don't think a fibro-flare would last this long, although it certainly is a co-morbid condition. I didn't have much estrogen to start with, being post-menopausal for 20 years. But nobody measures what we're starting with and there's no dose difference for that or size or weight. I didn't have severe problems with my hands until starting Aromasin.\nNow, after a week off Aromasin, I feel no better. My hands still feel like advanced arthritis, but I don't have any there. I take tramadol and neurontin when I get up (crying all the way to the kitchen) and wait for an hour for them to start working. They help with the muscle pain, but not the tendons and joints. I've tried adding Clinoril and Tylenol, but that's not giving additinal relief either. \nMy fear is that if I go back on the Aromasin I will just continue to get worse. I suspect, from not having any luck with remission of symptoms after stopping, that the pain syndrome is permanent and I will be totally incapacitated if I keep on taking it.\n \n ",

Most posts I have read with similar complaints are from women over 40 - old enough to have a touch of arthritis which is not causing symptoms.\nMy tumor markers came back \"normal,\" so my med onc said the AIs will only give me minimal benefit, and it's \"up to me\" to decide if I want to try again.\nI'm looking for opinions from others. Given that my oncotype was only 7, no chemo, did the rads, minimal benefit (but he wouldn't give me a number, although I suspect it's less than 5%), what would you do? It is possible that I would tolerate Femara if I went back on it, because I found that part of my problem was a low D level.\n \n ",

But I'd probably be splitting pills or something. \nI did find out from my medicare PPO that I should have all bills for \"facility fee\" sent to them so they can refuse to pay and tell the hospital they can't bill me either.

I can't understand how something you can feel doesn't show up on mammogram, ultrasound or MRI!\nI'm suspecting, after some cursory reading, that it just might be the suggested (above) pseudolump, maybe from fat necrosis. A cyst should have shown up on tests. I think it was first there shortly after the (single) lymph node removal (clean) and the radiation \"therapy.\" I had methylene blue dye, which is noted for causing fat necrosis - which a webpage says may be a cause of pseudolumps. They're also supposedly caused by radiation. (I refused tats but got 3 permanent blue spots from the dye anyway.) Areola shrank to half or less thickness, nipple is hiding in there somewhere. I also got axillary cording from the rads. So pseudolump sounds reasonable. It's definitely not hard or immovable, so chance of being benign is higher.\nIf there's any change you can bet I'll squawk! There's no reason for any fuss about\n how to find it for a biopsy since it's near the surface and can be felt.\nIf anybody else has suggestions I'll look up anything I have to.
