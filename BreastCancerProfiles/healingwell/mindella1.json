    "Content": " So my obgyn found a lump a year ago in my right breast, she sent me for a mammogram, they said it was OK. My primary doctor sent me for a ultrasound, they said it was a fluid filled cyst. My doctor wanted me to biopsy it to be sure but I decided not to. Went back in for a yearly mammogram and just got a call back. I go in Monday for diagnostic mammogram and a ultrosound for the same lump that hasn't moved a year later. Has anyone ever heard of this? To cyst stay that long in the same place? My mom is freaking out cause my grandma passed away in her 50's from breast cancer. I'm only 35 in case anyone was wondering. ",
