    "Content": " I had invasive lobular cancer with no lymph node involvement. I had a partial mastectomy and radiation for 7 weeks. I am old enough for the aromatase inhibitors but I had awful side effects. I am on Tamoxifen. don't like it but I will continue to take it. I have nausea everyday so they gave me Zofran to take when needed. I am grateful for 2 yrs cancer free next month. ",
