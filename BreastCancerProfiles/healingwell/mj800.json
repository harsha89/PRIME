      "Content": " I am scared to death.... So, many women that I have talked to say that the steriotopic breast biopsy is painful. A friend even told me that she knew someone that something horrible happen too. She said that her friend had a stereotactic biopsy done on her left breast, she said as with all women the doctors lied and told her friend that she would not experience any pain durring the procedure. To make a terribly long story short. The woman went in to get the procedure done not even fearing any pain. The person performing the test would not listen to her when she was experiencing pain, the woman began to yell and scream...The person did not stop the test. Then the woman begged and pleaded the woman was in so much pain she began to kick her feet and move her arms. The person performing the test began to raise his voice, and stuck and grinded out more tissue again, she begged and pleaded to stop, they wouldn't the pain became so imbarrable that she lunged off of the table ripping her breast with the introdrucer. She was in horrible pain and then had to under-go plastic surgery on her breast. Even before I heard this about\n this woman I had nightmares that this is what would happen to me, I have called the hospital, the surgeons office repeadly to get them to understand that my fears are not that of a normal person, I suffer from fibromyalgia, chronic fatique syndrom, bi polar disorder, panic attacts and severe anxiety, and depression disorders. I have a 0 pain tolerance, and 0 tolerance for doctors who lie and say a procedure is not painful. omg, I am terrified of this procedure, I have not slept in 3 days, I have not eaten in 3 days, and I have had my heart pounding against my ribs so hard it hurts, I know you might think I am just a chicken, NO I am The chicken, In past procedures I have become terrified and vilent on those who were just trying to do their jobs, I have injured my self and others In panic attacks. I am scared that I am going to loose what is left of my mind before they take me away to torture me Friday. My husband is fearful that I will black out again and this time injure myself on that table.....If I could only be able to see what they were doing would be so much better.. I am terrified not one person (who actually went through this procedure has told me anything good about\n it.)Â has told me this procedure. The doctors are refusing to put me out, and even the radiologist is not even wanting to perform the test on me unless they sedate me somehow. can someon out there please help don't lie to me, tell me the truth if you were in pain, or if you were in no pain. Please don't lie to just help me like the medical staff is doing to me.\n ",

      "Content": " Here I sit 2 - 3 weeks later. All I can think about\n is that I have to get this test done. I wish I could just do it but I know that I can't I tried, I tried with all my might. Now I am seriously loosing my mind, my doctor refuses to see me, my insurance has ran out. I have called ever hospital in the state to be put under for this and still to no avail. I am so desperatley depressed and feel so alone. I guess I might as well face it, I am going to die if this is what the doctor fears it is. I don't understand how they can threaten me not to be my doctor and tell me it is my fault, I can not control my panic disorder. I even spoke to a professional of mental health he was not helpful either. I guess I am doomed with this thing of just not knowing what those calcifications are. No one will help me with my problem, they just act like it is no big deal to get the procedure for me it was the most traumatizing medical experience I have ever had. It was painful and hurt and they hadn't even got the giant thumb size needle in that was just them laying me there not numbing enough and slicing into me, and acting like nothing to it. I don't get it. How on earth do women go through that and say it wasn't that bad. Well, I never did know how women live through having babies either. My low pain tolerance, and fear of dying durring childbirth also lead me to never having kids. Thank goodness I didn't they too would have been plagued with my low tolerance for pain, and fear of procedures. Sometimes I wish I was not even here. ",

      "Content": " Well, I have talked to what seems like a million places that performs stereotactic breast biopsies. I have talked to many nurses who have have actually shared the fact that some women do experience horrible pain with this procedure. Many of which say that they themselves would never do the stereotactic procedure they would just go straight for the \nopen biopsy where they can be put out. One nurse even kept my number and called me from her cell phone to warn me that this procedure is definatley not for everyone, that there are other things that can be done. Another nurse told me it really does matter who is performing the test, and that person needs to be one who cares of your discomfort, so that they are ready and willing to administer more of the numbing agent, she also went on to say that there are certain people that she will not assist with procedures because they do not care how bad a patient is hurting. Any way I did find a place but it is a 36.5 hour drive from Ohio that does offer IV consious sedation for the stereotactic biopsy. There website goes on to say that they do that because they care about\n there patience and what there pain levels. More places need to be like that, caring about\n the whole person how they feel, there fear and anxiety about\n the procedure and there results. They also give you your result in as little as 2 days. Longest being 3. I hope to contact them Monday and share more of what they say. ",

Terrified but not alone. My doctor comfirmed to me today he will no longer be my physicean. My husband said write Dr. Phil maybe he can get you a doctor who will put you out. So, I just wrote to him, that would be awsome and a relief if Dr. Phil would help me out with this. Because again today I spent the entire day on the phone looking for a doctor or surgeon who would give me general anestisia. Oh, I know my spelling is way off, sorry I can't think it has be 3 days since I slept or ate anything. Well, Hope some out there can help me. ",

      "Content": " Well, I called the surgeon who ordered the test, and requested some kind of sedation, he refused and passed the buck back to my family doctor. My family doctor knowing my history listened to me, and prescribed me something for pain durring the procedure and he prescribed me 2 mg. of adivan. I went to the hospital friday to get the test done. I was scared but willing to get it done. The lady who I had previously talked to on the phone told me she would be the one performing the test and would be sure to keep me numb. I tried to explain to her that I experience pain like no one I know. That when I go to the dentist just to have my teethe cleanedn I have to have severel numbing shots just to have that done, and to some degree it would still hurt. So, anyway I got on the table that lady was there, then all the sudden this man comes in, He plopps himself done real hateful like and says do you have any questions? I said no, because the lady had answered all my questions all week on the phone. The lady came back in the room, and the man went down below me and started cleaning the area to be tested. I was nervous, and I could feel my breast in the compression but that did not really bother me. Then he began to give me a numbing shot it burned sooooooo bad that my eyes were watering, I said to me omg, that burns so bad, what the hell, the woman put her hand on my back and said the burnning will go away in just a moment, then I still laid there and then I felt him begining to cut me, I screamed and I said no no no I am not numb yet please I feel that. So, then he gave me a little tiny bit more of the numbing shot, it burned it hurt I could feel it coursing through the area, then I said that hurts I know you are cutting me I can feel it, you have got to get me numb, and I was in such pain it felt like a razor blade and it was burning so bad, then the lady put her hand on my back and i heard some vaccuum sound then I felt a horrible pain, and came up off the table screamming. I fell off the bed into the floor hurting my knee and my back, and I was screamming the whole time. I felt like I was in a hitler torture chamber, them dumb azzes were going to continue that test and me telling them I felt everything and how horrible it was. I was just like that woman said a nightmare the only thing is I came off the table in time, or at least they removed the needle in time withouy ripping my breast \nopen.\n ",

      "Content": " now, get this ladies, I got a call from my doctors office the other day. He is now refusing to be my family physician if I do not get either the \nopen biopsy, or the stereotactic procedure done....OOOOHHHH, anyway he says he has searced high and low for a doctor willing to do the procedure with me under general anestsia but no doctor or surgeon, radioaligist will do it.... But, here is a flare in my azz... I called to make an appointment (a false one for my husban to get a testical biopsy and told all the hospitals in the area that we were doing the calling because we just wanted to make sure that he could be put out for the procedure) They said that wont be a problem, he can choose either local or general anestsia for his procedure.....Could some body tell me is there a medical reason why a woman can't be put out but a man has the choice. \nMy doctor wont see me no more because he says I am gambling with my life choosing death over life. I tried to explain to him I don't control these panic attacks if I did I all out would not have them, and I can't help that my body feels everything even with lidocain or what ever that was, it wasn't enough at all. So, really to me I think the medical field gives a man the choice to be put out so he may choose life, because not all men would do that awake. But, I guess I am not as good a man. I must die because I refuse to be tortured awake. ",
