      "Content": " I too was just told I have a 6mm nodule in my left breast. I am 48 years old and have had yearly mammograms since I was 40. My sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 last year and had a double mastectomy. We do have a family history and because of this I am considered \"high risk\" and receive yearly MRI's and mammograms. My MRI picked up a 6mm nodule in my left breast. The mammogram did not pick this up. I was called back for an ultrasound for a better look. The ultrasound could not detect the nodule as it is deep within the breast and so small. Radiologist has suggested a wait and see approach. He doesn't think its anything and says I would do more harm than good doing anything at this point. I have an appointment with my doctor next week and will discuss with her. \nPlease don't get too worked up about\n this. I know its hard, trust me! The fact that its so small is good. Have your imaging done and then go from there. 9 out of 10 call backs turn out to be nothing. Good luck and please let us know how things work out. ",

      "Content": " I too had a burning and pulling sensation in my left breast. I started having mammograms and ultrasounds in my late thirties. I had non malignant nodules in two areas of my breast. These nodules were checked every 6 months for about\n three years. After three years I thought it was pointless to put me through all this stress. Out they went and I don't have to think about\n them any more. ",
