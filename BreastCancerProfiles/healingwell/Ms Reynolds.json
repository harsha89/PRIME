      "Content": " Not sure if i'm spelling that right.  A year after my surgery, chemo and radiation - my arm and hand started swelling.  I went to place recommeded by my onc where they would work on the arm/hand by gently pushing towards my shoulder adn also gently massaging my other lymph node areas.  They would then wrap my hand and arm very tight and with about\n 5 bandages.  It was so painful.  i stopped going (it was a 2 hour apt five days a week!) and decided that it really wasn't making much of a difference.  \n \n ",
