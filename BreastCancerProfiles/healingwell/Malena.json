    "Content": " Hi,\n I'm a 44 year old woman and for the past month i've been having really strong shooting pains on my right breast. I recently went to the doctor because I also started leaking small amounts of blood mixed with some clear liquid. My doctor has been pressing the liquid out by hand. But ever 3 days I end up going back to get the same treatment because the pain comes back and this time with fevers. \nThe doctors told me it's just cysts. But now I think it's spreading to my left breast. What's wrong with me?\nLillian ",
