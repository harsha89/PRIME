      "Content": " I had a mammogram on August 26th. Yesterday I missed a call and got a voicemail asking me to call the breast center. I called today and they told me I need to come back in for a 2nd mammogram which would take 1.5 hours. The lady told me the Dr would be there to go over my results straight afterwards. I've just turned 40 and this is my 2nd mammogram. (My first was back when I was in my mid-20s when I had suspicious leaking from my breast which turned out to be nothing.) The woman I spoke to today didn't tell me if they had found anything, just that I should try not to worry. \nNow, here's why i'm worrying. I'm due to leave the country on September 9th. When I told the woman this she said she had to speak to her supervisor. She then came back on the phone and told me they could fit me in on Friday. \nAm I right to start panicking or should I try to relax? Could it just be that they have no previous mammogram to compare this one to? I'm a bit of a pessimist so of course I'm now thinking the worst and worrying about\n my 2 small children. ",
