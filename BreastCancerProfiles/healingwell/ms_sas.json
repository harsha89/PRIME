      "Content": " I have a consult with a Dr at the breast clinic in a few weeks - but i am looking for advice from people who know what these \"words\" mean and would like to know if i should be worried.. if i should request a biopsy, any information you can give me.\nIm 37 and went in for my 1st mammogram. They called me back for \"asymmetric densities in the bilateral breasts\". I went back, they did several more films, then had me wait, then called me back in for an ultrasound right then. They ultrasound tech said she saw a cyst.. ok, not a huge deal.. but when i went to Dr the next week and asked for the report, apparently there was another spot i wasn't told about\n then.\nThis is what the report says:\nAdditional spot compression and lateral views of the right breast demonstrated sub centimeter circumscribed masses in the right central upper and right central lower breast. Additional spot compression and lateral views of left breast demonstrated sub centimeter circumscribed masses in the left medial lateral breast.\nPhysical performed focused ultrasound of the right breast at the 12 o'clock position demonstrated a 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.5 cm simple cyst. Focused ultrasound of the right breast at the 6 o'clock position demonstrated a 0.8 x 0.3 x 0.9 circumscribed, heterogeneous mass with both hyper and hypo-echoic components but without increased vascular flow. Focused ultrasound of the left breast and the 3 and 9 o'clock positions was negative.\nImpression:\nProbably benign findings. BI _ RADS category 3\nFollow up bilateral mammography recommended in 6 months.\nSo - its the second mass im freaked out about\n. I know its small.. but if it has both components it means its not just a cyst right? and heterogeneous means made of different materials correct? And just because there isnt INCREASED vascular flow.. that doesn't mean its NOT malignant right? So what else could it be? just a fatty mass? fibrous? and PROBABLY benign.. thats not good enough for me! We could take care of this NOW if theres something wrong thankyouverymuch! ;-)\nany experiences, advice.. good or bad please. Should i ask that it be biopsied?\nThank you! ",

      "Content": " Thanks for responding Bev - \nI'm not even really worried about\n the first one.. are you saying they can do FNA on the second one too? \nI have heard its \"slow growing\" - but isn't that a double edged sword when your told \"lets wait and see\"? What if its growing so slow that there isn't enough of a change in 6 months for them to be concerned then either? At what point do I say, you can't tell me its a cyst.. then what is it?? If I'm overeacting.. please, tell me. I just feel like they are looking at me like \"ok your young, no family history, so make room for the people that really have BC and see ya in 6 months.\".\nKnow what I mean? ",
