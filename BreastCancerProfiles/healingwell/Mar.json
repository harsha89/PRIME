    "Content": " Just had a mammogram Monday and got \"the call\" this morning that they need to have me back for additional views. I'm going already tomorrow but I'm really freaking out. I had this happen a couple of times before and it is so anxiety producing. I just lost my husband to cancer 6 weeks ago & the stress I'm under is incredible. I'm sick to my stomach right now and can't function. I thought this digital mammography was better at not having people come back for 2nd rounds. I saw a thread on here about\n others having this and I know they were very scared too. Any one know about\n dense breasts and repeat mammogram? ",
