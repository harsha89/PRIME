I thought it shouldn't have been said myself. Hard choice of words to hear. Thank you for your comment, I appreciate your input. ",

      "Content": " Im having a liver biopsy in the morning and a nervous wreck because they say I cannot be sedated. I have such anxiety over procedures do I'm taking four 1mg Atavins. I was d. With Invasive Ductal Carcinoma 3-12-13, had chemo, in June a PET scan showing all the cancer qas gone, bilateral mastectomy 7-19-13, more chemo and finished Radiation 12-16-13. Went to the dr for a yearly physical and metioned for the heck of it that I had experienced what I thought was basically heartburn about\n 4 times in maybe a years time where laying on either side was not real painful but uncomfortable. 6-7 Rolaidss helped. He suggested checking my Gallbladder and while they were at it checked my kidneys, liver, and everything else with an Ultrasound. That showed spots on my liver. I then had a CT showing the same, then my Oncologist ordered a PET which showed swollen nodes around my pancreas and in my chest as well as the spots on my\nLiver. I asked if he thought it was cancer and he said without a biopsy we don't know but with my history they can assume so. He said not to have the mind set that it's nothing but don't think I'm going to die but \"hope for the best and prepare for the worst\". Not very encouraging I didn't think. I told him I just didn't think something would pop up so soon, less than 3 months after treatment ended, especially as great as I feel. He said hopefully that's a good sign that if it is anything hopefully it was caught early and can be treated. any similar stories from anyone? Thanks in advance! ",
