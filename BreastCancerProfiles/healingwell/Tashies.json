    "Content": " Hi my mum found a lump in her breast 3years ago she had a ultrasound done and they said it was a fat lump a week ago she went back to the doctors because her breast had swollen up and was painfully to touch they done another ultrasound and biopsy and found it to be cancerous does this mean it has been cancer the whole time or could it have just recently turned cancerous??? I'm hoping it's been caught early as she is a new grandmother to two beautiful grand children ",
