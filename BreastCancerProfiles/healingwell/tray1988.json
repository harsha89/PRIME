      "Content": " hi..just trying to figure out this report. \nWondering if I should followup before 6 months..\nFINDINGS: Multiple sonographic images of the left breast show a \nhypoechoic focus just below the skin surface at the 1 to 2 o'clock \nposition which measures 1.1 x 0.7 cm. It demonstrates posterior \nenhancement, has a slightly irregular wall. This is compatible with a \ncomplex cyst. Mammographic findings also suggest a benign lesion. \nIMPRESSION: Probably benign findings. Recommend a six-month left \nbreast diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound. BI-RADS 3. ",
