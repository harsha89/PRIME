      "Content": " jennyj89,\nUnbelieveable! Your story sounds near exactly like mine, DCIS Stage II, 14 nodes removed, 4 positive, though mine happened in 2002. \nMy incision site from the Tram Flap reconstruction has \nopened up, not once, not twice but three times now, in the last 9 years or so. While under initial chemo, I became diabetic, so I attributed the \nopen, non-healing wound to the diabetes - and I did not want to hear it from my doctors, so I covered it up, applied 1st aid antibiotic creams and watched what I ate. By some miracle, it did close - but then \nopened up again a few years later. This time, I went to the plastic surgeon that did the Tram Flap reconstruction. \nSame story as yours, Jenny. Last year, they debrided the wound, removing scar tissue, fat necrosis and any part of the Marlex mesh that was affected by the MRSA (which they tell me was \"community born\" - in other words, I introduced the infection, myself). The incision healed well, with the aid of a wound vac (read as torture device). \nI would like to know how Jenny has done since, because less than a year went by and I again noticed my wound was going to \nopen up again. So again, I went to the plastic surgeon before it \nopened. I do wish he had taken a sample of the fluid that I knew was going to be eventually seeping from through this \"bubble\", soon. To late, it \nopened up before he could attend to it. Plastic surgeon plans to clean the wound out - at their own surgical center. Praying there is not need for a wound vac. :(\nMember - GMA, I have written down the websites for the information on the sutures. I hope that I can still access the article. I had feared that the mesh used in the procedure was a problem, as we are hearing so much about\n on TV (law offices looking for patients willing to sue someone). ",

      "Content": " As an 11 year survivor, I feel quite blessed to be here to ask this.   Tram Flap reconstruction at the time of modified radical mastectomy.   Has anyone who has had this procedure done, endured post surgical wounds that \nopen up for no apparent reason?  This has happened to me at least 3 times now in the last 8 or 9 years.  1 yr ago, the surgeon went in an debrided the wound, removed scar tissue and affected plastic mesh.  A wound vac was applied to remove any last possible MRSA (yes, an infection had developed after the surgical site \nopened up).   The surgical site healed beautifully and I had high hopes that this would never happen again.  Well, 1 year later, it has.  I am again dealing with an \nopen wound, trying to keep it from being infected.",

      "Content": " As to the necessity of Tamoxifen - no. There are more approved drugs out there that are better - expensive, but so much better - that is if one can consider any chemo, a good thing.\nA modified radical mastectomy, after a stage 2/3 positive diagnosis, and immediate reconstruction, I was put on Tamoxifen from mid 2002 to nearly the end of 2005. Depression was my biggest side effect - like big time. Not suicidal yet, but it was horrible. I was switched to the newly approved Aromasin (pronounced Aroma-sin), and have been taking that for the last 8 years. \nSo my advice to either of you, would be to talk to your doctor and if they have not yet switched you to something else, make sure that they do. Tamoxifen is nasty. Oh, and many people that opt for Aromasin are given the generic - although it has the same active ingredient, I had bad reactions to the supposedly inert ingredient that makes up the pill (body and muscle aches throughout).\nI can not believe they still give anyone Tamoxifen. Must be cheap? ",

      "Content": " Nelliemae, Tamoxifen is nasty! Depression after being on it for a little over two years (mid 2002 to eary 2005). Cried a lot and just lost interest in things I loved most. I still did them, but my heart was not in it.\nThey switched me to a newly approved drug in 2005. Aromasin (pronounced Aroma-sin). Expensive, but so much better than the Tamoxifen. My mail order pharmacy decided to put me on the generic version when it became available, muscle pain and body aches made me go back to the brand name because of this reaction to the generic's filler. I still take the Aromasin, but am hoping the next visit, doc takes me off it it altogether.\nGood luck. ",
