    "Content": " Five days ago our 14 y.o. daughter told me she had a painful lump in her left breast (slight redness, no nipple discharge, no fever, questionably an extremely slight inverted nipple). Her ultrasound today showed a 1.5 cm complex cyst. The radiologist recommended a follow up u/s in 1 month and if the cyst hasn't changed in size or has gotten larger then would do a needle aspiration. She assured me it's not unusual for a 14 yr old to have a cyst and doesn't want to put her through the ordeal of an aspiration unless absolutely necessary. I appreciate that but am still concerned about\n postponing an aspiration on the chance that it may be cancerous. Does anyone have information or experience with a teen girl developing a complex cyst? Thanks for any insight. ",
