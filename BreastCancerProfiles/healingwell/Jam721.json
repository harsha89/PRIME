      "Content": " I really want to talk to someone that is Stage 4. I need to know things that only they can help with. I am trying out my 3rd chemo regiem. My doctor is going to re-scan me in January to see if the chemo is making a difference. My liver is like a spotted easter egg and that is the biggest concern. I still have my tumor in my right breast and they don't want to do any surgery until my liver is all clear. If you know of anyone who is willing to talk to me that would be great. Thanks! ",

      "Content": " I'm trying to remain positive for my family's sake if nothing else. I was told today during chemo treatment that they are going to retest me the first week of November to see if anything has changed. I'm weirded out by it because I wasn't suppose to be tested until January. My doctor is really worried about\n the neuropthy in my hands, feet, and leg. Everything feels like its alsleep. I'm on the maximum dose of neurotin already and it isn't helping. Thanks for responding so quickly. It means alot. ",
