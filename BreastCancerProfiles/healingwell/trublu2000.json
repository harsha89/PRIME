      "Content": " Hi MK and everyone,\nI am doing okay. Finally finished with my reconstruction, got the tattoo in Sept and final appt with the PS was in November.\nMy DH is now retired so day to day life has changed quite a bit but mostly for the good(smile). I saw my onc last week and all\nwas well, one more year on tamoxifen and then we will see where we go there. Beleive it or not April will be 5 years since\nDX, June 5 years since surgery! I finally bought new bras in November to fit my new breasts, I went from a DD to a C, so that was a adjustment mentally but I am okay now.\nSo much sadness this year on the board and still so much suffering, I lurk frequently but really don't know what to say most of the time. The post about Rozanne and her bladder problem really caught my eye because I have suffered big time with for years along with my fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. Not sure if anyone currently on the board suffers from those or not. I have been helped by Pilates I take private sessions with a wonderful instructor who also gives private massages at her home.\nI'll keep in touch. Take care all and God bless.\nLove,\nTru ",
