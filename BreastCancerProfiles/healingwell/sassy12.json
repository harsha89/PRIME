      "Content": " I have been finding so much comfort here the last few weeks. You all have such kind and loving words for each other, it brings tears to my eyes. I will turn 38 this month and what began as a baseline mammogram before breast implants ( a dream of mine forever!) Has turned into a nightmare. I was called back 3 times for repeat mammograms and 2 US. Yesterday I had a stereotactical and core done on right breast. I was told a small lump was found as well as a cluster of calcifications 3mm! I feel awful today, sore, bleeding and ever so scared for the results. Weekend now and I'm not sure how soon I will hear. Do all clusters turn out to be some form of cancer or pre cancer? Im more worried and theses than the small lump. ",

      "Content": " Bev, \nThank you for responding. I don't know when I will hear results. I hope Monday, but I'm trying not to get my hopes up that it will be tomorrow. I don't even know what to expect on who or how I will be told results!? If its bad news I wonder if my Dr will tell me over the phone, I will know if I'm asked to come in person for apt I will freak out!! \nMy mind has just been spinning thinking this last week (and reading) about\n all the awful things folks all over go through, its amazing how strong people are. We all seem to go along each day in our own little world until something happens. I realize I'm just one of many many women worrying tonight. So kind of you to write me back.\nEmily ",
