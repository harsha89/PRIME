    "Content": " I agree with patsymc. Besides conventional look elsewhere. Take a look at the book, \"Beating Cancer With Nutrition\" by Patrick Quillin. It can be purchased on Amazon for $17. A nutritional approach is a must. \"Sugar Feeds Cancer\" is especially highlighted by Quillin. Starve the cancer is the approach this book takes. ",
