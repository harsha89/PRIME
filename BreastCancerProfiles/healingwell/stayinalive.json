    "Content": " \n  Hi, I am Susan and live outside of Portland, Oregon.  I am 40(until Dec).  Diagnosed  with Inflammatory Breast Cancer Sept 26th 2004.  First line Chemo A/C followed by Taxotere with a double mast on Feb 7, 2005. No recon.  Diagnosed mets to Liver 2/21/05 with 95% Liver tumerous.  Started Herceptin, Carbo, Gemzar(sp)with astonishing results--tumors shrunk 90%.  Mets to Bone 8/05. Started on Navelbine and Herceptin until 3 weeks ago when mouth sores got so bad I needed a break.  I guess I cant complain as this is the first Chemo since the start that has given me any trouble.  Found out on most recent scans that my bones are healing and my liver is regressing as I have active lesions on the right lobe and an increase from 1.1cm to 2.3cm.  Here it goes again.  I am getting set to go on Lapatnib in phase 3 trials.\n \n ",
