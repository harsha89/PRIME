      "Content": " Hi, Two months ago I found a lump in my breast which actually could have been there for a lot longer because for some reason I have never been one to do the monthly self examinations. So I went to the OBGYN, a new one for that matter and told her about\n the lump and explained to her that it could have been there for a lot longer, and that its very painful, sometimes I even have to hold my breast up while I exercise. \nFirst of all, the Doctor lacked compassion and wasn't informative. She never explained any of the possibilities of what the lump could be. She just told me to take 10,000 units of vitamin A for thirty days and come back if it doesn't go away. \"Do all doctors treat breast lumps this carelessly?\" The whole experience made me feel stupid and insecure. I'm left here wondering that I should get a new doctor, not nessacarily because I think that it might be cancer but that I had to research everything myself; cysts, haematomas, fibroadenoma, etc., which by the way I have not found anything, anywhere that says vitamin A gets rid of breast lumps. But, also when she asked me if I used birth control I said \"no\" she laughed at me and said in a really snotty tone \"Are you trying to get pregnant?\" I followed by saying \"no but my partner and I have been together for over seven years and both feel that if we got pregnant that it would be great and also that birth control made me crazy so we both felt it was better for me not to take it.\" She then continued to give me a snotty look and told me that I need to look into other forms of contraception.....Why was she pushing me, isn't that my decision? \nSo, I'm really confused. Why did she have so much judgement? and Why did she not care about\n my lump? Are a lot doctors like this? The reason I had to get a new doctor was because I moved out of state. I'm tempted to call him and talk to him. I'm just looking for someone to talk to. I haven't really discussed this with anyone and I would like some feedback. Thanks! ",
