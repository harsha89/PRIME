    "Content": " TAMOXIFIN...i have been taking it 1.5 months after 7 weeks radiation.  The side effects are life-changing, but there isn't an alternative!  I already went through menopause, and now I get to go through it again.  The anxiety and mood swings are horrible!  And, i am always nauseous.  I am going to a holostic medicine specialist.  I am opposed to MORE prescript\nions to relieve symptoms.  That's how this all started in the first place... HRT after hysterectomy for 8 years, then stopped...then within 3-5 years, breast cancer.  apparently this is pretty text book.\n ",
