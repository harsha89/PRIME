Well, I know that that's not really true. There ARE possibilities, right?\nAnyway, of course, I learn to do the self-examination thing and tried it. I admit that at this time, I still don't know if 'that' is a lump or it's normal. Haha. So, sometimes, I'll be thinking that I felt a lump, then ending up scaring myself with it. =X\nNow, maybe I'll like to ask some questions. (: Note, I'm just curious, all right?
