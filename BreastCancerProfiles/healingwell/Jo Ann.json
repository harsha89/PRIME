Sometimes excessive radiation is mandatory for stage III. You could actually see the tumors growing around my mastectomy site. Unfortunately for me, gangrene did set in and I had to have major surgery to correct it. If it is at all possible, try to have hyperbaric treatments, pure oxygen at a sea level of about\n -45 feet.\nThis healing process is long and just another path on the road to recovery. I was initially given 9 months to live but that was in January of 1996. I know things have improved since then and while it is a very scary situation, you can do it. Just hang in there.\nTender Hugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Apparently, a day or so ago, I scratched my lymphedemic arm just across from the elbow, about\n 1 1/2\" long. It has scabbed over but then, something happened. I don't know if I re\nopened the middle and deepest part of the scratch but suddenly, I was dripping fluid on the desk and the floor. I cleaned it up but then noticed more fluid on the computer chair. I went through a washcloth, 7 compresses and two band aids. It started at about\n 7 last night and must have ended at about\n 4 or 5 this morning. The arm is now softer and I can see wrinkles in it I haven't seen in years. I suspect that the fluid had so much pressure that it broke from the inside out, releasing the pressure and the fluid.\nI have never heard of something like this happening before and I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience. Of course, being a Friday night, there's no doctor available until Monday but I'm hoping that no infection will set it. I am now 13 yrs and 9 years from diagnosis and still the problems just don't seem to go away. However, it's better than the alternative.\nThanks.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

The inspiration it will provide would be priceless.

      "Content": " For our older board members, I'm sure that you can remember that when I had radiation, I was among the \"lucky\" few who had to have double radiation, 6 1/2 weeks of radiation twice a day. Which led to burns, which led to gangrene, which led to surgeries, etc. I always wondered why you could only have radiation to an area once. Since I have had it the dreaded twice, I now know why. Because it will eventually lead to cancer. Needless to say, they do have a point. That's just what the double radiation has given me. I have basal cell carcinoma on the chest wall. Since the area they radiated was so big, the dr says this will probably happen again. So, he did a biopsy but he is an excellent and experienced dr and all he had to do was look at it to know what it was. They're going to call me next week to set up the surgery. \nThen, my right arm is covered in granulara annuloma. He said that this is also common for people who have had cancer. My net research shows it is usually because of diabetes and a suppressed immune system. He also did a big biopsy of one of the areas, hurts like hell, but he thinks it's not cancerous. If it is, I don't know how he'll cut this out. My arm will look like craters on the moon if he does. Anyway, I sent away for Graviola for the cancer and a new, herbal, product for the annulara. There is no medical treatment for it. I'm praying that works.\nFrankly, I'm more than a little sick and tired of going to my grave pieces at a time. I've also reached that stage of grief where I'm angry at Mitchell for leaving me here to face all of this alone. Where is a good man when you really need them. I'll tell you. Dead, that's where they are. I used valium and tylenol 3 to have a right good pity party and now am just disgusted.\nAnyway, I hope everyone else has a nice day. Screw Friday the 13th, Thursday the 12th is worse and there's another one coming up next month. Oh joy.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi from the little house on the prairie but there are no funny stories this time. In fact, I'm thinking about\n getting rip roaring drunk.\nI got sick in mid-June and was in bed to mid-July, not getting any better. Then in the hospital for a week and in bed for another 5-6 weeks. Despite heavy spring-time rains, I got my garden in in May but it didn't matter since I was too sick to take care of it. Then came the typical Texas summer heat and my yard went to Hades.\nAll the while, I am noticing something on my arm that is new. Of course, it is my lymphodemic arm, too. My daughter said I was over-reacting but it kept getting worse. I mentioned it to my new primary dr and he said he didn't like it. He said it had to come out and when he described how he wanted it out, I knew he meant clean margins. The dermatologist he sent me to said they could see me in late Nov. Right, like I want to wait any more.\nA call to my onc sent me to the same surgeon who did the stent in my carotid in 2001. He saw me in less than a week but I didn't realize that he was going to do the surgery right there in his office. That was on the 4th. I've got 5 stitches in my arm and they won't come out until the 19th. That's when he will give me the full path report. However, he left a message for me on the 9th that has the same three words we have all come to abhor. \"You have cancer.\"\nI have two friends who are giving advice but I don't want to do anything until I find out what kind of skin cancer it is. I promised myself I wouldn't look on the net but I did. I waited until last to do melanoma and that's where I found what I had seen on my arm. I also have at least one, and possibly two, more spots coming out. \nThe best thing I can say is that I am disgusted and more depressed than usual. I'm not surprised though. I have heard that the skin never forgets and never forgives. As a Florida sun-worshiping native, it was always in the back of my mind. However, we all know how it feels when it's real.\nI'm in the hurry and wait mode but I have a feeling that the onc already knows what's up and has whatever treatment, if any, planned. That's the way they were with the b/c. I know that things could be worse. I have actually lived 11 years longer than they said I would so I have a lot to be thankful for, 5 grandchildren I wouldn't have seen.\nBut, I do have a bottle of wine calling my name. I can hear it whispering from the kitchen. I said if the b/c came back again, I'd buy a carton of cigarettes and a huge chocolate cake. Screw the coughing and the diabetes. I'm now trying to decide if this new cancer entitles me to them. \nWhat next?\nLove from the Texas prairie, Jo-Ann, planning her pity party.\nAddendum: I just smoked a cigarette I got from my neighbor. That shot 6 1/2 years right to hëll. We can rule out buying a carton. It tasted terrible. I'll wait for tomorrow for the big chocolate cake. I'll get the $3.98 special from WalMart. I know I'll like that.\n \n \n \n \n ",

He says it will burn like the devil but will take care of the cancer. I now have to watch that arm forever and be on the alert\n for other forms of skin cancer. \nHe then went on to move up my CT scan and chest x-ray. The internet says that this Bowen's disease could indicate another cancer. I had to get my port accessed a second time so they could take tumor markers.\nAnyway, I do feel a lot better after seeing him and have the dermatologist appointment on Wed. I still have an appointment with the surgeon on Friday. Instead of removing another lesion, he's going to be removing my port. I cannot believe that we have been together for two months short of twelve years and we are now parting ways. But, we can blame technology for it. It seems there are newer and much better ones that they can put in if I should need another one.\nI'm going to save it, drill a hole in it, and put it on my \"Cancer Sücks\" hat. I'll check back after surgery.\nLove you, Lil Sis, Jo-Ann\nPS - It's November. When does your chemo start?\n \n \n \n \n ",

You know, Joyce, maybe this being out in the middle of nowhere is all it's cracked up to be.

There is also an increase\n in epidermal pigmentation. No dermal invasion is seen. Chronic\n inflammation is present in the dermis.\n End of Pathology Report\n Now, definitions I had to look up:\n Hyperkeratosis - thickening of the skin\n Acanthosis - brown to black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of\n the skin.\n Dyskeratosis - Central displacement, aggregation and condensation of\n tonofilaments within individual cells at all levels of the epidermis.\n Hyperchromatic - Abnormally highly colored, excessively stained or over\n pigmented.\n Pleomorphic Nuclei - Many formed, capable of assuming different shapes.\n I have an appointment three weeks from today to have the second one\n removed from the same arm but there appear to be more popping up.\nTreatment can be our beloved 5FU but applied topically. What luck!\nAnyway, I can no longer go out in the sun without both sunscreen and long sleeves. My daughter-in-law told me today that they sell shirts that repel the uv rays of the sun where she works. Since she gets 25% off, I'll be on my way there before too much longer. \nThanks for hanging with me guys. I'll let you know how this whole thing progresses. I do wonder that if you have 5fu applied topically, will you still lose your hair? \nHow sick can this be? Actually being happy that the cancer you have isn't the worst kind. And, I only had one piece of that chocolate cake and then gave it to my grandchildren. It made my stomach sick. Not the wine though, had no problem with that.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Remember, my doctor-given checkout date was around August of 1996. I feel that it is because of a very dedicated set of doctors and alternative treatments. I'm still having the ct, bone scans and chest x-ray but only once a year now. I see the onc every 6 months. The onc took me off Arimidex in Jan of this year but I'm still on I3C and plan to continue it.\nMK is right that I have all the bad genes from both of my parents and my problems were only hastened by the fight with b/c. But, I was dx'd when I was 48. Two weeks from today, I will be 60 (Oh God!!!). If all that has happened is a six-month extension, most of us wouldn't be here.\nDon't those kids grow fast? My 3-year old granddaughter (that I've had since she was 4 months old) is an absolute hoot. This past week, she looked at me and started singing \"Shakedown, Breakdown, You're busted\". I couldn't stop laughing. Today is my Joseph's 11th birthday. I can still remember running from chemo at one end of the hospital to make the delivery room with 20 min to spare. He is one very precious child to me. \nF the 6 months. Live one day at a time and live it to the fullest. And, oncs need to stop assembly lining their b/c patients. If they treated the patient instead of just the disease by recommendation, I think the survival time would increase rapidly. But, that's just my thinking and it hasn't changed in years.\nAnyway, down from my soapbox.\nLove You, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " from the amplifiers ringing in your head....... They've been ringing in my head for two days now. Good thing Friday was a cave day. I got in so early in the morning and I have discovered it takes longer to recuperate as I get older.\nI wish I knew the words to accurately describe the most wonderful experience I have had since my Mitchell and I went to see Rod Stewart. Bob is older, gray-headed, wears glasses and sings every note like he did 40 years ago.\nKatmandu, Horizontal Bop, We've Got Tonight, Betty Lou's Getting Out Tonight, Against The Wind, Beautiful Loser, The Fire Down Below, Hollywood Nights, Mainstreet, Night Moves, Shakedown, Old Time Rock and Roll, Ramblin' Gamblin' Man, Rock and Roll Never Forgets, Roll Me Away, Travelin' Man, Turn The Page, The Answer's In The Question, Simplicity, and many more I can't remember.\nFrom the moment he \nopened his mouth until he sang his last song, I was totally mesmerized. Well, almost. It is a shame to see that some people are still the complete jack***es they were 40 years ago.\nIn the row ahead of us, in the seat to the right of my son, some woman turns and announces that she intends to stand up through the entire show, (she's waving her second beer now) and there's no one big enough to stop her because she's 6'. Eric, at 6'3\", stands and says he believes otherwise. Throughout the concert, as she kept drinking, she would raise her shirt a little higher all the time. At one point, I told her this wasn't Jerry Springer, she wasn't going to get Bob Seger beads, and drop the shirt. \nNow, ladies, let me discuss the couple sitting right in front of us. It became apparent very early that there had NEVER been an ounce of class in these two. Before the concert even started, he couldn't stand up because he was so drunk. She, however, proceeded to stand up and shake her way through every song. The thing is I've only seen those kinds of movements on slugs when you put salt on them.\nNow, all of us know that beauty is only skin deep and ugly is to the bone and this lady was pure dãmned bone ugly. I swear to you, I haven't seen anyone this ugly since I was about\n 20. Her shape was an absolute rectangle except the butt end was huge. The way she was dancing wasn't recognizable until she began bouncing her head and strutting like a chicken. You had to be there. I wish I'd had some cracked corn. (Pun intended)\nThey were so drunk, they knocked over bottles of beer that I didn't see and soaked my backpack. Then the guy stood up and they were weaving their way through We've Got Tonight while he's moving his hand lower and lower down her you know where. Absolutely no class. I could hear the trailer park calling them from off stage.\nShe and the tall blonde decided to run down to the stage at Seger and the guards had them in a flash. The blonde kept taking pictures after she was warned several times to stop. I really wish to high héll they'd been thrown out. Mind you, they were my age. \nBut, screw the bunch of them. I love Bob Seger, I always have, and I wouldn't let them ruin my good time. He certainly did make me feel younger and also wish I could still do some of the things I used to do. Alas, I can't get drunk at Big Daddy's and sleep on the beach anymore. Concerts aren't held at Pirate's World, the Hollywood Sportatorium or the Miami Baseball Field on beautiful clear days. I don't wear size 7 jeans and wouldn't consider owning a bathing suit today let alone a bikini. I can't stay up all night and work the next day. \nBut I discovered that I have a lifetime of memories to keep me happy. And it's really my time in life to remember when I was \"Like a Rock\" and it's really time to \"Turn The Page\".\nEchos still ringing, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

When taking such chances, use an umbrella.\nMK keeps telling me how Chuck is going to be reseeding the land and has been to the county agent to see about\n it. My first question is \"Why?\". The answer is, of course, so something can live there. Will Chuck's small JD riding mower take care of 34 acres? Hardly. Cows, horses, and some goats will do that just fine.\nI don't know if you know it but MK has a large duck following. She started feeding them from her back yard but as time progressed, they come up as close to the house as they can and quack, waiting for her to come out. How long do you think it will be until they find her? She's got two ponds now so they'll be right at home.\nThere is one little thing that niggles at me. I understood Chuck working on his sail boat for future sailing on the lake. Now, he is taking it up to the outside storage area to continue to work on it. I haven't seen any pictures of MK's ponds but they must be huge. Just remember, MK, gators do live in Texas ponds. (There's already been one caught here in Van Alstyne.)\nI am dying to see the new place when MK's company is gone. She did tell me that she had 40 linear feet of counter space. My response is not printable.\nYou had me laughing so hard my sides ache. I need a nap.\nLove y'all, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Unfortunately, it was also 7 years last week since I lost my Mitchell.\nI'm concerned with my onc because it seems he's pulling back treatment. I have only one week of Arimidex left. He has ordered a colonoscopy and a visit with the brain surgeon before May. If, when they're done, the port isn't needed by either of them, he wants it out. I don't want it out but, since it has shifted, it's somewhat bothersome. \nI think I will still have my yearly tests but I feel rather strange with the mother ship letting me drift out on my own. He thinks it's time to concentrate on the diabetes and weight reduction. Maybe it's time to establish some type of a life for myself.\nNEVER believe the statistics. \nLove to all, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Go Kinky!\nNow, about\n money requests for the elephants and what to do: Everytime I would bake a turkey, my Mitchell always cleaned up tlhe wishbone and kept it in the corner of the kitchen window.\nWhen asked why he would do that, his answer was \"So we don't have elephants in the yard\". Someone would always say, \"But we don't have elephants here\" and he would say \"See, it's working\".\nWell it works better than that, I don't get ANY propaganda or money pleas from Republicans. \nBernadette, you may be the victim of \"chemo brain\". I haven't had a challenge as the \"Chemobrain Queen\" in some time. I am now over ten years out and it doesn't get better. You can find out about\n it on the net. I wrote a poem about\n it some time ago. I will see if I can find it.\nJoyce, you need to stop confusing dumb and stupid with chemo brain and the nature process, CRS. You are NOT dumb, NOT stupid, and if you were, do you think we would let you pilot the PCE? We've had no mishaps and only a chocolate shortage here and there, and you're not responsible for refreshments.\nYour method of telling them you will remember the gas prices before the election, I am going to use that one, if I may. Not that I have anyone to tell it to now but the thought of GWB turns my stomach. We have now degraded to a country where B/C is rampant, treatment and meds virtually unaffordable, but we can treat ED, 98% cure rate of prostrate cancer, and spend millions of OUR money on illegals. Time to get off the soapbox before I get really started.\nSo, Joyce, I have two questions that have nothing to do with any of this. How do you know if sour cream has gone sour? Who was the sob who invented invisible thread? He certainly never had to thread it through a sewing machine needle. (Deep sign)\nAnyway, have a very great day. \nLove you two, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Thanksgiving brought a very rude awakening.\nI finally hooked my 5.1 surround sound up to my pc and spent hours rocking with the new Bob Seger release. I then noticed that the evening's Austin City Limits would feature Van Morrison. Boy, was I excited. I was in my mood for a little \"Brown-Eyed Girl\".\nI got all settled down for a good time when this person on the tv started to sing. Who in the hell is that old man? Where did the jowls to the knees come from? This person had ear hair as long as his regular hair, if even that was his. Why did he have a WC Field's nose?\nAs soon as he \nopened his mouth, aside from noticing the false teeth, I had to sadly accept the fact that this was THE Van Morrison. I found myself becoming extremely critical of him and the band.\nThe drummer would certainly benefit by a trip or two to the Bosley Clinic. The steel guitar player looked like a leftover from Night of the Living Dead.\nThe fiddler player had to be his grandson. All of his children had to be far older than that. This is the first time that I have seen backup singers using sheet music. You have to wonder about\n the obvious senility. Is it CRS, CRAFT, Oldtimer's or Alzheimer's? The keyboard player is so far bent over that he either needs glasses, Lasix, or a back brace.\nHowever, Van can still play a mean sax, eat your heart out Bill Clinton. By the time this show was over, I slowly crept into the bathroom to take an objective look at my face.\nI decided that I needed two valium and a dose of geritol before bed. When did I get so old?\nSmiling at all in my age group, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

It is too smal to PET and too small to biopsy. I was already depressed when I went to his office and I certainly wasn't feeling much better when I left.\nMy onc called that night to ask me if I felt suicidal. I told him I had had better times to do that than now. He also told me, now get this, he had gone down to the department that runs the CT, and asked them to line up all of my scans since 96.\nI already know about\n the tumor on the adrenal, it's been there for years. And, the lung spot has been there for four years. It hasn't changed.

The move to Scotland came about\n 1500 years ago. The name aligned the clan with \"Duncan\". There were two kings of that name but it is thought the leader was the King Duncan murdered by MacBeth. If you ever get to Scotland, you must see MacBeth's castle. Of course, it is haunted. Personally, they couldn't pay me to spend the night in it. In fact, they have a post card that says \"two out of three ghosts prefer Cawdor Castle\". \nAfter the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Robert the Bruce was saved by members of the clan. That night, he said that the sons of Duncan would be now be known as his sons, Robertsons. \nIs that a MacIntosh, Ms Joyce? There is nothing as interesting as a \"Scots\" wedding. I love the pipes and have a lot of recorded music, some thanks to my dear MK. Also, sadly, the pipes always seem to be crying to me when played at a funeral, especially that of a policeman. And, while it is now universal, Amazing Grace is Scots and played by the pipes to bring tears to your eyes. We should have a mini-meet in Edinburgh.\nLove you, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

If any can remember, I posted a lot about\n what I went through in my two-year fight and if I had just posted all of it as I was going through it, I am sure there would be non-believers.\nI am also stunned that Rita no longer posts because she was accused of \"making up\" Denise. I hope that if Rita reads this, she will give us a second chance. I don't anymore believe she made her up than I believe in the Easter bunny and shame on me for not knowing what had happened. \nI don't think Peter should have deleted the post either. It appears to be back and I have answered it. I also defend Peter's reason, he really does watch over us. He has saved us from more than most of us know. I just don't think that this forum needs such a negative post and we should be able to answer it.\nWe are a sisterhood united by faith in each other. If the faith is betrayed, we're big girls and can just jump back into the support of all of our other sisters. We're all united by a deadly disease and have better things to care about\n. Let's go back to the caring and support.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

(I will always keep you special in my heart since we're both Scots and both had the gangrene. I still think we're the only two. LOL) I know the PCE will be on the move for Mar 7. I'll be headed to Mexico that day so Joyce will have to swing south for me. Cruella will bring lots of chocolate for all as she flutters her pink boa. \nAbove all, Di, know that you and our family are in my prayers.

      "Content": " Bernadette, I was bald for almost two years and when it first came back, I didn't know what was happening. I had this light brown whispy statically affected hair. My beautician said she wouldn't cut anything until there was real hair under that. She was right. When she finally cut what I had, there was the most beautiful curly hair. I have never had curly hair in my life and went to great expense to have it permed. Unfortunately, it only lasted for about\n 18 months and then it went back to straight.\nI had gray before I lost it and the one fortunate thing that happened is that less gray came back then left. I had a wig and still have the wig. Here in Texas during a normal summer, it was just too hot to use it. And if it wasn't too hot, the thing was too scratchy. I used it as a wig twice. I used scarves and baseball hats. Today, I am proud to say, that wig is the best ceiling fan cleaner I could want. \nI didn't realize that I hadn't changed the user when I first posted. I'm glad I hadn't done one of my highly inflammatory postings. MK lives too close for me to have her name associated with one of those.\nHugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Everyone usually prefers Thanksgiving or Christmas, but this is the day that I prefer. Gotta make sure that there are no evil spirits around to interfere with All Saint's Day. I'm sure it goes back to my Celtic roots and the Druids.\nAs my daughter so nicely corrected me, it turns out that I have been making Halloween costumes for 40 years. This year, there has been no rush to try to find the kids to measure them. No going to 5 or 6 fabric stores to get just the right item. No cramping my right hand, which has been weak since the strokes, cutting out the fabric.\nNo being up late at night to sew or doing the final fittings which usually kept me busy right up to today. I told my daughter that I just couldn't do that anymore and that I was going to buy the costumes. She said she wondered why I had waited so long.\nThe 3J's and I went internet shopping. Jordan is a little blase about\n her costumes. She's been a belly dancer, Cinderella, and other princess type costumes. This year, she chose Sleeping Beauty. Joseph was a man with a mission. He just had to be Wolfman. Jaidan is too little to know what's up so I got her the Valerie Tabor Smith Ribbon Fairy costume. Frankly, I don't think I could have gotten all the fabric for what these costumes cost me but it was worth it not to have the aggravation.\nThe costumes arrived and the kids were excited. First, Jordan came out and modeled Sleeping Beauty. It is a very nice costume and she loves it. Next came Cruella (Jaidan) and she really does look like a little fairy. The wings are just beautiful.\nThe last to model their costume was Joseph. His costume has the Larry Talbot shirt, wolfman hands, and the most life-like mask. The teeth are made out of resin and it looks so real. Joseph comes out to model while giving out convincing growls. We're all laughing and Cruella goes beserk.\nShe was so scared that she started running in place and shaking, trying to cry but couldn't catch her breath. Most people would feel sympathy for her but not me. That will teach her to laugh at my Godzilla movies.\nJust in case she didn't get the message, I kept the box here. Anymore laughing at Godzilla and the life-like Wolfman box comes out. \nWho says Halloween is not the best time of the year?\nHugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

It was inserted in Jan of 1996 on my left side. In Jan of 2000, I had to have a left mastectomy and told the surgeon to, please, save the port. He did. \nIt is a little uncomfortable now and then, but mostly when one of the grandchildren sits in my lap and, occasionally, the seatbelt in my car rubs again it. Also, I sleep with my arms around a body pillow. It protects the site.\nHaving had bilateral mastectomies and a left arm with severe lympedema, I am glad that I have that port. We've been together almost ten years.\nI didn't have chemobrain before my treatments but I was so scared that I didn't have any room left in the brain to store information. If it hadn't been for my mother and several friends, I would have been more of a public embarrassment than I was. \nYou will get through this. The pain will settle down and the port will definitely save important veins in your arm.\nHugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Today's chemo is a lot more \"user friendly\" and, as has been mentioned, there has been a great advancement in meds to counter the nasty side effects.\nUnfortunately, nothing has ever been done to stop the loss of hair. My advice to everyone facing the loss of their hair is, that when it starts coming out like you have the mange, shave it all off. It's your first step in letting this disease know you are going to keep it under control and fight back like hêll.\nNothing you have said makes us think you are crazy. You are going through what every one of us has had to face. That is also the reason we hang out here. You can vent, cry, laugh, scream, or whatever and we'll still be here. \nMy advice, however, is to find a form of chocolate you can eat. It's also known that extensive shopping therapy is a good cure for extensive chemo therapy. Stay with us and keep us informed of your treatments. Don't ever think we won't want to hear something. If it bothers you, the chances are very good that someone here has already gone through it.\nWelcome Hugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Erin, let the remark just roll off your back. Consider the fact that she didn't have the cajones to tell you to your face. When someone is jealous of someone else, when they can't find fault with you, then they want to let others know that you're not perfect, how could you be, you've been a cancer \"victim\". In \"olden\" times, it was a stigma against you, you've got the big \"C\". \nHowever, the one thing that I would do is to let everyone know that I am not a \"victim\", I am a \"survivor and please recognize the difference\". \nIf I took to heart everything that has been said about\n my situation, I would be pushing up flowers somewhere, or at least adding more dust to the air. As you said, you don't really care for her that much and you can't just hit the thumbs down icon to make her go away.\nKeep your own chocolate in your desk, ignore her, and maybe she'll get the message. As a last resort, ask her if she knows that 1 out of every 7 women will be diagnosed with b/c this year? And, for spitting in the wind, God may have something in mind for her. \nThe end result is that it is very sad there are people who cannot find anything to say except something hurtful. But, it's just like the kids who would call another kid \"4 eyes\" because he wore glasses. Bullies are always looking for a weakness. Don't let her know she may have found one.\nErin, you have had the \"fight of your life\" already and you are \"fighting to win\". How could ANYTHING be tougher to deal with than that? Based on what she's done, she is just a good waste of oxygen and a source of wintertime heat. \nJust keep on being Erin. That's a very good thing.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

They glued the scalp back together but didn't do anything for the cut and big goose egg on her forehead.\nThe lamp was one of those tall things. It was like the one I picked up into the ceiling fan a couple of years ago. Mine was cheap but this one wasn't. At the top, it had the heavy glass inverted bowl. When she started shaking it, Jodi told her NO, but, as MK reported, Jodi wasn't fast enough, and the glass came crashing down, catching Cruella in two places, and terrifying her mother.\nI, of course, reacted with my usual calm manner. I had Cruella and Jodi in my car and raced like hell to the er. I'm the best in this family for speeding. I have last year's ticket to prove it. When I dropped her off, her husband was there waiting for her and I headed back to pick the kids up from school.\nJodi had called the school to tell them I would pick them up and they were both angry with me because I was late. Poor babies............\nThere was no concussion or anything worse than the cuts. I thank God and Mitchell. Jodi is convinced that Mitchell is her children's guardian angel because he has saved them more than once. I think I'll stop yelling at him for dying.\nAgain, thank you, for prayers that have been answered. I don't know what I would do without all of you.\nLove and Hugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Well, my friends, I am, once again, so pi$$ed at the long-term effects of this dämned disease that I could just shoot something.\nI've been on Arimidex or Femara since Jan of 2000. One of the first problems I noticed was that hair was growing on my face. I mentioned it to the onc and she told me that it was normal and just shave it off. It was so fine that I could do that.\nNow, the true nature of what those two meds do is painfully obvious. The \"fine hair\" has turned into a full-blown beard and moustache. Right now I could join the circus and work two jobs at one time, the fat lady and the bearded lady.\nThose two meds prevent the hormone necessary for testosterone to turn into estrogen. My internist had tests run that show I have a very high level of testosterone which certainly explains why I feel road rage and keep getting lost because I won't ask for directions.\nI considered buying one of the bleaching products, but I would still have the beard, it would just be lighter. Scratch that one. I've tried all razors up to, and including, the Mach3 (whose refill prices are greater than the cost of the razor). I stuck with shaving but now I'm at my wit's end. \nSo, I decided to use Wax Hair Remover for the Face. My dear Jesus, what was I thinking? The directions said to microwave it for 30 seconds and not to nuke it for more than 1 minutes. I should have known right then that everything on the box was a lie. It took 3 minutes before you could stir it with a little paddle. The instructions also said that this was a special paddle and it would bring out the word \"ready\" if the wax was soft enough. LIE!!! It was on the paddle BEFORE I stirred, not after. \nThen, following their instructions, I put it on my chin and my upper lip. When dry, I started to pull it off. A very small section of the wax on my chin came off and the pain was horrendous. The instructions said that using this product might cause a redness on the area used. You're right, it caused a redness. It was blood. \nOne can easily see that this was a very bad decision. If you're a mother, didn't you ever have a time during labor when you said, \"I've changed my mind. I really don't want to go through this\"? Then you can understand why I'm next to tears looking at my face and seeing how much more wax had to be removed. It's a good thing I live alone.\nThey also give you a small vial of \"Soothing Azulene Finishing Oil\" to moisturize and soften skin. I would have certainly been better off if they had included a vial of morphine, screw the finishing oil.\nThe final lie was that it could prevent hair from growing back for up to 8 weeks. It started growing back in 8 hours. \nSo, if you see me and I've got 5 o'clock shadow at 2 o'clock, don't mention it. That would just be the final straw and I will not be held accountable for my actions. Thank God for valium.\nHugs from the bearded fat lady, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

I hope they don't think Tony will be as big a hit as Rubberband Man has been for Office Max. Go away Tony and \"get down\" Rubber.\nWho is John Basedow, fitness celebrity? I never heard of him and, apparently, no one else did. Early commercials didn't call him a fitness celebrity. His \"classic\" body pose while idly looking off in the distance just shows a guy with little man syndrome and a big ego. And his buddy, talking about\n how he simply couldn't put a price on his results, needs to blow his nose.\nThere were witnesses who saw a woman lift her 3 children and throw them into San Francisco Bay. Why in the hëll didn't those witnesses lift her up and tell her to \"save the kids\" as they threw her in?\nI watched a great show yesterday called Divas of the Outdoors. Some east Texas ladies who are real outdoorswomen. I laughed when the credits were rolling at the end of the show. Divas of the Outdoors was brought to me by Smith & Wesson. Ladies, how many times have I said that a woman's best friends are named Smith & Wesson, as is their cousin, Winchester?\nMy favorite is on right now. I had to turn it off.

I'll move my arm out of the way and tell them that they cannot use that arm either. Then, they tell me they'll use my hand.\nI used to warn them about\n not doing that, but now I don't bother. It's worth watching their faces when they put it into a nice vein, let it go, and it blows out and sprays blood on their face. I know it's bad karma but I figure they deserve it. \nHow do these people survive thinking they know more about\n your body in 15 minutes than you do? I hated the idea of having a port inserted, especially when the surgeon showed me what it looked like before my mastectomy surgery. I P&M'd about\n it for the three weeks it took to calm down. It is now my very dear friend.\nI hope your meds will keep away some of your side-effects. They have a lot of good meds today that do that.

      "Content": " What was I thinking????\nI must have had my head in the oven when I bought \nthis place in the middle of God knows nowhere. Hey, \nit's great to have 1.1 acres until you have to mow it. \nThen, there's all the weedeating. Not just around the \nhouse, mind you, but around the barn, too. \nLast week, I was mowing by the barn and a wasp\ngot me on the backside of my left thigh. I was\nthrilled. I waited till dark, when all the little\nb@stards were back in the nest (somewhere behind\nthe cabinets in the barn). I slid up the door, very\nquietly. The last thing they ever heard was the\nsound of the 20 ft wasp and hornet killer coming\nin their direction. I haven't been up there for a \nwhile so I guess I'll go see if any of them \nare left\nHowever, I have just gotten home from the ER. Seems\nI was weedeating at the back of my house and I got\nstung by something that looks like a wasp but is\na golden color. The sob got me once and then a\nsecond time where he lost his stinger.\nThat was yesterday. When I got up, I noticed how\nred and swollen it was. The redness kept increasing\nand it kept itching and shooting pains here and\nthere. MK said I needed to go to the ER right\naway, so I did.\nThe dr came in and she marked the area of swelling\nand redness. I felt like I was with Dr Sean Bush in\nVenom ER. The treatment is oral benedryl and\nan antibiotic. I shouldn't have needed an\nantibiotic for a bug sting. I think that the\ninfection that sent me to the hospital for 8\ndays really must have weakened my immune system.\nSo, after getting my script\n filled, I headed home\nlike a woman on a mission. I know where they live.\nI saw them going in there (the corner of my house).\nYou must picture this: My car is running and the bright\nlights are on. I got my two-step kitchen stool and\nthe can of 20' biter killer. No 20' for me. Oh no,\nI put the stool much closer. darn thing wasn't\non level ground and I feel down. \nNow, thoroughly irate and feeling stupid, I leveled\nit, climbed up, and to one of my favorite Joe Cocker\nsongs loudly helping me on, I attacked. I sent the\nspray up there. The wind swung around and got me.\nI'm planning on being up before dawn to try it again.\nI'd like to smoke them out but I'd probably set\nthe house on fire. \nAnd just before leaving for the ER, my neurologist\ncalled. He wants me to have another angiogram like I\nhad back in 2001. That was a Depends moment. It's\nhard to be credible to your dr when you can't stop\nlaughing. I told him that the first one was the one \nthing that had made me to quit smoking after almost \n40 years. I told him I would think about\n it\nand call him back and I will, someday. \nNow it's time to take 2 shots, about\n 25 pills and\nrelax. Good thing one of the 25 is a valium. \nShaking off the dust, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Also like you, I never ate french fries from McDonald's at the ages of 3-5 because, again like you, there weren't any McDonald's around when I was 3-5. I just don't like french fries, even till today, and it is a very rare occasion when I have some. I also don't eat at McDonald's. I don't \neven eat potato chips often, I prefer pretzels. I wonder if it could have been the pretzels?\nIt's the left-handed cause that just cracks me up. My mother told me that wearing underwire bras caused it. My mother also told me that if you took a bath during your period, (a bath, not a shower) you would get tuberculosis.\n \nMeat and milk with hormones can cause it (there's one that I could believe). Working or living near a transformer can cause it. Breathing can cause it because there is about\n 50% less oxygen in the air today. Cooked food, especially bbq'ing, is bad for you. \nGod forbid you have ever been around pesticides, there's another one. My onc told me to NEVER be around pesticides again. She didn't know, at the time, that I would one day meet a scorpion in my kitchen. She also didn't know that as a child, I would join my friends and run behind the mosquito spraying truck. \nI'm willing to bet that if you just stayed in bed your whole life, you'd still get it. Why?

It is very possible that I will need to drag you up behind the barn and have you dance to the tune of a peach switch. (Not only do I have a barn, but I have a peach tree.)\nFour years after the first dx (the two years of treatment from hell), I had microcalcifications on the remaining breast. I did not have reconstruction done on the right side because of the multitude of problems there. I did, however, have surgery to replace all of the gangrene so it vaguely resembles a teeny breast. The dr who read the mimmagram (1/2 of a mammogram) showed me the sites and urged me to go to the surgeon. In fact, she had called him and he was waiting to see me.\nThis was the breast that had had the surgery to make it smaller, a perfect size B. I don't know what decisions you will make about\n this but I took a very hard stand about\n it. At the biopsy, I told the surgeon that if it was cancerous that I didn't care to sit in his office and listen to a list of options. He could just have his nurse call me and tell me what day they would be doing the mastectomy.\nI had the biopsy on Monday, Tuesday his nurse called and Wednesday was the second mastectomy. I was adamant that he save my port though. He said that it might not be possible but I told him that I had every faith in him. He saved it. I did learn that it was not a recurrence, that it was a different form of bc, a new primary site.\nThe surgeon wanted me to go through another round of chemo as a preventative, but my Mitchell had just passed away so I refused it. \nYou can get through this. You are one tough little lady. Just keep fighting back because you just don't know what this disease is planning on doing next. \nHugs are all around you and I know Joyce will be piloting the PCE. I'll tell Cruella today that she'll be playing stewardess again. We do need to watch her with the chocolate. She claims she isn't eating all of it but the dark stains on her feathers and the little chocolate drool in the corner of her mouth tell otherwise.\nHang in there.

I don't think I'm really going to know if it's working for six months, when I will be having the sonogram and MRA done again. You can feel a difference in a few days if you don't read all the info about\n them. I missed the part about\n taking extra minerals since some may be taken out. \nBut, I have been doing some weird things on my own. I had a diabetic dr appointment Thurs. I got up thinking it was Fri and took my Fri morning pills. Then, after my shower, I realized it was Thurs so I took my Thurs morning pills. \nI get to the doc and I'm 200/100 and he's upset. He adds another b/p to my long list of meds and, DUH, I still don't realize what's up. I certainly found out why on Fri morning when I didn't have any pills. One pill that I take every morning is Meridia 15. That sucker raises my b/p but not so that it is a problem. Certainly a problem when you take two instead of one. So, instead of calling him, I just go taking my old meds and the new med.\nCome mid-afternoon yesterday, I've got kids and I can't keep my head up. Starting feeling really weird and grabbed the b/p meter. 106/56, doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure this one out. I'll probably fax him tomorrow and get on of the meds dropped. When you have a blockage of any kind, as I learned with the TIAs on the left carotid, it can induce the TIA because the b/p isn't strong enough to get the blood through the artery.\nI had told MK that I have been waking up evey day with a strange headache on the right side. We'd decided that it was probably sinus but I think it is this artery problem. The neurologist said that I shouldn't be able to feel it but I think he's wrong. I guess if the headache goes away, that might be a positive sign.\nOtherwise, sweetie, I'll be way up the river without a paddle, heading to Victoria Falls. Something else that wasn't in the brochure when you have double radiation daily and 24/7 IV chemo. I'm really laughing now because, I swear, you could never make a movie of this whole thing, not a soul would believe it. I want you to laugh about\n it, too. You know that we're all born to live and we're all bound to die. I don't know what I did in a previous life but I get the feeling that I won't be leaving calmly in my sleep like my Mitchell did. \nIf I do become a vegetable, I'm counting on you to be sure you trip over the plug or a juicer for carrot juice. Life is sure one hèll of a journey.\nLove You, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

I did throw myself a super pity party today and ate everything under the roof, that was edible. I even went to the grocery to get some more junk. Now, that's over.\nMy daughter, Jodi, in just in denial about\n this thing. She was that way with the b/c. She thinks I do not get enough exercise running around all day taking care of a 15-month old, an 8-year old, and a 7-year old. DUH? So, she tells me that there is a yard sale at the end of my road. She puts the baby in her stroller and off we go. By the time I got the, my hips and lower spine were just screaming in pain. I sat down there while she was looking and then walked back home. I made it to my front lawn chair, at about\n 95 degrees. \nShe is insisting that I use my recumbent bike at least twice a day. We'll see. I've been ****ed at it since I hit my toe on it. Not a good thing for a diabetic to do. I didn't know that toes could turn that black.\nBut, I have a new dvd. It's pretty much \"Senior Exercise for Dummies\" but \" a reference for the rest of us\". The right gear was mentioned. The first was a one piece top and a pair of tights. HUMMMMM, as I remember it, Omar the Tent Maker has never made my size of these items. And, it's for a good reason. The mere thought of anyone, including myself looking in the mirror, makes me feel so sorry for anyone who had the misfortune to see me in this ensemble.\nThe tape then progressed, learning new moves, keeping up the pace, always keep your feet moving, and smile. In all seriousness, by the time the tape was half over, I was just exhausted. I couldn't find the remote so I had to get up off my chair to turn it off. Maybe some day, I'll be able to do some of it. For now, it wore me out so much just watching them that I need to hit the shower and have another bottle of water.\nMaybe I'll watch Richard Simmons tomorrow and see if that wears me out. Exercise means excessive, exhausting, non-ebulient, and totally embarrassing. \nI'd be very happy if someone just invented a true weight-loss pill. With my luck, it will be released the day after I've gone. I did notice a man that was interviewed on tv last night. He is walking across America (or some combination of states) to lose weight. He must have just started or he was really heavy before starting cause he's still very large. I'm thinking of doing the same thing in the fall. Strap on a backpack with a pup tent and head out, south.\nTomorrow's another day and another chance to exercise. I convinced Jodi that she should clean my kitchen and bathroom. She bought it. I'll be in my bedroom watching one of my old Godzilla movies. Cruella won't be able to join me, though. The first time she saw my beloved Godzilla, she laughed so hard she couldn't catch her breath. Mean and disrespectful. But all too funny.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " They say that there are new medical protocols on the horizon and most of the time, I would say \"not in my lifetime though\". The following is the first paragraph of an artical in the Wall Street Journal on Aug 10, 2005:\n\"Boston Scientific Corp. received expedited approval from the Food and Drug Administration to sell a stroke treatment that employs a stent to \nopen up clogged arteries in the brain.\"\nRight now, it is only to be used in people who have already had one stroke. It has also been submitted to Medicare to provide the necessary hospitalization. I have a cousin in NJ, Frank, who is always sending me articles and I was really stunned with this one. According to Frank, I have to: 1) Show it to my dr, 2) contact the company, 3) contact the FDA, 4) contact my congressman and 5) keep looking.\nWell, I had to do 3 of those items fighting for my disability, 1, 2, and 4. I guess I need to get geared up for another fight. It would seem to make a lot of $$ sense if you could prevent the stroke in the first place. \n I have always said that when my b/c comes out of remission, I am going to buy the largest chocolate cake and a carton of cigarettes. I've been thinking about\n it but I may have to forget that for a while. \nWe've spoken a lot about\n not giving up and here is just another reason why we cannot. \nHugs, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

She was $20 short. I took the last $20 from her drawer and told her she wasn't short. It was the bait bill that set off the alarm at the police station.\nIt was down there that I learned about\n the contagious disease \"Eaten Up With The Dumb\" and how rampant it was.\nI learned to love Community coffee with chickory in Slidell.\nI remember flying home to Atlanta and couldn't find my car keys. I had left them in the teller's machine back in Covington. That's where my supervisor key was.\nI can only cry when I see what has happened to them. They said that one section of MS had 100 mph sustained winds for 7 hours. Nothing can withstand that. New Orleans is under so much water that she may never recover from it.\nSo much devastation and destruction of lives. I really hurt for all of those affected by this storm. One man just broke my heart when he said that he and his wife were on the roof of their house and the house split. He was trying to hold onto her but she told him to take care of the children and grandchildren and she let go. He said he didn't know where she was.

See, the body can't keep running full speed ahead in a battle for your life and endure the stress of your job.\nI am praying that the scans have improved or, at least, stayed the same. You need to discuss a new chemo with the onc. You just don't know that the new protocol might not help so many others like you. However, the body heals when it is at rest. That's a four-letter word you need to remember. Webster defines it as: \"peace, ease, and refreshment as produced by sleep\" and \"a period or occasion of inactivity as during work or on a journey\" and \"relief from anything distressing, annoying, tiring, etc.\"\nPlease put yourself as your main priority. I was so distressed when I found that I would not be able to work again because that had been my two-year goal. It didn't take long for me to realize that it was a pretty stupid goal.

      "Content": " I debated for some time as to whether I would post this because in a post for a newbie, the newbie said that we were scaring her. I cannot help what happens to anyone and almost all of us are scared. If you don't like what someone is saying, you always have the option to ignore their posts.\nI had been having a problem with the stent in my left carotid. It wasn't painful but irritating. If I yawned, the muscles around it cramped up. After complaining to MK long enough, I got an appointment to see the neurologist.\nHe first had them take a sonogram of both carotids. When the tech was taking them, I noticed that he did the left side in very little time, but was taking far too long on the right side. \nBased on the results of that test, I went into the hospital to have a brain MRA done. \nI did learn that the right carotid is 50% blocked but that's what it was back in 4/01 when they did my left carotid. I knew something had to be wrong with the right side but I didn't ever have a hint of what was up.\nMy right internal carotid is as much as 70% blocked and it is not operable. Once again, I have been given the \"get right with God\" and \"enjoy those grandchildren\". He twice told me not to have any stress. Then he said my diabetes has to be brought under control. It was until I saw him. He also said I would have to lower my cholesterol below 100. \nI asked what he thought the severity of the stroke would be because I refused to become a vegetable. I'd probably be a carrot and I hate those things.\nThe answer is that it is an unknown when it will happen, the severity is unknown, and whether it will take me out is unknown..\nIt has taken me some time to make a choice of what to do. If I knew for sure I'd be with Mitchell, I probably would do nothing but I don't have that as a certainty.\nI've decided to fight back. I will be doing oral chelation as soon as it arrives here. The doctor told me that anytime I want to check and see if any of the blockage is gone, he will schedule the tests.\nHe also told me that anytime I wanted to talk, regardless of the subject, to call him. I have some of the finest doctors in the world.\nPlease don't reply to this post. I'm only doing this because I have some very old friends here and I thought I owed the info to them. I'm not trying to scare anyone, I'm the one that's scared. B/C, the gift that keeps on giving. (Brought to me by double radiation.)\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " I have been remiss in recent months in reporting from this dust bowl, but things have been happening here. After months of trying organic fire ant killer, I appeared to have lost the battle. My middle child, Eric, comes up here and poisoned every one of the little things. A few have returned, but their number will soon be up. \nTrees are dying here as are my plants. To make matters worse, MK calls me to tell me about\n their 4\" of rain. I could spit on my weeds and that would be about\n how much rain we got.\nI think that I have already reported to you that the city cops staged a drug raid on a meth lab but it was exactly the same spot that the school bus drops off kids. Perhaps it was just practice for a Keystone Cop routine. I do have a few questions about\n this, though. First, this is not the first time they have arrested the same person for the same thing. He then sets up shop on the main street only makes the shed the lab. No, the cops aren't going to get him again, are they? Judge keeps bailing him out, he keeps cooking up his junk. \nAnd, I think I already told you about\n the 6-7 foot alligator that had taken up residence in a local farmer's pond. I feel real happy having a pond close to this house. \nA local man made national news when he put some kittens in a box and sent them down the river. There was a lot of todo locally and battle lines have been drawn. Personally, I would be happy as could be if there were someone who could remove all the feral cats from my neighborhood. They are getting under my house, on my chairs, walking on my car, etc. Now I'm sure there are a thousand cat lovers out there but I am extremely allergic to them. I've already had one attack that sent me to the ER. There is NO ONE or NO AGENCY that can help. I may not agree with the kittens in the river but I can certainly see where he is coming from. I even tried using Fox urine, don't ask where it came from cause I didn't ask the seller. Nothing works.\nA local town has arrested a football player for indecent exposure. The paper spent more time listing the tremendous wins the school has had with this kid than it did about\n the crime. One mother insists that the player be kicked off the team. Fat Chance, Lady. This is Texas and football is king.\nSorry, to be so lengthy but I had to save the best for last and if I'm lyin, I'm dyin.My weekly newspaper came today and it has \"Front Page News\". Bigfoot has been sighted in teenytinytown. Yep, the Yeta, Sasquatch or whatever you call it passes through here on a yearly migration. (I'm not making this up.)\nThere is also a local research center for sightings. The researcher goes into great detail about\n whether or not a sighting is real. Never having seen one myself, I found it interesting that he classifies them as Gigantopithecus which leads me to believe that he feels they were related to the 3 million year old skull named \"Lucy\". \nThey live in units where the newly matured males are run off and when one sees a Bigfoot, it is one of these males out looking for a female. (What did this guy do? Sit down and have a discussion. Has he ever heard of evidence?) \nHe claims they are omnivores, stealing the turkey and other birds shot by hunters. He also claims that many local farmers have seen them eating fruit from their trees. \nI'm not normally out after dark and I will NOT be looking for Bigfoot. The only I would find in the dark is the pond, mosquitos, and God Forbid, another alligator.\nLadies, I have to live here. I had no idea there were people up here like this. It may very well be the water. I only use the bottled spring stuff. I know my neighbors must have thought I was crazy with my home made bee catcher but they've been hiding traits that are scary.\nSleep well, my friends. All the Bigfeet have migrated down here.\nReady to suggest the nuthouse, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

Most of the time I could have one or the other but rarely both at the same time. The cable company always took at least a week or more to \"schedule\" an appointment. And, it was almost always the problem that some \"higher guru\" decided that the signal going down my block was too high so they would lower it. Since I lived at almost the end of the block, it constantly affected me. \nThe appointment always determined this to be the problem but they would then have to schedule additional people to fix the cable strength. I miss the speed of cable internet but I don't miss cable tv. Up here, I've got a dish and everything is clear. Now, it's the dialup internet that makes me want to rip out my hair. I'm waiting for satelite to come here.\nI can't think of anything worse than having minor surgery and having to stay in a hot upstairs bedroom. You're entitled to take over whatever you need to in order to recover and be able to relax. Time to fire up the PCE.\nLove, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

The last one was that I live long enough to see my youngest, Jodi, be able to support herself and her children if she ever had to. \nThis past Friday was a day I don't think I will ever forget. Joseph, Jordan, Jaidan, Isaac, Isaac's mother (Tina), and I started out early for the morning program and the pinning ceremony. This was also the time that awards were handed out. The first award was a sorority award and the student had to be in the top 5% of the class, treat others with respect, excel in communication with patients, etc. I was really proud when they called Jodi's name. Tina was sitting two seats from me and I asked her for a tissue. We didn't have tissues but we had a cloth from the baby bag.\nThe second award they gave was the \"Jones Excellence Award\" where the student had to excel in everything. Even Jodi was stunned when they called her name. By then, I really needed the baby cloth. Tina leaned towards me and asked if she could use the cloth, too. What a wonderful time. I am only so sorry that Mitchell could not be with me, physically, on that day. He worked so hard towards her education.\nJodi graduated from HS with \"advanced honors\" and graduated Friday \"magna cum laude\". She is one of those unfortunate people whose GPA is 3.999. Poor baby.\nFriday evening was the culmination of years of work. As she walked across the stage to receive her degree, I just cried. And I am so thankful to God that he gave me what I had asked for.\nIf he decides to call me now, I will not worry about what will be after I am gone. God has assured me that all will be well.\nHappily, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

I have problems holding things with my right hand and I tell my fingers which keys to hit but they don't listen very well. Typing allows you to fix the errors but you should hear some of the things coming out of my piano. LOL\nNow, bear in mind that I had mentioned this to my onc's asst in Nov. She didn't think it was anything. I saw him in Mar and he ordered the MRI. He sent me to the neurologist who ordered an MRA. The hospital wouldn't call me back to set up the test and I let it slide, for several weeks. I learned, the hard way, that this is not something to fool around with.\nPlease call the onc. In the beginning, the strokes weren't severe and weren't continual. I'm praying that it will be something very easily controlled.\nLove You, Jo-Ann\n \n \n \n \n ",

It's so good to hear about all of the \"other\" parts wearing out.\nTo add to all of it, last Fri, I had a morning dental appointment for a filling and an afternoon dental appointment to extract a tooth that had already broken into pieces. (We won't mention what long-term chemo does to the teeth.)\nI saw the onc two weeks ago and he lied. Now he won't let me stop taking Arimidex when I told him I had chosen to stop it. \nI can't see worth a cr@p but think it's the diabetes. If I lose one more degree in my left eye, the great State of Texas will not allow me to drive at night. Who cares? I don't drive at night as it is cause I can't see.\nToday, I had a bone density test and extensive x-rays of my lower spine and hips. I'm hoping they find out why I'm in so much pain. My internist heard from my onc.\nThe retarded bee is back again this year and I need a new bee catcher. I'm going to use pink tulle this year. I have a new camera so I will be taking pictures. MK says my neighbors must think I'm nuts but I'm sure they already know that.\nI have tried and tried to deal with the fire ants using only organic products. As soon as the winds are gone, I'm feeding them with a chemical poison. I won't use it near where I plant the garden but I've lost my patience with everything lately. In fact, my new hero is Oscar the Grouch. I sure know where he's coming from.\nLong may our complaints not include b/c. It just means that, despite all of the odds, we really are getting older.\nLove, Jo-Ann\nPS - And this from a woman given nine months to live in 1996, 20% chance to make five years after that, and then only a 10% chance to make the next five.

What kind of treatment have they told you you would need?\nEveryone of us knows what a life-shattering experience we had when we were told we had b/c so you've got plenty of shoulders to lean on. Let us know what we can do to help you. You've found a place with the most amazing women's support group. Sometimes people don't call or visit because they just don't know what to say.
