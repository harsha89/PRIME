    "Content": " Thank you for reading my post. I am 37 years old with a long history of health anxiety. It started back in 2011 when my dad was diagnosed with Colon Cancer. My mom had breast cancer when she was 32 so I'm always aware of that as well.\nI had major chest pain, especially on the left side and automatically assumed the worst. Back in 2011 I had a chest x-ray, an EKG, a mammogram, a breast ultrasound and a breast MRI. Ruled out all the bad things. However, pain really has never gone away. \nFast forward to now and I am experiencing the pain at its finest. I have one very very tender spot right below my left breast when I push on it it is agony. It is always present and I notice it most when I lift my arm. I am feeling numbness in my left hand and all down my arm. Of course, I'm worried it's breast cancer again but went for my annual exam in October and was told all looked good. I can't function right because of this constant pain and am short with my kids and my husband.\nSo, long story short, this pain has been going on quite consistently for six years. Obviously I feel if it was something bad I would know by now (or be dead!). I am going to see a new GP on Tuesday because I think I may need some anxiety medication to get me through. Any thoughts or suggestions would be most appreciated. Thank you!! \n- Kelly ",
