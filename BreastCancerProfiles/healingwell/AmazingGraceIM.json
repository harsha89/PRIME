Been three weeks since I got the call and then went to surgeon who told me to get biopsy - now waiting to get to that appoint -- gosh. ",

Juju, you mentioned you had a mastectomy - is everything ok with you now, how are you doing, etc. etc.  gosh, i never realized before just how many women are really in this position these days and the emotions and feelings involved.  I would love to hear your story.  \n ",
