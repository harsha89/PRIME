I went to a lecture and the Onc. stated that 4 years of Tamoxifen is just as goos as 5. He said there wasn't a major differece at all. This was as he was speaking of Aromasin b/c they have no idea how long you should take that yey, b/c it's so new. But he did say he puts his patients on Tamoxifen for 4 years. Hope this helps, ask you Onc about it. But I think the biggest problem you will have is making yourself believe it is ok to stop it early. You know how some of us are about stopping any kind of treatment, you feel vulnerable at first. \nL&H, Shelley\n \n ",

      "Content": " Goodness Jen! You sound like me. One thing after another. I too was pregnant when some cancer decided to spread and I went on Xeloda. For me, I had NO side effects. But then again it stopped working 6 months later. I did that along with Navelbine and I thought * Wow, this stuff is a breeze * until it stopped working and went on Doxil! Doxil is adriamycian's cousin. That was not fun. But for me, Xeloda was easy. But some women will have loose bowel problems where they need Depends, fingernails can become brittle and peel off. Ask about taking B6. That helps prevent the tingels, redness, cracking, dryness, and numbness of the feet/hands. If you have a Bath and Body works you can go there and get this stuff called healing therapy. It really thick and in a small container, but it's great. Or something with shea butter or anything that is a thick cream lotion. Not thin, that doesn't help at all.\nI hope you tolerate Xeloda well. I was on 5000 mg twice a day for 6 months. You know you can email me if you have more questions. You know the address! I just saw this post after replying to your email! See, I said I was going to bed, but I couldn't rest without checking in on my ladies first! LOL\nL&H, Shelley\n \n ",

I don't think it will be so bad tomorrow, it just sucks b/c it's another surgery to add to my list. It confusing enough as it is without all this new crap. My poor ( new ) PCP looked so overwhelemed today when I was trying to explain everything to him. He looked at me crazy when he saw I was having surgery tomorrow and I was not nervous and just making jokes. I had to tell him I have BC already and have battled it for 3 years. I finally had to just say, * All you need to do is give me refferals when I/Dr.s ask for them.* and he said ok. He told me his doctor buddy's wife just found out she has BC. She's 30 and pregnant. So he totally understands how sucky this can be and asked how Keith was holding up. I said he is doing Ok. We all have our moments, but we have been dealing with it alot longer, so it's not as shocking to me, obviously. Oh well, off to bed. Gotta be up early. Surgery is at 10am. But I have to be there at 7:30am....groan!\nL&H, Shelley\n \n ",

But then again, I clinch my teeth alot. I try not too, but I don't notice until my jaws start to hurt. And then that gives you headaches. HHHMMMM.........osteonecrosis......never heard of it. But I will bring it up when I see them next. B/c I was going to get a mouth piece or something for the night b/c I really clinch them then.\nThanks for the info.\nShelley\n \n ",
