      "Content": " Alas, I only respond because you asked me a question and I didn't want to appear rude. Those who know me from the UC forum know that I only share my opinion when others ask advice. The heading of this posting was \"...advice needed\". I just gave my 2 cents worth, that's all, like everyone else. I don't intend to scream it from the rooftops, coming across as a \"snakeoil salesman\" :) I always sit by and respond to those seeking help, rather than some \"know-it-all.\" There are enough of those in the world. As for the \"sugar\" theory, it is not sugar in fruits and veggies that is the concern. They are very much needed, especially the veggies. It is the refined/processed sugars (a grain) and other grains (wheat, corn, etc.)that are commonly contaminated with fungal toxins, like aflatoxin, a carcinogen. When you eat these foods you are at risk of ingesting fungus. Dr. A.V. Constantini, former of the WHO believes that multiple cancers are caused by fungi and mycotoxins. By eliminating those foods as well as reducing foods high in sugar, you starve the fungus, literally. That's all... ",
