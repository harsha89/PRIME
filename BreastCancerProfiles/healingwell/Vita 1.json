My physician does not think it will be anything but the radiologist who read my film scared the neck out of me. she said the microcalcificaton in my left breast is \"indeterminate\". My doctor says that I will be ok. I have a few friends to lean on but I am anxious and concerned that this might be bad news. appreciate hearing about\n how you managed! gratefully, Vita 1 ",

      "Content": " Dear Mimi57: I, like you, also had the dreaded callback for a second mammogram on Dec. 14. I am 55 and in good health, but with a family history (Mother, died age 58) of breast cancer. The radiologist called the small microcalification (less than 2 cm) \"indeterminate\" and prescribed a stereotactic biopsy of the spot. Needless to say, it has been a very different holiday! I am scheduled for Jan. 8. I confess that I am concerned and scared and anxious. I read a lot about\n these things, which says that 80% come back as benign. I keep trying to tell myself that. Know that there are other women like you and please write if it helps to reassure you that all will be well. Look forward to more posts from women who have been down this road and can share some positive stories! Happy healthy New Year to all! ",
