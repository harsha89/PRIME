      "Content": " Hi all\nI am a new member hoping someone out there can put my mind at ease.\nI have been suffering with breast pain then pulls across my breast from under my arm for 10+ months the pain has spread to my shoulder and top of my arm. The area the pain starts from is very tender, there are no lumpsthat I can feel, I perhaps could convince myself of a less than pea sized lump behind my nipple bu thats all, my nipple does pull in when i raise my arms too but I think that started a couple of years ago so think thats just the way I am. I have been through physio with no improvement so was sent for xrays on my shoulder and chest a couple of weeks ago. \nThe xrays came back with a lytic lesion on my humerus and a referral to breast surgeon recomended, I had been getting a bit of numbness too but today I have pins and needles / numbness all down my arm to my fingers, been there since yesterday, with no let up, its driving me insane.\nFirst question i suspect i know the answer anyone else out ther had symptoms like this thats been diagnosed with breast cancer?? \nI dont really think its at all likely given my age the lack of lump but the niggle is there and untill its ruled out I am going to worry as my mums life was taken by this awfull disease.\nAlso if its not that then what is this lesion why do I have pins and needles (seriously doing my head in).\nAny advise, words of wisdom, ",

      "Content": " Thankyou for your reply, I am 34 years old. \nI was thinking the same re the nerve I am pretty certain its to do with this lesion, its very annoying and is still there this morning, the area at the top of my humerus is aching today worse than normal. \nNothing with my muscles that I know of my physio lady did say the top of my spine didnt move as much as it should, the other side of me I have a 15 year long horrid repetative strain injury and is notted up badly from desk work but this side she said seemed normal from what she could see.\nI have a mammorgram booked in this friday.
