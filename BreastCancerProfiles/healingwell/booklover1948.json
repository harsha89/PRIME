If it is a hematoma it will be gone, If not, it won't have had time to grow.So I guess this is good news. I'm actually a little nauseated from nerves. \n I want to thank all of you who took the time to write. I'm sure you understand how much I appreciate it.\nGod bless you and take care.\nMarsha ",
