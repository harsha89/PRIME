      "Content": " I am 54 years old with a family history of breast cancer......mom and sister as well as a paternal aunt. Have been having annual mammograms since age 40. Always got the all clear. This year annual mammogram done 3/6 and the radiologist discovered a 6mm assymetry on my right breast. This all I can get my PCP office to tell me. The radiologist recommended a spot compression both breasts and a ultrasound on the right. He also said I do not have dense breast tissue.\nFirst time ever getting a report like this. Based on my family history......I'm really scared. ",
