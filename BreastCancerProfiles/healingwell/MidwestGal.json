      "Content": " Tavish...My name is Elizabeth. I was kindly helped by you and other when I was going through a series of mammograms, ultrasounds, etc. So far so good in that area. However, after still not feeling well, and basically getting to the point of not being able to function, I found a new doctor. Apparently with my cat scans, labwork, etc, he is almost certain I have a)lymphoma & b)pancreatic cancer. I am scheduled for an endoscopic ultrasound Tuesday to check on the pancreas to be certain. He has scheduled me to see someone by the name of Dr. Margolis at Beaumont hospital. Just wondering what your thoughts are, if any, on Beaumont. I am thankful to have this new primary care doctor, but he works out of Beaumont, and I'm in the Ann Arbor area. If you have a minute, would love any advice. Thanks much. ",

      "Content": " Hello.  I am a 35 year old woman.  I had a benign excisional biopsy 12 years ago.  After that,  I had yearly mammograms, all of which were fine.  My last mammogram was in May of 2001.  At that time, everything was fine, and they told me to start coming every 3 years.  I was recently referred to a Hematologist because I've had some strange blood tests.  I've had a continuously high D-dimer, which is a clotting test, but have been checked head to toe for clots, none of which were found. (ironically, one of the reasons a person's dimer can be high is because of malignancy, although the hematologist said, \"oh, I'm sure that's not the case\") The Hematologist suggested I have a mammogram.  I am going in next week for another mammogram and ultrasound because of a callback.  The report indicated there is a 7mm developing density on the lateral left breast in the craniocaudal view, and may be supeiorly  present on the oblique view.  No diagnosis code was given because it said that I need further evaluation.  The right breast was unremarkable.  I have not felt any lumps, and the technician did not either. But, my left breast (the troubled one) looks smaller than the right.  By the way, the size was 7mm.  I've been reading like crazy and they say the only way to truly know if something is cancerous is with a biopsy, is that true?  I appreciate any help.  Thank you so much for your time!  \n ",
