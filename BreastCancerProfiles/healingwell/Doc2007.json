    "Content": " Hello all...my best friend was diagnosed with Lymphoma in December. He immediatley changed his life style and eating habits and started working out etc. He is 41 yo and a great great person. He also is being stoic and not letting anyone help with Dr. visits and all of his close friends feel that he isnt being upfront with us about\n his prognosis and the extent of the Lymphoma. He wants to fight it however there is a certain level of avoidance or denial of how serious this is. He owns a hair salon and his partner is out of work. So he is covering home rent and Salon rent and overhead and he is the only Stylist right now as well. \n ",
