      "Content": " Boy Tawny this one came up from the archives!!! It is from three years ago! There are more recent discussions in the last week of call backs, I'm surprised that this one popped up in a scan if that is how you found it. Anyhow read all of them and see if you don't get some help with your worries. One thing not discussed is menopausal breast changes. There sure are lots of changes as you get older. The firm breast tissue becomes less firm, that is why all the jokes about\n older ladies breasts hanging. Birth control is important at that time of life, but I sure hate to see hormones used. Talk to your doctor about\n different methods. Let us know how the second mammogram works out. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Boy it sounds like you have had a really bad allergic reaction to the yellow jacket sting. Yes, it could cause lymphedema, but that doesn't mean it will for sure. Keep an eye on your arm and if it looks like it is starting to swell all over, call a lymphema center. Better yet, call now and ask them what to look for. Of course I am assuming there is a center near you because there is one here. Not everyone gets lymphedema. I sort of take care of my arm, except for lifting some things. My daughter really abuses her arm with lifting and she has had no problem. Jo-Ann had all her nodes removed from one arm and just a few from the other, and has terrible lymphedema in the arm with less nodes gone. Lucy, an old friend to all of us who is currently MIA got a bite of some kind on vacation, went to the ER and tried to tell the intern about\n lymphedema and her concerns. He pooh poohed her and it got in a terrible mess, infection and all. It took her doctor back home a good while to get it straightened out. I think a letter might have been sent to the hospital where they wouldn't listen to her. So you are right to be concerned, but you have been seeing a doctor so I am sure you are in good hands. No one wants lymphedema, but taking care and not letting it get bad if it starts is best. I would also suggest that another sting from a yellow jacket even on another part of your body could be a real problem, too, so beware. Do you need to carry prevention materials with you?

If there is a lump, as everyone else has told you, don't let anyone talk you into watching it for six months. A biopsy will tell you if it is benign or cancer, why wait and worry for six months and then have it done? Hugs that you are doing ok. MK\n ",

Even when they take several samplings, I'd be afraid a benign result may not be absolute. If the result is malignant, it gives you time to set up surgeons and surgery to a suitable time. \nMy daughter had the needle biopsy that confirmed cancer, then she set up the surgery to include reconstruction because she definitely had to have a mastectomy. I went into surgery knowing that I would have a mastectomy if cancer was found, no matter what it was. I probably could have gotten away with a lumpectomy because it was caught really early. Her lump was larger and the surgeon was worried it was attached to the chest muscle. It was not, she had chemo and was fine for eight years. Then she found enlarged lymph nodes in her neck and tests showed recurrence. She has been under treatment for nearly a year and seems to be doing fine. She is also one who does not want to talk about\n it much. \nSorry you are not getting more answers but over a holiday weekend everyone seems to be busy and there is not much activity.\nHugs MK\n ",

Bone cancer is no picnic, either, we have a member here much younger than your mom who has gone through many surgeries and is on chemo for a sixth time trying to keep the cancer at bay. Maybe she will see your post and sign in.\nI don't know of any place to get your questions answered except through her doctors who would know just how much cancer is involved. You can read all kinds of information, but it is general information. She has control of who can get that information unless her mind is not good.

One never knows exactly what is ahead. \nAt 58 I had a lump and elected to have a mastectomy, years later I think I may have been better off doing a lumpectomy and radiation. \nMy daughter at 39 had a lump showing cancer with a needle biopsy, had a mastectomy and chemo because of her young age, there was no sign of cancer in her nodes. Eight years later she was dealing with Stagee IV and thankfully has surprised even her doctors because she has lived a fairly normal life. Altho she is not by any means clean her onc keeps giving her chemo which seems to keep her going. \nA year ago in February my husband who seemed perfectly healthy hurt himself working around on the farm and turned out to have cancer all through his bones. A lung tumor was detected to be the culprit and he went downhill so quickly that he was gone by November. He fought to live but it just wasn't to be. \nTake each day at a time and make the best judgements you can, live and enjoy life, but remember to rest enough to fuel your body.\n ",

Needle biopsy is great unless the needle somehow misses the area but I haven't heard of that happening either. I really prefer surgical biopsy which is done in day surgery and is not a big deal at all.

So it is possible that you will not get a diagnosis of cancer. It sounds to me like they are going to remove tissue in several spots where the microcalcifications are to be absolutely sure. This is certainly the best way to find out. You need to be on top of things with the family history you have. How is your sister doing? Do you live near each other so she can help you understand the tests, etc. Your mom probably won't be of as much help because we older ladies usually let the doctors do what they think. LOL. Notice the roll call at the beginning of the page, you should take some time and read through it. It will tell you a little about us, where we live, our ages, and there are even some pictures we took at a get together in KY. Maybe you will find someone near by where you live to meet for lunch and talk with. Sorry, too, for the need for you to find us, but welcome you here............ Hugs MK\n ",

She bought vitamins and a concentrated elderberry juice and all kinds of things she read about\n. Who knows how much that helped extend her life. Her onc told us she lived three years longer than he would have ever expected. So the only advice I would give is to get some treatment, the best you can determine from talking with doctors, reading, talking with others. You needn't stay with one doctor, you can consult others and even better try to find a breast specialist in your area. I aagree with Bev about\n genetic testiing. ",

      "Content": " Hey Ellen, Been there, done that a couple of times. Our house in OH we built to retire and live the rest of our lives. Two short years later the plant where my husband worked hit the skids as many steel related plants did in those days. We moved to TX and rented a couple of years but finally found a good deal on a new house so we had two house payments because no one was buying in OH. Lived in that house two years and the oil industry went on the skids and the plant where DH worked closed down. We moved to Fort Worth with two house payments and needed a place to live. No way could we pay for three homes, so we had to let the one with the least equity go back. It was a VA loan and we \"got\" to make payments of $100 to make up the difference between the price the VA got and what we owed. Finally after seven years the house in OH sold for about\n half the original value and we bought a nice home on a lake. Lake properties never lose value, right? Yeah they do when the drought comes and the lake goes low and the gas drillers come across the road and put in several wells and a big pumping station. Last year we moved to a nice farming town away from all the mess to retire. That lake property that wouldn't lose value is supposedly sold for a lot less than our original listing price and now even that is being held up by the mortgage company the buyer is working with. So Ellen, don't beat yourself up about\n something that happens and you have no control over. Just go with the flow. Worrying never helps. Hugs, MK\n ",

Painter looked around and said \"there are all different textures on these walls\". Sure enough I hadn't really noticed the different types of texture, I just knew it was a lousey job. The guy who built the house was a retired engineer and hired the cheapest possible labor or did it himself a lot. So I said, ok give me a bid on fixing the walls before painting, separate from painting. There is still one naked wall in the living room needing pictures or something, otherwise I quit except for the paint and carpet. I have less and less stamina all the time and I need more help. Amy and I get along fine, but her interest in work is less than mine. She has more aches and pains than I do, too. This week it is sore throat and fever???? Last week it was sore back and knees. Her mother will be here to clean Saturday. I wish she had more of her energy. Oh well. I pay her very little unless she does something special. \nOnc took Carolyn off chemo for awhile. She saw orthopedic surgeon about\n her broken hip and he said he wanted more xrays and to watch it for awhile to see if mets was spreading before taking steps to pin both hips. He told her she was not to lift more than a gallon of milk, but that was two days after she wrestled a new hot water tank into place and installed it. My daughter is so much like her father. \nI need to get breakfast into me and get dressed. Hope everyone is doing well, including husbands that have problems.\nHugs MK\n ",

Her doctor was to see her today. Her temp was up so they were going to do a culture when I left. She got platelets, blood and is still getting potassium IV. But, she is playing Scrabble with us on her laptop. When I asked her if there was anything I could make her or get for her, she didn't hesitate a second and said, \"Hamloaf and corn pudding\". So that is exactly what I will do today. Along with making rolls for her dear husband who is trying to finally see her doctor today. Hopefully we will know more. Caarolyn is the toughest \ncookie I know and the most stubborn. I told her she even beats her dad in that department and they certainly were cut of the same cloth.\nYes, Chuck's service was very special. Todd is in college studying for the ministry. Also I neglected to add that almost four year old Hailey sang a song she made up about\n rain at the ashes spreading. It was very hard to hear her because she is shy and sings and talks very softly. I think she is following in her uncle Christian's footsteps in being musical. She has made up three songs now, Rain, Butterflies and Fishies. She also sang with Sam and her guitar in the house. \nThanks for letting me talk this all out. It does help. I feel Carolyn's time is very limited and I have to be strong for the kids.\nHugs MK\n ",

Her spirits are good as usual, and we all cut up and laughed and had a wonderful visit including a great nurses assistant who was funny and full of life. Today her counts were even lower in the areas they could get lower. Her white count is non existent, her platelets are now 17. Hemoglobin and red cells are falling now, too. She is on a special diet where she cannot have fresh fruits and veggies because of the possibility of bacteria. Last night she had Potassium IV running and another huge bag to follow. Erica talked to her on the phone and it sounded like she was more tired today, which certainly stands to reason. Tomorrow I will go to see her again. She is so opposed to being treated like she is sick. I tried to help her turn her dinner tray last night and she said,\"I can do it, I am not an invalid\". Oh dear! Of course the kids are very upset and it is hard for me to see them with such long faces. \nToday we had the memorial service for Chuck knowing Carolyn was getting worse we had decided to do it this weekend, and it ended up she couldn't be here anyhow. It was a wonderful service prepared by the grandchildren with love and music. Todd's fiancee played her guitar and sang two songs, one was Amazing Grace. Christian played Taps as Todd spread the ashes in the wind out in the corner of the farm. I thanked God for my wonderful family children, grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. I am so blessed to have them. I don't think I will have Carolyn much longer but her children will be her legacy and they are special to me and all of the rest of the family. \nHugs to all MK\n ",

You know it is usually easier for old gals to accept cancer. \nI sat and wrote a big long answer about\n Carolyn this morning on my netbook and somehow moved and erased it all. I spent yesterday afternoon with her and she was very upset that Erica and I had called the Drs nurse to see if she should be driving with her counts so low. Oh yes, the idiot dr sent her home. They did not do the culture, sent her home with a slight fever and still very low white cells, altho the red cells and platelets came up some after four pints of blood and a couple bags of packed cells. She came home with a very distended abdomen which looks something like mine, hurting so badly from the hardness and pressure. She called it edema, but the swelling in her legs went down some in the calf altho the thigh was still swollen. I asked if the dr had seen her abdomen before he released her and she said the nurses knew about\n it and told me about\n one nurse who tried to pull her out of bed hurting her even more. I asked again if the dr had examined her and found it. I don't think so, altho she wouldn't straight out say so. I told her several times she should not be in pain from this and she needed to call the office, so finally she did just before closing time. The dr was gone and the nurses didn't want to give her more diuretic because she already took some for high BP. So they set an appt for today at 11 for the Dr. They told her NOT to drive herself and then she went ballistic again on how everyone wants to tell her what to do and she was capable of making decisions herself. So I let her rant and rave and told her it was only because we love her that we care. I told her over and over to ask the Dr if she should drive. Then she started in on if she couldn't drive she couldn't work, so again I told her to ask the dr about\n working. Her appt was 11 am and she promised she would call and tell me about\n it. It is now 8 hours later and I have not heard one word from her. Needless to say I am really concerned, because I feel like the fluid is in the peritoneal cavity called ascites and it is much like pleural effusion in that it has to be drained and can carry cancer cells. So where is she? Getting more blood and cells, getting a paracentesis procedure? I am so afraid they have not called because she is so upset and having a meltdown. I'll let you know when I know something. I keep thinking about\n all our sisters here who have gone through this. Names avoid me sometimes, but I am thinking of a young woman from MO who traveled and camped with her husband but her problem was in the pleural cavitiy. More later.\n ",

All seems to be ok. My sugar is up but I think that is due to sinus and this time of year. I'm also very tired, after the last two mornings of trips only 23 miles from here I have come home and slept for 2-3 hours. Crazy.\nMy daughter Chris changed doctors and this one is an oncologist who has suggested BRCA testing since there has been so much cancer in our immediate family and cancer in related relatives. She has not been diagnosed, remember, but had a PAP test that was showing precancer. The dr she was seeing was a gyn/onc and she just kept chipping away at her uterus doing tests. We all couldn't imagine why they didn't do a hysterectomy. The answer was unnecessary surgery. No one was real happy with that answer so a new dr. Anyhow if her test is back positive then they say Carolyn and I really should have it done, too.\nWe finally have all the Christmas stuff down and almost all put away. My son is coming in a few weeks to go through his dad's tools and is taking what he wants back to TN in the farm truck with a trailer. I think he is cray to drive that old truck but he wants it and I am glad for him to have what he wants of his dads.\nSorry I have been away from you all for awhile, but I do think of everyone often. There has been lots going on here.\nLove and hugs to all, \nMK\n ",

Her oncologist called Michael and said she had to have set a world's record for surviving mets to bone marrow. He said three and a half years ago he really thought she had only three months. She worked up until six weeks ago, only allowed someone to drive her the last three weeks and even then did a few short trips on her own. Less than a week before she died she went to the feed store to get horse cubes!! She loved her horses. She loved all animals. She was generous and thoughtful. It was a great loss to everyone, but so far it seems like Michael and the kids are doing ok. Life goes on with one more special angel in the heavens. Love and hugs to all of you. MK\n ",

      "Content": " Yeah, the news is not good. The onc is calling it Numb Chin Syndrome which is a signal of \"deterioration\" of metastatic cancer which lodges in the meninges and lower spinal part of the skull. It hits the nerve which causes the numbness. Onc says there is a hardening in the brain, but not really signs of tumors in the brain tissue. She talked to the dr on the phone on Friday but tomorrow she sees him face to face and is hoping he will put her back on chemo. Internet searches show chemo does not do much but some have been treated with direct chemo injected into the skull spinal column area. Michael says she doesn't want that. She still will not let him go with her to the dr tomorrow but promised him he can go next time. He said maybe she can talk to the dr better if he is not there. I suggested he offer to take her and stay out of the office unless the dr wants to talk to him, but he doesn't want to upset her anymore than she is already. Time frame suggestion on web say four to six weeks. We are going to have memorial service for Chuck on the 27th instead of later. I am coming to Cincy this weekend for a shower for my grand daughter. I will be there a very short time. Thurs pm til Mon afternoon. I will call when I have a chance, Bev. I will be there every month for a weekend for the next four months also. Shower in April then weddings in May, June and July. Whew this family is growing!!!!! Great new additions, tho. Hugs to all, MK\n ",

Carolyn's still hanging in amazingly. She has cancer in her liver now and is very jaundiced. Her tumor markers and liver enzymes were up yesterday. They have been giving her 1/2 doses of chemo because her blood count is so bad, but today the onc is going to try a full dose again. Last full dose totally wiped out her white counts and she ended up in the hospital for a few days. She still goes to work, tho she comes home when she feels bad. It is unbelieveable how strong she still is. \nTake care Luci, hope you are doing well. I have been running back and forth to KY all spring and summer. Four grandchildren are getting married.

Ben gets married the 12th and we have rehersal dinner on the 11th. I arrive the 9th, so I have the 10th pretty free, too. I don't know about\n your hubby's status, but could you meet some day after work for dinner? Not sure where you are but would someplace like the waterfront in Cincy be close? You know appproximately where we are. After Ben's wedding, we have til Friday when we go to TN for his little sister's wedding. She was going to get married in October but they found a house and bought it and decided not to wait to move in. They wanted to elope but Dad and Mom talked them into a small wedding at home, so that is Sunday night the 20th. So rather than fly home and fly back I am staying the week in between. Then my next trip will be in July for a wedding on the 10th.\nBUT\nCarolyn had another bad spell this week. Her temperature was up for several days climbing from 100 to 104. She was vomiting and having nose bleeds, too. All of these she has been told to call the doctors office, but did she? Noooo she had an appointment set for Wed at 3:45 so she was waiting it out. Finally her son, daughter and husband got after her and she allowed them to take her at noon. She was severely dehyrated so they gave her fluids and antibiotic in IV. The doctor told her she could go home but she had to go to the hospital the next morning for 2 pts of blood and platelets, then she was to go to oncology for more fluid and antibiotics. So she was there by 8 am driving herself, she would not let anyone else take her. She got home at 7:30 last night, then had to go back today for more fluid and antibiotics. I have not heard a word yet today. I am sure she drove herself again, and I am not talking about\n a quick drive a few miles, it is 30 miles and heavy traffic in the rush hour period. I'm sure this stubborness is what has kept her alive so long, but it is frustrating for those of us who want to help her.\nHugs, MK\n ",

      "Content": " So there is gallbladder trouble big time.  Stones were passed and there are still some left.  Thursday night the surgeon told us that if Chuck was a healthy man he would do gallbladder surgery immediately, BUT because he was so confused they ordered a head scan.  The CT showed something at the base of his skull, so an MRI was ordered Thursday night.  The surgeon said it would be up to the onc what to do and because of this tumor he would wait for the onc to make the decision.  He thought his life span would be too shortened to put him through major surgery.  OK so I spend the night to see the onc the next morning.  By ten he had not appeared so I called the office and left a voice mail asking when he would be coming to the hospital.  By noon I had no call back so I left a voice mail for the PA who sees us once in awhile and is most helpful.  She called back and said the onc was at a medical conference.  She would talk to the onc taking over for him and she felt he would come see us.  He didn't, but the \"Hospitalist\"  a new twist for me, a doctor who keeps tabs on hospital patients everyday care and coordinates with specialists, came and said the thing on the skull was known to  the oncs and that they wanted to proceed with surgery.   Saturday we saw the surgeon again and he said it would be Monday or Wednesday depending on the condition of blood chemistry.  They have given him 2 transfusions, then Potassium, Calcium and Magnesium like you wouldn't believe.  Now it is 5:30 Monday morning and we still don't know if surgery will be today or Wednesday or possibly later.  The afternoon blood test Sunday showed electrolytes still low, so they gave him more and he was to have a blood test at 3 am to decide.  I will call in a little while to find out.  They did keep him NPO after midnight in case.  Oh yes, the Hospitalist was back in yesterday and said the thing on the skull was mets and it was only on the bone, not in the tissue. Up, down, all around is the way it has been.  Chris came yesterday to spend the week to help me get to and from the hospital.  Todd goes to college next weekend so she made arrangements to be home Friday.  Amy is still here taking care of the house and dogs.  I thank God for all the support I have been getting.  It has been hard physically and I really get tired.  I think I am holding up ok mentally.  Chris, Amy and I played a game of Scrabble last night.  Hugs to all,  MK\n \n ",

He now has a hot plate, a microwave and a fridge in his dorm room and he is cooking his breakfast so he can eat at all hours of the night if he wants. Well, this morning he put the water on to boil for his oatmeal and laid back on the bed and went to sleep. The water boiled away. I was concerned about\n fire, now I know I was right. What to do to keep him happy yet safe?\nThe Cortisone shot did not do anything this time. It has been a week now and my leg still is killing me most of the time. I did get a Homedics Hot/cold knee brace and it does make it feel better when the gel is hot or cold. The rest of the time it is just there. I guess I will call the drs office today and see which ortho man he wants me to see or if he has any preference. I need to be able to get around better.\nChris is here busy as a bee doing things for me like cleaning the oven and the freezer. Yesterday she washed down the front door and scraped the peeling paint off the pillers on the front stoop. It is too small to call a real porch but big enough to have four pillers for decoration and the paint was peeling, probably from the drought and the wood drying out. She wants to paint today but rain is in the forecast. It looks great out now, sun is shining, so maybe she can paint before the rain. She is trying to involve her dad enough to make him feel helpful yet not let him overdo. \nI am trying to rest all I can while she is here. I feel more at ease with Chris here than with Amy. Amy is great help when it is something she wants to do, but doing for Chuck is not her favorite thing. So I try to do all that.\nHugs to all.\nMK\n ",

That said I think you are absolutely correct in your thinking that it would be stupid to wait around and see what could happen with your history. I have no idea where you live but if you are in an area where there are breast specialists, why not make an appointment with one and let the expert decide whether to wait three months or not. If that is not possible talk to a surgeon about\n a lumpectomy and get it done. A path report will give you all sorts of information that removes the guessing game. Come back and let us know what happens! Big hugs! MK\nPS My daughter had an abnormal PAP test, too, and given the family history her doc is looking all over for cancer and can't find it.

We had an easy Easter dinner, grilled steaks, baked potatoes, creamed asparagus on toast, corn and some homemade desserts that she especially likes. She ate hearty on the asparagus, had a little potato and hardly any steak and she felt full and later said she felt so full she thought she might throw up. I brought home the pie I took. Just what I need, lol. Anyhow she had Erica cut her hair very short because it is falling out. She was on chemo a whole year and did not lose it, but the dr stopped it when it wasn't effective on the bone marrow. Then he gave her that last week to see if it would help the liver mets. One treatment and her hair is falling out. Don't know if they will give her any more her white blood count is up to a whole 2, but red cells and platelets are up some. She is, as usual, doing \"just fine\", her words not mine. And she made sure I had heard the dr gave her an ok to drive.

I wish Carolyn would have felt comfortable posting here, but she felt it was my kind of thing and not hers. She would ask me what you all thought about\n things sometimes. Yes, she was very strong until the very end and even then was amazing. When Christian was called home from the Eastern Music Festival he was attending in NC, he gave her a kiss and told her he loved her and she was able to tell him she loved him, too! When her sister got there to say goodbye she acknowledged her and told her she was glad she was there. When Michael and Christian were helping her to the bathroom, they were having trouble keeping her stable and she said, \"Gees guys!\" So we use that quote quite a bit now along with \"I'm fine, JUST FINE\".\" She truly was a daughter to be proud of in many ways. She was kind, generous, stubborn, unwilling to give in and she surely fought until the last minute. Again, thanks for your wishes and prayers and very kind thoughts. MK ",

      "Content": " Acually I think I can say Chuck is doing better. The pain seems to be better controlled by the Methadone. He still can't sit for long, even a few minutes hurts badly. But they are encouraging him to walk with the walker to get his leg muscles going again. His legs are so skinny and he has little strength in them. The PA is working on finding him a water class to see if that will help. The third chemo was yesterday and I guess in a couple of weeks he will be tested to see what it has done for him. He seems to tolerate chemo well. His disposition is good and he still is confident he will beat this thing and be back to farming some. Meanwhile I am soooo tired. You wouldn't believe what I did last night. I went to sleep at nine and nearly slept the clock around. Since Chuck was encouraged to move around, I ignored him in the kitchen at 2 when he was getting some breakfast. I had a little breakfast myself and my meds and went back to bed until 2 this afternoon. AND I SLEPT the whole time. I should be rested, huh? But now I have a mess in the kitchen facing me and I better get busy. I fixed lunch at 2:30 so who knows when we will have supper? LOL Thanks so much for everything, Bev. Hugs MK\n ",

Probably you are hunching over because it hurts less that way. And don't you think that position is harming the healing? There are many pain meds and one works better than another on different people. If constipation is the only problem there are lots of over the counter things that help, including good old MOM. Stop fighting it and start healing and then you will feel better. The reconstruction is far worse than the mastectomy. And some of the discomfort from it never goes away. Well, I say never because after 12 years I still experience some. Hugs MK\n ",

Finally his onc came back from conference to make the decision and he agreed with the surgeon that with all the other issues there was no reason to put him through surgery now that the gallbladder has settled down. Perhaps later they may decide to do it if chemo does a good job and things look stable. He has been a little confused and sleeping a lot which he did not do before. Don't know if he is just exhausted from his week in the hospital or something is going on. Chris goes home Thursday night and Amy's mother called to see if she was going to come home or what.

Amy said he came into her room at 3 am wanting to know where I was and then went back to his room and yelled for the people to leave he wanted to go to sleep.

We have lost many, but have many great survivors still hanging here together some from 12 years ago when we first began posting. I was diagnosed with BC in 96 and my daughter in 99. I lost my husband to lung cancer last November. He was a healthy man or so we thought a little over a year ago when he got hurt cutting dead trees. Cancer was found all through him when they took xrays to see what he hurt. He had an enlarged prostate and a very high PSA number, but the biospy did not show cancer and the dr took 19 sample sites. I hope your dad has very treatable prostate cancer and will live for many years to come. Take care of that little one in your tummy and don't stress too much. You need lots of rest and good food to make a healthy baby. Remember we have little control over our life span except to live as healthily as possible. The ultimate decision is not up to us, it is up to our Maker. Love your dad and let him know how important he is to you. Hugs and prayers, Mary K.\n ",

He suggested some different medications and they have worked to make Chuck sleep and help with his mind and seeing things. He has calmed down and has been almost normal at times, except for the pain and not being able to get around. Yesterday two aides came with Drew and right away they made some great helpful suggestions about\n a trapeze bar for over his bed and side rails for the commode to help him move better. All Hospice people sit and visit with me to hear all about\n Chuck from their last visit. His appetite has gone and now they are sending some meds to help perk it up, too. They are just wonderful. \nThen I have Amy, the daughter of the friend who has been cleaning for me for several years now. She is great help and is here 24/7. I think she likes our country living. She does the runs to the store and other errands as well as helping me here. She spent one night all night with Chuck fighting fires aboard ship and she was \"Mark\". So you see she is good with him, too. Chris has come two different times, once for almost a week, then for almost two weeks. All the family and friends have been very supportive, so I am not having to work nor even handle too much stress anymore. Life is good. After all there are a lot of people much worse off than we are. Some people live their whole lives with terrible handicaps and illnesses. Some babies lose their mothers to the darn disease of breast cancer. As Chuck tells everyone, he has had a good life and he knows his time is coming and that's ok. He even jokes about\n a funeral. \nThanks for your concern. Love you all, MK\n ",

However, lately the pain is gone for the most part, so the dr said we should leave well enough alone unless it begins hurting again. I'm for that, I do not want surgery. Meanwhile I will baby it along.\nAs for Carolyn, she still tells us as little as she can get by with. The last couple of times I have talked to her on the phone she has sounded pretty good, altho she admits she is tired and is resting more. She still has not learned her tumor markers nor liver enzymes according to her. I think I would remember and insist on knowing??? \nChuck seems to be in terrible pain again, but insists he will be better soon. We are leaving for the airport to pick up Chris who is coming for another week, then he wants to go to an auction site and look at the equipment that will be auctioned tomorrow.Sure hope there isn't anything to catch his eye or he will want to go back tomorrow and It is a 2 hr drive from here.

      "Content": " I guess I should come back and say the radiation did not help him any. He was so sure it would but yet it seems to have made him feel more pain. The day before we went for radiation he was in so much pain in his chest even the hospice nurse called 911. There were no signs that it was his heart but we wondered if the gall bladder had kicked up again. Seems neither was the problem. The ER doc said he felt it was the mets in the sternum causing the pain. So we came back home from the local hospital and got up and under way to FW at 7 the next morning for the radiation. The rads dr hit the sternum, the hip and a new place on the femur with the heavy duty one dose radiation. We got signed back into hospice so he could be helped by them again. He really seems to hurt a lot. Yesterday he was trying to remove a long screw and it took three times at least of lying back down in his bed and getting up to take a few more turns. I got him a laptop some time ago but he wanted a printer to use in his room, so we got that and he was trying to fit it to the desk three feet from his bed, so that was why he was trying to take out the screw. Now this is the guy who swears he is going to use a new shop to work on his farm machinery this winter. He met with the guy to close in the shop and insisted on giving him a check for half the amount. OK now where is the man? Haven't heard from him again. It's only been a week but he said he wasn't busy and could get to it right away. Grrrrrr If he had just listened to me and waited until he was feeling better. But no he wanted to be ready to go when he was feeling good. And Carolyn is just as stubborn. Things do not sound good with her, but don't tell her that. She had bloodwork done on Wed and they were to call her with tumor markers and liver enzymes. No call but she got a letter in the mail they were going to do another CT scan. Why the letter????? Why no call????? Chris will be back next week for another week. Bless her, she is such a big help. Amy is resting at home waiting until we need her again. Meanwhile I am trying to rest and not do too much. Hugs MK\n ",

One of my favorite quotes from the Bible and I am no scholar for sure goes something like this, God takes care of even the little sparrows. Another, everything works out for the best. Chuck is doing ok. His pain has not lessened, he still can't be out of bed for any length of time because he can't walk nor sit for very long.\nOK I had the MRI on my knee. You know how everyone complains about\n the tech not telling you anything? Well the tech told me there was something there that was not just what the dr suspected, something else that might need to be taken care of soon. She said to make an appointment for my followup with the dr, but be sure they had a good phone number to call me if the dr needed to see me sooner. She said once the radiologist reads the MRI he may contact the dr and the dr may need to call. OK that's great, what could it possibly be? We know there is a Baker's cyst, we know the bursa is very tender to touch and the dr suspected a miniscular tear, but she said it was none of those, something new. The crazy part is that my knee is not hurting nearly as bad as it did. I told her that and she asked if I was babying it. Well, of course I am, I don't want it to hurt like it did before. The thing that keeps running in my mind is bone mets. Does an MRI show that? A blood clot way inside my knee? That would cause immediate concern. Who knows? But I am following my own advice and not worrying until I have something to worry about\n.\nOur son showed up at the door Monday evening completely by surprise. He goes home tomorrow, so this morning we are meeting Carolyn and Erica and family that can be there for breakfast at IHOP. We have over an hour's travel to get there, Carolyn has chemo at 11 so we are meeting on her way to town. Erica has school and this was the only time we could all be together. Chuck most likely will want to stay home, and I worry about\n leaving him for so long. He will be ok if he doesn't do something stupid like decide to go outside and the dogs get out around him, which is easy for them to do. Three Hospice people were here yesterday at one time. It is not likely any of them will be back today. \nOK it is 5 am and I woke up at 3 thinking of things I needed to remember before I leave this morning. They are done, so I decided to look at the computer. Mistake, huh? No more sleep this morning. I will go back and lie down now, tho.\nHugs MK\n ",

He wanted me to take him to auctions last week. One was 100 miles away so I told him I was not driving two hours for him to tell me he wanted to go back home because he hurt. He can lie down in the back seat of the van so he could probably travel ok. But there is no way he can go to an auction. Then he insisted on the van keys to go get the mail another day, while he was out he drove down the road to see our other field and by the time he got back he was shaking really bad. He is traveling back and forth from the kitchen to his room, a good 85 feet many times a day. Yes he uses a walker or a cart to push or the wheelchair once in awhile but by the time he gets back to bed he is hurting terribly. The Rx has helped clear his mind but he still believes he had a several men in his room at various times. I'm sure he hid some things we can't find like his set of the car keys so they wouldn't get them. He swears he didn't but that the men were there. I can't convince him otherwise. It is a struggle to take care of him because he feels better and thinks he will be all better soon. Deniall, denial, denial.............. My knee is back to hurting so I am calling dr today for another Cortisone shot. Hope he will give me one. Love you, MK\n ",

      "Content": " IMHO there is not an unnecessary biopsy. Perhaps there are unnecessary mastectomies, but that is a choice made by the patient and doctor at the time with the facts known. I probably had one of those, but it was my choice. If I knew then what I know now I would have chosen a lumpectomy over a mastectomy, but that is not your question. Calcifications that cluster are problematic, they can be cancer beginning. It is said to take seven years for a lump to form so that it can be seen in a film. I find it interesting that your calcifications are linear in appearance. A biopsy is nothing in the big picture. It can be a needle biopsy or even a surgical biopsy, but neither one are a big deal to go through despite what a few think. If the surgeon thinks it is necessary, please follow his advice. It is better to err on the side of caution. Hugs MK\n ",

Many have shared the wait and worried, but I always say \"Don't worry until you know you have something to worry about\n!\" The pathologist will have a good bit of information from the biopsy which will give the doctors and surgeons what they need to advise you as to surgery and treatment. Chemotherapy is making great strides. My daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer which metastasized to her bone marrow. This is not a common mets and has been virtually untreatable, but with new chemo drugs her bone marrow is now clear of cancer. She is still taking chemo weekly just because it is so new for this to happen the oncologist doesn't know what would happen if they stopped chemo. I tell you this in answer to your question about\n living after breast cancer. There is no answer because everyone is different and the strides being made today in medicine gives much more chance of a longer lifetime. I was diagnosed in Oct 96 and have had no problem with cancer since. One of our friends here I think is past her 25th year. My daughter-in-law's mother was diagnosed in her 40s and is now 90 with Altzheimer's. Just do what the doctor's and you think is right for you, keep on truckin' and we'll help all we can.

She had a mastectomy with her orginal diagnosis and then chemo because she was younger. She had a recurrence eight years later which was over two years ago now. Some cancer cells grow faster than others. Generally they say it takes seven or eight years for a lump to form, so you can see one more month would not make a difference. The ultrasound lady should not have said anything to you about\n scheduling surgery. Usually they say nothing as they are supposed to do.\nAltzheimer's is the disease of the brain that usually affects old people. People joke about\n having \"old timers\" when they are forgetful, etc.\nWhen you get the results of your biopsy ask for a copy of the report and tell us what it says. We will maybe be able to help you interpret it.\nHugs MK\n ",

I had two benign lumps over the past 20 years before this one, so yes I was pretty faithful to having my annual test and I still am with my remaining breast. I did not have chemo or radiation. I was 58, there was no node involvement and basically it was a Stage 1. It supposedly takes about\n seven years to form a lump to be seen in a film. That is an average of course.

      "Content": " Jo-Ann is probably one of the longest living stage IV survivors. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer over 12 years ago she was given 9 months to live. She had very strong chemo and double radiation, treated very agressively for that time period. Remember chemo has changed a lot even in 12 years. After a couple of years Jo-Anne had a second breast cancer that was totally different from the first. She had a mastectomy and that was her only treatment for that cancer. She has other health problems now like diabetes, some artery blockage, etc. She is now 60ish. AND she just drove to Florida from Texas, took a cruise and is wending her way back home visiting in SC, GA and God knows where. Nothing keeps her down.\nMy daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer in 99, had one round of chemo was not Stage IV at that time, but 8 years later cancer was found in lymph nodes and bones, then went to bone marrow. She has been treated with chemo weekly since the bone marrow was found and was clean for a year or so, but now it is back. The chemo was changed and she is still is functioning far more than anyone would expect. Avastin was one of the drugs that kept her clean for that year plus. She was 39 when first diagnosed.\nMy husband was diagnosed this year with lung cancer. He had no symptoms, but bone mets were found during an injury to his chest. He has really bad mets to his sternum and the pain has been horrible. Chemo didn't do much for him, but radiation to his sternum kept him pain free for a few months in that area. He is now on Hospice care but insists he will be up and working again next spring. We have a small farm we bought for his retirement.\nEach person is different. Each treatment reacts differently to the individual. I hope your wife is able to conquer the pain and the spread for several years. I'm sure you have heard that breast cancer, actually all cancers are being treated like diabetes as a chronic disease that must be watched, tested and treated the rest of your life. I was lucky in the cancer area, I was diagnosed at 58 with breast cancer and have had no more signs of it, but have other health issues now at 71 that makes life difficult. I am thankful for my situation and would gladly trade places with my daughter. I hate seeing all these young women being diagnosed.\nGive her a hug for me, Mary K.\n ",

We are going to put our tree up today, I guess. It is up to the two of us again after years of kids, grand kids, etc. decorating it for us. Christmas Day is going to be just the two of us, too, and I asked DH what he wanted for dinner, meaning, \"Do I have to fix the turkey in the freezer?\" He said he thought bacon, eggs and home fries sounded good. Hey sounds good to me, too. So between today and tomorrow I have to make some Jello salads and rolls for tomorrow's dinner. I think I can handle that. \nCarolyn is still feeling good. Chris has not yet gotten the report of her biopsies. My mother sinks deeper into lala land all the time. Last night I told her I had made Poteca, a Slavian nut roll bread that she made year after year for Christmas and she asked what it was. I described it and she said she didn't remember making it. Sad, sad, sad. She was still doing some baking five years ago. At least she is in no pain and somewhat happy, except she hates for anyone to tell her what to do. A woman who has been controlling and bossy for all her life doesn't like it when someone tells her what to do, imagine that? LOL\nI still have not sent out one card and it is too late for Christmas, maybe next month I will get an early start on next years????? I just don't manage to do what I used to do.\nMerry Christmas to all of you and best wishes for a Happy, Healthful New Year! \nLove and hugs, \nMK\n ",

AND sometimes letters are faster than phone calls if you don't use an answering machine. When I got my call back in 96, they did call on the phone, but they called the house and I was at work during the week, then I was out of town on a business trip for nearly a week, too. So by the time the letter reached me it had been nearly three weeks since my mammo. Oh well, it was cancer, but it was very early. I opted for a mastectomy, did not have any chemo or radiation and have been cancer free since. So don't worry until you know you have something to really worry about\n. We are here when you get some answers. A biopsy is best to find out all you need to know to make decisions if they need to be made. Take your time. I wish someone would have told me that. I was so frightened I hurried into the mastectomy decision and probably a lumpectomy would have been sufficient. We do care around here and will try to give you straight, thoughtful insight.

It is benign which is good but I am guessing that some of the fancy words could mean changes in the tissue and possibly the concern is more changes in the future could mean a change to malignant. Now that is a pure guess on my part, I am not going to pretend to know for sure. BUT I bet your doctor or the surgeon you see will be glad to elaborate on the wording. Do see a surgeon and get the thing removed, if it isn't right I think you would want it out. And at that size if it leaves a dimple in your breast when removed, it will fill in unless you are a really, really thin person. I had quite a large dimple that was gone in a year or less.

That's why we always say to have the biopsy done. Your cancer has been staged with the pathology report. You can have a copy of that report and have it explained to you. Of course it is best if it is not in the lymph nodes but that still does not mean that it has 'gone all over your body' yet. Left alone without treatment that would have happened most likely. My daughter was 39 when she was diagnosed, no lymph nodes were positive, yet in eight years it was found in lymph nodes and bones. HOWEVER she was not good about\n her follow up checkups and mammos and it worried me over those eight years. Do everything you can to fight and be sure to follow up. There are many women with breast cancer who do well with some pretty bad sounding beginning diagnosis. Cancer is now being treated like a chronic illness and treatment improves all the time.

Any difference in the feel of the breast should be evaluated by a doctor and lumps should be biopsied always. That is the only way to tell whether cancer is present or not. Pregnancy fuels breast cancer. My daughter was diagnosed at age 39, had a mastectomy and all seemed fine for eight years, then recurrance. It settled into her bone marrow which is nasty. Her onc put her on one chemo and after a year decided it really wasn't doing the job, so he put her on a new chemo drug she gets weekly for three weeks with one week off, then another drug is mixed in once a month. Lo and behold her last bone marrow test was clear!!!He is keeping her on the chemo because there is no known result and the fear is that it could come back even more aggressively. So this mother is very grateful for the advances that are being made in treatment. I am so sorry you lost your daughter. I always advocate young and old women have annual check ups. Hugs MK\n ",

Most likely a biopsy and a path report which will give the details if it is or isn't a cancer and type of cancer. Even if it is cancer, it can be removed and possibly radiation will be all that is necessary. Women of our age, I was 58 when cancer was found, rarely have aggressive cancer. I was really naive when I was diagnosed and told the surgeon if it was cancer showing in the frozen section which is done while the surgeon waits, to do a mastectomy. My cancer was the lowest on the scale of staging and I very easily could have done with a lumpectomy and radiation. So help her be informed. Don't jump the gun and make rush decisions. Come back and ask questions after the path report and we will share our experiences. Meanwhile chill out and be strong for your mom, she doesn't need you to be a basket case.

There is always a chance that the lump is benign, breasts change a lot during menopause, they soften so the lump could have been there from an old injury? It could very well be an early cancer that would require only a lumpectomy and some radiation with no further treatment ever needed. My aunt is an example of this, she had the lumpectomy about\n 25 years ago and is now 81 and doing just fine. I probably could have had the same but I opted for a mastectomy and have had no further cancer problems -- I was 58 then and am now 70. Then there is a chance that it could be cancer with more treatment needed, but the pathology report will tell that. I feel like the more aggressive cancers are unusual after 50, altho there are exceptions. So please just relax and wait until you know more. You will most likely have less to deal with than you are imagining. Hugs, MK\n ",

When I had my reconstruction I was given two units of blood that I had stored before surgery. So there is a great loss of blood. \nWith the family history you have I think I would do anything to help keep the breast cancer at bay. Unfortunately clean margins, etc. today still can mean recurrence in the future. With breast cancer there is no certainty of cancer free forever. I have passed 12 years without recurrence, but my daughter only managed eight years, we were both clear for those years. I am not saying that to frighten you, but to tell you to be extra vigilant in your exams, tests, etc. Incidently my daughter has a degree in fashion design but she worked in the manufacturing end and now is more into marketing. \nHope you will keep in touch.

If there are clusters why would anyone suggest you wait for six months? I just had a mammogram and then had a diagnostic mammogram, so I looked at my films a lot the past two weeks. I hardly had any white spots which indicate microcalcifications. I had a couple smeary looking white areas. The one they were focusing on was there last year and comparing the films they were trying to see if it changed. They decided not. I reminded the radiologist I had breast cancer, my daughter and an aunt also did and I would not mind a biopsy. He said it was not necessary and to come back in one YEAR not six months. \nHow about another opinion? Can you take your films to another doctor and have another opinion? I would offer to have a biopsy if I were you. That is the only real way to tell if there is cancer, not playing guessing games. I believe there is a connection with uterine cancer and breast cancer. If there is, I would think you would want to be sure.\nHugs of welcome, Mary K (MK)\n ",

He just took the car to the end of the drive to get the papers, yesterdays and todays because I never got out there yesterday. What a difference a few hours makes. Tomorrow is a test for us, home health nurse 8:30, leave for FW 9:00, see surgeon 10:45 about\n the port, blood work 12:15, and then the long drive back home.

This is a woman about\n your age who has mets to the bone from breast cancer. She has been fighting this disease for over nine years and has had several surgeries to remove diseased bone and replaced with steel rods. She has had chemo and lost her hair something like six times. She has been fighting for her life--now compare that to not having a biopsy because of a fear of a little needle. Oh yes, I know horror stories, I have one of my own to tell--I got contaminated sutures during surgery in 1997 and live with a hernia the size of a nine month pregnancy with twins because I had to have all my abdominal muscles surgically removed. I can't stand for more than a few minutes wearing binders, compression suit and various other methods of holding my intestines from falling any further. IV antibiotics kept me alive for nearly a year while the doctors tried to save my abdomen. I walked around my home with a fanny pack with a pump to deliver the antibiotics. I never liked needles much, either, and a PIC line is no fun, but I would rather be alive. I understand fear but I don't understand why anyone would prefer to face possible consequences that could lead to a painful death rather than conquering that fear. Besides there are drugs that could make you sleepy and possibly ease the fear. I just do not understand how you could not do something to remove the fear from your life. So I guess we will have to agree to disagree..................... MK age 70\n ",

Do you really think that a test would be so bad and the medical professional would be so heartless? This test takes the place of a biopsy to make things easier for you certainly not worse. Going into something so frightened serves no purpose. I suggest you talk to your doctor about\n doing a regular biopsy if you really believe this horror story. Even masstectomy surgery is not as bad as you described, perhaps you could plan for that and you would never have to face a steriodactic biopsy ever. If I sound like a smart aleck, believe me your \"friend\" telling you all this makes me feel like one. That person needs a good talking to, especially if they know your medical history.

Yes, I think you have more than your share to deal with, too. \nThe tests on Tuesday showed a tumor in the lung, middle lobe right next to sternum which is where a lot of his pain has been. The sternum, sacrum, rib and spine all have bone mets. He can't get comfortable any place or in any position. They have doubled his Morphine yet again, now 60 mg q 8 h. Today we went to see PA and onc. PA will be in close touch for pain help. They also gave him Morphine drops with instant relief to put on his tongue or in a drink to work when tablets with time release seem to be too spread out. Next Wed he will have a head scan to check vessels for chemo. A port will be put in hopefully next week also. Chemo will begin shortly thereafter. They are giving him Avastin, Carboplatin, and Taxol as well as Zometa for bones. \nMore when I know more. Hugs MK\n ",

He hurts worse after chemo so we hope that means it is doing something. He takes carboplatim for his lung tumor and it leaves a metallic taste in his mouth because it is metallic compounds. This week he only has lab work so it will be done by the visiting nurse and no trip to Fort Worth. Then the next week it is time for Zometa again. +My PS is right up the street and I have an appointment to see him for annual visit to keep up my insurance policy from work while Chuck is getting his ZZZZ. That was a great benefit from working and leaving under disability, my term insurance of $50,000 stays in force as long as I am disabled. \nChuck wants chicken noodle soup for supper and since he is gluten free I have to make noodles. I keep them in the freezer but they aare just about\n gone, so I guess I will spend most of the afternoon making them. I have an extrusion attachment on my mixer which works well when the dough is right. Trouble is that I don't always get the same results when I make the dough. They taste good, tho.\nHugs, MK\n ",

I remember how much you were anticipating her birth. \nWell things got crazier since I posted above. Even though the family dr said the test showed no myeloma, the oncologist she talked to put him in the hospital for more tests. He had another head to pelvis MRI, sixteen Xrays and a bone marrow test. The bone marrow again said no cancer, but altho he was discharged after those tests, the onc wants to do a CT guided biopsy next of his ribs. He is still in terrible pain even taking morphine tablets. We are waiting for the test to be done.\nI have my mammo today. Chrissy's latest scrapings, etc. still show no cancer for her.

My daughter and I were both there and helpless to lift him. \nI don't know what they will do next. His heart and mind are willing but the body just won't cooperate.

Last week I had two dr appoints and then chemo and radiation for him which amounted to three trips to Fort Worth 140 miles round trip. Chemo was a 13 hour day. I had help on Saturday to get the house cleaned, then yesterday I spent every minute I could in bed resting myself. Whine, whine! Golden years??? Bah humbug! Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Hey Jessie! Celebrating any anniversary is good!!!!! How are you doing? Are you still under treatment? Carolyn had to change chemos this summer. Xeloda was not doing it. She seems to be strong and doing really well on this new stuff. No bad side effects and her blood count is holding its own. She had four transfusions before going on the new chemo and that brought the count to near normal. So I hope you are feeling as well and as strong as she is. \nOur 51st anniversary was yesterday. Notice I didn't say we celebrated. LOL Chuck watched football games and I read and messed around on the computer. He had leftover chili for dinner. I found some special deals on Amazon and bought some Knorr Cream Soup Base, so I made some cauliflower cheese soup that didn't turn out well enough to serve to company. The taste was fine, but the texture was like very, very runny mashed potatoes with a million little lumps in it. The recipe said to put the cauliflower in the blender and I was too lazy to get it out, so I tried mashing. Didn't work. Maybe today I will strain the soup and use a hand blender and see if that will work. Otherwise I will eat lumpy soup for a few days. \nTake care, love MK\n ",

      "Content": " I guess my answer to you is that we all would like to know the answer to your questionl Breast cancer is being treated like a chronic disease. Most women have chemo type drugs until they no longer work, then try another kind. Is your mother not seeing an oncologist? Estrogen type therapy??? Estrogen feeds many kinds of breast cancer. There is another drug Herceptin that is a hormone type but it only works on some, also. I am way over my head here. My daughter has breast cancer that was in her bone marrow and two types of chemo have given her a bone marrow test cancer free, however her oncologist keeps her on the weekly chemo so it has no chance of recurring. I would find the best oncologist available for my mother for an assessment. Breast cancer is not to be treated lightly. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " She saw the oncologist yesterday who told her she had 30-35% chance of recurrence if she did nothing.  If she has chemo two times a week every other week, it would make the odds 20%.  He did not push her strongly to have chemo, telling her it was her choice.  She has no clue what to do.  Since chemo is different for colon cancer, and I have no experience at  chemo for breast cancer,  I hesitate to advise her.  I told her how we discuss the percentages around here, that it takes highs and lows to end up at the average.  If she is in the higher range of chance of recurrence, it would be better to be getting chemo.  Finally I suggested that she begin chemo and if she finds it intolerable she can always stop.  I didn't think to tell her to ask about\n the path report, whether the cancer was aggressive.  I will tell her to ask about\n that today.  She said she has an appointment next week to decide.  Bear in mind that she is 69 years old.  She is in good health except for arthritis and bum knees from her althletic background, as far as she knows. Last winter she had a bout with something they thought was a fungus in her lung.  What makes me rather angry is that no doctor has ever told her she should have a colonoscopy.  Her tumor was the size of a baseball and weighed 1 1/2 lbs.  You would think she would have felt it, but she didn't.   Anyhow, if anyone has any ideas as to what to tell her, please let me know.  Hugs MK\n ",

There are some pictures and some good info there but it takes a long time to find it.\nSorry about\n your mom. As I have mentioned in other posts my daughter has breast cancer and has bone mets and bone marrow mets. It is harder to deal with a loved one's cancer than your own. Having a four year old will make it difficult when you have treatment with your mom so sick, too. I hope you have a big family that can help. We won't mention the heartless idiot who left you alone to deal with so much, although it sounds like it was before your diagnosis. \nWe'll give you support here if you come and post and tell us what is happening with you. So many young women have been through so much. I wish breast cancer (and all the other cancers) would be eliminated from our llives.\nHugs, Mary K.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Candy, thanks for your thoughts and prayers. I know you are worrying about\n your husband and daughter, too. I will keep all of you in my prayers, also. \nMy husband has had some issues, too, for about\n eight weeks he has been crippled up. He has constant pain whether he sits, lies down or walks. The dr seems to think it is his back and has ordered an MRI which will be done next week. He also has pain in his rib cage on both sides and hears a strange sound when he moves which he describes as a popping sound. So she also ordered a bone scan for next week. \nStella's (best friend) daughter has MS also. She went into the Army after high school and recently went to a VA hospital rather than civilian care where they did a great work up on her which has helped a lot. They told her she should have done that before she had so much damage and they could have helped her. \nMy mother broke her hip last fall and healed like a young woman. She is getting more and more frail but still in good health. She will be 96 in May. Her mind is back in the days of her youth mostly. She still thinks great, adds great, plays cards and bingo and wins prizes, but she talks about\n her brothers and sisters and living at home with Mom and Dad rather than talking of my Dad and our childhood. But that's ok, as long as she is content. She seems to be and says she is well taken care of, well fed and comfortable.\nSometimes we do think we have a lot on our plate, but then we look around us and see those with much more. I take pleasure in watching the birds and occasional glimpses of wildlife I can see out my kitchen window. Hummingbirds came back last night, so now we have a feeder hanging for them alongside of the Finch feeders in our window. These tiny birds remind me of the smallest wonders of God's universe.\nBig hugs back,\nMK\n ",

He had a bone marrow biopsy, umpteen Xrays, a head to toe MRI and he put him on morphine for the pain, Prednisone to help with inflammation. Saturday when the oncologist he was seeing was not on call a colleague of his gave Chuck the results of the bone marrow test and said \"No cancer!\" He discharged him. Well that is great news and it was nice that he could come home, BUT no one addressed the pain issue. So he really suffered Sat night, all day yesterday and I haven't seen him yet this morning. Soon as the doctor's office \nopens we have to get some answers and some pain medication and I guess steroids. The rib problem is a break that is not healed properly, he managed to have hiccups for two days which really exacerbated the problem. The back issues are still very painful. He looks like an old man trying to get around. Well, he is an old man. LOL!\nMeanwhile I still have the mammo to look forward to on Wednesday. Such a great life when you get old.\nHugs MK\n ",

You can go to work the next day if you choose. I wouldn't because of the anesthesia, but pain is minimal and healing is easy. Radiation would be most likely minimal for this, yes, you said five days. I would also quit HRT immediately. I don't think the hormones help anyone who is a possible candidate for breast cancer.

We have all the extras, Medicare is paying for the electric hospital bed. I bought an electric wheelchair, a bedside potty chair and two rolling walkers. One for him and one for me. I have help every Sat to clean now, she is helping with changing the beds and some laundry. Fortunately we have pretty good retirement so we don't qualify for a lot of the extras through Medicaid. The Home Health Care people told me that Hospice provides lots more in the servics than they can but then he has not been put on hospice care. Yesterday I took him into Fort Worth for lab work and his Zometa which is on a different schedule than the chemos. I drove an hour and a half with him lying on the back seat of the van. Parked and took my walker into the building to leave it and get a wheelchair for him. Pushed him in, got my walker and went up on elevator. I had made prior arrangements for him to go to the only bed on the chemo floor, so I got him there. They did labs and gave him the Zometa and helped him down to the van and we came back home, another hour and a half. On the way we stopped for a hamburger. I came home and went to bed for a rest and fell asleep for a little while. Then it was suppertime. So it goes, each day seems to disappear more quickly than the last one. He shows no sign of getting better pain wise even though he has had two radiations (mega doses) and two full chemos. His pain meds were changed last week to Methadone. Thanks for listening. It does help. I have had my cup of coffee so I am going back to bed to rest a bit more before getting up and dressed. Hugs MK\n ",

Building a shop and buying a hoist to hold him up while he works is expensive but he is trying to convince me it would add value to the property. Hmmm, let's wait until the round of tests after the first three chemos and 2 rads. Remember four or five years ago they wanted to do a prostate biopsy and he was going to refuse because if they found cancer, he would not do anything anyhow? I got so angry with him I really let him have it. As he told everyone I rolled 46 years of marriage into a 45 minute ass chewing. And I did. LOL He is feeling a little better pain wise until he moves his hips, he must really have a big problem there. He is moving a little more now, so maybe the radiation treatment is working. Did you meet Chris when we met in Cincy? She was there a few times with me, since I had to rely on her driving. Hugs MK\n ",

I think it is because they don't want to face it either, so it is good to hear from you. Of course you know what cancer can do. It sounds like you are going through a lot yourself and now having to deal with your wife's situation must be extremely difficult. I will keep you both in my thoughts and prayers.\nKrisha, you were very smart to have a baseline. I hope you explain to your husband the importance of the doctor having a film to compare to each time you have a mammogram. That is what a baseline is all about\n. It is the very best way to take care of your body so you can live a longer and fuller life. Tell him it is not that you were looking for cancer, you were preparing for the future. Men and woman are different worriers. He doesn't want to chance knowing you have a problem. Just because you are getting a call back doesn't mean that there is anything wrong.  It may only be a shadow or something they couldn't define in the original films.  Even if there is a lump there is a great chance it is benign.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Oh Bernadette!!! I can't believe this! I think it is time your husband sees a regular doctor and have a good health check up for the reason he breaks bones so easily. Has anyone mentioned this to him? There are several medical reasons that could cause bone breaks, the first of which that comes to me is Celiac Disease. The is a condition that only requires eating a gluten free diet. Wheat products are a no no. My husband was diagnosed a year ago last Feb. He has had symptoms for years and broke several bones over the years, and not as quickly as twice in three months. He was very anemic when they started doing tests. As soon as he quit eating wheat products, his blood went back to normal and he gained weight and looks great now. I recently met a woman who broke both her arms and a leg and then they determined she was a Celiac. She is 61 and was only diagnosed last year. We have two great nephews, little boys, who were recently diagnosed because of other problems not broken bones. But a good complete blood test would be the best way to see if all is well with your husband. Three months off his feet and how long was it before? Gees that is rough. He better get a job he can do sitting or lying down. You take care of yourself, too. Getting over tired and stressed is not helpful\nBig Hugs, MK\n ",

You might try that approach, it worked with Mother. Now tho she is 95 and her mind is nothing like it used to be. \nShe is still fiesty and does not like to be told what to do. She was talking to me on the phone and her monitor went off, a male nurse came to shut it off and asked her to move up on her bed further. She answered him in a very nasty tone, telling him she didn't like to be told what to do. OK so he leaves her room and within a minute the monitor is beeping again. He came back and told her if she moved up like he asked her the monitor would not beep again. So she said, \"Oh OK\" and moved right up. No more beeping during the conversation. The bad part is that the same scenario can play over and over and she doesn't remember what causes the beep. It is to alert\n the nurses she is getting up because of her broken hip fall.\nprayers for you and your mom,\nMK\n ",

Next to the muscle is a rather critical area for surgery, preferably keeping from any removable of muscle. 5-6 mm is very small!!! 2.54 cm equals 1 inch. \nThere is a connection between breast cancer and cervical, uterine, ovarian cancers.

My younger daughter has been watched by a breast specialisst very carefully ever since. Yet her regular PAP test came back just a few weeks ago showing granular cells that are cancer. She now has an appointment with a GYN oncologist for the 16 of this month.

I tell you this so you will talk to the oncologist and if one chemo is causing miserable side effects others can be tried.\nAs to the Potassium, are you buiying it over the counter? Do you watch the dosaage in the bottles? I was taking one 500 mg per day and had to increase to two a day because I had terrible cramps mostly in my legs and thighs.

There are many studies that suggest different causes and different things that might cause the risk to be less. BUT everyone one of those suggestions can be torn apart by someone with breast cancer. For example breast feeding is supposedly a good deterrent and yet I know a number of women with breast cancer who not only nursed but nursed until the kids were two or over. A good diet is another deterrent, lots of fruit and vegetables and low fat. Well, again that can be cut down. If we knew what would prevent breast cancer there would be a lot fewer women being diagnosed today, yet the numbers are growing all the time. The best thing to do is to keep current with mammograms, doctor's exams and self exams. If you have a history in your family be sure to have a base mammogram early so that it can be used for comparison. Does that help any? Maybe some of the others will have some better ideas. \nMK\n ",

I was a door mat far too long myself, we have been married now nearly 51 years but not all were pleasant for me.

Women have come and gone over those ten years, but some of us have hung around to try and help newbies. What quite frequently happens when you start posting is you find someone you relate to well and you become friends. I guess you will just have to read posts to find someone whose treatment sounds familiar or maybe you like the sound of their message. What though for repetition of posts by that person, because many just come post once and we never hear from them again. \nYou might mention your age, something of a history like married, kids, etc. What part of the country are you in? Staging of your cancer? All these things will help you find a special \"breast friend\". \nNow the questions you ask also can be answered more easily knowing your age. Many women have both breasts removed, especially if there is a problem in both of them or if there is a family history of breast cancer. Some have reconstruction and some do not, depending quite often on age. A younger woman would be more self assured perhaps with reconstruction. Older women are glad to live without bras and be comfortfortable. I had one breast removed and did not like the lopsided feeling with a prosthesis, so I had reconstruction then. \nLet us know what is happening.\nHugs mk\n ",

It likely had to do with my age and history of benign lumps. When my daughter was diagnosed two years after me, tho, I really began to worry that maybe I should have had something. She was advised she needed to go through chemo as a preventative for future, since she was only 39. I was given a Tamoxifen Rx but given a choice of taking it or not. After struggling with the side effects for six months I decided I chose not to take it. She was also prescribed Tamoxifen but had really bad depression while on it, which is never a problem for her normally. So she also quit taking it. So far we are both doing fine.

      "Content": " I can help with question Number 1. There are a lot of considerations making the decision for surgery. And surgery takes many forms. It is possible to have a surgical biopsy to remove the tumor followed by radiation or radiation and chemo. When a surgical biopsy is done it is possible that a sentinel node biopsy could also be done. Dye is injected to find the sentinel node leading from the cancer site to see if it has gone into the lymph system. Or a mastectomy may be recommended for many reasons including size of tumor. BTW when a tumor is quite large it is possible to have chemo first to shrink the tumor before surgery. The position of the cancer is another reason for a mastectomy. Close to the chest wall tumors require a mastectomy. The best thing for your sister to do is to learn all she can so she can make an informed choice, because she may have a choice. There is a lot of information about\n breast cancer out there on the internet. Some can be found right here on Healingwell. There are many books written with personal stories, factual details, etc. Just tell her not to overload, sometimes too much reading can scare you to death. We are here to help answer any questions.\nI don't know a thing about\n BCa. I know there are tests for tumor markers and some doctors don't believe they are accurate for breast cancer. Some doctors rely on them. My daughter recently told me of her tumor marker score which sounded really great compared to other numbers I have heard but I doubt the tests are the same because she has pretty serious Stage IV BC and the number seems to be lower than normals I have heard. I guess I need to ask her what kind of test it is.\nLooks like you have had a round of it with prostate cancer. My husband had very high numbers in his PSA test but showed no evidence of cancer in biopsies. Now his PSA has dropped back closer to normal, so go figure.\nGive your sister a hug from all of us.\nMK\n ",

      "Content": " I have a concern about\n the day surgery, also. There are many kinds of reconstruction and some are definitely not day surgery!!!! Possibly they are doing the mastectomy saving the nipple and outer skin and using an implant. I guess that could be considered day surgery but like you I think it is crazy to send people home so quickly!! My daughter had a mastectomy and reconstruction at the same time, but she had a tram flap which is taking the abdominal muscle and tunneling through the midriff area to make the breast. The outer skin is made from an elliptical shaped piece of skin from the abdomen and the result is a tummy tuck as a bonus. The next morning after her surgery a nurse came to change her bandage and bent her forward with such force that a blood vessel broke. If her doctor hadn't been making morning rounds, she could have bled to death internally. So conceivable someone could go home and do something to rupture a blood vessel, also. You'd think they would want vital signs for a couple of days at least. Keep us posted. MK\n ",

Her brest cancer had metastisized to her bones and then later to bone marrow. She recently had a series of tests to see how she is doing and the results will be discussed on July 9th with her oncologist. She was 39 when she had her mastectomy and chemo. She will be 49 in a few days. \nBelieve me it is harder to deal with a daughter's diagnosis than one of your own. I pray your daughter will do well.

But perhaps the dr will suggest a needle biopsy which is even easier. At any rate it will probably be a couple of weeks before you know anything for sure. Used to be when they did a surgical biopsy you signed papers for a mastectomy if it was found to be cancer while you were in surgery. That is what happened to me 12 years ago. It saved a lot of waiting and worrying, I guess, but sometimes a mastectomy was more than was necessary. So try not to worry. I didn't tell family, either until I had surgery.

I wrote to the CMs time after time begging for help to remove the problem when I was CL there but they were not interested, they liked the attention it gave the board. The numbers were great because of all the animosity. Then when I tried to do something I was ousted. Do you remember she even came over here to Healingwell and caused problems? That didn't last long, thanks to Peter. \nYou know I turned 70 the other day and I am really ready to turn over the moderator job here to someone else. Are you interested? Maybe if you came here to moderate your friends would come, too. Your MN board is not breast cancer related, tho, is it? Anyhow I would love to have you take over or even help if you'd prefer. Anyone else interested? All you have to do is write to administration and tell them your reasons, etc. \nAnd I say AMEN to Joyce's post!!!!\nHugs MK\n ",

You didn't say when you took your mom for treatment, etc., but I am assuming it was a good while ago and there are big changes in treatment and surgery today. In 1969 I had a lump, was put in the hospital immediately, had a lumpectomy and stayed for five days even when it was benign. Today they do needle biopsies to see if the lump is benign and if it is let it go. Sometimes chemo is done before surgery today to shrink the lump. The sonogram has been added as a testing tool because your breasts are more dense and lumps are sometimes hard to find in mammos. I can assure you that your wife's doctors are doing things in a good order and sound like they will take good care of her. \nPrayers and best wishes for the New Year to be good for you,\nMK\n ",

If you have a breast specialist in your area I think it would be a good idea that you make an appointment. They understand more about\n shadowing, lumps, calcifications, etc. than a family doctor and perhaps the radiologists. Do not just let it go and forget about\n it. Breast cancer is best treated found early. I don't mean to scare you but with family history I would be VERY careful of everything you find that might be chancey. Take care of yourself! Keep copies of all reports in a safe place and together. I am still looking for some reports I had that somehow got packed separately when we moved........... grrrr.

Last night when I was trying to read he saw the puppy in the mirror and stood on his hind legs barking like crazy. I couldn't get him to stop so I turned out the lights. He could still see the puppy, so then I blocked the mirror with a piece of cardboard. We are getting a lot of laughs and enjoyment from him, but sometimes I think I lost my mind getting a puppy even if he is an older puppy. We call him Wild Man but his name is Jimmy.

My daughter who never had the issues I had still complains about\n her midriff area hurting. That is where they tunnel the muscle cut from the abdomen up to your breast area to form the breast. I ran into more serious problems with contaminated sutures distributed by the major suture company. My abdominal area is one big hernia due to infection and all the antibiotics have taken have caused other health issues. My surgery was in 1997 and the contaminated sutures were supposedly recalled in 1995. I read recently that they are still being used in Iraq on our soldiers. The sad part is that this problem was kept so quiet no one knows about\n it. 20/20 had a show about\n it or I would never have known, either. Ask your surgeon if he knows about\n it. If not email me and I will tell you more. If you are reasonably healthy and active right now I would not mess with breasts. I am guessing you have to be over 50 to have a daughter with breast cancer. I was 58 when I had surgery almost 12 years ago and believe me it has aged my body if not my mind. Hugs, MK\n ",

Eleven years and you really had serious odds to beat! Carolyn still looks good and acts good. They tell her at the onc clinic she looks too good to have cancer. The onc told her her hair would thin but she shouldn't lose it. I bought her a Wrangler ball cap for her birthday that says \"I'm not too tough to wear pink!\" I know it is for a man but believe me Carolyn is tougher than a man. The only thing we have to deal with from her is a bad mood when someone tries to help her!!! She had a port put in yesterday and everyone offered to take her, but no she went alone. Then they made her call her husband to come get her so she wouldn't drive home alone. He got there, they wheeled her out and put her in his car. He drove across the parking lot to her car and she got in it and drove home. Last night when the medication wore off her port was hurting her. Stubborn???? \nYou take care of yourself. I am glad to hear you can relax and not worry about\n working anymore. Take it easy and get some good books.\nLove and hugs, \nMK\nPS To the others that posted, I appreciate your input, too!!

She takes a chemo pill that has terrible side effects, but somehow she keeps going and going and refuses to talk much about\n it all. She will have another bone marrow biopsy soon and a bone scan to see if the medication is doing any good at all. Her other regular blood and tumor marker tests show no real improvement. She won't share with anyone much about\n those tests. She doesn't want anyone to fuss over her. Good Lord the woman is stubborn. She will be 49 in July. How old is your mother? Keep us posted and let us know if you need any questions answered. Brain mets is really difficult! We had one friend here who lived with brain mets a couple of years and had several surgical treatments as well as chemo. She was a tough one hanging in and staying positive!

Lauri's advice is right, don't worry until you know you have something to worry about\n. We'll help all we can when you get some answers. It is always a good idea to get copies of your path results, test results, etc. and keep them in a safe place. What may be benign now could change in ten years and if you have the report you will know if it is the same area, etc. After I was diagnosed with breast cancer and my daughter also was diagnosed, I sent back for earlier reports and found that ten years before my benign lump was in the cancer site. Drs used to keep reports and details from their patients, but today you are allowed to know all the details and have copies. Hugs MK\n ",

Here she with clogged arteries, diabetes that goes haywire and she is worried about\n the spots. I worry about\n her driving, keeping those grandkids that are continuously coming for her to watch and feed and care for. And she is screaming from Shakespeare, \"Out darn spot\" or something like that. I think we need to just all have a fun visit and calm her down. She'll do fine after a visit from her friends to get her through this onc visit. She has been through so much, these spots are not going to wear her down. \nMy husband even has offered to go get her to come for a visit. Now is that a shocker??? This is the guy who has no time to do much other than fix farm equipment and dream about\n green fields next year and he is willing to drive four hours to get her and four hours to take her home. Can you believe it? The Deere is about\n ready to run, so she could even drive it if she felt like it. LOL. He also has a Farmall/IH now. And the boat has been safely transported to her new home on the farm. As he pulled it out across the field to store it in the building, the wind was blowing and the grass was waving.

You need to be careful in using the arm in the correct way, because you could cause swelling known as lymphedema. But you do need to exercise and keep the arm limber. Has no one talked to you about\n lymphedema and how to exercise? If not contact the American Cancer Society in your area. They have women who will visit you and show you what to do unless you live in a very rural area. Your doctor should have already discussed this with you. One of the exercises is to simply squeeze a small ball in your hand, kind of like a stress remover, which would not hurt you either. Another is to walk your fingers up a wall and each day try to go a little higher, but do this slowly not all at one time. You know I bet you could find the exercises explained on the internet by Googling. Take care, try not to stress out. Who is with you most? Are they calm and helpful or are they stressed and worried?

The other insurances will work with SS. My disability from work paid 65% of my salary minus what SS paid me. A private disability policy should have nothing to do with either of the others and should pay what it states they will pay in addition to them. So from what I can see you should be all set, just do it. In fact, with SS you can phone and get it started that way. I never went to the office during application. I had to go for a hearing but that was only because no one had really ever heard of my problem before. My daughter is talking about\n applying but has not done it yet. She lost her SS card and has to go in person because of that. Make that call today!!!!! No sense dragging yourself through a day of work. Fatigue won't help you battle the new BB.

I hope you do come back more often after the New Year, some of us oldies are getting slower and slower. I don't know that it is a burn out, but after nearly ten years of posting I find it difficult to be as enthusuastic as I once was. Merry Christmas to you and yours.\nLauri it is always good to hear from you. Hope you have a wonderful white Christmas in all that snow. It is beautiful but I sure don't miss trying to get around in it. Today I must get my packages wrapped and finish up last minute stuff. We are going to Carolyn's tomorrow to \nopen packages with all of her family. Her recurrence is looking extremely bad, so we are trying to make this a special Christmas while she still feels well. She wanted us there, because we told her we would do whatever she wanted. We are surprising her with a player piano. She used to have one that she rented and loved it. Erica found a great one for us to buy for her, so we all pitched in and did our part. I hope she is as happy as we think she will be!!!! \nHugs and love to all, MK\n ",

If you remember she is also 95 and has now been in a home for three years. She thinks it has been just a matter of days or weeks sometimes. She was getting very aggressive towards the workers, too, and they threatened to kick her out. I asked about\n giving her some antidepressant that helps control rage and between her doctor and the admin at the home they worked it out. She is much more pleasant to deal with, altho she still gets a bee in her bonnet every once in awhile. Why the people at the home didn't suggest medication sooner, I will never know. They have lots of patients on it. It doesn't sedate her at all. It just takes the edge off her temper which has never been good. \nI hope your trips are for short periods, you may take on more than you can manage if they are long. I would love to have my mother visit me, she is 1300 miles away, but I know anything more than two days would have me worn to a frazzle. It is too expensive to fly her here with someone else to watch over her for just a couple of days. But as I sit on the patio and watch the beautiful birds I think of how much she would enjoy it. Or would have enjoyed it. I am not sure she is really too interested in much of anything these days. She does play cards with some of the women at the home, but she won't read, watch TV or even walk out in the garden at the home. She does crosswords and plays Solitaire mostly. I call her every night and she seems most appreciative of my calls. It gives her something to count on each night, I guess. \nTake care of yourself, first!!! \nHugs MK\n ",

I would guess that it is milk glands growing as you mature into a woman. Where there is no use for milk glands they disappear. So don't be concerned, but you do need to make a habit of knowing your breasts as they change and then if a lump does show up you will recognize that it is not supposed to be there. Usually if you can feel a lump it feels like a hard pea, but not always. Take care and have a Merry Christmas. Mk\n ",

My daughter and I both had breast cancer within two years of one another, I was first. We both had negative nodes and seemed to be doing great, but at eight years she found a lump in her neck. Her breast cancer has spread to her bone marrow which is not a good prognosis, but she still seems to be living a normal life except for being very tired and having some side effects from the oral chemo she is on. She is amazing to all of us in the family. Meanwhile I am cancer free with other issues of old age and compromised immune system. \nI guess the best advice is to carry on the best you can stay as upbeat and positive as you can. If you feel depression coming on, get some medication. Many of us take antidepressants in varying strengths to help us along. \nAnd as Lori says plan on living a long full and cancer free life.\nHugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, I am near your age and had a mastectomy in 1996 at 58. I have had no problem with a return of breast cancer. My first question is why would a doctor suggest you do nothing? At 67 depending on your other health issues you could have many years left, and you say you are in good health. If there are other issues at all you might try the Avista. but a double mastectomy would be certainly the best chance of living long as you would without breast cancer. Mastectomy surgery is really not as bad as it sounds. Recovery from it takes a few weeks and it is not real painful. The worse part for me was trying to lie down to sleep. I slept in a recliner for a couple of weeks. Not all woman have that problem, tho. As for reconstruction, that is really the most painful surgery, takes a long recovery if you go the tram flap route. I can't speak for implants. But at 67 do you really need breasts? I was lop sided with only one breast which was why I chose surgery. If I had known then what I know now, I would have wished for double mastectomy and no reconstruction and lived braless!!! You can get prosthesis for dress up, etc. \nOK You wanted opinions, you have mine. I hope you will get some others, too.\nHugs, Mary K.\n ",

I think all of us feel that way about\n the Louisville trip, it was so great we never could get interest in having another. \nI'm sorry you lost close touch with Becky's family. Since you are going to move I would think it would be a good reason to check in again. My grandson and his family live in North Fort Meyers where he is Student Pastor of the First Christian Church. I know that is not real close to Orlando but you never know, if you run into someone with the same last name as I have ask. \nPlease come back again just to check in. We are around. I think that we have just gotten a little more involved in every day life and don't spend so much time here anymore.\nBig hugs to you and yours, MK\n ",

Most young women hear, \"you are too young to have breast cancer\" and no one does a thing to make sure. Hopefully that fallacy is being laid to rest, there is no age limit on breast cancer, we have learned that here. I had a lump at 29 which was removed and benign. I had another lump at 49, also removed and benign. At 58 I was diagnosed with breast cancer, caught it early and all is well there. The important part is to make sure you have annual physicals and do self exams. I have two grand daughters who are grown young ladies and both their grandmothers have had breast cancer, too. I know they are concerned just like you are, and rightly so. Take care of yourself and don't let anyone back you down. Keep seeking the answers. And let us know the outcome of this, we care.

I can't really think of any questions until you know what you are dealing with. I would just advise you to be firm in asking for removal and don't let anyone talk you into waiting and watching. \nCan something benign turn into cancer later one? Hmmm does anyone have an answer to that? I had a B9 tumor removed in 87 and in 96 I had a cancerous tumor in the same area. I had copies of the lab results from both so I am sure the first one was benign. Supposedly cancers grow about\n six or seven years to the size they can be found. So I guess we can draw our own conclusions.\nJust stay on top of everything and make decisions you are happy with.\nHugs MK\n ",

So far it seems she is doing well on treatment. I was diagnosed two years before she was and have been what we call NED. No evidence of disease. I would gladly trade places with her, but that is not the way it works. Then there is my mother, 94, healthy but a little feeble and her mind is not the greatest. She doesn't enjoy living and wants to die. \nBelieve me it is harder to deal with breast cancer in loved ones than it is your own. Being there for your brother and letting him know you love him and his family is as important as anything. Every hospital has a social worker who should be able to answer some questions for you. They should be contacting your brother, too. \nWhat I don't understand is why they would do the brain surgery when it was so obvious cancer was spreading so rapidly. Why put her through that and why put more financial strain on the family? Dear God where is compassion anymore?\nDo what you can to be supportive and loving. Let him know you are there for him in any way he needs you. I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers. Please do keep us informed. \nHugs Mary K.\n ",

Not all lumps can be seen on mammograms. 3 x 3 what centimeters or millimeters. 2.54 centimeters equals one inch. Does this lump feel like it is a little over an inch in diameter? Not all lumps feel the same. Some are hard and others are soft. \nIf you think it is hard dealing with yourself, try dealing with your daughter. My daughter was diagnosed two years after I was and is getting treatment now for a recurrence after eight years. I sure wish I was dealing with what she is. but I am doing OK after eleven years.\nTake care, one step at a time and hang out here with us to lean on.\nHugs MK\n ",

Mammograms and sonograms are not perfect diagnostic tools, either. Studies are improving diagnosis and medications every day. Recently the discussion has been that breast cancer is a chronic disease to be treated as diabetes, etc. A mastectomy is not the worst surgery to go through physically, altho mentally it is difficult for a woman. Unless she has reconstruction done at the same time she will not be off work very long. \nThe way to help is to be her best friend and let her talk it out with you if she will. My daughter had a recurrence last year and is under treatment but she doesn't like to talk about\n it. So we all try to let her know we are ready and willing to help her in any way and then let her call the moves. That seems to help. If you have any questions, come back and let us know. Tell her to get report copies, her pathology report from surgery and any other tests she has including blood tests. It is her right to have the information and she should keep a file for comparison to future tests. You have to be proactive in your own cause when you have any illness. \nHugs, MK\n ",

I finally found copies of her dad's blood tests when he was anemic because of celiac disease. She kept asking me what his numbers were, so I told her last night that his hemoglobin never got below 9.4. I told her to check about\n donors helping the cost, but I know she hasn't. She will probably not give in to a transfusion until she can't stand up. She is \"doing nothing\" her words but resting. She does go to work because they need the money. Her husband confirms that she has been sitting around a lot which is not at all like her. I also talked to her about\n going on disability and how Part B Medicare might help her with costs. She had an Aridea treatment yesterday, which she has once a month, and it usually helps her with bone pain. Meanwhile we all sit around and wait ready to help her. She is as stubborn as her father. \nI'm sorry for Dorothy Hamill, too. I am sorry for every woman who even has had the fear of thinking she has breast cancer. I am sorry for anyone who has to deal with any form of cancer for any length of time. My cousin died in his sleep recently at the age of 63 and tests showed he was full of lung cancer. He never knew he had cancer, altho I am sure he had some symptoms. Maybe that's better than knowing and fighting?\nMy grandson's first trombone teacher, a young man who couldn't be more than 25 learned he had testicular cancer a month ago. Just last week he learned that it is also in his kidney. He has not even had any chemo yet. First they will remove the kidney. Cancer just seems to be everywhere.\nLove and hope of good health in 2008,\nMK\n ",

It is good that your doctor is being thorough in ordering tests. You will not know anything for sure until you get results. My best guess is that you will have to have lumps removed for a definitive answer, especially since you have already had cancer in an ovary. When I was 42 I had a hysterectomy and the path report showed precancer. I thought nothing of it at the time, but 16 years later I was diagnosed with breast cancer. First you have to find out if you have cancer, if it is they will know from the tests the stage and be able to treat you accordingly. It is said now that breast cancer is much like diabetes, it is a chronic condition that must be treated to keep under control. I hope and pray that is not your situation.

Not only family history of breast cancer figures in but also other related cancers in a family group. Rather than give you any misinformation, I will simply say that there is a Jewish group where the BRCA is very prevalent. I don't think there is any contagious classification for breast cancer.

LOL can't use ACRONYMS in Scrabble anyway!\nNow let me tell you more about\n last week. You know we have been trying to sell our old house. We signed a contract in Nov for closing by Dec 21st requested by buyer. Just before that date we learned the buyer was in the middle of getting a divorce and the lender wanted her parents in on the contract. No problem closing would be before the end of the year. Well every week something happened putting it off, I could write a book. So back to last week. I am lying in the hospital bed and DH calls that there was a phone message from the title company. I called and it was a new title company, getting info again for the closing. The lady said she could come to the hospital for closing, no problem there. The next day which was Friday our Realtor called and said, \"you are not going to believe this, but....\" They buyer had a nervous breakdown and it caused a stroke, she is in the same hospital. Well, I guess that ends that saga, poor woman is only in her 40's life has not been great to her, evidently. \nThen on Saturday when I got back from my CT scan DH says to me, \"Want another shocker?\" He handed me the paper with a big article about\n our former next door neighbor. He had been hit by a car and died. He was 60, a lawyer and former judge with a second wife and a darling little daughter. Remember all the times we have said we could be hit by a car tomorrow? It happens. It is very upsetting to me that the little girl who spent a lot of time with her daddy won't have him anymore.\nToday begins a new week, whatever has taken place in the past couple seems to be clearing. My blood sugar is only 88 this morning!!!!!! It hasn't been that low in a couple years. I am going to rest for a few days and try to keep it that way.\nHugs MK\n ",

Waiting six months could be if they made the wrong decision. Yes, you can tell a lot by the picture of the lump but you can not be absolutely certain. I would push for a biopsy or at least get my records and get a second opinion preferably by a breast specialist. I agree with Gail wholeheartedly. I am not wanting to frighten you, but waiting six months would be more stressful to me than being sure right now. Hugs, MK\n ",

When I called her son answered the phone and there seemed to be an urgency in his voice when he told me she couldn't come to the phone and he would have her call me later. When we talked later of course I was shocked at what had happened. Within a day or two I drove to Garland to meet her. That was just two weeks before I had surgery which changed my life so drastically. We have been friends ever since. She is supposed to be coming this weekend for a visit.

My plastic surgeon who is one of the best in the city called infectious disease dr when I had a bad infection, a trauma specialist to ask about\n an IV, a radiologist to help with treatments and on and on. I don't understand why doctors just want to wait and see. We haven't run this question through lately, but you can always ask the doctor, if a male, \"Is this what you would want for your wife or daughter? Wait six months and check again?\" I think not. But then again 6 mm is really very small. I don't know how they could see a shape of a kidney that small, unless it was magnified quite a bit. I really would rather know than wait, anyhow.

I came home this afternoon and am trying to get mail and computer stuff somewhat caught up before lying down. I feel much better. All the doctors could come up with was a possible pylonephritis. I really hurt but there was not a lot of infection, etc. in the tests run. The CT scan showed inflamatory tissue but again it was not an obvious differentiation. I will still be on antibiotics at home this week and I intend to rest. My blood sugar and blood pressure had been high for a couple of weeks and now they are down to very normal numbers for diabetes. So maybe every so often I just need a little cleansning? The surgeon said I should absolutely never have surgery unless gangrene or something life threatening set in because with no muscles behind the outer skin no sutures would ever hold and I would just pull apart. I've known that I can not waste time getting antibiotics or treatment if anything is strange. Sorry we didn't have time to arrange the PCA. The nurses I had were great and really fun. They would have loved seeing you all \"in the pink\". As a matter of fact I had a room mate for part of a day who has Altzheimer's. They had a monitor on her that played a little tune when she got up. I told the nurse it would drive me crazy soon because it was an awful do do do do do tune. She laughed and started dancing around the room singing it and told me all I needed to do was get in the groove and dance. They were a really fun group! I did not eat any green jello!!!!

When the hemoglobin gets below 8 I guess she will have to have that blood transfusion but it stays between 8 and 8.4. She did tell me her platelet count is getting lower, tho. I am not sure what that means but I can't feel very good about\n it. \nShe called me yesterday to check on me and to see if the very, very high winds were causing fires around here. They were all over north TX yesterday, gusts of 53 mph. One community close to where we used to live lost 14 homes. There was a fire blocking the road on the way Carolyn's house causing the school bus to detour and it took Natalie an extra hour to get home. She sounded really stressed and worried about\n fires. \nWe put in a very rough night last night. Missy, my 14 yr old dog, was really sick. I actually thought she had a stroke and was dying in my arms when she heaved and threw up all over me. She did that a couple more times, and finally it looked like she was going to feel better. She has not gotten up to go outside yet this morning but she has stirred and is sleeping on her pillow beneath me under the computer desk. I know it is only a matter of time with her, but I think she will be ok for now. \nThanks again for asking, you girls take care, too.\nlove u, MK\n ",

Since I spend most of my up time sitting here, it was something I really needed. My son got me a scanner for slides that you can put old slides into the computer.

I am really looking forward to seeing them on the computer.

She told Erica she expects her blood count to be up today since she feels so much better than she did. She is drinking a glass of Blackberry wine a day to help her blood count because she learned somewhere it is good for anemia. Her appointment was at 1:30 and it is now almost 3:30. Maybe the dr told her to get to the hospital and get that transfusion???? Will post later when I know something.\nWe have also been waiting all day for the call to come and sign papers for the closing of our house and that call has never come, either.

I know you are enjoying your grandchildren as I am my great grandchildren. Somehow we just don't post as often as we once did. We have lost far too many dear friends. Now the possibility is looming that I am going to see my own daughter fight the great battle so many have fought and are still fighting. Yesterday she helped the \"boys\" in the family lay some of that new hardwood flooring, they tried to keep her on easy jobs. LOL. She is quite the character. Tomorrow she will learn more about\n her situation. She says the doctor had some more smears done with the bone marrow to determine what course might be best.\nI haven't posted a lot about\n Carolyn, she had swollen lymph nodes in her neck in February and the biopsy showed BC had spread. She has been hurting in her back and hips for a long time. A bone scan showed hot spots, which she informed me did not mean breast cancer, it could be arthritis, too because scans don't show the difference. Yeah right. She has been on Aridea and Femara and kept telling us how they were working, yet we learned more lesions were seen in her bone scan before this last one, which did not show any new areas. Blood work showed she was anemic, so she was given a boost of medicine I had never heard of making her feel better, but one week later the hemoglobin had dropped another half point. She is in the severely anemic range, so that is why they wanted the blood transfusions. She insists she feels ok. Just tired. Then they did the bone marrow tests and found the BC cells which she still has not told me about\n. She did tell Erica and so did her husband tell Erica. Erica is a real worrier, but it almost seems Carolyn is trying to keep me from being upset and worried. Like ten years of being associated with a breast cancer board hasn't prepared me for just about\n anything.\nTomorrow we also are supposed to close on the sale of our old house. One year it has taken to sell it and already the closing was moved ten days. We are hoping to get it closed on the last day of 2007 so it won't carry over into 2008 for taxes, etc. The woman who is buying is going through a divorce so the lender is insisting on her parents being on the mortgage until the divorce is finalized. \nSo tomorrow is a big day. I hope things go exceptionally well to finish out 2007. And here's to a great 2008 for all of us.\nLove and hugs, MK\n ",

Actually the techs are not to tell you anything, the radiologist will read your tests and send the report to your doctor who will tell you the results. That always takes a day or two. I have had the radiologist talk to me an give me results but only a couple of times. The first was when he was sure I had breast cancer and he advised me to make sure my doctor took action asap. The other times were when I went to a special breast clinic for mammograms, the Dr made sure to give results to breast cancer patients right away to alleviate the worry. His clinic closed down because insurance and medicare payments did not cover the costs adequately. That was a real shame because it was the best place I ever went to have a mammogram and I have had plenty over the last 30 years. Let us know what you find out.

My husband was diagnosed with celiac disease last February which was found by anemia and then an upper GI scope with biopsy. I suggested Carolyn tell her onc about\n the celiac because it is genetic, but she didn't because she understood one of the meds she takes is a problem for blood cells and besides she said, \"If I had celiac disease I would have had it all my life not just now.\" I reminded her that her father was just diagnosed and it was because he became very anemic last year all of a sudden. I just wasn't sure what they were looking for with the bone marrow test. I know leukemia is related to bone marrow. I know there are blood cancers that could be related, but does mets ever show up in bone marrow? We will probably know more in a week or two. Her test is next Tuesday. Hugs, MK\n ",

They are filling him with IV liquids and antibiotics, but he still had a temp of 101.6 yesterday afternoon with all of that. Still chillin' and sweating. Urinalysis was clear. Waiting yet for blood results. He sees a rheumatologist for some long named condition I know little about\n so they are communicating with him to see if it might be something he can suggest. I told Stella over a week ago to call his other doctors offices and explain his situation and see if they could help. He also sees a kidney doctor on a regular basis. Will report in again. This is really crazy how sick he is. Jo-Ann said it sounds a lot like her problems this summer. Thanks for your prayers, MK\n ",

My daughter went through chemo and I think she had what you are having. She did not have good insurance that paid much on drugs at the time, so she took as few as possible and did fine without too much nausea. Her main complaint was tiredness. She worked through the chemo. Hers was every three or four weeks, can't remember now. Things change all the time. I hope with your Chron's it is manageable.

It is a big adjustment for them, that's for sure. But she will settle down and accept that she is where she needs to be. They are fed three square meals a day and kept clean. If they will participate there are activites to keep them occupied, too. There is no way I can care for my mother, and it sounds like you have more than enough on your plate, too. Talk to the people there and see if they can somehow stop all the phone calls. Or do something to shut off your phone, you can't stand all that stress. If her short term memory is bad, she probably doesn't remember making the call two minutes ago. When I talk to my mother on the phone she tells me the same thing about\n three or four times with no idea she just finished the very same sentence. So don't feel like the phone calls are for real. My mother doesn't remember in the evening if she had any company or phone calls that day, she tells me she talked to no one, then I find out her sister was there and took her out to lunch. Do you have a brother or sister to help? Please feel free to email me if you need to talk about\n this situation off the board. I would even be glad to call you and talk if it would help.

      "Content": " Lauri, a wheelchair is not the answer. I have an electric cart here at home, a walker with a seat, and I never even go down my hallway without pushing a tray table to lean on. The longer this goes on the more it hurts. I am now wearing four binders at a time and it still does not really help. I feel like I have a hundred pound kid hanging on my back at my waist pulling down as I drag them along. I move from chair to chair in my kitchen. I haven't been inside a mall since 2001. I have gone to an outlet mall twice with someone pushing me in a wheelchair, but when you get inside the stores there is not room to move around, so I usually sit parked near the door while everyone else shops. It is so much easier to just stay at home. I go to a concert where my grandson is playing, park in handicapped parking only to find when I get in the building I have to walk a long hallway to get to the auditorium. Carting the scooter around is a pain, the walker is a little easier, but then I still walk with it. When Jo-Ann and I drove to Louisville I was exhausted for over a week afterwards. No one in the medical profession seems to understand. My dr is hesitant to do an exam for fear of hurting me, and I keep telling her nothing hurts when I am touched, most of my abdomen is dead feeling. I need something to lift the hernia, but so far I have not found anything that does what I need and believe me I have looked on the internet and tried many different binders and abdominal lifts. I am looking at some full body things now that cost nearly $300 but I am not sure they will help, either. Do I want to spend that kind of money for naught? Sorry I am complaining so much, but it is so frustrating not to be able to do things I want so badly to do. But I keep telling myself that at least I am alive. Then there is Mother who tells me every night she has lived too long. And my daughter won't live long enough. Grrrr Hugs MK\n ",

She realizes how confused she is sometimes and really clams up then. Anytime you need to vent please feel free to email me. Since you are across the pond I guess I can't call. LOL.

So something crazy was going on in space for sure.\nRemember a few months after Peggy died I got an email from her. I called her mother and also talked to her son, trying to figure out if someone had used her computer and sent it by mistake. They both told me her computer had been turned off since she had died. I thought maybe someone who had had access to her computer and really knew their way around the computer world was playing mind games with me.

She should have been under care, even if as an annual thing for tests, etc. My daughter is fighting a recurrence that happened at eight years. She was not seeing her onc or even having annual mammograms at the time. It took us all by surprise. We know that breast cancer is now being treated more like an ongoing problem to be watched and kept under control somewhat like Diabetes. So if your mom has been to her doctor and is not discussing her situation with you, you need to talk with her and tell her you are very concerned and fearing the worst. I certainly understand your last comment, my daughter insists she is fine when I know that is not true. She is doing ok with her treatments, but certainly not fine.\nHope you all get good news next week.\nHugs, MK\n ",

Then it blew and they needed to put the IV in again. The used the under part of my forearm. Now that is a tender place and also a pain to deal with the needle and the lines from it. Finding the vein made a huge black and blue mess!!!!! But when it all came out it healed faster than the usual black and blue spot does.\nI think your doctor is wise to keep close tabs on you, even if your veins don't like it. \nBig hugs, MK\n ",

I did get a lovely card from my husband with a very special message. I also got a dozen red roses on the 13th because that was the anniversary of the day we met, Feb. 13, 1957. A few years ago....\nOn the 14th we finally had to let Missy go to doggie heaven. She was getting worse and there was no point of keeping her alive to suffer. She was probably the best dog I ever had and I have had many. I just love animals, especially dogs. Poor Pity has never been without her momma and we have been concerned about\n her. She has health issues, too, and I am sure she is missing Missy. So I started looking at the classified ads and on the internet. I'm sure it was meant to be because within an hour or so I found a male Yorkie who is a bit big for Yorkie standards, he weighs ten pounds and that put him in a much lower price range than the usual Yorkie. The lady sent me a picture and he is so adorable I called her right back and said, \"He is mine!\" So we are going to meet her sometime this weekend or Monday at the latest. She is in OK north of Dallas so she will meet us part way. His name is Jimmy. Wish I could share a picture.\nHugs MK\n ",

How can they refuse to do what a doctor suggested, or was it the nurse practioner suggested? IBC is not a cancer to mess with and if there is any chance that you could be diagnosed with it, the earlier the better, so I would not take this lightly. Other cancers in the family history are meaningful in breast cancer. Some more than others. I am no expert on this, but I attended a genetic seminar and that is where I learned there is interest in family members history of other cancers. \nAnyhow I am suggesting you find a specialist somehow. If you can find nothing else, look in the phone book for an oncology center and call there and ask for help. Hopefully you will get someone who has some knowledge or who will direct you to someone who can help you. Also, MD Anderson in Houston is one of the best cancer centers.

Did you delegate your job as travel guide to your sister or was she chomping at the bit to take over? LOL. I don't know why but I think of you and your mother as somewhat the same as my mother and I. I took her on several of my business trips. She lives in a lovely home for the aged now. She is still well enough to get around, but her mind is getting worse all the time. Lately she has been telling me that my dad lived to the age of 91, which would have meant he died three years ago, when 30 is more like it. She has him confused with her father who died at 91. It is so sad to see this happening. I call her every night and lately she is telling me she can't hear me or doesn't understand me. I need to have my brother check out her telephone. \nDon't be surprised if Peter finds someone and moves on. With the internet people are meeting and falling in love much later in life, when they probably would never have ventured out to meet otherwise. My neice and my son's best friend from grade school both met spouses over the internet and married in their forties. They seem exceptionally happy in their marriages, too. Marty and his wife even had a baby! He is a new father while my son is a grandfather. LOL. \nI look in at IV once in awhile and see if any of our old friends post. There are many we have lost track of.\nTake care and enjoy the grandbabies.\nHugs MK\n ",

Ah well, that is passed. I, too, have good memories of Chris and many of the others who are no longer with us. I wish we never had to meet under these circumstances of breast cancer. I wish they never had the pain, physical or mental knowing their time was limited on this earth.

If it can do so much so quickly, is it really good for women to be taking it so easily and frequently? I refused to take estrogen for about\n 12 years after my hysterectomy because it caused my blood pressure to rise. Then a doctor talked me into trying the patch. Well, that was a pain in the you know what. I couldn't put it on immediately after bathing because the moisture made it come off, so I would wait and of course I forgot. Then he insisted I try half a pill, then a whold pill............ then the next thing you know I was having a mastectomy and off the pills I went. Did they cause the cancer? Who knows? I took them maybe 5 years and my cancer was very early. So I don't have an answer. I only wonder. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " I told you all I had gotten Satellite internet connection.  After spending nearly $500 I am beginning to think I made a very big mistake.  The first few days it worked pretty well, except I don't really like their email format and system.  But three nights ago I got a message from Norton that I had an error and to fix, click on the button.  Well, I clicked and Norton began uninstalling itself and then told me to reinstall when that was done.  I was up until midnight doing all that.  The next day went pretty well until evening when all of a sudden the new WildBlue went crazy.  I called Tech support and told them what was happening and the supervisor told me that she thought it was very strange that Norton would uninstall itself. She suggested I run a FULL scan and look for viruses.  So I ran a full scan and watched as the files flipped by for awhile.  I noticed several strange sounding files with HiKey in them.  There are Hkey files, but when I got back to WildBlue Tech and went to Norton Tech they both said I had a virus or a hacker's spyware. I was told to call a special viral removal number at Norton, another $100 and they would remove it for me.  Well, we were moving right along in spite of the language problems when a huge thunderstorm came up and I lost internet connection.  Guess that happens when you have satellite. So we hung up and an hour later the connection was back so we started again to do the fix and here comes another wave of storm.  So tomorrow morning at 9 am my new friend, \"Peter\" from India will call me to finish fixing my computer.  Wild Blue email is still not functional, but I am able to be on line and yes it is faster............... I am sooo tired but I did call and leave a message for Jo-Ann.  She never answers her phone anymore.  \n \n ",

I had no idea your son had to go back to Iraq for the third time. Thank God he is home and safe. Your family sounds like it is doing well. I remember your daughter came with you to the group meeting in Cincinnati. So many years have passed since then. \nYes, we all tried to contact Chris, but she just would not let us in. I haven't been in Cincinnati for a couple of years. My mother is in Wheeling, WV in a home near my brother, so when I go north I usually fly into Columbus and my daughter, Chris from KY, picks me up and we drive to WV and spend time. My son has moved to near Gatlinburg, TN so we go there occasionally. Everyone is scattered anymore. I really would like to get back to northern OH but I never seem to have enough time to fit it all in. \nPlease don't stay away so long again. I am thrilled you are doing so well. As far as cancer goes, I am, too. The hernia thing gets more painful all the time, so I do less and less. My daughter has a recurrence of breast cancer after eight years, but so far treatment is doing well and she still works way too hard. They are making hay for their animals and she is right in there lifting and doing it all. Grrr. I wish I could convince her to rest more. Yesterday when I called she was out fixing the hay rake. A couple of days before she was installing a gas water heater. She is her father's daughter, very mechanical, and her husband is not so she usually does the plumbing and electrical repairs.

      "Content": " Whoa Gretchen you have been through the mill. I doubt that normal even for breast cancer will apply to you. It sounds like your doctors are doing all the right things. Biopsy results take different amounts of time depending on the type of biopsy and who is available to do the reading of the test at the time. Some smaller hospitals have to send everything away, while bigger hospitals have doctors on staff to do the reading. When I had my mastectomy they dtermined the cancer through a frozen section while I was in the OR and since I had signed papers to go ahead, they did. Needle tests can be read immediately, too, if the staff is there. Otherwise it can take a week or even more. Sometimes the pathology can be so different from the normal that it is even sent sent to specialized hospitals for results and that can take several weeks. It doesn't happen often, but it happens. The biopsy can be done in day surgery, but if they decide to do the lymph node it could be more. I hate to sound so uncertain but as with all things there can be exceptions to the norm. Just take care and try not to worry until you know what you need to worry about\n. Hugs and prayers, Mary K.\n ",

I order from Lane Bryant because it is impossible to buy big around bras in any store. After returning the first ones in the style I ordered the next smaller size and it was too big, too. Maybe I should find your trash can and leave mine behind, too. I hate having to go anywhere that I have to endure pantyhose, dress shoes and a dress..............Yuk I will stay home. Take care.

I know I have a grand daughter in that growing stage, too, as well as three adult grand daughters.\nSix months is not a long time, true, but remember that is an average figure. We have plenty of women here to prove that those numbers are short. Even the ones who lost their battle lived longer than the numbers quoted, and look at the old timers we have! Jo-Ann is one of them, too, and her current problems are not BC related except that maybe BC treatment hastened the other illnesses. But from her family history I would say she was in line for all these problems without BC.\nMy daughter added a new twist the other day. She is under treatment for mets with a monthly infusion and taking two hormonal pills. She was here making hay, and came in the house gasping for breath. It was hotter than hell and humid as a sauna out there, so anyone would be gasping. I told her she shouldn't be working so hard. She said, \"It worked for Lance Armstrong!\". So now I understand her better, she is going to kill herself working so she can live longer! \nKeep in touch with us as much as you can Steph. We are always glad to have you here.\nHugs MK\n ",

I had real bad problems with infection in my abdominal wall and lost all my muscles both rectus and side muscles, but that was due to the infection from contaminated sutures from the factory. I am not basing my answer solely on my experience. My daughter also had a tram flap, she was 39 at the time. After eight years she still has midriff area discomfort and that area is certainly not smooth and tight enough to fit into dresses a ball room dancer would wear. She has horses and cows and lugs feed and hay to them, so her abdomen should be good and tight from all her work and exercise. \nI am guessing from seeing ballroom dancing on PBS that you are thin and have a wonderful shape, most likely small busted? Perhaps prosthesis could be sewn into your costumes to make it easier for you to move without worrying about\n them moving the other direction. I know there are bathing suits constructed this way. \nGood luck and God bless your decision. Breast cancer changes our lives, no one will dispute that.\nHugs, Mary K.\n ",

Not all lumps are cancer, most are not, especially in younger women whose breasts tend to change during the month and are more dense anyway.

It used to be when a doctor could feel a lump the first thing he would do is get a syringe and aspiriate the lump to see if it was a cyst or not. If no fluid they would then do a lumpectomy. They don't do that anymore. They have sonograms and other ways of telling what is there. AND it is true that caffeine has something to do with breasts and mammograms. It would be a good idea to really cut back before a mammo if you drink a lot. Try cutting back, keeping checking through exams for a little while and see if there is a change. Keep us posted.

Many women life a long life with having a lumpectomy and radiation but with cancer in both breasts to begin with I would opt for the most aggressive treatment possible. You didn't give a hint as to age or any of the report scenarios. I hope she has copies of all her pathology reports so you can make good decisions. Many of the women here can help read those reports, too. Hugs to you both as you are making decisions. Mary K.\n ",

She also breast fed her kids for longer than the norm. She worked hard and got lots of exercise, stayed within good weight limits...on and on, she should not have breast cancer according to the BS. OK I will now jump down from my soapbox and take a deep breath and have a good day. Hope you all do, too. LOL MK\n ",

Maybe you are what Jo-Ann needs too. \nI finally heard from her when I was about\n ready to send out the calvary and I told her she needed to come post and at least say Hi. Well, that was days ago, over a week ago and I haven't heard from her again nor has she posted. I think the only reason she called that day was because she got called to jury duty, took a doctor's excuse that she has too many medical conditions to serve on a jury and they refused to consider it, after sitting around a few hours they sent her home to come back at 1:00. When she drove all the way back they told her the case was settled out of court and she could go home. She was royally PO'd as you can imagine.\nRemember I told you all I didn't want a farm because I had been there, done that and earned a very fancy T-shirt from years of duty. In Ohio we did over 200 acres, so the 34 here is not really a problem for me. However, yesterday Carolyn and her husband and two old men (Michael's dad and Chuck) baled and gathered well over a hundred bales of hay. Their equipment, Chuck is rebuilding his Deere before he can use it. I found the tractor on eBay located in Hot Springs, AR and then found him a plow in IN. Both are here and he thinks I am okay at finding him good eBay buys. LOL\nMeanwhile in my world, I do not worry about\n all those cabinets, I cook when I feel like it and clean up the dishes but it is far from neat and spotless. The rest of the time I am on the computer or reading. It is pure joy to sit out on the patio when the weather is nice and read to the birds singing. \nJo-Ann does like it here, but she is really not supposed to drive far from home because of her blocked arteries. I may have to go get her??? And that is Chuck you are picturing with the straw hat out there or Michael's dad. They do not go shirtless, tho. \nI read him your posts and he said to tell you if you had been here yesterday you could have had a good time, too. So I guess he is telling you that you are welcome to come and have fun on the farm. I'm not sure the fish in the pond are big enough for fishing, but we do have a Great Blue Heron that comes to eat occasionally.\nHugs MK\n ",

I am just going to suggest that the five month recall letter may have been sent by mistake at this time. Communication between various members of the medical team could have been garbled or a simple misunderstanding could have caused you to get the letter. Do not take it as a reason to wait. Surely you have a follow up appt with your doctor to discuss the report? See him/her first and go from there if you don't get satisfaction. BTW many cancer screenings can be done at free of charge clinics. Call your local American Cancer Society to get information and watch the news, especially during breast cancer months. Since you now have insurance you don't need this information possibly, but others reading the post could. Never, ever go so long without having your check up. Believe me the cost of a mammogram even if you have to pay will be far less than the alternative. Hugs MK\n ",

Some of the women who I know have had it, had terribly swollen arms and all kinds of problems, others seem to have lighter problems. However, it is something that needs to be dealt with and the sooner the better. I do not speak from experience, I have had no problem, but I know that left alone the lymph fluid can harden in the arm and then it takes a lot of therapy with massaging to get it under control again. There are sleeves, compression sleeves, gloves, all sorts of equipment to help those who need it. But only an experiencee therapist can help. Since I have no idea where you live and would probably not know of a lymphadema clinic near you, you will have to do your own research. One of our hospitals has a lymphedema wing. So get her help and be sure she follows through. \nHope this helps some, Mary K.\n ",

Get all those details and come back and let us help you understand or make suggestions. The core of this group has been together for nearly ten years. We have many new members who have recently had treatment. As you probably can guess, treatment has advanced quite a bit in ten years, but that doesn't make having breast cancer any less frightening when you are first diagnosed. Please share your first name and the area where you live. You can find out more about\n us in the Roll Call on the thread page. Hug, Mary K. MK is easier.\n ",

Anesthesia does get harder and harder to take. I always have said it was the worst part of any surgery as far as I was concerned. \nMy two dogs had their teeth done today and some lumpectomies, so they are sleeping it off like you are. One definitely had a fatty tumor in her leg, making one side look like a ham hock. Now she looks normal and I am sure when it heals she will feel much better. She has drains...................... The other had a hemorrhoid sort of thing that the vet feels could be cancer, but at her age I certainly would not put her through any treatments if it was. \nI hope tomorrow morning you will all feel so much better. \nHugs MK\n ",

My hernia is the result of having all abdominal muscles removed from side to side breast to groin. It is a hernia the size of a twins pregnancy at 9 months, with nothing holding it up but artificial means. I wear three binders now to give support. It has been over seven years and I am tired of not being able to do things I really would like to do, like plant a flower garden. \nToday I have the dubious joy of showing up for jury duty. It is an old court house and I am sure the air conditioning is probably not great. Who knows where they might herd us through the process. I am taking my electric scooter because there is no way I can walk with a group. Hopefully they will decide they don't need an old woman with a scooter in the courthouse. My husband is going with me to help me get in and out of the van and courthouse. Surely they won't keep me????\nMy daughter also had a tram flap and her tummy is quite soft. Whatever happened to the wonderful tummy tuck we thought we were getting? I have no answer to your question, I reallly can't get my own answered. I swear my belly is full of fluid, but when I had a sonogram to check the tech spent all her time looking at my gallstone, she never went lower where I feel the fludi. Oh well I have no infection at least. \nCome back more often.\nHugs, MK\n ",

My daughter went home immediately, too, to three and seven year olds, all the household chores, and even went to work on the computer. She worked out of her home as a contract employee and she didn't want the companies she worked for to know she had breast cancer for fear they would give her work to someone else. She would not even let me keep the kids because she wanted them at home. I guess that is why I feel so strongly that staying a day or two in the hospital is more beneficial. So you are exactly right, choice is the important thing, but you were right to have help at home, also. You are probably wondering why I didn't go help her at her house. I have physical problems that prevent that, I could have managed the kids in my house where I am set up to sit while I cook, etc. I can not be on my feet for long, so there is no way I could have taken care of her, even if she let me, which she wouldn't. Right now she is going through treatment for recurrence and once again she is in there working as hard as anyone. They are making hay on their ranch and she is lifting bales, etc. Wonder woman she is! Hugs MK\n ",

She called me from the road, she finally got to the post office as we talked and her postal box was full. Then she planned on driving to a book store in Sherman which is a good ways from home. She said once again she could get her computer going if she just felt better. And she told me she would try to take a picture of how much weight she has lost to send me. I asked her how she would get it out of her digital camera and send it if she had no computer. Well, duh, she hadn't thought about\n that. Oh my what can we do with her?\nHugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Kitt! Looking at the mammograms radiologists can tell whether a density is suspicious or not by several factors. Asymmetrical is more suspicious than symmetrical. Spiculated or spidery looking is another term that is used when a density is suspicious. All the mammograms and sonograms in the world cannot tell for sure if there is cancer, only a biopsy and pathology study can tell for sure. There are different kinds of biopsies. Removal of the suspicious area is in my humble opinion the most reliable, but there is a newer test called the needle test where a core is removed and tested. I think the needle test is great if the area is really suspicious because it can tell for sure if cancer is present, but a negative needle test worries me because such a small area is tested. My daughter had a very suspicious lump and the positive needle test gave her some time to get her surgery lined up as she wanted reconstruction at the same time. She was 39 at the time. I was 58 when I was told I had a spiculated area, very suspicious. So when I went into surgery I had signed papers to do a mastectomy and then months later had my reconstruction. \nMy favorite bit of advice to everyone is not to worry until you KNOW you have something to worry about\n. But believe me when it was my daughter I found it hard to follow my own advice. Now she is fighting recurrence and it is very worrisome, too, altho she seems to be doing quite well considering. Read the posts by the older members above who have been through a lot of treatment but have fought the bc devil bravely and honorably for several years and continue to do so. They are remarkable young women.\nHugs MK\n ",

After that she had terrible swings from hot flashes, in TX summer she wore a heavy sweater coat and then she would swing the other way and have the AC so low most people would freeze. She couldn't stand it and finally talked her doctor into giving her some oral estrogen. That straightened out her temperature swings, but then she had a very aggressive recurrence. I think she lived six months at most. So as Bev says it is your decision. Connie's was to regulate her body and who knows if the recurrence would have happened regardless. It is a tough decision. Maybe you could get a few more opinions from your doctors? You see several and a polled opinion might be helpful. My husband has a spot on his back that really looks like the melanoma pictures on the computer. He went to our GP and she said it was not cancer, but knowing from this board that doctors are sometimes wrong, I still worried. Yesterday he went to see another doctor for his anemia which is now gone. This dr is a hemotologist in an oncology center, so I asked him to look at it and he agreed with the GP, so now I am satisfied. Take care. Hugs MK\n ",

It will pick up your spirits and God knows we all need that. \nI know you pretty much have to do what your doctor is going to do, but you can express your feelings and with a nudge in the proper direction the doctor can change his mind. Just be sure to let your feelings be known, a needle biopsy could mean that you would still have to have the lumpectomy. You have your mother and son to deal with and going twice may be more of a problem than for most people. \nI hope you can find a nice place for your mother. Mine is in a very nice place, but she has enough money that will take care of her. At nearly 94 I can't imagine that she would live another ten years. Altho, you never know, she is in good health just getting more and more senile. I am 1300 miles from her and my brother and sister in law are near by. I call her every day, that is my job. They take her on weekends at least 50% of the time. As I mentioned before she is much nicer now.\nYes we all worry about\n our daughters and grand daughters. I have four of them and now two great grand daughters. My son's two girls also have a maternal grandmother who had breast cancer when she was in her 40's but she has not had a recurrance and she is nearly 90. My daughter in law was the last in a family of six. I have not heard that any of the girls in that family has been diagnosed. \nMy daughter is doing fine. She is very independent and tough, does not want anyone to fuss over her. We know she won't live to a ripe old age, but if she takes care of herself and stays with the doctor she should do ok for awhile. You just have to respect her wishes and let her live her life. I let her know I am willing to do anything I can. She has an older daughter who is cleaning house for her and trying to help in many ways, which she accepts. I encourage Erica to help her and slip her some money now and then to help since I am unable to help her physically.\nIt is good you like to crochet, I knitted like crazy for awhile, but then I discovered books again. After years of working and little time to read, I am now trying to make up for it. Losing myself in mindless little family oriented romance situations keeps me happy. LOL.\nStay with us and vent all you want. That is one of the things we understand and accept. You need to blow steam and get it off your chest. You would be surprised how many of us have difficult mothers, too. LOL. \nHugs MK (Mary K.)\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Linda, \nReading your first post was beginning to sound like a parallel to my story until you said your mother lived with you and that you also have a son who is disabled. First the breast situation. I had two benign tumors over 20 years, then when I was 58 I had the real thing and had a mastectomy. There wasn't any history in our family at first, either, but since then it sure has been cropping up. My daughter was diagnosed two years after I was when she was 39. She recently has had a recurrence, not good news. \nNow about\n MOTHER. My mother was difficult, too, but at 92 she lived alone in an apartment 50 miles from any of the family and we worried to death about\n her. We tried to talk her into assisted living and she wasn't buying it, even when her doctor told her that was where she needed to be. Finally we made arrangements for her to spend the day with her younger sister and moved some of her furniture to her new \"apartment\" as we called it. Actually it is a large room. Once she was settled in there, she changed so much, it is unbelievable. I actually had her for a ten day visit at Christmas and enjoyed her company. So I don't know if that would work for your mother or not, but if you do have cancer, stress is one of the worse problems to have with it. Your son, I know is another situation. Bless you and all parents who care for children at whatever age with problems. \nThe needle biopsy I feel is great if you are just making sure the tumor is cancer. Now a benign result worries me a bit, because you wonder if the correct spot was biopsied. If it were me, I would insist on the removal biopsy, especially given that you have had one before. Incidently I was able to get the report from when my second benign tumor removed after my daughter was diagnosed. I got it for a complete history and I learned that my cancer was in the very same area as the benign tumor. I have also heard of having a benign tumor in front of a malignant one. I am not trying to frighten you, but I think with all you have on your plate, you need to find out what is going on for sure. An exicision is really not that bad as I am sure you remember. \nCome back and let us know how things go. We care and are here to help if we can. We can also celebrate happily any benign reports!!!!\nHugs MK\n ",

And guessing games are what doctors play when they don't do a biopsy because there is no sure way of knowing if a mass is cancer unless a pathology test is done. Some masses have characteristics of cancer and doctors usually can be fairly sure of cancer, but not all that don't have the standard characteristics are benign. So I say insist on a surgeon and get them removed. You don't need large masses in your breast no matter what they are. If they are true cysts they can be drained, so did anyone try that?

      "Content": " Asymmetrical means it is not even, the edges are different. Sometimes words like spicular are used, which means the thing showed up on the films as spider like. The only true way to find out what the tumor or abnormality is would be to have a biopsy. Drs play guessing games as to whether a spot looks like it is benign or malignant, but there is no sure answer until a biopsy and pathology are done. So if it comes to that, remember it is the best and only way to know for sure what you are dealing with. Sometimes they do an ultra sound first. May I ask why your insurance is running out? If there is something there, you need insurance for longer than October. How about\n COBRA? As long as you have insurance you need to keep it going. If you are found to have breast cancer and your insurance lapses, you will have a pre existing condition and probably will not be able to get new insurance, at least that would cover breast cancer. There are also cancer insurance policies that might help, but once you have heard that diagnosis, forget them, too. Do you have any friends in the insurance business you might talk to and help you? I know buying coverage is expensive but there are special insurances for professional people that cover emergencies and other conditions. Do some fast checking, it may save you a lot in the long run. Let us know how it all goes. Hugs Mary K.\n ",

She just doesn't like people to fuss over her. If you are talking about\n the pre-teen, it is because she has never been made to do anything.

When you are young your breasts are firm, as you go into menopause, there is a big change in that the firmness gets very soft. I don't know but I am guessing those milk glands are realizing they will not have a job to do anymore. So wonder what happens when a woman takes fertility drugs to become pregnant after 50? Hmmm. At 51 surely you are seeing changes that have to do with menopause. I know we are all different, but I saw changes at 42.\nI would not wait until May 1st for a long overdue mammogram. Why is it so far in advance? Around here you can get an appointment within a week easily. I sure hope you see your doctor and move yours up. Come back and let us know what you learn. \nGood luck, Mary K.\n ",

Another time I went to a doctor that Social Security sent me to and his office really was frightful. He had no help, so I was glad my husband was with me. He answered his own phone while examining me and talked in Spanish. I really wanted out of there! Then I found out he didn't even know what he was supposed to be examining for SS. \nI would be very angry about\n the \"suspicious\" notations on the report. Who all saw that report? Why did no one tell you what it said? That is why I often advise people to get copies of their reports. I have found out that even drs and nurses read what they want to. I went for a CT scan because a colonoscopy showed I had a flattened spot in my intestine. When I called for the report all anyone wanted to talk about\n was my one big gallstone. It wasn't until that flattened area showed up as a huge red spot on the outside, obviously an abscess, that anyone bothered to read the whole report that did indeed show there was a sac that looked like it had fluid in it. By the way my gallstone is still in place nearly ten years later and it is still causing comotion. I keep telling everyone when it bothers me I will have it removed but not until then. My little abscess turned into a huge infection and I don't want anyone \nopening me up just to remove a gallstone that may never cause a problem.\nHugs MK\n ",

Several phone companies have a deal where you pay a monthly amount regardless of long distance calls and you can make all you want. I have had this with Verizon and not AT&T. It is great because you can pick up the phone anytime you want and call and talk as long as you want. It usually runs $50 a month but then taxes add up to make it more like $65. But if you have any kind of long distance charges over $30 per month usually it would pay.

      "Content": " about\n this group.... Several of us began posting on another site in 1999. After a mess there with a troublemaker many of us moved to Healingwell. We have had group get togethers beginning in May of 2000, annually until about\n two years ago when we lost several of our group including one of the ladies who lived in the area where we last met within months of our get together. Actually we planned the visit because we knew she was needing us, we walked the last lap of the Race for the Cure with her.\nYou need to realize that in a group with breast cancer quite often some of the members who are around and post a lot are the most ill. Through meeting we have become close and it truly is like losing a family member when we say a final goodbye to a special sister. I don't want to seem morbid here, there are lots of us with many years of survival, too. I guess what I am trying to say is that we are a close group who have been together through good and bad for many years. We do have different personalities, and not everyone sees eye to eye with everyone else, but I hope you will never see any nastiness here. We do not tend to be negative, either. Everyone is here to help support each and everyone of us, regardless of whether the problem is our breast cancer or maybe another problem affecting our lives, like husbands or children who have problems.\nHugs, MK\n ",

      "Content": " Well, Ruby when I was first told I had breast cancer I was so frightened of cancer, I didn't care about\n the breast I only wanted the cancer gone. Looking back I could have made another decision maybe, because it was very early. And my second choice would have been to have a double mastectomy to even out my chest. Of course I was 58 at the time and I wasn't planning to dance topless anyhow. \nI didn't have chemo. I know that is pretty scary to think about\n, but my daughter did have it and she did very well. She said the tiredness was the worst for her. She had a little nausea, too but really didn't complain about\n it. She had the mastectomy and reconstruction done in one all day surgery. \nMy sister in law lived in the Rochester area for awhile, in a town called Holcomb. It was really pretty up there. I lived in very NE Ohio at the time so it was only about\n a four hour trip to visit. \nI checked out your journal. I had not visited a site like that before. I like it because you express your feelings. I did not like the oncologist I saw. Since my cancer was not a big deal, he proceed to pounce on me about\n my weight, which at that time was actually good for me. Then he told me to come back in two years. When I told the girls at the desk two years, they said no one is ever told two years. So you know how that made me feel? So I never went back at all. It has been over ten years now.\nHang in there and keep in touch. We are not as active as we used to be here, but there are lots of veterans who check in and can help.\nHugs MK\n ",

As I am writing, Chuck is tearing apart the oven which doesn't seem to want to heat to over 350 degrees. It is LP gas. He is looking to see if something is plugging the air line. I have a 17 pound turkey sitting here that has to be cooked by tomorrow afternoon. I made rolls and \ncookies and a yeast sweet bread (that you make like a jelly roll with nut filling) today and had a terrible time getting them baked at 350 or less. Hmmmmm why is everyone coming here? Did I ask them to come? No, I won the opportunity to fix dinner by having the biggest dining room for everyone to be able to sit together and eat. Oops did I mention I have not found all my dishes yet? I have service for 16 and right now 9 plates are here and 11 will be eating dinner. Where are the other seven? This is the way it has been most of the week. I have a list of things I know I unpacked and put away here but can't find again. A list for things that are still packed I need to find. And a list of things that still need to be brought from the other house. Today Chuck brought a chair that makes number eleven. It was a dumb idea to make the other house look lived in while it is for sale, wasn't it? LOL. We will make it through December...... isn't that a song? Hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, we are going to, come snow or rain, which is not likely according to the weatherman. Thank goodness this is not Denver.

She says very little, even when asked. Her back is killing her and she winces or gets tears in her eyes and goes right on doing what she thinks she has to do, lifting 50 lb bags of horse feed, etc. I suggested she take some time off work and rest and unstress but with two mortgages and kids she feels she can not do that. Her older daughter, who has my pride and joy great grand daughter. is cleaning her house for her every week. Her 11 yr old daughter is a cutie pie but is in the sloppy pre-teens where she does nothing to help and her mother doesn't make her do anything. But being a butinsky will not help the situation, so I just wait and hope she will tell me something after this doctor visit. Will let you know. It's great to have you all thinking of her.

He also gave her some pain Rx. She is doing good. I am fine.\nMy other daughter sees a breast specialist for her yearly mammograms and because of our history she really gives her special treatment. She explained to Chris this week that bone mets are treated like diabetes anymore, just trying to keep it under control, there is no cure and it will always be there. She thinks we should do something about\n the genetic test and that should be Carolyn and she doesn't want to do it. This doctor told Chris I would be better than nothing.

      "Content": " Bev, thanks for your insight. I think you might be hitting the nail right on the head. And that goes for how she feels about\n \"telling\" us all about\n it, too. I talked to her last night and she did get copies of her reports this time. She said the bone scan report shows \"activity\" but insists that is does not differentiate between osteo arthritis, osteoporosis or bone cancer. Does anyone know if that is usually what the report says? The onc couldn't feel the lymph nodes, but she says she can still feel them, but they have grown smaller. Her friend at work bought her a Chi machine and some kind of hot therapy deal. If you google you can find it easily. At first I thought it might be snake oil stuff, but I looked at it and don't see any problem with using it. \nEllen, don't worry about\n being mean, I really doubt you are. It is my generation and the one before who were mean and made kids help a lot more. I talked to Miss Natalie and told her I was coming to check her room to be sure and keep it clean for me and then I would reward her in some way. I'm hoping she will keep it clean and get in the habit until she matures enough to care. LOL. Right now she is just a little girl. When I was her age I was so much more mature. I could cook and clean just like an adult, so maybe it is good to give children a little more time for childhood. \nThanks again for all your help and insight, MK\n ",

I think the time it takes can have to do with your \nlocation and how far the sample has to go to be biopsied. , also. Usually a frozen section is done right away as Lori said but if no one was there trained to read it.......? I guess it would be a moot point. about\n the scar. I had two benign lumps removed before I was diagnosed with cancer. Both times the scar and area filled in and you couldn't see where the lump had been removed. The larger of the two took a little longer filling in, but it did and by the time I had a mastectomy I couldn't remember which breast had which lump originally. So don't be concerned about\n the scar. Let us know about\n the report when it comes back. I hope you hear today. And by the way, you need to get a copy of that report to keep for future references whether it is benign or malignent, and put it in a place where you will know where to find it. Hope you don't have to join us, but you certainly are welcome either way B-9 or other. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " For some reason there are people who pretend to have cancer when they do not. We have suspected some who have come to this board, even, but everyone here now is genuine. That said, I can argue the other side. She could have had treatment and stopped, carried or had all her medical records sent to MD Anderson where they gave her the cocktail quickly without scheduling tests yet. I am sure tests should be forthcoming. As for loss of hair, not everyone loses hair, believe it or not. It depends on the type of Chemo they have. Some hair thins a good bit. Some does not. I met one of the board members here after her chemo and she had a beautiful head of long hair. I could hardly believe it. Being ill after the cocktail???? There are good drugs to counteract the nausea which is usually given before the treatment and then again after, so it is possible to not be sick. And sometimes the next day is worse than right after. Many people on chemo gain weight. Usually the very sick pallor does not show up in the beginning of treatment, either. Now I am sure some others will have some input, maybe even disagree with me, because we do not all think alike and certainly others have had more experience with chemo than I have. I didn't have it but my daughter did. She looked fine all through it but she did lose her hair. When it came back it was beautiful altho very short for a good while. So my advice is to believe in your friend, that is what friends are for. If it turns out she was not really truthful, she may have another problem you can help her with. Who would ever want to pretend cancer????? Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Now I will attempt to answer your question. I am guessing since you are having chemo first your tumor could be large and the doctor wants to shrink it first before surgery. At least that was why they did chemo first several years ago. I have heard that they are doing chemo first more often nowno matter the size. \nWith any surgery, they do not take the whole area off such as a breast. They \nopen it up and take the inside tissue. In fact, there is a nipple sparing surgery if the lump is located so that it can be done. Otherwise they will make a new nipple with reconstruction. Depending on the size of your breast and your intent as to reconstruction, they could do the reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy. My daughter had that done with a tram flap. Others have had inserts that are slowly filled with saline to reform the breast. And if you are older and your other breast is sagging, you can have it perked up, too, so they match or if you are large breasted it can be reduced and the new breast made to match the reduction. \nRead and ask questions about\n reconstruction if you are considering it and find out what is involved with each type.\nHugs Mary K (MK for short)\n ",

She also mentioned taking Femara. I thought she told me Letrozol but I think the Dr gave her samples of that, and maybe when she had to fill a Rx he changed it? She goes for her third appointment this morning. She will get another IV of the bone strengthening drug and have a blood test and a bone scan. As happens so many times when she is here I was doing my BP and sugar test. She took the cuff and did her BP and as usual it was VERY high. 139/105. I raised my eyebrows and said again why hasn't a doctor given you BP medicine? She just shook it off and said oh well, what's the difference? Grrrr. She is too tough. \n \n \n ",

Not sure how to spell that correctly, but it sounds like it is written with a long e sound. Bone Eva You might check into getting that. It can also be taken orally. I am not sure if this is hormone or not. She is also taking hormone drugs, Femara right now. There are also drugs for osteo. I have taken a nose spray called Miacalcin for years. Fosamax is another. Again I am not sure if they are hormone related. It is 4 am here and I am not quite awake. My dogs heard a raccoon on the patio for the second time tonight. They evidently like the bird seed, especially after a good rain when it is all wet cuz they were both sitting there shoveling it in and the light did not worry them a bit. Even this early in the morning I enjoy watching them. I know I am really nuts. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Yes, my surgery was done 1997. My problem was not the mesh nor was that the name of the mesh used. Mine was definitely the sutures as two sutures were the places the infection first showed up. The surgeon cleaned the suture areas up in Sept. 99 and I was on IV antibiotics from August 99 until March 2000. A suture manufacturer put out contaminated sutures because their autoclave was not working, something like 6.1 million suture sets. A recall was done and only something like 2.3 million was returned. It was on 20/20 in early Sept 99 and on the news but with very little publicity, many people died as a result of the infection. The same sutures are used in heart surgery, etc. I was part of a class action suit and got a rather small settlement considering what it did to my life and mobility. Walking gets rougher each year, I now have a scooter and a walker with wheels and a seat, so I could get around San Antonio better now. LOL. I don't go very far from home anymore. I have seats all over the house to use while I work, two in the kitchen, one in the laundry, one in a storage room. It is not fun but it beats the alternative here, too.\nAnd yes, Glenda, I keep telling Carolyn that she needs to address her BP with the dr. I guess when she sees the dr and it is high they just attribute it to nerves of seeing the dr. I keep telling her I was on BP medicine when I was her age and that she needs to be on it, too. But she is one of those people who believes the less medicine you take the better. My husband is like that. He is to take Nexxium every day and takes it every other day. Grrrrr. Then when he has trouble eating I ask if this is the day you took your Nexxium or not............... I see my dr this Thursday for my annual physical. My doc also sees my grand daughter now who has discussed her mother with her, so I will talk to her about\n Carolyn and her BP. She is in good hands with the oncologist but evidently BP is not something he worries about\n? Wish I could get Carolyn to see my doctor, too. \nThanks for your concerns. Hope both your husbands are getting along better. Mine was quite anemic and Celiac Disease was diagnosed. He has been following a gluten free diet and taking iron tablets and a recent blood test was perfectly normal. He is very good about\n not eating wheat products. He doesn't like taking meds but he really follows the diet without cheating. Bev, I bet you wish you could get your DH to do that, too. \nHugs to all, MK\nBTW I told Carolyn that you all seem to ask about\n her about\n the time for each dr visit. She was pleased to know that. She is on a horse board and talks there about\n her cancer.\n ",

It was fine during the initial surgery where the sutures were infected, but after months of trying to save my abdominal wall, everything was infected and all was removed. I have only the outside skin, fat which I have now overproduced, and then omentum or covering of the intestines, from hip to hip, breast to thighs. I am wearing three binders now which are more comfortable than none or one or two, but they still do not lift the nernia. I called an elastic manufacturer to see if I could buy 3\" webbing like is used in binders to design my own. The guy told me they could not sell to the public but he had a roll of black if I could use that he would send it to me. He did and it came last week. 50 yds of strong 3\" elastic. Now all I need is Jo-Ann's help and expertise. She seems to be having a rough time right now and I think she needs to come for another visit. LOL. More hugs.\n ",

With 3 \"tails\" I figure I can get more leverage. In fact, Annie and I talked about\n binders at our first Cincy meeting. Back in the old days the binders were flannel and had many tails, 7 or so, each one being tightened and secured with a safety pin. \nIf you still need a binder to fit your hubby, I know just the one. I bought one recently, it is 15\", five 3\" webs and made for very large people. I bought it figuring it would wrap around at least twice and it almost does. The problem is I can't manage to get it tight enough without DH to help, It is a DARE brand and I bought it at ASAP Medical supply on line. Amamzon has some like it but they are only 4 tiers and not quite as long. I also buy Bird and Cronin 15\" binders from an orthopedic place online. 15\" are hard to find but I need them long enough to go from breast to thigh.

Your story gives me the most hope. \nThe doctor said that it was definitely cancer and the blood test has now ruled out Hodgkins which leaves recurrence. Carolyn has the biopsy set up for Monday afternoon and the bone scan is set for the 9th. Chuck has his upper GI early Monday morning so we will be in Fort Worth but she wants to go alone. My independent daughter who does not like fuss, bother or emotion....... They both work and bought a ranch near our new house, the reason we moved up this way, so no she wouldn't qualify for help. They live in the town we moved from and come to the ranch ion weekends. Their insurance is through a small business situation, hence the not so good insurance. \nAnd yes, Cathi, I feel exactly as your mother did. It should be me and I wish to Hello it was.\nThanks again for all your love and concern.\nHugs MK\n ",

Well, they couldn't do that because it was already cancelled and the refund check had been issued. Yes, we got the check for $36. But the paper was there again yesterday. Here is what they finally discovered at the paper office. When I first called in the guy cancelled the paper at the old address, which made the account number drop off the system. Then all the subsequent calls to stop the delivery of the paper were sent to the carriers using the old account number, which no one was showing on their route anymore. Sooooo since no one had that number it was not on their route................ now I think they are trying another method of reaching the right carrier. After all this is a big city with a huge circulation of millions. If not I guess we will have to take action Jo-Ann's way. I am surprised she didn't have us use Mr. Smith and Mrs. Wesson. LOL Next I should tell you about\n Chuck's trip to the real estate tax office. Better yet, Jo-Ann knows that situation, too, maybe she can conjure up a story.

      "Content": " Thanks for your understanding. It has been eight years since Carolyn's diagnosis. She had no positive nodes but was given chemo, 4 rounds because of her age. She turned 40 just as she finished. She had a mastectomy so she did not have radiation. Her lump was high on her breast and was rather long. It was classed as a Stage 2 because of the size. She took Tamoxifen for awhile but it caused her to be really depressed which is certainly not her. She was not good about\n going for yearly check ups but she did go for her five year check ups and mammagram and all looked fine then. \nI am not worrying until we hear what the out come is as to where it is located. So far the CT scan showed her internal organs to be ok. She has been experiencing terrible back pain for several months so that is what we are concerned about\n. Another concern is that they have lousey insurance. I think it pays only 80% after a big deductible, so the cost of chemo is frightening. The oncologist seems to feel sure it is breast cancer returning or the second guess is Hodgkins. Either way he is saying it is most likely cancer. \nHugs MK\n ",

He did manage to get to the other house yesterday to check on things. I am here covered up with boxes to unpack yet and stuff to figure out and arrange. My DGD who was such a big help went to Milwaukee to be with her father while he is waiting to have surgery for a thyroid cancer. She'll be back next week and will come and help me some more then. His cancer is in early stages and should be ok, but she wanted to be with him. She's a wonderful young lady. \nI have been keeping track of the board several times a day, just not taking time to post because I really have little to add. You all are so much more knowledgeable to help newbies than I am. But I am behind you 100% and keeping everyone in my thoughts and prayers.\nHugs MK\n ",

She told me her husband told her she better hurry up and get better because there is a lot of fence repair to do on the ranch.  He was joking..................  but knowing her she will probably be doing it.  She is one tough woman, wants to take it all on herself.  Still wish I could trade, but I am hoping this medication will be the kind that works and works well for her.  Hugs MK\n ",

She insists the pain in her back, which is evidently quite severe because it brings her to tears when she moves wrong, is from a muscle not any bone cancer. She has been to a chiropracter several times and yesterday had a massage by therapist a doctor had recommended to someone else. Evidently she gets a little relief but then her work requires standing and bending in such a way that it causes pain again. She is cheerful usually, unless you catch her when she is really hurting and full of stress. She puts on a happy face and continues to do way more than she needs to or should. She is still hauling big bags of feed for the horses and cows instead of leaving them for her son or husband to do. Grrrr. I try not to be a buttinsky and let her tell me what she wants. I think it is harder to try to suggest to your own daughter what she needs to do than it is a friend or a stranger. Soon as I know anything about\n her next onc appt I will let you know. Thanks for asking. And thanks for the hugs, we both can use them. Hugs to you all, too. MK\n ",

I am not sure it was radiology or if it was chemo. She lived in OK at the time and the doctor treating her for heart problems unfortunately erred in her treatment. She moved to Atlanta GA and went to a new doctor. Just as he was getting a handle on her problems her heart gave out. We were all so upset because it was so unnecessary. Her heart beat was very erratic as I recall. I am not telling you this to frighten you, but to point out it can happen and once again we must advocate staying on top of what the doctor is doing and how much he/she knows.

It is supposed to be about\n the support of family, friends and strangers and how much it helped her. Amazon has it listed for $16.95 for preorder and you can get it through the Amazon connection here and help Healingwell at the same time. \nI can't figure out why you would be getting elephant mail, Joyce. It should be from the donkeys............. lol. Gees I love the way the powers of internet send us emails after things we do. My grand daughter uses my computer to check into things for a new mother and her interests and now I am plagued with emails for baby stuff etc. And I try not to stray into unknown territory that might take me near something that is a no-no subject, all of a sudden emails come from them, too. The other day I was googling something and almost hit the wrong selection, am I glad I caught myself.\nMeanwhile I am still in a strange mood and not real excited about\n posting, altho I do keep an eye on the posts. Big hugs, MK\n ",

I had only seen that one until this one was put up for bid. I was astonished at the price it brought. The originally sold for $40. There are still a few available in gift shops but Rubel quit making them about\n three years ago and some are more rare than others. I think Greta is the hardest to find. A Bargain Shopper angel sold for $278 last week. The ones I brought to LV were Flora Sweet which Libby got and Alice Goody the Nurse and I don't remember who got her. I watch as they are listed and when the sell well print the results for my kids to know the value in the future. LOL My way of investing????? DH thought I was nuts buying these angels but I think he is beginning to think maybe I wasn't quite as nuts as he thought. LOL. \nHugs MK\n ",

A tummy tuck if you need one is a great asset of the tram. You end up with natural looking breasts and they grow with you as you get older. Trust me I know that. LOL. Just don't expect to come home and do what you did before surgery for a few months. Many of us have had the surgery, so ask away. I did not like the lopsided feel with the prosthesis myself.

I was lucky and caught my cancer early and my staging is barely I. In fact the onc I saw drew a chart and showed me how each factor of mine fit it. I think there were all zeros but one I.

DON'T fret and worry about\n the biopsy while you are gone, there could be no reason for worry so why waste time worrying? \nI have no idea about\n the insurance, but I am hoping and guessing that because it is the same company perhaps you will have no trouble getting it changed to your husband's plan. PPOs are usually higher in cost and I would think that would be in your favor rather than the opposite scenario. \nLet us know what happens. We will help all we can. Be sure to get copies of all your path reports and mammo reports to keep in your own files. It will lbe helpful in the future even if this turns out to be benign.

I know I am really nuts, but she really wants to see her great, great grand daughter as well as Carolyn's kids. She has mellowed so much I hope it will be a pleasant visit. More later.

Early detection and getting treatment can be all it takes for a longer lifetime. I was diagnosed ten years ago and there are several more around here that far out. One of us is approaching 25 years I believe. Try not to worry until you really have something you know needs worried about\n. We are here to help once you get some more answers. Hug, Mary K.\n ",

A friend of mine actually wore a winter coat sweater around the office when it was so hot the rest of us could die, because she would freeze to death after having a major flash. I never would have believed any one body could swing from hot to cold like she did. I hated having flashes but they were nothing compared to what she went through. I hope you are able to find something to ease yours. My dr prescribed Lexapro for me because I was having anger/rage spells. I know when I was having hot flashes that would have triggered them big time. The Lexapro does help me now. Mary K.\n ",

The best way to know is to have a biopsy. There is a needle biopsy which is easier than surgical biopsy which is not a difficult surgery at all. Personally I would want a surgical biopsy because the needle could possibly hit off the mass, especially if it is a movable mass. However, if cancer is suspected and a needle biopsy confirms it, so much the better. In your case they seem to be saying they believe it is benigh. Keep us posted as to what is happening, please.

It is a sort of depression but instead of feeling down, you feel angry, terribly angry. Talk to you doctor about\n the Wellbutrin. I took it for awhile two different times and it didn't help me, but now a I am taking Lexapro and it seems to be working ok. All medicines are not for all people. There is a cream that one of our dear sisters used to talk about\n several years back to help with the vag dryness. Maybe someone can tell you more about\n it. Astroglide I think was the name.

I had two benign lumps long before my diagnosis nearly ten years ago. It was caught early and I have not had any cancer issues since. Be proactive and look out for number one.

Now I couldn't do that if my life depended on it awake. So back I go again tonight, this time I will be fitted with a machine that sends air through my nose and all those wires and sensors will be hooked up again.  Oh Joy.  What fun old age is getting to be.  Hugs MK\n ",

You brought your kids and I brought my grandkids? There was a little blonde headed guy with me who started taking trombone lessons in 6th grade band. It turns out he got all the right genes from all sides! He is so good on that trombone that his judge for solo contest told him \"Bravo\" you will play with a symphony some day. We just learned in the past few weeks that he has been chosen to play with the Fort Worth Youth Symphony, one of the youngest at 14 to ever earn that privilege. Next year they are going to China! I took him at Christmas to buy him a special mouthpiece he wanted and even the guys at the music store told me how good he is just listening to him trying mouthpieces. His Junior High Band director loves him.\nBig hugs, MK\n ",

Since I had expected a skin check I did not have it all written down and when I started pointing to places I missed several. To be fair she handled removing some skin tags, etc. \nIn the last couple of weeks there was an article in Family Circle with an \"Are you at Risk?\" list and several pictures. The only question I didn't have to check was, \"Have you ever had a bout with skin cancer?\" I have some things that look like the pictures, too, so I am going to take the article when I see her next month and suggest again that I see a Dermatologist for a skin check. \nLet us know.

When my daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer two years after I was, I called and got a report from 12 years before so we would have more history. \nYou never know when you are waiting for surgery what is going to happen. I was prepped, the IV in and ready to go to the OR when the two surgeons who were going to do the surgery came into preop and told me they were going to postpone my surgery. It was for repair to my abdomen after nasty infections problems that were cleaned up two months before. Anyhow, my blood work somehow was lost from earlier in the week and they took blood that day which showed my physical condition was not the greatest for the surgery planned. They also discovered that day that the mesh they were going to use to repair the hernia caused by earlier surgery was not big enough. So needles were pulled and I went back home that day. I never have had the surgery and live with the hernia situation. Don't let this story scare you, the situation that caused the infection was rare.\nI guess I am just trying to say different situations happen. I bet the person who was in line for surgery after me, got to go early. LOL. My mastectomy surgery was easy. I was in a local hospital with only 28 beds, they kept me about\n four days and I had wonderful caring nurses. I actually enjoyed my stay. \nHugs MK\n ",

Now because of our history my younger daughter is being very carefully watched. Fortunately, my cancer was low grade and my daughter's grade II because of the tumor size. We are both doing great at 9 1/2 years and 7 yeaers out. We both had tram flap reconstruction after mastectomies. \nThere are all kinds of stages and pathological reports here. You can learn a lot by reading and asking. You can teach a lot by sharing your story. Welcome to both of you!!!! \nHugs, Mary K (MK for short)\n ",

She sounds like a very understanding, caring doctor. You came to the right place to hear real stories of personal experiences. We are all ages here, if you have not seen the Roll Call above I suggest you run through it and familiarize yourself with some of us. We will try to help you go through whatever treatment you do. We were all scared to death when we first learned of the possibility of breast cancer, so we understand what you are feeling now. I often say \"don't worry until you know what you have to worry about\n!\" Worrying needlessly does not help you. Take a deep breath and start on a list of questions for the doctor.

If you would like to send me your phone number via email, please click on my name in the left column to get my email address.\nNo, neither of us had bilateral. \nCarolyn lifts hay and feed bags for the animals, she does most anything she used to do, but sometimes she does hurt across her midriff where the muscle was pulled up through. Her surgeon used only one lateral muscle and did not use mesh for her. I was bigger breasted than she and when asked if I wanted to reduce my other breast I chose not to, so my surgeon used both lateral muscles and did use mesh in me. I did not feel the mesh and altho I ended up with suture problems, the mesh was not a problem for me. The tummy tuck was really nice because at 58, I was really needing something. LOL.\nYes, it definitely does take about\n a year to return to normal. Now that is not recovery necessarily. You can do more and more as time goes on but it takes a good two months to even stand really straight. Lifting is a problem for a little longer, but I don't know that Carolyn was real good about\n waiting there, either. I know she did not attempt to ride a horse for a long time because of having to get up in the saddle.\nAs I said I am willing to call you if you want.

I would insist on having the lump removed rather than a needle biopsy, too. Since it is small, what are chances of missing the spot? A removal biospy is very simple day surgery and you will get a complete pathology report which tells you not only if it is benign or malignant, but also reveals the properties of the cells and gives a picture of what is needed in follow up care. Early detection is important. You said your mother was diagnosed 20 years ago. If all is well with her now, chances are even if you have a cancerous tumor you will be fine after treatment. My daughter and I were both diagnosed. Over nine years ago for me and seven years for her and we are both doing just fine now. She had chemo because she was younger and the oncologist thought it would be a good preventative measure. I had a mastectomy and no further treatment. \nI know you don't want to be here, none of us really did, but with each other's support it has made a big difference in our lives. We will help you in any way we can. Read the Roll Call post when you have time and learn more about\n us. You might want to post there and let us know where you live.

My BP med was changed for a generic over a year ago and after fighting higher blood sugar tests Debr suggested it might be my medicine. It was, I went back on brand only. Then the BP was getting a little high so the dr wanted me to take double dose, one in the am and one in the pm. Again my fasting blood sugar went up. So I am trying new combinations with different meds. I guess the answer is to try until you get a drug that works with your body and stick with it. Sometimes that can change with time, too.

      "Content": " Here is my take on this subject. No one knows for sure who Denise is or was. No one knows for sure who Frankee is. No one knows for sure if Denise's mother was her mother. We meet people on internet forums and believe them until they do something that might seem questionable. Then some of us begin to have doubts whether the story is straight or not. \nI also talked to Denise on the phone, she sent me pictures of her family including her husband before he began to \"beat her\", \"stalk her\" and break into her home? She sent me to the Wales Chorus website where he was supposedly a member and she seemed quite proud of that fact. Many questioned the fact that she spent so much time on the computer with small children. The seizures she had that made her fall down stairs, break bones, end up in the hospital for a few hours and then be home again were perplexing to me. Maybe that is how things are done in Wales, who knows? The obituary was not an obituary from a newspaper, it was written by her mother???? But was her mother, her mother? She had supposedly gone through two heart attacks and was near death and then was well enough to take care of Denise and communicate with several board members. \nI never heard any mention of the fact that Rita had made her up. I know that Rita cared deeply and worried about\n her and I supposed Rita quit the board because of Denise's death. I certainly had no idea anyone had made such an accusation against Rita and it makes me sad to think she had to deal with that, too.\nPersonally after this long, I don't know why we are revisiting the whole thing. Peter got information which he felt might be something we needed to know and shared it. He certainly does not deserve to be raked over the coals because someone believes Denise was not fraudulant. Believe me there were more who felt she was than felt she wasn't. If she was and you believed in her, so what nothing has changed as far as your beliefs are concerned? If she wasn't fraudulant and you believe in her, she is gone and won't be back. There is nothing you can do. I think the whole thing should be dropped and forgotten. And this is the type of post I would like to delete because it solves no problems only causes more of them.\nThe two people I know of that have been banned from the breast cancer forum were banned because of problems with multiple names and had nothing to do with Denise. The multiple names were found by using the ISP address. Not personality decisions. \nSo Frankee what is your goal here? As far as we are concerned Denise is gone. To my knowledge she received no great sum of money from anyone. She was sent cards and small gifts. So if you are hoping for some information to build a case you will not find anything from here. I suggest you give Denise our good wishes the next time you see her and forget about\n us. We can take care of ourselves and if another Denise comes along there will be some who believe and some who question.\nMary K.\n ",

My next great grand daughter is due in June. At least the sonograms say it is a girl. Did your DD's say that, too? Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Air Angle, I edited your post so you would have a title that might bring you more help. You really didn't say much about\n your symptoms so it is hard to know where to go in trying to help. Three years ago you had a mammogram that showed three spots. What kind of spots? Were they white and called calcifications? What is going on now? Have you had another mammogram? Are there more spots or is there something else showing? You mentioned pregnancy and menapause, so I am assuming that there is something wrong with your period. Generally that is not affected by breast cancer unless you are taking medication or having chemo. So tell us a little more and we will see if we can help you. You can get a copy of your records from three years ago and the mammogram report at that time. It might be handy to have if something is developing. I was diagnosed with breast cancer nine years ago and was one of the fortunate ones, a mastectomy took care of my problems. Unfortunately we have many women who have been fighting breast cancer for a good while. So let us try to help. The least we can do is hold your hand as you go through tests, etc. Hugs MK\n ",

Be sure to look at it real well and if it looks pink or red, feel it for more warmth than the rest of your skin to see if there might be an infection going on in there. Also fluid can collect, called a seroma, which might have to be drained so feel it in two places and see if when one side is pushed in if you can feel fluid flowing to the other hand. Tram flaps are very major surgery and you have to really watch. I had trouble with seromas and then later with infection. Don't be afraid to check in with your doctor, they would rather have you call when nothing is wrong than have you wait it out and have a problem that could have been solved more easily. Hugs, MK\n ",

When he was not able to get fluid I was sent to the hospital for a biopsy or lumpectomy as it is called sometimes. It was benign and I gave no thought or worry about\n my breasts for another twenty years when I had my first mammogram.

Her short term memory is terrible, but she is doing very well otherwise. Still dressing to the nines with jewelry and all. The people at the home are really very nice. All seems well, already I am responding to less worry, blood sugar and blood pressure numbers are getting back to my normal range. Strange how stress affects them so much. Today I am doing nothing but resting.\nHope and pray all is well with everyone. \nMK\n ",

Of course there is time for healing and you have to take care in use of your arms and lifting. There are exercises to do to help with range of movement and all, but within a couple of months you are good as new. Reconstruction is a different story. Are you planning on having it done or not?

You had breast cancer diagnosed last fall, had a mastectomy and this fall when a lump is found in your other breast the doctor decides to play God and pronounce you cured? A second doctor says ok we will wait six months. What in the world is wrong with these people? Why would anyone wait and not do a biopsy. Oh my blood pressure is soaring................... You need this thing out of your breast. And if I were you and already had one mastectomy I would seriously think of another one to prevent any lump from showing up again next year even if this one is benign. But that is only my humble opinion. \nOf course your emotions are running wild. Just from last year's activities it is not unusual to be emotional. And now this and doctor's with a terrible attitude. Where are you? Can you find another doctor or two who would be a little more proactive in your care? You need many hugs after the treatment they have given you.\nHere are some (((())))) for a start, MK\n ",

This summer has been a little slow with old friends, but we have made lots of new ones. I guess we will have to have another AWOL round up and have everyone check on someone else. LOL\nI never told the next chapter of the computer story. Can you believe that Rashid, the tech I had to pay for a service agreement to talk to and then listen to a sales pitch, called me back that night at 10 PM to tell me there is a fan on the CPU that could be the problem. I told him forget it, we would take care of it here. He sounded upset like he had gotten into hot water. Maybe the sales pressure was not what he was supposed to do? LOL Still looking for the fan, no cross references to Chinese parts. I may have to buy a new computer but it will be on sale someplace not direct from Rashid. Gees.\nEnjoy your life.\nHugs MK\n ",

We have had several women over the years (many of us have been together here for nearly seven years) who have gone through chemo while pregnant.

Is there a good breast cancer clinic in your area? How about\n neo natal specialists? We are here for you if you need our support and love. Another strange thing, I think all the babies have been girls............... Not that it has any significance, but that is what I remember. We do have a couple of active young women who are so busy with babies and treatment we don't hear from them often. Maybe they will see your post and respond. I hope so.

      "Content": " Oh Vickie, I am so sorry this happened to you. My daughter had one mastectomy and tram flap and she lifts stuff all over the place. She has horses and lifts bags of feed and hay......... I really worry about\n her. I had problems that do sound a little like yours. Several years ago a company put contaminated sutures on the market because their autoclave was broken and no one discovered it. 6.5 Million suture sets went out. There was a recall but only 1.6 Million came back Somehow I managed to be a lucky one that got the bad sutures. My surgeon fought my infection with the help of an infectious disease specialist for nearly a year with antibiotics from oral to injected into my abdominal wall to IV for months, before deciding the infection was just too much. I had all my abdominal muscles removed from hip to hip breast to thighs along with all infected tissue. I now live with a huge hernia that looks like a Buddha fertility god. Like you I can't get up, I can't stand for long nor walk for long. I wear binders 24/7 to hold in the hernia a little, well they support it. You know maybe binders would help you???? Email me a phone number where I can call you and we can discuss this even more. mkstroup@juno.com I hesitate to write about\n my mess on here because it was so extraordinary I don't want to frighten others. Hindsight is always better than foresight. Yes, Tram flap is very difficult surgery and like everything else the percentages of problems is very small compared to the successes. Many people died with the contaminated sutures, I feel lucky to be alive. The news of the problem was much too hushed on the news to suit me. Please email me, maybe I can help you more. Hugs, Mary K.\n ",

      "Content": " Diep and free flap are the same. Tram flap is when the rectus abdominus muscles (center two abdominal muscles running up and down) are tunneled up through the midriff area and wrapped around to make the under breast. The a wedge of skin area usually containing the belly button is taken to make the outside of the breast. You can actually see my old belly button which was stitched together in my new breast. The lower part of the abdominal skin layer is pulled up and stitched to the upper bottom end of where the wedge was removed. This is actually a free tummy tuck. The surgeon makes a new belly button so it looks normal. LOL Depending on the size of the breast or if there are two breasts being made two rectus muscles could be used. A piece of mesh is usually installed in the area where it was removed to keep the intestines closed in. The tunneling muscle leaves the blood vessels intact and supplies blood to the new breast. In the free flap the muscle is cut and applied as a free piece and the surgeon has to have special skills to attach the blood vessels, can't remember what this specialty is called, vascular???, but few surgeons have this skill as it is so specialized. I had the best plastic surgeon in Fort Worth according to all the nurses and medical people I talked with, but free flap was not an option then and I doubt if he has the specialized skill today. These are definitely major, major surgery but produce real feeling breasts that do grow if you gain weight. I should know on that score. LOL.  You can wait for reconstruction, I waited seven months.  Having a bilateral done, you may not even want reconstruction, you can wear prosthesis when you want breasts and run around braless and comfortable when you don't.  Yes, the flap kind of reconstruction is much more difficult surgery than the mastectomy.  Implants is not so difficult, altho I understand they are not a piece of cake, either.\nHugs MK \n ",

The nicest young doctor came into the room and immediately told me I was not in any crisis situation.  He said there were some indications that I could have kidney disease in the very beginning stages, but there was not really any reasons for concern.  We discussed the increase in blood sugar numbers and blood pressure numbers and I told him about\n them decreasing since I got the Brand only Lotensin back and quit taking the generic Rx.  He thought it would be good to increase the Lotensin meds to be sure to keep the BP down, but that was it.  Come back next year just so he could check and make sure all was still going well.  I told him I expected to have to have dye injected tests and be told low protein diet, but he said no.  Protein is good and I am far from needing to have tests other than blood or urinalysis.  So all in all it was a good day and I know I owe you all a big thank you for coming along and helping me out with prayers.  Big hugs of thanks,  MK\n ",

Jo-Ann thinks it might also have something to do with my two computer hook up. We will keep trying. My son in law comes at Christmas so if we haven't solved it by then, he will.

Perhaps you could try again by copying the post above and making a new post with a title line that will catch our Stage IV women's eyes. We do have several here that I am sure can help. I have heard of all the 2 thru 4 choices, but I have no experience with them. One question I would ask the doctor is, if your wife was in my position, which would you choose for her? Please let us know what you decide and we will help. Hugs, Mary K. MK\n ",

I happened to get some factory contaminated sutures in surgery, the company had a recall but only about\n 1/3 of the sutures were returned. I won't go into all the details, but believe me this mess changed my life and certainly not for the better. Yet even tho a regular attorney turned all my records (after he and a surgical specialist read them) over to a malpractice attorney there was not enough for the malpractice specialists to be sure they could win a suit for me, so they were not interested in my case. I was in a class action suit and did get a little, but no where near the amount that would compensate for my bills which my insurance company paid, nor to compensate me for my problems now. I firmly believe my trip to the kidney specialist today is also a result of the massive infection. My point being a lawyer will only take the case if they feel they can win and there really has to be substantial evidence for them to feel that way. You can talk to an attorney, none will charge for the first visit. Hugs MK\n ",

I was ready for surgery with even IV line in when the two surgeons who were to do the surgery came to see me to tell me my blood chemistry was not good and they didn't have mesh in a piece large enough to do the job. Surgery was cancelled.............. Another time I was released to go home and was told a specialist would be in to see me to give me instructions for home. After waiting for hours I called the office of the doctor I was waiting to see only to find out she was out of town at a seminar. Finally about\n eight or nine at night another doctor who worked with her came in and let me go. I had waited nearly 12 hours after the release of the surgeon. Frustrating, yes. They are all so busy. And God knows New Orleans needs all the help they can get. There is so much destruction and tragedy there. We'll be with you on the 15th. Hugs MK\n ",

It is normal at this time to feel this way. Those who are having more serious problems are further into the breast cancer journey and not everyone gets to the stage of having such difficult problems, thank heavens. We have had women talk about\n the diep flap here but I don't think any of the regulars right now have had that surgery. It is very specialized and not as commonly done as the tram flap and implants. While I can't really answer your direct questions about\n the diep, I had the tram flap. Once you have surgery anywhere on your body nerves are cut that cause a numbness, so I am not thinking that the sensation would be completely normal. You have feelings on those nerve ending. My tram flap breast feels normal and looks normal in clothing, but of course does not look exactly like my other breast except in size and symmetry. Hope this helps a little. Hugs MK\n ",

I don't know if the rolls had been reversed if he would have done the same for me, probably not. But then I never had a really high paying job. That job sounds like a wonderful one. Living in Maine would be safer it seems. I could also be much colder. What you are suggesting, Jan to summer surely sounds reasonable to me. It is not that many months and with holidays and school breaks you could visit back and forth while you do your trial months. It could be he would learn to love the outwoodsy Maine even more than you. NY to Maine is not so far if there is a good highway cutting across, but I don't think there is because of mountains.

I know it is frightening for you to deal with your mother's breast cancer when you are so young and probably know little about\n the disease. There are all types of breast cancer, most of the time it is very treatable and not a threat. You will learn after her surgery from her pathological report about\n her cancer. The lymph system is a series of nodes which normally handles carrying off infections and is a part of the immune system. If cancer cells go to the lymph system it is possible they can go to other parts of the body and show up there as cancer but still breast cancer features. The oncologist (cancer doctor) decides on treatment depending on the pathology and if the cancer has spread to the lymph system. I tried to say this so you could understand in case you had no idea about\n it. Please feel free to come with questions. Hugs MK\n ",

When I was a kid I tweezed for both of my grandmothers and now I spend a part of each day doing the same for myself. My grand daughters look at me as if I am nuts when I ask them if they would help me. I also find it very difficult to cut my toenails and have asked for help there, too, to no avail. \nI bought the waxing kit, a battery powered thingy that was supposed to grab the hair and pull it out. When I get a perm I have had the beautician do my eyebrows and chin and mustache. Recently I asked her to do cheeks and all to get that peach fuzz that grows way too long. Well that was a mistake, I had blisters all over my cheeks like I had been sun burned. Someone could probably make some really good money inventing a system that works and doesn hurt or maim us. \nHugs MK\n ",

She always had a beautiful smile and love in her heart. The first post in this thread is from her husband. Ian is their son who was in kindergarten last year. Kai is her stepson who was very devoted to her and helped her a lot. Three wonderful men. Michael's mother is a nurse who helped him take care of Mel in her final months. Jo-Ann and I went to visit and were treated like family. \nThanks again for posting, Mike. You all are still in my heart. Hugs Mary K.\n ",

They moved to Bay St Louis right on the beach and last year decided they had had enough of hurricanes and high insurance and moved to Memphis earlier this summer. Thank God they did because the house on the beach is definitely gone, the house in Gulfport is most likely gone or damaged beyond repair. She had a renter there and many friends in the area she is so concerned for their welfare.

The biopsy is very simple surgery and will not be traumatic. After you get back your pathology report and know what you are dealing with you may have decisions to make. But the important part is to have the pathology report. Even if there is a malignancy, there is no need to panic, because there are many differences which indicate which path to take. A low grade, early cancer can be easily dealt with. More agressive cancers require more aggressive treatment. So just calm down as much as you can and don't worry until you know you really have something to worry about\n. We are here to hold your hand and help. I realize watching you mom was difficult. My daughter also was diagnosed with breast cancer and believe me it was much worse for me dealing with hers than mine. She is doing fine just like I am.

I can't see how I could have kidney damage from sugar diabetes and think it is more related to my abdominal mess.

I think I better call and warn her off the French Fries and to learn to write right handed. This is just too ridiculous for words. Laughing, MK\nPS Joyce I should send Vic some of the emails I get from Jo-Ann when she has watched TV and gotten angry. Chuck and I laugh and laugh.\n ",

I don't think there is a medicine anywhere that will help the healing process. Jo-Ann is correct about\n diabetes being a reason for not healing, but from what you described to me you don't sound like a candidate for it unless your family has a history. Has your doctor run a complete blood protein on you? Low blood protein can cause healing problems, too. That was the reason I did not have scheduled surgery once, the surgeons explained that I would not heal because my blood protein was too low. \nScream and vent all you want, but please rest and eat some really good full of vitamin foods. Can you do liver? Dark green veggies. Fish and cheese. When do you go back to see the doctor? \nHugs Mary K MK\n ",

Simply having calcifications here and there is not unusual but when they cluster they could be the start of cancer. At this point, if there is clustering the biopsy will tell you if there is cancer, and even if there is, chances are it will be early and most likely easily controlled. Meanwhile stick around here, learn all you can here and other sources on the internet or in books, etc. The more you learn, the more knowledgeable decision you can make should you need to make one.

I have heard of several samples being taken which is probably better, but all those needles would bother me more than having a regular biopsy done. My daughter had the needle test done which told her she indeed did have a malignancy, then it gave her time to line up a breast surgeon and a plastic surgeon so she could have both done at one time.

Lung cancer and pancreatic cancer led the list as not being very good odds of treatment. Prostate was at the very bottom as being most treatable. Breast cancer was lower than middle range and then take into consideration how early detection factors into it all. I think you are going to be just fine.

She had a bone marrow transplant. She went several years without recurrence, then it came back in her nodes in her neck. But she lived over 12 years with a good quality of life after the transplant. With that many positive nodes I was amazed at how well she did for so long. She worked full time right up to the last couple of months with a great attitude. \nI had 19 removed and all were negative.

Jo-Ann who posted above didn't mention her original doctors told her that she had nine months to live. She is almost nine years a survivor. She had a second mastectomy in 2000 with a second breast tumor. So you see that no one can really make a statement like your doctors have made, they can't see into the future. I agree you need to find a new oncologist, one who believes in the medicine they are practicing. You might as well take care of yourself and practice your own medicine as work with these people. Hugs and many prayers, MK\n ",

Now when I had the last lump which was not benign the radiologist told me they were highly suspicious for cancer and I knew from that to really expect cancer. I think most of us agree that the only definite way to know for sure is to have a biopsy done. Waiting for another six months may not make a big difference if you have a slow growing cancer, but an aggressive cancer could do a lot of changing in six months. Ask for asssurance from your doctor.

I needed repairs from child birth and a doctor had told me the best repair was to have a hysterctomy, so I insisted on having one when I was 42 and beginning menopause. The surgeon was not all that convinced but removed the uterus, then afterward he told me my pathology report was precancer so he was glad he had complied with my request. I think I would also want an area removed that had precancer cells in my breast also. A lumpectomy is very easy surgery and it would be a lot safer than waiting and watching in my humble opinion. And, there have been cases where a calcification cluster can hide a mass behind it. My daughter had a second lump behind the one seen on the mammogram. So, it is your choice.

Christian very politely explained she was his mother and she had to take medicine that made her lose her hair. He was about\n six at the time. Another cute hair story. My grand daughter was behind my husband sitting in his chair and noticed he was getting very thin on top. She rubbed his head and said, \"Don't worry, Grandpa, it will grow back!\".

Sometimes when tumors are large, chemo is given before any surgery to reduce the size of the tumor before removal. So as you learn more and more about\n breast cancer you will understand more about\n your own treatment. You are doing the right thing to read and learn and ask questions. I was telling a friend the other day that I wish I had known more about\n breast cancer before I had to make decisions. I didn't find the internet until my daughter was also diagnosed two years after I was. It would have made so much difference to me if I could have discussed my decisions and learned from women who had been there, done that. So feel free to read, learn, question and vent if you need to.

Since Mia has the same insurance and was able to get them to pay for the test, that set precedence. Maybe if they still fight you after you try a little more to get it paid, she can provide you with a copy of the statement that they paid for her test. Insurance companies and the government are famous for turning down payment of health issues the first couple of times through. Getting disability from Uncle Sam is an automatic turn down at least twice no matter what. I have only known two people who did not get turned down and they were not expected to live long. Good luck in getting approval. We are here behind you. This test sounds like a great one. I am interested in seeing the effect it has long term. So many have had chemo and had ill effects, others seem to breeze through without problems. But why put your body through it if not necessary? Hugs MK\n ",

There are some that are very slow growing and minimal, and others that are aggressive and harder to fight. First you need to be very comfortable with your doctors. Don't accept everything with out questioning if you have a question. Get a copy of your pathology reports and keep them for reference. You can share the details here and we can help you with what is being said. Also we are spread all over the country, if you saw the Roll Call above, it will give you information as to where we are and our age, etc. It is possible someone could be near you and be able to even meet you for lunch. The last time I said that, the new member wrote back she lived in Nebraska. Nope no one else was near her. LOL. OH, NY-NJ, IN, MI, have several members, KY, TX, CA and some other states have a couple. Just jump right in a feel at home and ask away. You are also allowed to vent, scream, whatever helps, however, some words are edited with *****s. Hugs of welcome, Mary K. (MK)\n ",

You can find mine by clicking on my name and if you email me, I will do my best to answer your questions. \nWe just had a new member here from Nebraska, she laughed when I suggested she tell us where she lived that someone may live near her. Now if I can remember her name? Maybe she will see this post and say something. \nNo I had to quit doing the water aerobics. I got another infection in the abdominal wall from a swimming pool, not the one I was going to for aerobics but I decided it was not worth taking the chance of infection. I enjoyed being in the warm water, too, but I had to drive nearly an hour each way, deal with wet binders when I got home and with the infection possibilities I just gave up.\nIt is good to hear from you, hope you will stick around and feel at home here. We had a good get together in Louisville, KY in May of 04. Becky Phelps was not doing well so we all wanted to go to her area and walk the survivor's lap with her, which we did.

Recently I went blackberry picking on my scooter and the people who owned the orchard called me a hot rod. It was only because I had not had much experience driving it at the time. Then I took the kids to the zoo and buzzed around there with the kids running behind yelling at me to slow down cuz they couldn't keep up. So picture the Bigfoot hunt, MK buzzing on the scooter and everyone running behind yelling at me to slow down. Even Bigfoot would be frightened out of his wits, but that old alligator just might join in the fun. Oh Jo-Ann your stories come all too infrequently, but we enjoy reading them none the less.

I am sorry I have been very negligent in sending cards, too. Again, Patty, thanks for letting us know. Hugs, MK\n \nPS I went to the newspaper and it was so much trouble to login that I copied to paste her obituary here. There was also a picture which I doubt will print here, so if you want an email version with the picture, let me know. \n \nVIEW IMAGE \nJanice Evelyn Barnhart, 49\nJune 27, 2005\nJanice Evelyn Barnhart\nDecember 31, 1955 To June 24, 2005\nJanice Evelyn Barnhart, 49, of Poulsbo died Friday, June 24th, after eight years of fighting breast cancer with great strength and courage.\nBorn to Clarence J. and Donna (Skog) Breuer in Duluth, Minnesota, she was her father's only baby girl, but had no problem holding her own with her four boisterous brothers. The family moved to Carmichael, California when she was eight. She was attending LaSierra High School when they moved to Poulsbo, where she graduated from North Kitsap High School in 1974. She then moved to Southern California, where she worked for eight years before moving back to Poulsbo. She started her career in federal employment at Port Hueneme and spent many years at PSNS and Bangor.\nShe married Doug Barnhart on August 19th, 1989. They were blessed with two beautiful daughters, Katelyn Rose and Linnea Kristine. These two girls were the light of her life. All of her activities centered on them, as she lovingly sought to lay the groundwork and foundation for their lives. They enjoyed time spent together camping, and the family's favorite vacation spot was Disneyland. Imaginative and sentimental, Janice used her beloved family photographs and her collection of rubber stamps to create numerous treasures, from greeting cards to intricately embellished scrapbooks. She loved decorating her home, especially on the holidays, with the many things she and her girls made. She was a vigilant Girl Scout leader, and an enthusiastic member of Vinland Lutheran Church. She was involved with the Busy Mom's Bible Study and many other church groups.\nConcerned with how her illness might affect her children, she and her husband worked hard to keep a semblance of normalcy in the household throughout her long struggle with cancer. It was accomplished only with the help of her extraordinary friends, family, and Vinland family. She was truly loved by all. Her school friends, Cindy, Julie, Noreen, Jane, Kathleen, Jeff and Shirley were her Night Angels, nursing her throughout the nights on her last week on this earth. Her entire family was there when a bright ray of sunshine shone onto her early Friday morning as, surrounded by those she loved, the Lord \nopened heaven's gates and welcomed her home.\nShe leaves behind her husband, Douglas, daughters Katelyn and Linnea, and her parents Donna and Clarence Breuer of Poulsbo. Her brothers and their families: Craig and Nancy of Monroe, their children Leslie, Ashley, and Cory, Michael and Michelle of Poulsbo, their children William, Janelle, Helecia and Brandon, Kevin of Poulsbo, his children Colby, Franchesca, and Cavin (Rusty), and Jeffrey of Poulsbo. Also her in-laws Elaine and Duane Barnhart of Sequim, brother-in-law Dale of Southern California and four aunts: Margaret of Fair Oaks, California, and Dorothy, Johanna and Evelyn, all of Duluth, Minnesota.\nThe family would like to thank Janice's Vinland family, who provided transportation for the children, never-ending meals, prayers and support of all kinds, and her many friends, including her Night Angels. Thanks to Group Health Hospice for providing exceptional care, and thanks to the radiation/oncology lab in Bremerton for their phenomenal diligence and consideration. She was truly blessed.\nThe memorial service is June 28th , 4:00pm at Vinland Lutheran Church. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to Girl Scouts Totem Council or Olympic Lutherhaven in care of Vinland Lutheran Church, 2750 NW Finn Hill Rd, Poulsbo WA 98370. ",

How about\n getting your oncologist to write a letter to them and get this presented to an advisory board or an advocacy board. This is ridiculous. So far no one else has replied to my question above about\n having to pay a co pay. We need to find a consensus of opinion here. \nHair loss will be frightening and devastating at first possibly, but it seems that those who experience it feel better with it in time. I did not do chemo but my daughter did and from a mother's view it was very difficult for me to see her for the first few times. Not because she looked terrible but because I was hurting for her having to deal with hair loss. So I understand how you are concerned about\n telling your mother. My daughter's diagnosis was much harder on me than my own. That is when I found the internet system of support. It was a real Godsend to me. \nI, too, hated the word cancer and when I was diagnosed all I wanted was to be rid of it. So anxious to be rid of it I told the surgeon to do the mastectomy immediately if he found cancer. Hindsight tells me I would have been better off doing a lumpectomy because my cancer was not anywhere near advanced nor aggressive. I got into trouble with further surgeries for reconstruction which I would not have needed had I had a lumpectomy. But hindsight is always better. And my problems were rare and had nothing to do with cancer. No one else has experienced them. Now I am not so afraid of the word cancer. We have some women here who have survived for 20 years. I have known others who survived a lot longer. My grand daughter's other grandmother has been a survivor for over 40 years. So breast cancer is not always terminal by any means.\nHugs MK\nHugs MK\n ",

Most places in TX call themselves ranches but we saw signs saying FARM. We saw Longhorns, Limousins, Herefords, Brown Swiss.............round bales and rectangular bales. But we got the most gorgeous blackberries I have ever seen in my life. They were as big a my thumb and so abundant on the bushes that it took no time at all for us to pick 30 quart. Well I did about\n 9 and quit because I was afraid of being in the sun too long. DH picked the rest and then we journeyed home a different route which was 20 miles longer. We save money by picking the berries ourselves but spent $25 in gasoline costs. LOL. We had a marvelous day and enjoyed the ride. \nLuci when I saw your title line I thought you were going to say could Jo-Ann and I meet you for lunch. Guess not in Amarillo. Hope you see longhorns before you leave. I am enjoying your travelogue immensely, too. Thank you so much.\nHugs MK\n ",

Next step is a 24 hour urinalysis and assuming it shows the same indication I will have to see a kidney specialist.  She keeps saying diabetes causes kidney damage, I know that but I find that so hard to believe since my numbers have not been up until lately. I am thinking those high powered antibiotics I took for a whole year five years ago and a couple of times since for the abdominal wall infection is more likely the culprit if there is kidney damage.\n \n \n \n \n ",

In fact the first doctor who told me I needed repair work told me it was best to have a hysterectomy when it was done because it would hold better. I am under the assumption that any surgeon who can do a hysterectomy can do bladder repair and simple rectal repair. If there is special work needed you may need a surgeon specialized in that field, but even so it should all be done in one operation. It is not uncommon for two surgeons to work together to do their specialties. Many reconstructions of breasts are done by a plastic surgeon after the regular breast surgeon does the mastectomy. Be sure and get answers from your doctor's office. I think his nurse should be able to help you with your questions. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Been there done that myself. You might remember after I was off work for two months with IV antibiotics because of my infection, I was called into the bosses office and it was suggested perhaps I would like to work part time and the woman who was helping me on a contract basis part time would take my job. I learned of a couple of meetings that were held where it was suggested that I had made mistakes in the way over time was calculated, which I had not. It was made to sound like my friend and co-worker had been working behind my back to take my job. (I learned later that was not true at all.) \nI was posting on the board just like you madder than a wet hen. I spent the weekend composing a letter which was quite long letting my boss know exactly how I felt about\n their suggestion and how hurt I was. On Monday morning I went in early and went directly to his office. I handed him the letter and told him I had put in writing what I was about\n to say because I did not want any confusion or misunderstanding as to detail and then I verbally told him just how angry I was and how I felt I had been kicked when I was down. \nA day or so later he called me into his office with the second in command and they told me they were sorry and I could do what I needed to get well and things would stay status quo. By that time I felt fluid filling up in the abdominal wall again, and I told them I would need to go back on IV antibiotics again and wouldn't be able to work. That was the last I worked except for going in a couple of hours to help at the end of the year and to do some special things. \nMy disability pay was a godsend and it lasted until February 2005. I will be ever thankful that I had the disability insurance because with SS disability it was just about\n as much as my paycheck and I didn't have to buy gas, clothes, lunches and I could stay home and play on my computer and talk to my breast friends. \nWhen God closes one door he \nopens another, I believe the saying goes. If you have disability insurance you probably will be better off than working part time anyhow. Just be sure to leave a lasting impression. Incidently, several months after I was gone my boss called me into his office when I was visiting my friends for lunch. He apologized to me and told me he had no idea how much I had done for the company all those years, and he was very sorry that he ever suggested what he did, and his eyes had tears in them so I knew he was not just blowing smoke. \nHope you get things resolved the way you want, but I agree with Jo-Ann you should not be trying to work. Quilting is enough work. LOL. \nBig hugs and lots of love, MK\n ",

If you would like you could send us your son's address in Iraq and we could send him some cards, letters and perhaps even a package of goodies.

Sometimes fathers are so jealous of their own kids that when the nest is empty things are much easier. And in some ways men mellow with age, too. I'll be looking forward to seeing pictures, too.

It was 90 degrees and a policeman was there and told him along with some other people how dogs don't sweat, etc. and told him he should not leave his dog in the car. After all that he went back into the restaurant and finished his meal just to prove the dog could make it. Fortunately the dog did make it.

I did not do chemo but my daughter did. She lost her hair just before the second treatment at a little less than three weeks. We live in TX and she tried wearing a wig but it was too hot. One day she pulled it off and left it in the hot car and fried it, no more wig. So with the hot summer we are having I wanted to warn you about\n that. She wore ball caps and went without mostly. It was very hard for me as a mother to see her go through hair loss altho I had also had a mastectomy and breast cancer. She was the first person I had seen up close after losing hair to chemo. Some say that is one of the hardest parts of breast cancer. Hang in here we will help all we can. Hugs Mary K (MK for short)\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, there is also Jean in Wa who is in your area. Watch for her posts and check in with her. \nAs to whether or not to have a mastectomy, here is my two cents worth. I am older, now 66, and in my generation cancer was always a real hush, hush threat. When I heard I most likely had breast cancer, I signed the papers for the surgeon to go ahead and do the mastectomy then and there. It turned out that my cancer was Stage 0-1 and there is no reason in this world that a lumpectomy would not have been sufficient. Because I had the mastectomy, tho, I did not have any chemo nor radiation, but I was 58 years old, too. My daughter was dx at 39 and because of the \nlocation and size of her lump the doctors felt she needed a mastectomy. She also had chemo because she was young, they said more as a preventative. We are both doing fine, nearly nine years for me and over six for her. So, my suggestion is you follow the doctor's advice with the lumpectomy and get the staging and information about\n the tumor first. You can always have a mastectomy if it is advisable.\nAt any rate, the decision is yours. Altho losing your hair sounds awful, and I am sure it is very difficult, the women I have met without hair look beautiful with a radiance. Did you happen to see Melissa Etheridge when she performed bald, how beautiful she looked?\nHugs, MK\n ",

Get a friend or someone to help you make some calls to them, but you sit nearby to say \"yes\" when they need you in person. I really think you need to find an oncologist you can relate to. I did not have further treatment and went to an oncologist twice just because I wanted to be sure I did not need chemo, etc. He was so rude and know it all that I was more upset than anything. He told me to come back in two years. When I went by the desk and the girls wanted to make my next appt and I told them it was two years away they were shocked. They said no one waits two years around here, so you know how that made me feel????? I never went back. Of course you need to find another doctor you can trust to hold you in his care.

It sounds like you are doing great. And I don't know much about\n WA state but it seems like there is a chance you could meet up with Gail and Jean when you are up to it. I have met Gail a couple of times and she is a really great lady. Take care and rest and heal. I think but don't know from experience that usually chemo is done before radiation. It seems that is how most of our breast friends treatment seems to go. Hugs, MK\n ",

I would head in that direction, I think. My other thought is that it takes years for a lump to form, but then you mentioned lobular and how it mirrors in the other breast, that is also true. So I am really at a loss. I think I would have no problem having a bilateral and leaving it go. No reconstruction, no bras and all that, but then I am an old woman now. LOL. So I am going to suggest that you really delve into the information you can find, go to a specialist doctor and get advice and then think long and hard about\n what you want to do. If the Onco test shows you had a low possibiltiy of recurrence and you have lobular, that seems to me to be contradictory so I would really want some good answers there. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers as you find out what the heck is going on. Like Laure said it could be caffeine, but gosh do you have to go through this every time you overdo caffeine if you did. Shaking my head in confusion. Hugs MK\n ",

My daughter had reconstruction at the time of surgery and had to wait a month to get it scheduled with both surgeons. All went well for her. Waiting one month doesn't ususally make that much difference. I was really worried that she was waiting so long but she assured me from all she researched it would not matter. She is six years out from surgery and has had no problems. She also had a tram flap. The diep flap is rather new and specialized surgery I am surprised you would only have to wait a month. Waiting is the hardest part but if that is what you want, I'd say go for it and don't worry. Hugs, Mary K. (MK)\n ",

Plans for moving and all the stuff you have going on makes your life very busy. I am concerned about\n poor little granddog, too. The older I get the more of a patsy I am to animals.

The test results that have already been done were sent to them and I understand that they were evaluated before an appointment was set, so maybe this is saying they are not concerned. \nAs for asking for an appointment if there is a cancellation, I am pleased with the name of the doctor I am going to see and asking for a cancelled appointment I may get one of the others. I want a doctor I can talk with who will understand what my body has been through the past eight years. Of course this guy may be an arrogant son of a gun, too, I don't know. LOL.

LOL I'll bet security was tight there. And the OK City momument, I hardly ever cry but just reading about\n it makes me want to sob. Yes, Barry, Americans did that to Americans. Some of the radical movement Americans which seem to be around us everywhere wanting to tell us how to live and how to think feel they have the right to blow up others to prove their point. Much of that was a result of the fervor of Waco and I live smack dab in the middle of the road leading from one to another. Quite frankly it scares me to death. OK I won't get on my soapbox this morning. On to Elvis and Memphis. I have tried four times to get to Graceland. Timing has been off every stinking time. Wrong day or too late in the day. My one sil just moved 15 minutes out of Memphis, so perhaps I can go visit her and finally get there. I hope so anyhow. Have a safe trip today and tomorrow. Hugs MK\n ",

She coughed so much and so hard it hurt me to hear her coughing. I told her so but she kept saying she was going to die anyway.................you know that old story. The carotid artery was what made her get serious. You know the coughing stopped. I was also a smoker, altho I was more of a closet smoker and half a pack a day was about\n it. When I was diagnosed and had my mastectomy I decided that I would no longer smoke and inhale carcinogens into my lungs and from there into my bloodstream. So I quit. I have never bought another pack of cigarettes. I did have a couple of cigarettes I asked others for just to see what it was like. They just did not tempt me to continue, they tasted bad, smelled horrible. Every once in awhile I still think I would like to try one more, but I will not buy them because at today's prices after I wasted that much money I know I would have to smoke them. The cost alone should make you think twice about\n smoking, and you spend that much for something you know is harmful to your body?????? Really and truly think this through and convince yourself what you are doing is crazy. Like dieting you have to convince yourself first. Now return the favor and tell me to stop eating, it is my biggest problem today. LOL. Love and hugs that you will find the strength to quit soon, MK\n ",

My daughter had two young ones when she went through chemo, too, and I don't know how she managed so well. Hope Judy is lurking and knows we are here for her if she needs us. Meanwhile I think most everyone keeps all of the board in their prayers, so she is covered there, too. \nSounds like you have a very special wedding coming up, I know you will be so proud of both your sons and of course your new daughters, too. Grandkids? You know my grandson and his wife had a baby girl in March? So I am a great grandma. I am going to see them this next weekend before they move to Ft Meyers, FL where he has accepted a job as Youth Pastor.\nI am sorry you lost your dad. I know you were close and how difficult it is to lose someone you love.\nMy mother is really giving us fits. She turned 92 this month. She was lost driving around in her car for an entire day and laughed about\n it, saying she is fine..... right! She flew down here to my grand daughter's wedding with my brother and sil and ten days later apologized to bride on the phone for having missed her wedding. She lives alone in an apartment 50 miles from any family member and won't consider moving. The apt mgmnt passed out leases for the new year and she signed hers and returned it as quickly as she could so my brother and I couldn't stop her. She argued with me on the phone how well she is because she won her bridge game that day, saying her mind is just fine and that proves it. I am so angry with her right now I wake up in the middle of the night worrying about\n her and wondering what to do. The above stories are just a couple things she has done recently to make us worry about\n her living alone. She thinks her friends will watch over her, but truth be known those friends are in worse physical shape than she is. Her body is fine, but her mind is going downhill and she will not admit it. She calls me her sister's name sometimes and my daughter is sometimes my dad's sister. Whew............. what to do, what to do?\nI had to put down my Heidi due to congestive heart failure. I have two dogs left and both of them are hurting with hip arthritis. Boy are they different since the Alpha dog is gone. I envy your new puppy in some ways, altho going through puppyhood is very difficult. I don't know what I will do when these two dogs are gone. They are both old so it won't be far off.\nHugs and love, MK\n ",

LOL. Yes, it does take a long time for everything to heal. It has been eight years since my mastectomy and reconstruction and I still have crazy aches, itches and zizzles deep inside. It has been five years since my last abdominal surgery after the infection and sometimes, like tonight, I get these terrible itches deep deep in the tissues that can't be scratched or stopped. Sometimes I feel like it will drive me crazy. And yet I am so lucky compared to so many who have had all kinds of treatment and medications that cause problem aches and pains.

Ellen told me what it is, too, and that was also helpful. I'm not really worrying but a lot of things are adding up a lot better now that I know the test results. My \"hips\" have been hurting something awful lately and I assumed it was probably arthritis setting in. Now I am realizing that perhaps it was not really the hips at all but the kidneys aching???? I meant to tell the dr yesterday about\n how hard my belly had been lately and she blew me away with that test result, making me forget....... Anyhow I think I may be collecting fluid there, too, and as I read about\n all this stuff abdominal fluids can be a problem. You are right, Candy all we can do is track the BS and the BP and I am really being careful and doing a good job for the next week or so to have a good pattern. It will take about\n ten days to two weeks to get the medication changes because I had to mail the Rx to the ins drug supplier and then have them ship me the meds. She also raised my Glucotrol XL to double, so that will be another change. Meanwhile I am going to take it easy and rest all I can. Good excuse to be lazy, right? I do appreciate the input and help.

Even though my breast cancer was of the early stage low category, I, too, think of cancer each time I get a pain. Now testing blood sugar every once in awhile when it is up for no special reason I think of pancreatic cancer. I had a very good friend who fought it four years before losing to it and the first clues she had was blood sugar, altho at the time the doctors diagnosed diabetes. Then I rationalize and tell myself my aunt who also had it was never diagnosed with high blood sugar. See? We all let our minds run amuck.

      "Content": " Hi Toni, I am a little behind on catching up with posts. I just read your post from the other day for the first time. I am glad you have a doctor's appointment next week. I hope the doctor is one that is knowledgeable about\n breast cancer or one that will admit he does not know everything and send you where you might need to go to be sure of what is happening. Could you have shingles? When I read the other post, I thought maybe that could be the case. I have had them a couple of times, they break out easily when for some reason you have a compromised immune system. I have gotten them after being around kids with Chicken Pox. There is an antiviral drug to calm them down if you take it fast enough and I saw on the news the other day they are working on a vaccine for shingles much like the chicken pox vaccine only stronger and for adults rather than children. Please be sure to let us know what you find out. We care and like to hear good news, too!!!! I hope that is what you get. Hugs MK\n ",

She is the baby of the other one I have, both are blacks. We did raise this one from puppyhood but then her Mama was there to help. Her Mama we got when she was 1 1/2 and Heidi I got when she was 4 months old. Yesterday someone pulled into my driveway with a cocker spaniel that they found running down the road. It was nearly 100 degrees and he was so hot. Anyhow we made several calls, she drove around knocking on doors and finally found a man who thought he knew where the dog belonged and took him to keep him safe until he could find the owners. Yes, it was Boxers my neighbor had, he moved several years ago now and I still miss the dogs. \nMy mother is a trip. Neither my brother nor I have heard from her in almost a week. We figure we need to let her stew in her apartment alone awhile. She has never been a sweet loving mother like some people have. Remember my brother is a minister and a saint in so many ways, but she stretches him to the limit also. Enuf said on that one. LOL.\nBig hugs, MK\n ",

I would like to send you a hug just for being such a good mom with a difficult situation. \nAs for your lump. There is no one specific statement that can be made about\n a lump as to whether or not it is a cyst, benign, or malignant. The only way to tell for sure is to have a biopsy. Everyone's experiences are different. Since you just found it, waiting for your own doctor is not going to make a great difference. Even if you have breast cancer a month or two in making decisions is not going to make it any worse. You need time to learn and make choices if you need to do that. \nMy favorite saying is \"Don't worry until you know you have something to worry about\n\". In other words, do what you need to do to find out what it is before you get your nerves all tied in knots. Even if it is a cancer, it could be treated and you could be fine. The key is to move forward to solve the problems if there are any. Most of us had no family history. We have many women in their early 30s and even late 20s come to the forum.\nKnow we are here to help you and give you support. Keep us updated. \nHugs Mary K. (MK)\n ",

My daughter had the mastectomy and chemo and then after a few rechecks she didn't go back to the onc for two years or even had a mammogram. I kept telling her she needed to go.

      "Content": " I like hearing good positive news about drugs and treatments, thanks for sharing. WARNING I am about to get on the soap box....\nI certainly hope some progress is being made towards finding the cure and more importantly the real cause of cancer. BUT will anyone listen when they do? How many are still fighting that nicotine addiction? I admit that I didn't listen to the \"Smoking may cause cancer\" warning before my diagnosis, either. And as far as food choices go, I am not doing well in that department, either. However, my diet is not that far from my grandparents except they had home grown garden vegetables instead of produce counter variety. And they did not eat the amount of meat we eat today, servings were much smaller, families were larger and a pound of hamburger went a long way. Cancer was not such a big deal then, so that is my rationalization, it can't be food. But yes it can. LOL I have my head in the sand again.\nAND are any of you as tired as I am of reading about well known people who have been diagnosed with cancer and within months and some treatment they announce that they are cured, the cancer is gone? Like it is really and truly gone? After sharing information with so many women here who have breast cancer over so many years, we know that it is impossible to know if the cancer is gone so quickly. When I read or hear these stories it makes me feel like the public is being led astray as we are on so many things in the news these days. I want to write a letter to the editor or email the TV station .... I have become so cynical about anything in the news anymore. Pardon me, let me tell you about a friend of mine who was cancer free for ten years suddenly had it show up again, no one had seen it over those ten years of NED but it was lurking and then it was back everywhere. It was about this time two or three years ago that I lost that dear friend who went through the bone marrow transplant, bilateral mastectomies, radiation, you name it. \nI guess I am going through an angry spell right now and it is probably best I just try and sit on my hands. I want all my friends here cured so that NED means just what it is supposed to mean. I pray that all who are going through bad times right now get better soon and enjoy life without worrying about that next treatment or the next PET scan or blood test. \nLove you all, MK\n ",

The only time I would believe a doctor guessing was if I was told they were \"highly suspicious of cancer\". That seems to be the terminology many use. That was what the radiologist told me and showed me on my films. I knew when he said that I had breast cancer and really didn't need a second opinion. His wife had breast cancer, too, I learned later. \nWe don't have anyone in Oregon right now, but we do have three ladies in Washington State. Postal (Gail) has been with us awhile and posts often. She lives in Kennewick. She sometimes goes to Seattle to see doctors, tho.\nKeep searching for help. We are cheering you on. \nHugs MK\n ",

Are you anywhere near a breast cancer center where you might get a second opinion? You can take your films there and let them just do a second reading. Having a family history makes me a little more uncomfortable. He knew you had the history, right? What kind of surgeon is he? Just a general surgeon? Or does he have a specialty? How about your regular family doctor or primary care doctor? How do they feel? Don't just take this answer as final, look into it a little more for your own peace of mind. Husbands can feel more confident because they don't want you to have to go through anything. They tend to believe a little more quickly. I think I would send out more feelers. Hugs MK\n ",

When we were coming home from Cincy and I was being pushed in the wheelchair where you are prisoner to the pusher..... we went by a shop that said Cincinnati Stuff or something like that. All I could see were pink pigs everywhere. That is the symbol of the city and I saw some with wings and wanted to badly to go in there and check it all out. But alas, I not only had the wheelchair pusher behind me but DH beside me who never stops to look when he has a goal in mind. And believe me his goal in mind was to get on that plane and get back home. He worried all weekend about\n the airport and plane being a crowded mess and the traffic terrible because it was Memorial Day. I kept telling him to relax Memorial Day is not a heavily traveled holiday, but would he listen? Not. When we finally got on our way home, he kept saying over and over how amazed he was there was no crowd. If he would just learn to trust what I have to say once in awhile. LOL. Have a great Sunday.

I ended up with a seroma and had to go back for more surgery--and then new drains. It was two months before I could go back to work because of the drains and all the mess. So let them do their work. The more active you are the more they seem to flow. Maybe you need to rest more? I could bathe but we covered up the drains area with plastic bags. I don't understand the pain if there is no pull on them. They are a pain in the butt but mine did not hurt. Isn't it less than 24cc per drain before you have them removed? If you are at 30 you are getting close. Hang in there. Hugs, MK\n ",

That was a couple years even before I needed them His mother was diabetic so he thought he might need to check. When he found out he had to prick his finger, he forgot about it. LOL. If you can find a deal like that, check Walgreen, CVS and other Sunday supplements, buy one and keep testing yourself for awhile. The directions are all there and it is not hard to do.

I pushed to have hysterectomy because I needed repair work and a dr told me in my 20s that I needed repair but without having the uterus removed it would not hold up. So when I was having problems anyhow due to premenopause I suggested the repair and removal. The dr was not really all that excited about doing it, but my uterus was enlarged some and I was positive so he agreed. After the path report came back he told me I had precancerous cells and he was really glad I had convinced him to do the surgery.

      "Content": " I do know Aetna is one of the most difficult insurance companies to deal with, but if you fight and hang in there you will succeed. I had a friend several years ago who was Dx with pancreatic cancer. As most people know pancreatic cancer is never curable, but she wanted to live as long as she could. She found a doctor willing to work with drug companies to prescribe experimental type drugs. Aetna fought for a good while and Joan went to the media. Believe it or not 20/20 came to TX and did a story on her and she was written up in the New York Times. Well, 20/20 never ran the story on TV, because after the NY paper article Aetna was willing to do whatever she wanted. Joan lived four years and most of the time she lived a liveable quality life. She wanted to see her daughter graduate from high school and the older one graduate from college. She got her wish. Even knowing that she could not possibly be cured she got Aetna to agree to what she needed. So don't give up, keep after them until you get the tests you need and the doctors are satisfied. Keep us posted. Hugs, MK\n ",

My daughter was diagnosed two years later and was given four chemo treatments \"due to her age\" and her tumor was fairly large, altho everything else looked good pathologically. We are both doing fine today. Some of our women on this board have very aggressive cancer types and are fighting a great battle against mets.

Then he will be on afternoons again. Looking forward to your visit. Hugs MK\n ",

Jo-Ann was a real chain smoker and she quit four years and a couple of weeks ago. She chewed Nicorette until she couldn't stand it anymore and then went to regular gum. But she did it and if she did it anyone can, believe me. We will cheer you on. I had my last cigarette before my mastectomy and then told myself I was not going to push my luck with any more cancer sticks, but I was not a habitual smoker so I managed pretty easily.\nDon't dwell on the most negative aspect of breast cancer. Yes, many have lost their lives, but many, many more have not and quite a few put in a good many decent years before losing the battle. I had a friend who had 23 of 25 nodes positive. She lived a darn good twelve years after her first year or two of treatment. \nShare with us your path reports, etc. I am sure some help in understanding them will be ready for you.\nHugs and prayers that all goes smoothly,\nMary K.\n ",

Have your husband try that on the area you feel is swollen. Over ribs it might not be so sloshy, tho. But if it is swelling you need to have it checked. It could also be a little infection if it is red and warm???? Another thought I had was that maybe you are favoring one side or the other and it is causing a tension feeling???

The company he worked for in OH went bust when we moved to TX and part of his retirement (from there) is under the Pension Guarantee Trust that they are allowing United Airlines to default to. It stinks, what little bit he gets from there is so much smaller than what I get from the school system, yet he made four times what I made or more back then. So no matter what you can't trust pension plans all that much. I got all my dental work done before I left wor, almost. I expected to work a couple more years, but fortunately 3/4 of it was done while I had good insurance and could use tax free cafeteria plan money. I finished up the last quarter so now all I should need is cleaning and any minor problem repair. So you are right to be getting stuff done now. I have known really old people have successful cataract surgery. Even tho it seems scary they say it is not that bad. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " WEll, Luci the same thing happened to me two years ago. In my annual blood test my glucose average number was up. I had never even heard of this test before. My PC dr told me to start testing my blood sugar. At first my morning numbers were all around 99 and I kept denying there was any problem. She sent me for a heart test, an eye exam and had me come back in three months several times. After a whole year of denial, my numbers were going up, so I attended a diabetics class where I learned a lot about that averaging test and diabetics. No, I did not have chemo. But if you watch the news there is more and more mention of diabetes. I think it is becoming as prevalent as cancer. Could environment also cause problems? Losing weight and strict diet control can handle it at first. I really did neither, but I do test my blood every morning, she wants me to do it four times a day, but I always forget until it is not the right time. But I can tell you, she was right, my numbers are up higher and now I am also taking medication, only one pill a day. Nothing like what some of the girls here deal with. I think you will find many are diabetic. And yes I waited a long time for the call from the doctor's office each time, too. Those reports do come back and sit on their desks as Frayda suggests. The averaging test is done every three months because the sugar cells in the blood live that long, so being careful of sugar consumption for a week or two won't change the test. Also I learned that STRESS causes the blood sugar to elevate as much as food for me. My worst numbers were after having my mother here for ten days. So don't stress out about it. Hugs, MK\n ",

      "Content": " Your test results sound wonderful!! Only a seven out of 100!!! Yippee for sure. The bilateral should really put you in good standing. I meant to react to your post about the outpatient surgery for a bilateral, but I think my phone rang or something and I had to get off line. Please do not fight the hospital stay. Bilateral or even single mastectomy is serious surgery. There are many veins and arteries involved as well as muscle and other tissue. These need to be watched for bleeding and you need to have your vital signs watched. I mention this in particular because when my daughter had her mastectomy a nurse changed her dressing and had her bend forward which broke open a bleeder. Luckily her surgeon came to see her shortly after that happened and realized she was going into shock. The surgeon stayed with her and held her hand while the OR was set up for them to go back and fix that bleeder. If she had been home and bent over?????? Well, who knows what might have happened. I think it is really wrong that they release people so soon after surgery. You have to keep running back and forth to the doctor's office to be checked and that is hard on you. Unless you have good, qualified nursing care at home, I hope you will stay as long as you can in the hospital. I know you have a \"thing\" about doing that, but believe me you need to take care of yourself and rest to heal, not run home where you know as well as I do that you will do more than you should.

I agree with Sara that maybe next fall would be better. By then hopefully Cathi will be feeling better, too. It looks like we will be going to Cincy for only the Memorial Day weekend and my DH will be going with me. My grandson is graduating from HSand there will be an Open House for him on Sunday. The grandson and his wife who just had baby Reilly have accepted a call from Fort Meyers, FL where he will be a Youth Pastor at the First Christian Church. His mother and dad are really not excited about them moving away and that will be the last weekend before the move, so we need to be there to see them. My DH hates to be away from home, so the long weekend will be it. Later in the summer, I guess I will have to head to the other end of OH and see my mother and brother. \nDon't feel like you have let anyone down. The enthusiasm has to be there with everyone and I think the wind left our sails for a bit. Last year when we planned Louisville, we had it pretty much all planned and set up two months ahead of time and everyone was enthused to go to see Becky knowing she was very ill.\nWhen we all get thinking about a meeting, I am sure you can help us lots. Can't wait to meet you. \nLove MK\n ",

I had a tram flap done only because I did not want to feel lopsided. Somehow I hit some key that erased it all, so I guess that is just as well. My story is not the norm and no sense scaring anyone. The breast cancer was not the problem, nor was the new breast. Let's just say, make your decision and feel good about it. It is easier to match two reconstructions if you want to have that done. Without reconstruction a bilateral will not leave you feeling lopsided. Big hugs making your decision. MK\n ",

The recent voyage of the Norwegian ship that ran into the tidal wave off the Carolina's would be a good example of needing insurance, altho they did refund half the fare and offered another cruise for another half fare. If I had been on board, they probably would never get me back on a ship again, tho. LOL. I hope you have a wonderful trip and don't need to cash in on any insurance policy at all. Please come back and let us know. Mary K.\n ",

She was so beautiful, such a lady, quiet and sweet, dignified and mannerly. I knew she was a very special person right away. I know you all are very proud of her, proud of her beauty and her life before breast cancer. You must be especially awed and proud of the way she lived her last six years fighting this terrible disease with such dignity and grace. Just a year ago when we were all in Louisville, she proudly brought you children to meet us, and we were happy to get to meet you and your dear aunt, who was such a great help to your mommy. She napped during the day as much as she could so she would have energy enough to be with us as we shared your lovely city. We appreciated her efforts for us and loved her all the more because she was so willing to be there with us. \nI hate that you will have to live with memories, but I am happy to know that many of those memories are good ones. I know you had some great vacations together and spent many wonderful hours together. I hope in your thoughts during the next years you will realize what an impact your mother had on so many people she met. She was beautiful inside and out, no one can begin to compare with her. She called herself Mighty Beck here on our forum and she truly was Mighty in every way.\nI send my love and my sympathy,\nMary K.\n ",

In mine I have seen only spots here and there of microcalcifications. Clustering microcalcification is what is watched for along with other signs of lumps, lesions, tumors, whatever the doctor calls them.

Stella is here until next Thursday and if we are not out running our legs off, we are home panting and resting from going. We just got back from a round trip of 140 miles to see her nephew over in Dallas, and here we are dead tired making pies because it sounded good. Anyone want a piece? They are fresh out of the oven. We were treated to some good Italian lasagne made by her neice in law but on the way home we thought some pie would finish off dinner nicely. Are we bad??????????????? Hugs, MK\n ",

I did not have heart problems and still don't. However, I have since been diagnosed with diabetes. Many of us here do have diabetes. Many of us are not so thin. What I am trying to say is that we understand multiple health problems. Heart problems can be tricky. Chemo is sometimes hard on the heart, I would think surgery would be best if your heart will allow surgery. I think radiation can also be a problem especially if on the left side. Goodness, you didn't need all this, did you? We are here to help with questions and say a prayer or hold your hand in cyberspace. Sometimes just knowing someone understands and cares helps a lot. Where are you located? It is possible someone could be near you. I live in TX now, but was from OH and WV area.

Don't know if the Practioner is a female or not, many are, but I doubt if it were her mammogram and report she would ignore it and be so lackidaisical. It is rather comforting that a second opinion still thinks things \"could\" be ok. Gees, at a Breast Center you would think they would help you a little more than telling you to ask for an ultrasound. I would also send the bill to my insurance company and complain that my primary physican was not responding and you were so concerned you paid for a second opinion yourself. Document, document, document. Because if in a chance you are diagnosed with breast cancer later, you have proof that you were treated with a lack of concern. Also get a copy of the report from the doctor you paid, written report. You paid for it, you should have it in writing. Hugs and prayers they are correct. MK\n ",

LOL I live near Fort Worth TX now but am originally from the OH-WV area. My husband was in the Navy and we moved around a lot in the 60s. Are you close to Calera AL? I bought some angels from a guy there on eBay and told him about the breast cancer board here, so he sent me some more to share. He seems like a very nice man, saying he supports breast cancer causes because of his wife, daughter and grand daughters. Every now and then he sends me something. All from a little eBay purchase. LOL. \nLet us know what is going on soon as you know and we will be there with the PCE.\nHugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Wow Susan you have had a rough experience. It is rare that a doctor says anything bad about another doctor. This in itself tells me this is not anyone you need to ever see again. I would check around and see if you can get any names of other oncs from women who have had breast cancer. Did you have a Reach for Recovery rep call on you? I would start with her if so. Ask about some support groups around and even if you don't want to actively go to them you might find some women who would share their onc's name. BUT I would definitely find an oncologist that you feel you can talk to and trust. Lobular is a different kind of breast cancer. As I understand it, it mirrors in the other breast and quite often a bilateral mastectomy is advised. Your pathology showed something or you wouldn't have been diagnosed with lobular. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO HAVE A COPY OF YOUR PATHOLOGY REPORT. If nothing else, get that copy and share it with us. I am not knowledgeable about the pathology business but there are lots of women here who have experience and know their pathology who can help you. Please don't just stop with this, if your gut tells you, listen to it. Hugs MK\n ",

The frightening part is that she was very unconcerned about it all, laughing and saying she was fine and not frightened at all. Her birthday is May8, Mother's Day, there is talk about my kids in Cincy flying me up there and all of us going for a party to celebrate her 92nd..... Then there is this nagging little thing about the diagnostic mammo and what might be needed following that. So I just can't plan or be sure of anything.

Yes, it is hard to leave them when they are so little and sweet, but later on one of the perks of being a grandma is that you can spoil them and let the parents deal with the bad behavior. LOL. My friend, Stella, and I took my two grandchildren yesterday on a trip for Stella to see some of the Texas local history, dinosaur tracks and then we drove through a Wildlife Park where animals come to your car to be fed, etc. We had a great day but were dragging last night and even yet today. We are sitting and reading or knitting all day today. Rest day only.\nNow, about that mammogram. I am thrilled you came out so well on that score. Wonder what made the mark on the film in the first place? My spot was visable I could see it, but it was not really different from last year's films.

Immediate reconstruction takes a little more time to schedule because you have to have the surgeon and the plastic surgeon both available, unless the plastic surgeon will also do the mastectomy. It seems to me I have heard that radiation can make the skin less amenable to reconstruction. I guess I should read your other post about the diep flap before asking if you found a plastic surgeon or not. This type of reconstruction takes a very specialized plastic surgeon. Not all are trained to do this intricate surgery, I understand. WE had a young woman discuss this surgery recently and I believe she posts the website for her surgeon with information. You might do a search in the search box above and find those posts if they are still available and I think they probably are. Mary K.\n ",

Well, I can say that although I hate to share this kind of thing, I couldn't share with anyone any nicer. And you have a baby coming, too? Our great grand baby was born early and has some problems. The past couple of weeks have been kind of rough, but at least the wedding went beautifully, thank heavens. My grand daughter has been Mrs. Fox for a whole week now. I will keep you in my prayers, Kitty, that your news is not bad. \nAnd Debbi it was not the reconstructed breast, it was the other one. I had a benign lump removed from this breast back in 1967 and nothing since. The color of the skin has changed some and the doctor even asked me about it during my physical, so I am wondering what that might have to do with seeing something on the films???? Oh well, time will tell.\nMy very best friend from Ohio is coming on the 7th for two weeks. Plans were made several months ago...... if I have to have surgery again, maybe there is a reason she is going to be here? Now that sounds like I am really worrying, I am not, but I am thinking it will be nice if she is here to laugh and joke with me. \nHugs to you all, MK\n ",

WE have all different ages, shapes, philosphies, but we all love each other and get along great and have so much fun at our get togethers. Sadly we have lost many of our sisters over the six years I have been here, but it has made us closer for the most part. Notice the post about Cherilyn. I haven't read it yet, but she was a great friend, too. I am looking forward to meeting you soon myself. Sorry your daughter got a little bored, but she'll know you are safe with us. LOL. And Mia, I got my socks today. I love them. They are so comfy looking. Can I wear them to the wedding? LOL Thanks so much. You are super. Love MK\n ",

      "Content": " I had a busy weekend and am late weighing in here, but my daughter had a needle biopsy. The mammo showed that the tumor was likely to be cancer and the needle biopsy confirmed it, which gave her time to set up surgery for her mastectomy and reconstruction to be done at same time. She had to have mastectomy because of location of lump. Sometimes more than one sample is taken to be more sure of getting the right area. My one concern is that is the needle test is showing benign, did they get the right area? If it is positive it does give you time to prepare for surgery. I had a biopsy and frozen section which definitely diagnosed cancer and the mastectomy was done immediately. I didn't know until I woke up. But I really expected that it was cancer from what the radiologist told me and then the surgeon also was pretty certain from the films. Hugs all will go well. Let us know, we care and will hope for a B-9 diagnosis for you. MK\n ",

Since I am so old my mind is going and I can't remember the talk show, oh hang in there it is coming, Phil Donohue was in Cleveland back then. I watched him occasionally. But that was probably before you were born Annette. Mia was a mere child. LOL. around 1962??? We lived there less than a year then, in my husband's aunt's home which she had divided into two apartments. He was in the Navy and we were not able to be with him, so we stayed there until he had orders to Great Lakes Naval Base and we moved to Kenosha, WI. From there we went to VA, WA, SC then back to WV and finally back to OH. All this happened between 62 and 67. Ah military life was fun. \nI am not so familiar with Stark Co.

Secondly, you did the correct thing to tell your siblings to start handling your Mom. They are in denial to protect themselves, not you or your mom. I have mother issues, too, and when I talked to my doctor about how much she upset me, the dr told me to never have her visit me again. So when she talked about coming here, I went there and it was much easier because there were other relatives around. LOL You have to handle things as well as you can and keep her from bothering you. Stress is hard to handle when you are well but going through treatment it is impossible and not necessary. Stand your ground with the VIPs. If you need more cheering on, just say the word and we will do the Rah! Rah! you can do it. Hugs and prayers, MK\n ",

      "Content": " As I understand lobular breast cancer, it is different in that it tends to mirror in the other breast. This was not my diagnosis, but a very dear friend of mine was diagnosed with it about 14 years ago. She had 23 of 25 nodes positive, so her prognosis from the start was not real great. However, she had a bone marrow transplant and a bilateral mastectomy. She did well for about ten years and somehow talked her doctors into allowing her to have some estrogen to lessen her terrific temperature swings. Sadly after taking the estrogen for a couple of years she had a recurrence that was very aggressive. Your tumor is not large and stage I is good. I will be interested to learn what your test shows. My daughter was diagnosed and had early stage six years ago. Her oncologist told her because of her age (39) he was strongly recommending four chemo treatments. She is showing no signs of cancer now and is certainly living a busy life, she has horses, cattle, works outside the home and has two kids at home. On the go all the time. \nBy sharing new treatments and information, we all learn lots here. When I was diagnosed eight years ago I was totally in the dark and followed doctors suggestions for the most part. We know now through our friends here to learn all you can and question the doctors when you feel you need to. Some doctors make statements like, \"you are too young to have breast cancer\", which we all know now to be totally false and very misleading. So ask any questions you have we will try, even if we don't know the very latest in technology we will learn from others like you. If you noticed there are now two of our group that will be on a brand new drug. \nHugs of welcome, Mary K. (MK)\n ",

She was willing to try anything to prolong her life as she had two daughters she wanted to see graduate from college and high school. She had an excellent doctor who was willing to go the extra mile and contact every experiemental treatment and learn about it. Aetna bulked at everything, so they got the media involved. 20/20 came and did a story about her which was never aired, because Aetna suddenly decided she could have what she needed. She was written up in a New York City paper, can't remember now which one, but Aetna was not given good press. The outcome of the story was she lived four years and until the final six months she was doing pretty well as far as quality of life. Pancreatic cancer is usually a few month prognosis because it is so difficult to diagnose. So, Lauren, fight Aetna they will change their mind. How old are you? Sometimes the older we are and I was 58 at diagnosis, the less likely we are to have recurrence or aggressive cancer. My daughter was told she needed chemo because of her age, 39, while I was told I did not. Our pathologies were very similar except her tumor was a little larger than mine. Both of us are doing just fine, she is six years out and I am eight years out. Keep us informed. Please. Hugs MK\n ",

When he could get no fluid, I was sent for other tests and a biopsy. This was before the good mammo machines we have today. I have a lady that comes to help me and she was telling me just yesterday about having a recent mammogram and that she has three cysts. She said she has never had a mammogram that they have not called her back because of cysts. She had also gotten a sonogram and was told it was definitely cysts. I asked her how they could be sure if they didn't aspirate and she said the first time the doctor had drawn off two syringes full of fluid so knowing her history they feel that is what it is. I was shocked because that is a good bit of fluid. We talked about it all and I suggested she might see a breast specialist, but the problem is she does not have insurance. She is self employed. She seemed a bit concerned but she said they could see the fluid in the sonograms. So I am also wondering about her cyst problem. I don't know if cysts are common to those who have breast cancer or not. Let's see what the others say. Yes, everyone seems to say caffein does affect the breasts and cysts. Low fat diets are also supposedly good for avoiding breast cancer. But I am not the one to ask if I follow them. LOL Hope someone has some info for you. Hugs Mary K. (MK)\n ",

      "Content": " OHHHHH I get so angry at these doctors who tell you to wait and see. Especially with your family history. That was IMHO the stupidest call a doctor would make. I had two benign tumors before cancer was found and never was I told to wait 6 months. Why oh why do they do this? My daughter was also diagnosed at age 39, I was 58. My other daughter is being watched carefully. She has had one benign lump removed, her doctor wanted her to wait 6 mos, but that was about the time her sister was diagnosed, so we insisted on removal. Your nodule sounds small, so maybe chances are good that it will be benign, too. How about calcifications, were they mentioned in your mammogram? You know you should really get a copy of the report from your last mammograms from the time you were told to wait and watch. They are available and you are entitled to have them. Once my daughter was dx two years after I was, I called and got a copy of the last benign lump which was 12 years previous to the mastectomy. AND the spot where cancer was found was right in the same area as the benign lump. So stay on top of everything. Hang out here, ask questions, listen carefully to what is being said by doctors and question them all you want. You do not have to take their guesses as gospel. Believe me, they have been wrong many times, too many times. Good luck, God bless. Mary K. MK for short.\n ",

Those who have told you to wait until you have more tests done are correct. If you have a pathology report share it with us if you don't understand exactly what it says. You are entitled to a copy of any report done. AFTER my mastectomy I learned I had a very low grade cancer in all aspects and now I know I would probably have done just fine with a lumpectomy and radiation. I have no problem with having had the mastectomy at all, the reconstruction built a great new breast that feels very normal. I ended up with some other problems that wouldn't have happened if I had gone with the lumpectomy. As has been said, you can always have a mastectomy later if necessary.

I have not had the experience because I had a mastectomy and it was determined I did not need any more treatment. I will let those who had radiation address that question. My daughter had the mastectomy and reconstruction done all in one surgery. Usually it takes more time to set up because one surgeon does the mastectomy and a plastic surgeon does the reconstruction, so get to them both scheduled on one date takes some time. It is a full day in surgery, usually at least eight hours when they both are done. I had my reconstruction seven months later. My daughter and I both had the tram flap done with the tummy tuck. It is difficult surgery and healing takes a long time. Even though you have the tummy tuck it takes about a year or more for the midriff area to feel normal. But the end result is a normal feeling breast. Hugs, MK\n ",

Recently she was able to talk her doctor into trying a liver seeding which was an innovative treatment. I am sure she knew her time was limited but she never really told any of us how close. She always signed off with the years and months of her life since diagnosis which was near 15 years. When she was well enough she would post suggestions to everyone seeking treatment or having problems. She was truly our treasure. Her name, Contreasure was taken from where she lived, Treasure Island, FL. I called her last summer when the hurricane was bearing down on them and she told me they were trying to decide where to go, which direction, that is. As it turned out the hurricane by-passed their area and they were safe, just without electricity for awhile. Imagine a hurricane coming when you are feeling so ill.................... and she was so calm about it. Hugs MK\n ",

Frantically, I turned it off and on again and still the black screen.  So I shut it off, went about my kitchen chores, bathed and dressed and then came back calmly to tackle the problem.  I found my paperwork and learned the warranty was still in force.  The booklet said call Compaq, so I did.  I got Sam, only God knows where Sam is from, I couldn't even understand him when he asked my name.  Finally I got the hang of his accent and as we tried to communicate turned on my computer.  Lo and behold it looked normal???  But Sam assured me there was a problem that needed addressed.  We went through some troubleshooting steps and cleaned the temporary files, etc.  Then he had me go through some other stuff which shut off all the little programs that come on with start up like my telephone answering, the IM stuff and the weather bug.  At this point he suggested I get a spyware from Compaq and to clean temp files once a week and he was about to say goodbye when I reminded him my answering service was shut off.  He said, \"Oh did you want that?\"  Well, duh yes, I put it on there, I pay about $10 a month to use it.......  So he helped me reset the start up stuff and with that we said goodbye.  He transferred me to Compaq store to buy the software for Spy programs. Which I did to the tune of $40.  OK if it does the trick.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

The letter arrived just as I was to leave for a week's business trip, so I had to call back and schedule for two weeks ahead. I was so disgusted. If they had called the work number I could have gone the next day and had it all over a month earlier. Waiting is very hard. We all agree on that.

You are welcome to post there, too, if you care to. I am the oldest here, living in TX now but from OH and WV. My daughter was also diagnosed with breast cancer at age 39. I was diagnosed at 58 and have been clear for over eight years now. My cancer was not aggressive nor did I have any postive nodes. Where are you in treatment? Still making decisions or have you actually begun? We have several girls in their 30s some with children. We many different stages, some fighting Stage IVs who are the greatest women you will ever meet. Please feel welcome and feel free to ask questions. Where are you?

He has been her counselor, etc. Anyhow he said the daughter is living with her aunt and uncle. She lost custody of her through some of the rough times, but he said she is about to regain custody. He said he did not want to go into her details, but said she is a wonderful young woman who had a rough childhood and had lived through some rough circumstances. Since her husband was stabbed and died in her arms I am thinking........ well, I will let everyone have their own thoughts. But, yes, I feel she saved some lives which was her intent. She gave a statement last night asking that everyone give her some time to get over this ordeal. What a woman. We will probably hear much more about her. I hope her life turns around and she has some really good breaks. It sounds like she will be getting the reward for turning in this man, so possibly that will really help her. Hugs. MK\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Laure', sorry you needed to find us, but we are glad to have you here. It sounds like you have been through a tumultuous time lately. It all hits the fan at once, doesn't it? I will attempt to answer some of your questions and the others will chime in, I am sure. We have ladies in VA and NJ, in fact one in Bedford VA is a great friend of one in Morris Town NJ. So you are moving there? What a time to have to deal with breast problems. \nYes, they can tell from a mammogram and sonogram if it looks like cancer. Key words are spiculated (spider like) and clusters of micro calcifications. And 2.54 cm equals one inch, so that tells you your lump is less than half an inch in diameter. Which should be pretty early. \nMany have had the core biopsy done on this formum. My daughter had it done six years ago when the radiologist also told her it was highly suspicious for cancer. The biopsy told them indeed it was cancer and because of where the lump was and the size of it, she needed a mastectomy. Doing the core biopsy gave her time to get a surgeon and plastic surgeon lined up together so reconstruction could be done at the same time. She was 39 at the time, there was not any positive lymph nodes but her oncologist said she should go through chemo because of her age, to be sure. Six years later there is no further evidence of Disease (cancer), NED as we say. \nSome have been able to have a lumpectomy and chemo and radiation and been fine, also. I had only the mastectomy because I was 58 when diagnosed. We represent many forms of reconstruction, too, should that be necessary.\nAs to the question about metastasizing...... yes, if it is a very aggressive form of cancer, it can spread quickly. Even though lumps are small, we are told they are forming for about six to seven years before they can even be detected on the x-rays. But never assume the worst. In fact, I have a saying that is often quoted here, \"Don't worry until you know you have something to worry about!\" Now, that doesn't mean not to worry exactly but don't get all hyper until you know what you are dealing with, then take the appropriate action and still keep from worrying big time. Worrying does not help anything. LOL. But we all have been frightened of course. How can you not be? The unknown is frightening. There are many very strong ladies here who have been through far more than I have and their strength and attitude will amaze and help you, I am sure. \nHope this helps a little. Sorry you have so much on your plate right now, but we will help all we can. \nBig hugs, Mary K. (MK)\n ",

LOL Just teasing. Altho by the time you read this your biopsy will possibly be over. But to answer your thoughts about the girls on this board, yes, there are some fighting some major battles. Some like myself are fighting minor ones. We have some who are far out from their diagnosis doing very well, they can give you hope. Those that are really battling can show you the positive spirit and the great attitude needed to fight the fight. We have a great group here, we have lost many over the five years many of us have been together and it has been difficult when we lost them. The important message is to keep on watching and fighting and giving of yourself to help others. I hope and pray you get good news with your biopsy, the other problems you have are enough to have to deal with. And if the biopsy is positive, I hope it is the slowest growing, smallest bit of cancer there is and easily treated.

In May of 2000 I went to my grand daughter's graduation in Cincinnati area and suggested meeting the girls in that area for lunch. Women from all over the eastern US decided they wanted to come, too. We had about 20 there for our first get together. Then some who didn't come wanted to have another group meeting so they could meet everyone, so in October we held another group get together in St. Louis, MO. We had nearly 40 there. We have had many more group meetings, the last being held last May in Louisville, KY. If you look under my second post in the roll call you can see pictures. \nI think you can find help with many different situations, either by experience of those posting here or from their memory or knowledge of other's experiences. It is great having new women coming to post and share their stories and questions. We have learned even more from the two of you.\nHugs, Mary K.\n ",

I know I have some from MB of Ian but where are they? There is a great picture of Mel's smile from San Antonio, too. I wish I was organized and knew where to actually find them. I will try to locate them and send them as well as a note to both Ian and Kai.\nI want to tell you all once again how impressed I was with Kai and Ian when Jo-Ann and I went to OK that Saturday to see Mel. They both sat and talked to me very politely and made me feel so accepted and welcome in their life. Ian seemed so grown up compared to when I had seen him last in MB running wild. Kai told me about serving in the military and his plans for his future. How many young men would take time to sit and talk to an old woman who was their mother's friend and be so nice and kind?\nHugs MK\n ",

Months, even years later she will mention something and I was completely in the dark, usually about her grown kids which all live distances from here. Me, I get on the phone and tell her all about my kids and what is going on. She won't discuss her health issues, either. She had a really strange very high blood pressure experience when hers is usually really low. Her doctor told her to tell her siblings who had low pressure about it because they could experience the same. She told us, then every time I would ask her how she was doing, she would get very upset and say \"I am fine!!!.\" In other words don't ask me again.

She took her time and found a surgeon and a plastic surgeon who would work together to do her reconstruction after her mastectomy. My other daughter also found a lump and had it biopsied and it was benign. I hope yours is benign, too. We are here to help.

My little Heidi has congestive heart failure and the vet has been so compassionate about her. I was ready to give up and have her put down, but he said no her heart beat is still strong.

His whole family is upset that she came to TX and is marrying a Texan and not going back to them. Oh yes, it will be quite the fun reception.

Sometimes things happen to bring us together. Many of us have been around four or five years together, we have had meetings in various cities and gotten to know each other. Many of us have someone nearby who we see more often. I live near Fort Worth, TX and Jo-Ann lives north of Dallas, so we get together every few months. She comes here for a few days and we have a great time. She lost her husband just a few days after her second mastectomy, so we became close at that time. It does help to have someone to talk with face to face or on the phone or email as well as through this forum. We are trying to get chats started up again on Tuesday night. I think it will be 6 pm in Pacific time next week. Hope you can join us. Hugs and prayers, Mary K (MK)\n ",

As everyone has told you, only a biopsy will tell you for sure. A biopsy as you know is very easy surgery and won't take much time from the baby. There are several girls in MI here. Lori posts often, the others not quite so often, but I am sure she can help you lots with information. As I suggested above please check the roll call.

I have many friends who have kids with handicaps and there is nothing like a mother's love and intuition to keep them from harm. One friend of many years has a son now in his late 30s and she was told he would not live to age 10. The live in OH and I have been in TX for 23 years but we still talk on the phone and she tells me about him. I had two benign tumors removed long before I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And the cancer showed up in the area of the last benign lump. So things like that do happen. I hope all goes well for you, but definitely believe you need to follow your feelings and insist on getting care. Do not let any doctor try to guess what is wrong and minimize what you need. Go for a second opinion if you are not satisfied. It sounds like you are in an area with good care. Lori sure does well..... She is a cutie.

During Dec I was in my usual Christmas humbug slump, but my grandson did manage to retrieve my MB pictures from an old hard drive for me. Can I email them to you? I have some older ones from San Antonio but I have not found them. Digital pictures are great until you lose a computer with them on it. I have a CD somewhere that my son in law copied all my pictures to, but where he put it is the $64,000 question. And to top that off he did not write on it. I have gone over at least 20 CDs that are empty looking. LOL. Keep after us, I know you shouldn't need to do that, but procrastination is one of my worst traits anymore. Hugs MK\n ",

Or a bauble or jewel if that suits you better. \nLast year my husband bought a beautiful sentimental Valentine that cost a fortune for a card. It brought tears to my eyes with the message, so I put it on the dresser in the bedroom. Somehow it stayed there but got pushed behind pictures, etc. lying down. I saw it a while back and thought I would put it back out in front and tell him that I read it again and he didn't need to go buy another one this year. So last night he posted on his sailboat message board how he had come back from sea and met me on Valentine's Day eve 48 years ago. A very sweet Valentine message it is. \nIt is so funny, I have been involved with breast cancer boards for nearly six years now. My husband bought this old sailboat and it turns out to be somewhat of a classic so now he is posting on their board all about repairs and refurbishing, etc. My daughter originally found the message boards for me, telling me it was more my thing than hers. Now she has found a horse board where they talk about horses and she is posting there. So all of a sudden they are all involved in what they thought I was spending so much time doing. LOL.\nHugs for a great Valentine's Day,\nMK\n ",

      "Content": " I have learned that they only listen to half or a fourth of what you say. Probably when you said you would be out of town and something about the 17th, they geared their minds up to doing stuff after that time. Really does make you angry, I know, but it happens time after time. I saw my PS who does my disability ins paperwork on Oct 5th. He signed the papers, he gave them to the nurse while I was there and I stressed to her the importance of getting them in the mail because my check depended on them. A couple weeks later I got a 2nd reminder from the ins co but decided the papers could have crossed in the mail. Another month later I got a third reminder and then I called the drs office. Someone with the same incompetence quotient as your drs office, put the papers back on his desk and there they sat.................. All the years I worked I worried about little things like getting people's paperwork done properly knowing it was important to them, but today I don't think it ever crosses anyone's mind. They go to work, put in their time and go home. If you find someone who truly cares, give them a hug and thank them for being so caring. It will all work out. Hugs MK\n ",

It certainly has been crazy. As I mentioned elsewhere Brownsville on the most southern point of TX actually had snow which is unheard of. Corpus Christi on the Gulf of Mexico had a couple of inches which is also most strange and rare. What is going on? There are terrible storms on the west coast. I haven't talked to my family in WV but they all live up high. The kids in the KY Cincy area are up high also.

      "Content": " The calcium is probably better known as microcalcifications and yes cancer is possibily present, especially since she has already been diagnosed. The arrangement of clusters is usually the clue. When your mother had chemo and radiation what type of surgery did she have? If she had a biopsy are the calcifications in that same breast? The lump in the abdomen could be most anything. Her oncologist should be watching her closely if they deemed she had aggressive cancer. She should have had CT scans, possibly MRIs, and other tests to keep an eye on her entire body. Where are you? Are you near a good cancer center? I think maybe a second opinion from a specialist might be in order.

A representative of the ACS who was also my friend told me and brought me a little bag full of goodies. A ball to work in my hand. A jump rope to hang over the door and use pulling back and forth, and she also taught me to stand face to wall and slowly work my arm up the wall, climbing like a spider. You know the itsy bitsy spider story for kids? I did not do any exercise until at least a month after surgery and I have had no problems at all with range and use of my arm. All my nodes were removed, too. So different surgery, different doctors, etc. make a difference. Just ask the dr in case he forgot to mention it. And those drains, they are inserted all over again according to doctors. I had mine so long the doctor finally got disgusted and took out the last one, then I formed a seroma which had to be drained. No one ever seems to tell anyone ahead of time about the drains. I guess we should do a better job of that here for those going into surgery. Hugs, MK\n ",

Sure you could feel lousey for a few days, but some only feel lousey for a few hours, but not the whole three weeks. So I think you can get in some camping and other activities with the kids. It is good you are planning on it, keep your life as normal as possible. Deal with things one day at a time as they come, don't get all worked up over something that might not happen. OK? Sure women do have very aggressive breast cancer and lose the battle, but the percentage is minimal. So just relax and rest until it is time..................please. Hugs MK\n ",

I had to go on disability five years ago. Fortunately I had wonderful insurance at work and have gotten 65% of my salary minus what my Social Security pay is. That ends next month, and my income will drop drastically but I am thankful for the five years of insurance. Meanwhile I have had time to do what I want pretty much when I want. I have not missed working at all. At first I had lunch with the girls about once a month, then gradually it decreased until now I see them maybe four times a year. I have not even set foot in the office for two years, altho I still ask about everyone and communicate with several. There is life after work. LOL Don't look at it as giving in, look at it as getting a wonderful present. We are here ready to help by sending hugs across the seas. Hope you are enjoying summer. Love MK\n ",

      "Content": " OK Candy mentioning Best Buy made me remember my daughter's experience with them last August. There had been a special sale on a nice I-pod. My grandson wanted one, so my daughter said she would buy this one for his birthday for him. They went to the nearest store. They said they had one left but it had been promised to someone and they were \"holding\" it for them. DD asked if they could locate one for her, so the clerk looked at inventory and called a store about an hour away and asked them to hold the one they had for her, she was on her way there. After driving the hour to the store she was told they had sold it to someone else. She said it had been \"held\" for her. The salesperson told her it was not store policy to hold an item, first come, first served. So she explained what had happened at the last store and said they honored their hold by not selling to her, causing her to drive nearly 50 miles to this store. She asked to see the manager, who repeated it was not their policy to hold an item. But DD would not give up, she asked why they would let her drive so far if they had no intention of holding the i-pod for her. Finally, the manager gave in and brought the next model which holds mega more memory and was much upgraded and gave it to her for the sale price. Persistence does pay off, sometimes. LOL. Hugs.

Even with the history and a scarey mammogram, it does not mean any certain diagnosis. I had a scary mammogram eight years ago but the cancer was very early stage and I had a mastectomy and no other treatment. I have not been found to show any signs of cancer again. My daughter was diagnosed six years ago and is doing just as well, altho she did have a series of chemo because of her age. What I am trying to tell you is not to worry until you know what there is to worry about, if anything. God knows you have your hands full with your husband, but I am sure if you need to have some surgery there will be a way found for his care. We are here to support and help in any way we can. Hugs and prayers, Mary K.\n ",

Life can be so unfair sometimes, we all know that, but there is nothing we can do to make it fair. We just need to work it out and go with the flow. The waiting is the worst, believe me. One thing you will learn around here is to be an advocate for yourself. Speak up!!! Ask questions, don't take any guff from anyone. Did you read Luci's post about leaving the doctor's office after two hours and telling them she doesn't allot any more than two hours wait? I loved it. I am so much more aggressive today than I used to be. I was a doormat, but I am no longer. Now come on, pull it together, think about ghost stories and standing outside in Montana in the middle of winter in the middle of the night with no warm clothing and laugh. I am sorry about the husband deal, but you know what, he is not the first to put his tail between his legs and run when the woman he is supposed to love and honor and take care of in sickness and health needs him. You just got that part over so you don't have to deal with it now. And as I told you before, I would rather have a low grade breast cancer than deal with Crohns, and you have already been fighting that battle. Hang in there and before the kids come home, get in a place where no one can hear you and scream good and loud and get it all out. LOL. Hugs, MK\n ",

We need to think positive and not worry about things til we have something to worry about. Where have you heard that before?\nI, too, received some breast cancer Christmas gifts, one daughter got me a cosmetics folder for traveling and it was designed and made by Vera Bradley. My other daughter gave me a magnetic pink ribbon to wear on my car, like the support the troops yellow ribbon. \nActually I got several neat things. There is one that stands out as unique. It is a docking station for my cell phone here on my computer desk. I keep my cell phone in it, keeping it charged that way, then there is a real receiver where you can talk on the cell phone like a real phone, giving better sound. It also rings like a regular phone and louder. Don't know about the rest of you, but unless my cell phone is right next to me I do not hear it very well. Another special gift is a utility cart. I have lots of use for it, moving stuff around, yesterday we used it next to the table to put serving dishes on so the table would not be quite so crowded. It will help me bring groceries in from the car, move any boxes around the house, etc. \nAnyone else want to tell what they got that is really special?\nHugs MK\n ",

My cousin who is my son's age was not doing well in a huge school near Boston, so I asked his parents if he could come live with us during school year in OH and he did so much better. Then my sil's house burned down suspiciously after she and her husband split so she came with her four boys for about three months. And we had a Japanese exchange student for part of a school year. While she was with us, her mother and older sister came from Japan to visit, so we had them, too. We lived in an old farmhouse built around 1900's which was roomy but no where near elegant. But we did have fun. Hugs MK\n ",

Maybe they schedule too many patients in a shortened day. My PCP has cut her practice and only takes on new patients when she has space. Usually she is good about getting you in and out, especially if you have an early morning appointment, which I always aim for.

You were needing scans done and did not want to call and make the appointment. You were so afraid of what you would hear. I screamed at you in cyberspace and told you it could be good news and you were doing all that worrying about nothing, get it done then worry if you needed to. Well, the news was not exactly good, you did have a little microcalcification which made you decide to get rid of that second breast. The next few weeks were pure hell for you, the surgery, losing Mitchell and going through all the misery you went through with his mother, the kids and on and on. But look, five years later, you are living in a cute little teeny tiny house in teeny tiny town, and you seem so much happier even though you still miss Mitchell and always will. But you have those darling grandchildren nearyby, your health is looking better cancer wise, and the rest of it depends on behaving and minding your diet, etc. Look who's talking????? Anyhow, I am so happy for you, my dear, dear friend. I know you never, ever expected to hear words like you heard yesterday. It was great. I hope you gave that doctor a big hug.

A biopsy is not difficult to deal with, especially when you have lived with Crohn's and some of your other problems.

I had a lump 40 years ago which was benign, it turned out to be not a cyst, but the very first thing my doctor did was aspirate it to see if it was a cyst or not. Sonograms were not available back then. When no fluid was found, the lump was biopsied and found to be benign. So why are doctors in 2004 and 2005 playing guessing games? I don't understand. I would insist on at least an aspiration or needle biopsy at the very least. Doctors can not be sure what anything is without proper testing. Hugs and prayers that it is a cyst. Mary K.\n ",

      "Content": " Yes Ziggy, several have had this procedure done. I have not, but understand it is a rather simple procedure of withdrawing a core via needle for testing. My personal feeling is that if the test turns out to be positive it is a good way to know without surgery that you will need surgery and it gives you time to make arrangements. My daughter did this, had the test and took her time getting a plastic surgeon lined up for reconstruction to be done at the same time as her mastectomy was done. However, again this is my own opinion, if you have negative results, what proof do you have that the core was taken exactly where it should have been? It is a very small test and being off by half an inch could be a problem.............. I'm sure you will hear other opinions, as you should. You can also find information on this procedure here at healingwell, see the ads on the right hand side and the information at the top. There are also other websites with information. My daughter spent a lot of time doing her own investigation before making decisions. She is now six years out and doing well. Hugs Mary K.\n ",

      "Content": " So glad you called and reported back to us. I understand gallbladder is very painful. Surgery today is usually very easy for removal of stones. I have one large one that every time I had a CT scan everyone was ready to get the surgeon and I kept saying, when I have a problem with it I will see a surgeon, no sooner. For five years I have been keeping my fingers crossed and it is still there and still not causing a problem. I keep getting warned, however, that when it does I will be sorry. So I know it must be terribly painful. Hope Connie can make it tonight. I have a Christmas band concert for my grandson to go to, so I am afraid I won't make it. But hopefully you all will have a good chat. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks Jenny, now I seem to remember at some time maybe I knew your name is Jenny! I have a grand daughter Jenny.\nIt sure makes sense to me for them to remove the lump and not bother with the biopsy. Why did they not decide to do that in the first place? Who knows, maybe it is a male thing.\nAs for presurgical prep, fifty years ago, almost, I was in nurse's training. You should have seen the surgical prep done in the hospitals for just the very same thing as you are talking about. First of all people were admitted two days ahead of time so all the blood tests, etc. could be done. The night before surgery, a nurse or surgical technician came to your room and not only did all the scrubbing of the site, but they shaved it. Now you know how much hair is on a woman's breast, but it was shaved............. Student nurses had the pleasure of doing this job, which was not much on a female breast but we also had to shave the men for various surgeries. Now that was a lovely job, especially when they were very hairy.\nThe three hours in advance, is to get you settled in, they will do any last minute lab tests, possibly hook you up to an EKG, BP, etc. to make sure you are in good shape for surgery. Then most likely your anesthetist will come talk to you about his duties. Your doctor will come visit just before surgery usually with a magic marker and mark the spot, verifying with you which breast, etc., asking you questions which make you wonder if he knows what he is doing. But actually, he wants to be sure you know what he is going to do and it verifies where. When you are having some reconstructive work done it is almost fun to watch the Plastic surgeons with their magic markers. My daughter's PS actually drew on the bed sheets she told me................ I couldn't believe the hospital would let him do that, but he did. After these visits they will give you something to make you drowsy to prepare you to go to the operating room. Your surgery should be pretty simple, so you will probably not have much anesthesia, but since no one is explaining and you seem to want to know the answsers, I thought I would explain.\nSo now you have eleven days more to wait.................... we are here to keep you company. Waiting is so much fun.\nHugs MK\n ",

Also after surgery sometimes fluid gathers in a seroma which the doctor will aspirate to remove fluid. At any rate, you need to call the doctor's office and discuss with the nurse and possibly they will want you to come in a little sooner than your next post surgical visit.

My husband was very upset at my diagnosis, but he pretty much kept it all inside and stayed by my side when I was in the hospital. The only time he took me to drs appts was when I was not allowed to drive and far be it from him to go into the doctor's office with me. LOL Yet when he faced a prostate biopsy last year and every appt since he expects me to ride along with him. I get a chuckle out of that, but don't say a word. I just go. Please don't worry about things until you know you need to worry about them. If you think the new job is a great deal, go for it. Your good friends at the last job they will stick with you and I am sure you will make more new good friends to help you through any crisis you might have, also. You sound like a really good guy. Your wife won't necessarily get as sick as it sounds. My daughter went through chemo, I did not, but she had a 3 and a 7 year old at the time and worked at home almost daily, along with caring for horses she has. Chemo is not always a terrible ordeal, altho I don't mean to minimize it at all, sometimes it really is. Have faith that she will be one of the fortunate ones. If she isn't she has you by her side. Instead of feeling the ex may be even more problematic because of the breast cancer, consider she may be glad it is not her facing all this and for a change be thoughtful of your needs and your sons's. Let's look at the positive side and pray that it all works out that way. Prayers, MK\n ",

I can't really imagine why they would do two different types on the same breast, tho. I personally feel the surgical removal is the most sure. A needle biopsy is great and easier when the lump is definitely cancer, but when the results come back negative I would wonder if the exact spot was hit. Again this is my own personal feeling. If I were to have a biopsy I would want all to be done surgically since I was prepped already. Please tell us more. How old are you? What type of pain did you feel? Any other questions? Hugs Mary K.

True some do have problems now and then, but using a port saves veins from blowing in your arm. If lymph nodes are removed from your arm, then you should not have IVs or blood pressure taken in that arm again. So saving veins is important. I'm sure you will hear from others. I had no experience with chemo or a port, but I did have a PIC line which is similar when I had to have IV antibiotics over a long period of time. That worked great. Hugs MK\n ",

No matter what they think it is, they need to take some action to be sure. If it is a cyst, then they can do a needle aspiration and I believe they test the fluid to make sure there are no cancer cells. They usually are not, I believe. If they determine it is a lump you can still have a needle biopsy done, a core biopsy, or a lumpectomy biopsy. I am of the old school and I would prefer a full biopsy. My daughter's mammo showed it was most likely cancer, so a needle biopsy was done to acertain that it was before she made arrangements to have mastectomy and reconstructive surgery. The surgeon had told her a mastectomy was necessary if it was cancer due to the size and location, she was fearful it was into the chest wall, which it was not. Six years later she is doing fine. \nLet us know, we will be happy to share your good news and be here to help if you need further testing, etc. Hugs MK\n ",

      "Content": " What a great thread this is!!! Sherry, you have gotten so many good responses, I don't know what more I can say. I was 58 when dx (diagnosed) eight years ago and from the old school where I felt cancer needed to be gone totally, so I told my surgeon to go ahead with the mastectomy after the frozen section so I didn't have to go back for more surgery later. After the pathology reports and knowing what I know now, I probably would have been a good candidate for the lumpectomy and radiation. But I wanted any cancer removed from my body. I had tram flap reconstruction seven months later. My daughter was 39 when dx, she took her time and did a lot of research on the internet. She was actually the one who found this wonderful group of women for me. She was given no choice as to having a lumpectomy, her lump was high on her breast and the drs were afraid it was into the chest wall muscle. Thank heavens it wasn't, but she had the mastectomy and immediate tram flap reconstruction. Her reconstruction and mine are matching just fine. I would not dance topless but then I wouldn't have anyhow. Many women who have posted have had lumpectomies and had to go back for more surgery because the margins were not clean, meaning the surrounding tissues still showed signs of cancer. It definitely is your choice and there are many choices to make. As you learn them, come and ask questions, there is someone here with just about every scenario. We will be as helpful as we can. I am glad Sara saw your post and answered you. If you can meet her for lunch, please do, she is a wonderful person. We had a group gathering in Louisville last May where we met her for the first time in person. There are four from our group living in Louisville. Did you check out the roll call at the beginning of the page? If not please do and you will find there are many from OH, KY, IN. We're here for you. Hugs Mary K.\n ",

They make the best sundaes with hot caramel on one scoop and hot chocolate on the other scoop, sprinkle around some nuts, spray on some of that whipped cream and top it with a cherry. Now that is what I call a good sundae for a birthday. LOL Actually sometimes I have just the hot caramel and tell them to keep the chocolate. The other best thing is to have Homemade Vanilla Blue Bell with Mrs. Richardson's caramel heated in the microwave. Now Libby I know that sounds good to you, too. Hugs MK\n ",

I had OR training and worked after leaving as an OR tech, so I knew what I was dealing with. We have some nurses on board here, too. Most active are Mikki and Connie.

Good news is when there are no lymph nodes involved, good news is even when just a few lymph nodes are involved as opposed to many. Good news is the type or staging of the cancer to be one of the lower grades. Good news is when you don't have one of the more aggressive forms of breast cancer. So keep all this in mind as you have emotional turmoil. Of course the very best news is that there is no breast cancer at all, but now that you know there is you go on with hope and take aggressive action to fight what you do have.

The idiots who live on the other side of us have a Jack Russell and a Collie and last night they left them out for over an hour maybe two. These dogs are used to being in the house and they barked and barked. Finally I called over there and no one answered the phone, I left a message that I was extremely worried about their dogs being out so long in the cold. Still no results, so I called three more times and hung up when I got the answering service. I know they have caller ID so I am assuming they will know how upset I am.

This has been an especially hard year and a half for our group.\nBut Lori, you have it wrong, you can wear more than one bracelet at a time. The reason I tease you about bracelets is because my mother is a bracelet lover and she wears them six or eight at a time. In fact, several years back she was someplace where a man guesses age and weight and he told her age correctly then confided that he guessed because of the number of bracelets she had on. So maybe it is best not to wear more than one at a time. I believe she was in her seventies then, but at 91 she still wears a whole armful. She has to take them off at the airport.

There are several women here who have taken it without problems, then there are women who have had problems. Joint pain is not something I have heard a lot about with it. Taxol and Taxetere sp? seem to have joint pain. I have heard of heart problems, which is listed as a possible side effect as being about the worst. Depression can be a problem for some and of course the hot flashes. I quit taking it after about six months because my dr gave me the option and the hot flashes were horrid. My daughter had depression problems and quit taking it. I hope you get some more answers and they can help you. Mary K.\n ",

      "Content": " Great Sherry that you have a plan now. Personally, I do not think 24 hours in a hospital is long enough. It is ridiculous today what they do sending people home way too fast; however, if the doctor decides you need more time he can request time from your insurance company. I never stayed the minimum amount of time. For my mastectomy, only one side, I was in the hospital four days. For my tram flap reconstruction I was there about four days again. My daughter had one mastectomy and reconstruction and she was in two days I believe. So don't be disappointed or feel something is wrong if they decide to keep you an extra day. The reconstruction surgery will need a good time of healing. You know you WILL need help with the house and your kids if they are small, don't you? At least until you are healed pretty well. Back in the old days, this would have been at least ten days in the hospital. I am from the old days. LOL. You will do fine. Should you need some encoouragement and want to hear from someone by phone, I will be glad to call you. I have the one rate telephone deal which I do not use often enough. Just send me an email with your number and I will be happy to check on you and report back to the board until you are on your feet once you have surgery. You can get my email by clicking on my name here on the post. Hugs and prayers all goes perfectly. Mary K.\n ",

I am not trying to \"protect\" anyone, nor am I trying to turn off the laughter and fun. Nor do I feel I need to be around here 24/7, but the post was against rules and needed to be deleted. The reason the moderators can delete is so Peter doesn't have to handle each post. In the past when I have deleted posts like this I have heard about censoring which is not my intent at all. In fact, I was thinking today if someone had posted in another thread a story about someone trying to sell holy water and lucky poker glasses, it would have been fine. Everyone could have laughed and answered and said anything, but the seller would not have been selling his wares here nor would anyone be chiding him. While everyone was having so much fun laughing, I was feeling miserable because I was wasting Peter's time over something so blatantly wrong. Funny to most of us could have been hurtful to someone else? And if responding to a crazy post in a separate post, the name of the poster should not be called out, because that would be wrong, too.

Hopefully it is a cyst and once it has been aspirated it will go away and all should be ok. However, always be on guard and keep up with annual physicals and check yourself occasionally. If it should turn out to be a lump, as others have suggested, insist on having a biopsy because no one can tell for sure what that lump is without a biopsy. It is rare for someone your age to have breast cancer, but certainly not impossible. Do not let anyone tell you that you are too young.

When she lost hers it grew in just a beautiful salt and pepper. Not the most expensive beautician could have made it so pretty. And she thought it made her look older and missed her blonde hair, so she went for the Nice 'n Easy and went back to blonde.

I have had sciatica and it is painful. Thank heavens mine did not last long.

It was a beautiful wedding and there were many, many friends there to celebrate.  It was her grandmother's loss. I just can not understand how a grandmother could not attend her 30 year old grand daughter's wedding. Life is so short. We know that here.  Hugs MK\n ",

She is one who hates to stay in hospitals.  But I reminded her when I had the last infection they made me stay in four days with IV antibiotics, and she should be prepared and she had better stay.  She says she will be good and do as they tell her. She is in North Central Regional Medical Center in McKinney, TX but when I went to the website to find the address, they have two centers and I couldn't tell from the maps even which one she is in.  So I can't give an address.  Once I get a phone number from her, I will let you all know that.  Since she can't do much else, she can talk on the phone.

But then we did not get together until May 2004 in Louisville. Probably a group meeting will be held in May again. We had talked about a fall group in 2004 but it just didn/t work out.

      "Content": " IMHO no doctor would take a woman's breast if he did not feel it necessary. In fact, sometimes I feel like they try to conserve breasts more than they should. Quite often I have thought, and it is only my opinion, that having a lumpectomy sounded pretty chancey. Not always, tho, there are many cases where a lumpectomy is fine, when they know the cancer is low grade, very small and very early. I probably could have gotten away with a lumpectomy but I chose mastectomy thinking I wanted rid of the cancer period. I did not have to have chemo or radiation after chosing the mastectomy because the doctor's felt I was clear of cancer. It is now over eight years later and I have had no problems with recurrence or any other cancer. My diagnosis came at age 58, I think that made a difference, too. My daughter was dx at 39 and also had a mastectomy and then one round of chemo and she seems to be fine six years later. Tell us where your mother lives, perhaps one of us is nearby and can offer some other doctors to check out. A second opinion is never a bad idea. But it should be with a breast cancer specialist if at all possible. Hugs Mary K.\n ",

When you are dressed who knows if there are nipples or not, right? So many of the reconstructed ones are permantly showing, and with reconstruction you don't have to wear a bra, so the result is not necessarily what some women like, altho others do. Several of our group have had no reconstruction and wear their flat chests proudly, too. Being comfortable in your own skin is the answer and it sure sounds like you are doing very well!!! Feel free to sign in the roll call and find out more about us and tell us about yourself. Where you live, age, etc. Happy Thanksgiving. Mary K. (MK)\n ",

Sorry to hear of your prostate problems, Bob. My husband had a biopsy last year and it was negative, however his PSA is still elevated and the urologist is seeing him twice a year yet. I hope the one year deadline proves to be untrue. We have had women given deadlines like that and they have proven the guessers to be wrong. Jo-Ann has lived seven years beyond her \"date\" and altho she is not the picture of robust health, she gets around. We travel together occasionally.  We believe a sense of humor is really necessary and it sounds like you and your wife are doing well laughing instead of crying. Your dinner sounds very appropriate. LOL.  Thanks, Frank, I edited my post, too.  \nPrayers for all of you, MK \n ",

There are some girls here who were diagnosed twenty years ago, I have passed eight with no recurrance or cancer related problems. So right now, stop, take a deep breath and realize that you are not facing dying any sooner now than you were before you knew you had a problem. Take a day at a time and a night at a time and for heaven's sake get some sleep. There is nothing you can do until you have the doctor's appointment and then there may be nothing needed be done. Concentrate on what you know for sure, not what you fear. Don't worry until you KNOW you have something to worry about. That is always my advice for anyone who is anticipating problems. Please, calm down, it sounds like you have a good daughter and her boyfriend who will be there with you no matter what. Thank the good Lord for the blessings you have and be at peace with yourself. Talking to a counselor is a good idea. If you are chuch going and have a good minister that might be the best place to start. Hugs and prayers that your next post will be much more calm and you will be feeling better. MK\n ",

Mike and the boys have the house finished and have moved over there for sleeping and more space but it doesn't make sense to move Mel because her mil takes care of her most of the time.  I told her to tell her we all love her and are continuing to keep her in our prayers.  Can you believe it has been three months since they went to OK?  Our energizer bunny has not run out of battery yet.  She says very little but seems aware of people around, etc.  Hugs MK\n ",

Well, let me tell you, after I found it I could not eat, could not sleep, I was petrified....... I didn't have many pictures taken at the time but there is one that makes me look likea sick Twiggy and anyone who has met me knows, Twiggy I am not............... You are normal in being frightened, but believe me once you know something you will work out the details if it is cancer and will be more at peace. And if it is benign, you will sigh one big sigh of relief and go on with your life. My first one was benign and I never worried again until about 20 years later when my first real mammo showed something. That was biopsied and again benign. I was so lucky with the first two, I didn't bat an eye when I was diagnosed at 58. Hope you are so lucky, too. Hugs MK\n ",

Sometimes surgeons that can handle knives can't handle their attitudes, too well. Some of them can be the most self rightoeous sons of a guns you ever saw in a surgical suite, but they do know their business. Maybe with more patients like you they would learn their attitude is not acceptable. LOL. Go for it. I have lots of faith in you. Hugs MK\n ",

I sure don't know all the rules and regs but here is a cancer help legal site where you can possibly get some answers. \nhttp://www.wlcdr.org/clrc.html\nMy issues at work were when I was having problems with infection and before we got too far into it I was on disability and couldn't work anyhow. But it was suggested I work part time and let the woman who helped me part time take over my job. She didn't want my job, and after I had to go on disability they hired someone for more money who was fired after five months because they couldn't do the job. And finally, my boss apologized and told me he just did not realize how hard I worked and how much I did. I was the accountant for an engineering firm with three offices, I loved my job and never complained, always got things done, so they never knew how hard I really worked until I was gone. Now they have four people doing what my part time help and I did. LOL. \nBUT don't sell yourself short. If you feel you have just cause, certainly get some help. As I understand it the legal site above will guide you in that direction. A phone call sure won't hurt, will it?\nGood luck, keep us posted. I think you headed in the right direction seeing a psychriatrist to help you sort out your anger. Anger is the one thing I have gained from all I have been through. I was told it is a form of depression. LOL I have been prescribed Rx to help but found the pills caused me to feel worse. So I just get angry and let it blow now and then. \nTake care. Hugs, MK\n ",

I had agreed that if the frozen section showed cancer to have the mastectomy immediately. As I was being wheeled somewhere still very groggy, I remember hearing my husband's voice and the first thing I did was reach up to feel if my breast was gone. My husband told me that it was cancer and that the owner of the firm I worked for was there. When I heard that I sat right up and said, \"Alan is here?\" I remember feeling very specially cared for because I knew when I went into surgery another of the principal's had been there. They had prayed with me the day before as I left work and I knew I was in good hands. Those two men had taken turns staying with my husband throughout my surgery. I thought that was really incredible and tried to thank them for being there. Eight years ago last month, so per Connie 8 and almost 1. Where is Connie? Hugs MK\n ",

If you said it was a specialist I wouldn't think a thing of such a long wait, but a PCP????? No way. Hope it is nothing. You can find a lot of information by going to Google and looking at skin cancers. I learned lots when I had that rapidly changing spot on my face which turned out to be nothing, but I identified some other spots on my body. Did you know there is one skin blemish that has a halo?

All the stuff going on in your life and you are going to tackle a blueberry pie for dear old dad. The last time I tried blueberry filling I bought frozen berries and like someone suggesed above, it was pretty runny, but I was making it on top of the stove to put over cheesecake, so I stirred a little cornstarch in a little cold water and added..... it would have worked great if I had given it some time to thicken, but I was impatient and added a little more. Then it was like too thick................. Ugh if I could only learn to be a little more patient. \nI am making pumpkin pies for tomorrow and I bought the new refrigerated crusts that just came out that are in a roll, so they don't have creases to paste together. Usually I would make my own crusts, but I figure that is too much to manage for a meal for only six or eight of us. No one is visiting this year, so it is only those living here and I am not sure if dgd and her soon to be groom will be eating with us or not. Have a wonderful day. I agree on enjoying the holidays this year, too. Then go for it. I hope the new meds makes you stronger and drops those darnable TMs. Love, MK\n ",

Are your doctors considering this? You know after surgery there is a suppository they give you to knock down the nausea, wonder if that might work in this case? I can't imagine always feeling so sick. It must be horrible. Husbands just don't have a clue sometimes. What can I say, mine gives me a bad time sometimes, too. Grrr.

      "Content": " There are many women here who have had bilateral mastectomies who might be able to help you cope. During a holiday week people are usually busy with family and dinner preparation so I am not sure how much response you will get for a few days anyways. First, my advice would be to seek some help from your doctor for short term coping. There are many Rx that will help you ease into coping. I'm sure your job loss alone was enough to be very upsetting without adding in the additional health problems. Was your job loss due to your health problems or because of downsizing, etc.? You might find some help to fight the job loss if it was due to health at this time. Where are you located? City, state? We may have a member near enough to you to have lunch with you and tell you more about us. Our roll call above will give you some info on us and I urge you to post there with info you feel comfortable with sharing so we can get to know you better, too. We are here to help. There are many ages here, many different stories of treatment, many stages of breast cancer, survivors of about 20 years down to newbies. Please help us help you. Hugs, Mary K. MK\n ",

Usually bc in older ladies is not as aggressive. Now about that younger lady, maybe after she settles down and realizes what the odds are and what she really could be facing, she will realize saving a breast is not quite as important as she first thought. I'm sure her doctor's will guide her in the right direction. Hopefully all will be handled properly. I know how upset it is making you, and I don't blame you for being upset.

It is great to be positive about treatment, but making a blanket statement like she will be fine certainly give the public the wrong impression about breast cancer being easily treated. I hope she is and I hope that her cancer was caught early, but I think it would be better to let the public know more about treatment possibilies and outcomes statistically. By making the statement she will be fine gives the impression all you have to do is go through treatment and presto ................. which we know is not always the case. Hugs MK\n ",

She loved you very much, she was so proud of you and knew that you were there for her and appreciated that. She was a beautiful young woman. The world has suffered a great loss in her passing, as you well know. I am so glad I got to meet her in person in Louisville. She was truly an inspiration to all of us and much loved by everyone who met her in cyberspace as well as in person. It certainly is to your credit that she was so loved and admired. Come anytime you feel the need to \"talk\", you are most welcome. Susan's mother posted for awhile after her passing and still corresponds with some of her friends. Other's keep in touch with Julie's Mom. We have lost some truly remarkable young women in our group and with each passing I think it gets harder. Hugs and prayers, MK\n ",

      "Sample": "You have had surgery. I remember when I had a lumpectomy my surgeon apologized and suggested sending me to a PS surgeon because my breast had a big dent in it....The pathologist will have a good bit of information from the biopsy which will give the doctors and surgeons what they need to advise you as to surgery and treatment. Chemotherapy is making great strides....The surgeon suggested plastic surgery and I told him I was not going to dance topless so I would live with it. Within about\n two years, maybe less the breast was all filled in....I would hope they would do a surgical biopsy which is only day surgery. But perhaps the dr will suggest a needle biopsy which is even easier....I suggest you talk to your doctor about\n doing a regular biopsy if you really believe this horror story. Even masstectomy surgery is not as bad as you described, perhaps you could plan for that and you would never have to face a steriodactic biopsy ever....Many have shared the wait and worried, but I always say \"Don't worry until you know you have something to worry about\n!\" The pathologist will have a good bit of information from the biopsy which will give the doctors and surgeons what they need to advise you as to surgery and treatment....Hi Jean, I had a benign tumor years ago that took quite a large sized chunk from 9-11 o'clock on my breast. The surgeon suggested plastic surgery and I told him I was not going to dance topless so I would live with it....",
