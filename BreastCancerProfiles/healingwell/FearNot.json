      "Content": " Just wanted to let you all know that I dodged the bullet again and was truly blessed. When I went in for my biopsy after two more radiologists did some more ultrasounds on my breast they felt like it was fibrous tissue and maybe a cyst. He inserted a needle and withdrew fluid. IT WAS A CYST, PRAISE GOD! Anyway they put in a marker near the area and I am to go back in 6 months. Even though these cysts are truly a pain to deal with, I will not complain for this one was truly a blessing. Thank you all for your encouraging and kind words and I will keep you all in my thoughts and prayers. \nDebbie ",
