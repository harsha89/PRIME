      "Content": " Bella I wish I could answer your question but unfortunately my statement stays the same. You should really go see a doctor. We dont know if the lump in your breast is bad or not and there would be no other way of finding out unless you see a doctor. I am a breast cancer survivor and I have learned that \"waiting \" is not the place to be when we know there is something unusual in our body. Bella can I ask the reason why you cant tell your parents? Maybe I can understand better, I dont see anything wrong by going to your mom and tell her you noticed something in your breast. I have a 17 year old myself and I am constantly reminding her about\n breast self exams. As a mother I can tell you that we care for our children, even if there isn't a lot of communication, I know I would do anything for my 3 girls. \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Bella, I agree with the previous comment. You should go see  a doctor to make sure everything's ok. I will tell you that 80% of the lumps found in our breast turn out to be benign(not cancerous) but there is a 20% that I believe is strong enough to push us to see a doctor. You are very young but unfortunately breast cancer doesnt care about\n your age. Now please dont misunderstand, I am NOT telling you is cancer but I do tell you to please follow up. I dont know why you cant tell your parents but just remember, is your body and is your life. I wish you well \n ",

I know you must be scared but dont jump into any conclusions before you are checked. There is no disease unless a doc and a biopsy will say so. Enjoy life to the fullest and I be praying for you :) Hope to hear good news soon... ",
