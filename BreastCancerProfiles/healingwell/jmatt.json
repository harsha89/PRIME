    "Content": " Hi,\nWith the cost of lymph massages i think it's a good idea to learn how to do them (properly) yourself.\nHow long do you recommend each session should last? Usually at the clinics they go on for about\n 30minutes. Should this be the guideline?\nI know by taking regular exercise it helps dramatically with the swelling but when would it be best to do the self massage, before or after exercising?\nTheres an ebook which i found on http://www.lymphadvice.com/lymphedema.html which gives great advice on the kinds of exercises which help and it also looks into diet, which has ben a real eye \nopener. If this helps anyone.\nAlso, how many times a day should the massage be done?\nThanks! ",
