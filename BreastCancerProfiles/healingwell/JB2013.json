    "Content": " Note: I received permission from the site administrator to post the following:\nHello Everyone,\nMy name is Dr. Julie Schnur, and I am a clinical psychologist as well as an Assistant Professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, NY. My research and clinical work has focused on improving the quality of life of individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer. In the course of my work, I have spoken with breast cancer patients who were also survivors of trauma and/or abuse. These patients have made me aware of how re-traumatizing cancer treatment can be for trauma and/or abuse survivors.\nAs a result of these patients sharing their experiences, I am now committed to learning more about\n how we can improve the quality of cancer care delivered to survivors of trauma and/or abuse. I would be grateful to learn from you about\n your experiences. \n If you have ever been diagnosed with cancer as an adult, if you are a survivor of trauma and/or abuse that occurred \n your cancer diagnosis, and if you are age 18 or older, I would be grateful if you would complete my online survey. The survey questions will ask about\n your history of trauma and/or abuse, your experiences of cancer treatment, and about\n your personality and background. The survey is secure and anonymous. It will take on average 35 minutes to complete.\nThe ultimate goal of the survey is to understand what makes cancer treatment retraumatizing, so that we can improve the delivery of cancer treatment in the future, and educate cancer treatment providers about\n the unique needs of survivors of trauma and/or abuse. \nThank you so much for considering participating. I appreciate the chance to learn from you!\nIf you are interested in participating, please click on the link below:\nPlease consider sharing the link above with any adult age 18 or older who may be interested in completing the survey. If you or anyone you know has any questions or concerns about\n the study, please contact me at CTR@mssm.edu. Please note that this email address is only checked during business hours, Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM, Eastern Standard Time. During the week, we will make every effort to respond to your email within 48 hours. \nSincerely,\nJulie B. Schnur, Ph.D.\nAssistant Professor, Department of Oncological Sciences \nCo-Director, Integrative Behavioral Medicine Program \nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai ",
