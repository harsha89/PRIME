    "Content": " Hi Kelly1\nI just stumbled on this thread myself after trying to locate some images of what my breast might look or feel like after my surgery in two days. I have a BIRADS 4, they attempted a core biopsy first and were not successful due to the \nlocation of my tumor. BTW please forgive my spelling on these terms, this is all completely new to me. I am 36, have 3 little boys myself and have had fibrous tissue in both my breasts for at least 6 years. The tumors were discovered after lymph nodes under both my arms got really big and sore and my breasts started hurting at the same time. Ultrasound was clear but the mammogram showed the cluster. In two days I go under the knife for a surgical biopsy (the details of which horrify me to my very soul) and then it's another waiting period to find out if it's benign or malignant. \nI can't say I have any clue what to expect afterward, I think the fear I'm feeling is overwhelming and almost completely blocking the rest of my senses. It's literally like a concrete block in my head that's keeping the wheels from spinning :/ And I also can't tell anymore if I'm more scared of all the needles and hooks and the pain or of finding out that I might have cancer. \nI would love to know how your 4-week visit turned out when you started experiencing all the intense pain and swelling. \nCheers :) ",
