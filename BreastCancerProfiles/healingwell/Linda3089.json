      "Content": " I saw the surgeon on Wednesday. He is doing a removal biopsy on Thursday and he is pretty sure the biopsy results are benign. His office was so plain and almost shabby and while I was waiting for him, I thought about\n leaving and finding another surgeon. Boy am I glad I didn't. He gave my husband and I all the time we needed, answered every question and he kept telling us to concentrate on the removal biopsy. He was really calm and thoughtful and helped us to calm down.\nOn a side note. one reason we were so scared was that when we read the reports,which we had to get to bring to the surgeon, we saw that in 2001 the report noted a \"suspicious area\" and no one ever mentioned it to me. The 2003 report noted the same area and again no one ever mentioned it to me.\nThe problem with that was that after 20 years of mammograms with nothing unusual ever report, I became over-confident and careless about\n getting in annually. I know I was wrong and foolish, but I certainly would have been more diligent about\n annual exams if I had know that there was a suspicious area they wanted to keep an eye on. \nFrom now on when I have a mammogram, I going to make certain that my primary care doctor gets a copy since I see him every 3 months.\nI want to thank everyone for their support over the past week. I will get back to all after Thursday and certainly let everyone know the biopsy results. Daily I try to ask for mercies for all people dealing with illness. I have done this for years as it helps me to think about\n others and keep my life in perspective and be grateful for all I have. Of course this means more to me now than ever before. Best wishes to all. Linda\n \n ",

I called the gyno office and they said the doc would not be in today and that they find a surgeon who would accept my insurance and that I would probably have the biopsy done next week or so.

      "Content": " Deb, \nThanks for the response. I am not too worried. I had a b9 tyroid nodule removed in 1983. The 1st. doctor told me that if I didn't let him operate or if I even went to another doc I would be dead in a year. Needless to say, I found someone else who was actually a human being. I have some real good things going for me. Previous b9 growth, no family history and oddly, I don't feel sorry for myself. I have told my family that I don't want to hear \"It's not fair\" Or \"Why you\" I have lost many friends to cancer and it wasn't fair to any of them and not one of them would be my choice to die from this disease. I just look at this as a part of life and I want to take things one step at a time. \nThe only problem is that my 81 year old mother lives with us and she is and always has been a difficult individual. But if she starts to cause too much trouble in my home, I will call the Dept of the Elderly and ask for placement in an assisted living facility. \nI also have a 40 year old son who is mentally ill and lives at home. He is handling this well and he knows that we expect him to take - his meds and that this is not a time for acting out, which he rarely does. Most of the acting out is on Mom's part\nMy husband and I try to be generous and understanding, but we are both ready to put this situation in the forefront of our lives until it is resolved.\nI really appreciate your input. Like I said, I didn't know about\n MRI s. But is a needle biopsy the most accurate outside of surgical biopsy? If it is, that is what I want and I want it asap. Thanks again for the feedback,\nLinda ",

      "Content": " Thanks MK,\n My Husband and I are making plans for an assisted living facilty. Not only is it stressful having a such a difficult person in my home, but in Fl I am her legal caretaker, which means I am responsible for supervising her all her medications, making sure she follow the diet the doc has her on, getting her to doctor appointments, filling prescript\nions, keeping in touch with the case worker. Both the doctor and the case worker have suggested placement in an assisted living facility, but she is on Medicaid and has no money, so she will not be able to go anywhere she wants, just what the state will pay for. \n My husband and I are going to start looking at some of these today.\nAs far as having the growth removed, I am trying to stay in the present and today's thing is getting a surgeon to do the needle biopsy. But in the back of my mind I agree with you. Better out than in. It's just so hard to stay in the present. Fortunately, my family situation gives me enough issues to deal with on a daily basis. \nI have also told my son and my husband they have to learn to cook and shop. They are both already goos at cleaning and doing the wash. And I told them that no body was born knowing how to cook and that they can do it. \nThe doctors office just called. I meet the surgeon next Wed afternoon and I have been told that he schedules everything very quickly. The nurse who called said she had the same sort of thing and had a core biopsy. But that the surgeon does what he thinks is best. Since my growth has grown over the past month, I would like it out. But time will tell. \nIn the mean time I have also decided to redecorate my bedroom. Right now it is gold and beige with chocolate colored sheets. I'm going for the Hamptons beach look with blues, yellows, sand and mint green. I've already ordered new curtains and I am crocheting a afghan in mint green and yellow with touches ob blue. \nWe all need something bright in our lives. \n Thank you for your response. I really appreciate being able to vent outside of the family. Take care Linda ",

      "Content": " I am one of the lucky ones. it was benign. And I want to share something else. When this whole thing started back in March, I tried to stay calm, stay in the present, deal with the facts and stop myself(and others) from dealing with the what ifs. I had to keep telling myself that God had a plan for me and that whatever the outcome, if I stayed in the present, I would be able to handle it -one day at a time.\nI had lots of support from my family and from this board. I didn't tell anyone outside of the family and this board gave me all of the support I needed. Like many other women, I do a lot of caretaking. My mother, my disabled son, help my daughter & her family. But on March 27th when the radiologist told me that there was a nodule, the \"I don't give a darn\" button got switched on. Suddenly I jumped to the head of the line in terms of needing my attention. I insisted that my husband and son learn how to shop and cook, which they are still doing. If my mother doesn't want to take her medicine, it doesn't bother me. The doctor will put her in a nursing home sooner than later, which is what I am trying to postpone.\n And the strangest thing happened last Monday. I was thinking about\n all of the changes I made in the past 6 weeks and I was suddenly grateful for the nodual. Honestly grateful. \n I know that those of you who have have a different biopsy are fighting with all your courage to get well. And I want you to know that every night I say a prayer that soon things may turn around for you.\nThank you once again for all the support in the past 6 weeks. Linda \n ",

      "Content": " I had the nodual removed last Friday. First the radiologist put the wire through the tumor and then I had 2 mammagramps. Next thing up to surgery. I was lucky that I only needed local anesthesia with something that put me to sleep. I woke up almost immediately and felt great. In about\n 20 minutes I felt some stinging and they gave me some morphine and in another 20 minutes I left worse again. My breast was very hard and they gave me an icepack thinking it was from the local. \nSoon they took me to a discharge room, gave me some cranberry juice , took out the IV and let me go to the toilet. I started to get dressed putting on my underwear and jeans,but leaving the hospital gown on top since they wanted to check the bandage.\n The RN moved the bandage a little and this look of horror came over her face and she ran out to call the surgeon. He stepped into the room and the same look came onto his face. It seems there was a hemotoma and I was back off the OR. It was a good thing because an artery had burst. Once again I was able to have a local and everything was repaired and I was home in no time. In fact, my husband and I went out for dinner.\nI am soo glad I didn't have general anesthesia or I might not have felt the pain as soon as I did and while my surgeon was still in the building. My breast is deep purple over most of it. but it feel fine and I will get the results of the biopsy next Wednesday. And everyday that I don't get a call to come in to the office immediate, is a good day. \nI want to thank everyone for listening to me and I will post the results as soon as I get them. Everyone on this board has my good wishes and hope for the best possible outcome. ",
