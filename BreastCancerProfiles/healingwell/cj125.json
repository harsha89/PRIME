    "Content": " Hi!\nMy name is Connie, I turned 50 this year, I live in Vegas but I'm from the Midwest. Born in Colo, but spent all but the last 7 in Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas. I have a wonderful husband of 18 years and 2 great children. My handsome, eligible son is 27 - and my beautiful daughter is 17. I know - what an age difference... it's my 2nd marriage.\nI don't know all the lingo here yet, but I had surgery 3-31-04 - they removed the cancer thing and 3 nodules. The nodules were supposed to be cancer free, so they scheduled me for 30 full breast (external) radiation treatments and 8 boosts. I finished that last Friday - but only after having to take 2 weeks off from the 2nd degree burns I got. \nI'm looking forward to learning more for all of you - I'm glad I found this place.\nSincerely,\n Connie or better known as cj125\n ",
