      "Content": " A big thank you to all of you who have welcomed me. I just had surgery on Friday. Lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node removed. I guess there were some complications with excessive bleeding and a hematoma w/ lumpectomy? The swelling is a bit more than I imagined - I think that is due to the complication. They still sent me home same day, so I imagine it can't be too bad or they would have kept me overnight. I am doing well and not taking the pain meds they prescribed. It only hurts when I move around. So, I have been pretty much just laying around propped up on pillows and keeping ice on it. I didn't expect a 2 inch incision w/ 6 staples under my arm for one node being removed ; I can't imagine if they had to take more out? As I understand it, I will get the full pathology report as early as tomorrow, end of day. That will confirm a negative node and the margins around tumor being negative. Saying my prayers and staying positive. It has been hard on my husband because we have a not-yet-two-year-old boy and he is a bundle of energy. Have to keep him away from climbing on my lap, etc. and I miss him snuggling with me! I have to stay home from work next week until I go to follow up appt. with the surgeon. My surgeon is so awesome and caring. He even gave me his home and cell numbers if I had any questions. possibly all surgeons,  but it is new for me. I am determined to call him today so I can catch him on the golf course as I know he is a big golfer! Ironically he is the same surgeon that did my husband's crohns surgery 10 yrs. ago. He specializes in oncology surgery though and has done many breast surgeries. Now, to find the best oncologist in the northern illinois area! Has anyone had experience with Canter Treatment Centers of America? I think they have 4 hospitals in the U.S and one happens to be 20 miles from me. I am skeptical because I saw a couple bad things about\n them, but it seems like a wonderful center at least from the info they gave me. I think I am going to talk to at least 3 diff. oncologists before deciding where to go. Any suggestions on what I should be looking for in an onc? I live in the northern suburbs of chicago, near wisconsin. Going downtown to the city would not be possible, so I have to find something up this way. Any ideas on what I should be looking for in a trtmt plan would be appreciated. I'll check in later today or tomorrow. Hope to hear from you! Thanks!!!\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Lou, I am in almost the same place as you having just been diagnosed. Although I have already had the lumpectomy on 4-27-07. The sentinel lymph node was negative so the cancer did not spread to the lymph nodes. I am now in the process of scheduling consultations with oncologists to determine the next steps. Sounds like treatment will include chemotherapy followed by radiation. Do you feel comfortable sharing the details of your diagnosis, such as the type of breast cancer or size, etc. Not sure if you know this info yet. Mine is invasive (infiltrating?) ductal carcinoma and was 3.1 cm in size. the surgery was not bad. Recovery went well and today I am in hardly any pain at all. Didn't take any pain killers either, even though they prescribed them. I am 39 yrs. old and live in suburb of Chicago. I'm married and have a 2 year old boy. Look forward to hearing more about\n you. Please keep posting here as the women (and some husbands here as well) are wonderful sources of information and support!!! \nKathy ",
