I've had a sterotactic biposy in my right breast (which came out fibrocystic/benign), an MRI on both breasts and now I have off and on discomfort in my right breast and a pulled muscle/spasm feeling from time to time in my left breast. I am told that pain or discomfort can linger for many months after a biopsy. I am now on week 11. But I'm wondering if the left breast issue is referred pain from chronic neck and back pain? Although I have had the chronic neck and back pain for a long time, the breast thing on that side just started. Sometimes I will wear a tank top under my clothes instead of a vra and wonder if the gravity of not wearing a bra has anything to do with it. Anyone have any ideas? ",

I just don't want to keep \"running in circles\" as I stated before with this but on the other hand feel like no one really knows what to do about\n pain from the biopsy after a certain amount of time except give you another mammogram and I don't want all that radiation.when I had my first biopsy which was totally messed up, they took pictures before and after the procedure and they took about\n 14 pictures. Ummm...I'm no expert but to me, that seems like a lot of radiation and when I got my second biopsy (which they knew what they were doing) they were able to do the biopsy off of my pictures that I got the first time and didn't do any more mammograms afterwards and sent in the sample. He said that he took more than normal just to cover the area and I agreed to that. So, now we are trying to establish back a normal baseline and they want to do an ultrasound and mammogram 6 mo from the date of the procedure. Still nervous about\n getting a mammogram regarding the radiation exposure.\nDo you have a lot of pain or just when you do certain things? Can you sleep on that side? I wore a tank top instead of a \"bra\" for the first few weeks after the biopsy. I'm thinking that was not a good idea because I think the gravity pulled on the hematoma which I think slows the healing process. ",

I still feel a little bump from one of the hematomas and if pressure is applied, it is sore. Not too bad but enough to know the soreness is there. Now with that being said, I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, but I did start my period 8 days early and it was lighter than usual and only lasted 4 1/2 days which normally mine go 6 days. Anyway, the discomfort on the side where my biposy was can be any where on that side nit just at the biopsy site. Really? This long afterwards? Will it ever get better? ",

I fell asleep last night with an ice pack of solid frozen water in it and the ice pack was on through the night. Will that cause damage? The reason I ask is because they say to ice the area for 10 min or so at a time and I fell asleep with it on me for hours. Do you suppose the skin around the area that is tender to the touch a nerve thing or is it tender due to the hematoma itself? I can't seem to get any answers....just the standard covering their behinds answer of \"everyone is different on the healing process\". ",

I woke up last night because of the pain from laying on that side. I am premenopausal and wonder if hormone fluctuation can cause pain in the scar tissue that I was told that I had? Remember, I had two biopsies a week a part because they didn't get in the right area they needed to the first time. Does anyone feel that after getting this biopsy that one breast now feels lumpier than the other one? I did have my 6 month follow up. I now believe that the reason for the fibrocystic change was because of now being in premenopause which back then, I thought it was because of too much caffeine. Any thought? I just didn't think the tenderness/off and on pain would have been gone by now but then again, the fluctuating hormones may magnify pain. ",

Now I have a small knot where the needle was (on one side of where the needle was) and that is scarring me. No one seems to care. How cold these Dr's are and yet don't feel bad for taking our money. I don't get it. How would they like it if they got a taste of their own medicine? I have been a basket case because I'm not getting answers. This is so stressful. I will say a prayer for you all.

The hematoma seems smaller but it seems like when I stretch my arm as if I'm reaching for something, I get a twinge of pain off and on for about\n 3 min. Or so. Am I irritating this? Also, shouldn't the pain be totally gone by now? I mean it's been a month now! Any pressure against it doesn't feel to great either. I read that when they do mammograms that the hematoma can leave a lump or scar tissue or even calcifications which can make the radiologist think it could be a cancer thus possibly wanting to do a biopsy. When do the biopsies stop? I mean, I got this done because of microcalcifications (which were benign) and now I read that because of the biopsy and hematoma, that can also warrant another biopsy. Ughhh..I just don't want to be running in circles with biopsies ya know? ",

She felt it and said that it wasn't a hematoma but that it was scar tissue with fatty tissue behind it. Can she really diagnose that just by feeling it? I called the Dr who did the biopsy to ask him about\n that and he said that it sounds like its a little bit of the hematoma that created the scar tissue and its pressing against the nerve. Does that even sound logical? I'm not due for another month to get the follow up but he said that my pain (which feels like nerve pain most of the time) doesn't happen that often at this point after the biopsy but then said before, that everyone is different in the healing process. So what should I believe....that what I'm still going through is normal or that what I'm going through doesn't happen that often, but has happened?\nThis is all so frustrating. :-( ",

I noticed that the breast that had the biopsy feels different than the healthy one (had it for micro calcifications and came out benign) k7nd of like feels thicker or maybe more lumpy maybe? I just wanted to know those of you that have been post biopsy for awhile, do you notice a difference in your breasts now? I might add that I actually had two stereotactic biopsies 10 days apart vecause the first facility messed up and did not get near where they were suppose to. I developed hematomas from each biopsy. I still feel a tiny little knot from one of the hematomas on the outside of the breast but overall, that breast feels a little more \"firm\" I guess than the other one.

Also the fact that I too did things around the house too soon. The ole' saying that you can return to normal activities the next day is not a one healing fit all so to speak. If anything, they should say that everyone is different and also explain the different things that can occur if you do this or that etc...instead of just saying you can return to your normal activities the next day. That's wrong. It took me going out of state to a breast surgeon who works with one of our Dr friends to get some answers which the radiologist should have explained in the first place. ",

They went in with a needle in a very delicate area and the trauma will take some time to heal. I am 9 weeks out and I know how you feel. I am wanting everything to be healed 8 weeks ago. Give it time. Put moist heat on it. Wear a good support bra (which I didn't do) and take it easy on that side. I know they sometimes say that a few days later that you can return to normal activities but for me that wasn't true. I vacuum now and it can irritate the area. I sleep on that side and the pressure can make it hurt a little. So, just take it easy and if you want peace of mind, ask for an ultrasound to see if you have a hematoma.
