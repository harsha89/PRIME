      "Content": " Thank you for your reply. My skin does have that tender/burning feeling when lightly touching it. That happened before icing it. I'm told that there are a ton of nerves in the breast and with a stereotactic, it can definitely effect the nerves. Now, whether that is true or not, I'm not sure. I'm wondering if one would have the nerve pain from the sterotactic if they didn't have a hematoma? ",

I just don't want to keep \"running in circles\" as I stated before with this but on the other hand feel like no one really knows what to do about\n pain from the biopsy after a certain amount of time except give you another mammogram and I don't want all that radiation.when I had my first biopsy which was totally messed up, they took pictures before and after the procedure and they took about\n 14 pictures. Ummm...I'm no expert but to me, that seems like a lot of radiation and when I got my second biopsy (which they knew what they were doing) they were able to do the biopsy off of my pictures that I got the first time and didn't do any more mammograms afterwards and sent in the sample. He said that he took more than normal just to cover the area and I agreed to that. So, now we are trying to establish back a normal baseline and they want to do an ultrasound and mammogram 6 mo from the date of the procedure. Still nervous about\n getting a mammogram regarding the radiation exposure.\nDo you have a lot of pain or just when you do certain things? Can you sleep on that side? I wore a tank top instead of a \"bra\" for the first few weeks after the biopsy. I'm thinking that was not a good idea because I think the gravity pulled on the hematoma which I think slows the healing process. ",

I still feel a little bump from one of the hematomas and if pressure is applied, it is sore. Not too bad but enough to know the soreness is there.

Remember, I had two biopsies a week a part because they didn't get in the right area they needed to the first time. Does anyone feel that after getting this biopsy that one breast now feels lumpier than the other one? I did have my 6 month follow up. I now believe that the reason for the fibrocystic change was because of now being in premenopause which back then, I thought it was because of too much caffeine. Any thought? I just didn't think the tenderness/off and on pain would have been gone by now but then again, the fluctuating hormones may magnify pain. ",

She felt it and said that it wasn't a hematoma but that it was scar tissue with fatty tissue behind it. Can she really diagnose that just by feeling it? I called the Dr who did the biopsy to ask him about\n that and he said that it sounds like its a little bit of the hematoma that created the scar tissue and its pressing against the nerve. Does that even sound logical? I'm not due for another month to get the follow up but he said that my pain (which feels like nerve pain most of the time) doesn't happen that often at this point after the biopsy but then said before, that everyone is different in the healing process. So what should I believe....that what I'm still going through is normal or that what I'm going through doesn't happen that often, but has happened?\nThis is all so frustrating. :-( ",
