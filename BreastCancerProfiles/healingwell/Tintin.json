      "Content": " Hi! Merrida,\nThanks for writing me. I did posted the same thread to Crohn's and Ostomy forums. No specific answers pertained to my situation. To my horror, when I re read the pathology report today, I found that I am also triple negative. I don't know why the surgeon did not mention it when she was going through the report with me. Maybe she did not want to worry me. With triple negative bc, Chemo is actually the more effective way to treat it but Chemo causes extensive ulceration of the intestines. I only have small bowels left. I have so little confidence left because I have tried so hard to take care of myself and things just keep popping up. \nI am not having much luck getting hold of the bc nurse (I would like her to arrange a meeting with the oncologist or whosoever is in charge). At the same time I probably should not delay the treatments due to the aggressive nature of the illness.\nI will try to call the membership services again tomorrow and hopefully they can give me some answers.
