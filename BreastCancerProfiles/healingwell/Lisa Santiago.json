    "Content": " I am 35yrs old and for a while now I've had rainy days. I recently started getting seizures and they haven't found the source. Since they hvnt been able to figure out the source of seizures my doctor and neuorologist ordered the following, Mammogram, Pap, brain MRI, EEG and several Lab work. Just this past Tuesday 10/3 I got a mammogram and just now I got a call from the clinic to return on Thursday. The office didn't want to provide any additional info. What is a bit nerve racking is my mom died of breast cancer at the age of 51 and my cousin got cancer and breast cut off at 42yrs old. Plus hvng these seizures doesn't help my nerves.\nSINCE I WAS 20 yrs old I would tell my hubby that I wldnt make it past 30s but only bcuz I always had something in me telling me that. Now I'm here and dam it I want 40+ more yrs. These conditions are making me worry I smile, laugh, and act as if I'm not worring but DAM IT I'm so afraid. \nI am in the waiting period for the MRI RESULTS and the EEG appointment and now the mammogram follow up call. \nHas any gone or know anyone that has had seizures for 1+ yrs and 2 different doctors hvnt found a source?\nIs a call back from the doctor 2 days after your mammogram typical?\nLisa ",
