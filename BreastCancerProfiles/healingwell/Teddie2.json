      "Content": " In answer to my own question above, I have located information (from the International Strategic Cancer Alliance) that the breast produces its own estrogen and that this cannot be detected in a blood test, only from an extraction (painful and expensive) of a sample from the breast. They are working to create a better test format. \nThis then begs the question question - does Femara, or its sub components, get into the breast to block formation of estrogen? ",

      "Content": " New to this forum - indeed to forums at all, so excuse me if this question is in the incorrect place.\nDoes anyone know why my oncologist is having me take Femara if my blood estradiol count is zero? Treated for estrogen positive/progesterone positive breast cancer - stage 1 or 2 (two tumors, different cancers, side by side, one 1.2 cm grade 1, 1.5 cm grade 2, lumpectomy - clean margins. radiation just completed. I'm very nervous about\n taking the Femara because of current osteo arthritis and joint pain. I'm post menopausal, 56 yrs old, hysterectomy 16 yrs ago. Also - I often have bad reactions to prescript\nion medications.\nWhen I posed the question to my oncologist, she just said \"it's more complicated than that ...\" Thought that I would find out more online, but I haven't.\nthanks for reading this - I'll keep a watch on postings.
