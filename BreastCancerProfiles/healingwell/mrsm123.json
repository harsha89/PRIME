      "Content": " Hi..I usually post in Chronic pain but found that I also need to\nBe here, for now. I recently (end of Jan.) had a mammo. Last ones\nBefore this were 2006 and2007. This new one showed many microcalcifications\nIn both breasts. Was told I needed to return for more views and bilat\nBreast ultrasound. Did that only to get the report that they were\nrecommending stereotactic biopsy of right breast. Had that two\nFridays ago. Apparently they missed the calcifications completely.\nSo today I had to repeat the biopsy.\nNow I have to wait yet another week for the results...\nSandi\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks Sherbear, \nThe worst part of it is that I had two biopsies, one day apart- one thyroid and one for the stereotactic, both came back the same day, 8 hours apart, both completely missed the tissue they were supposed to biopsy..so today was the repeat for the stereo...in a week I guess I will have to repeat the thyroid...\nSandi\nMotorcycle accident 1992, Back problems from 92 to 2005.
