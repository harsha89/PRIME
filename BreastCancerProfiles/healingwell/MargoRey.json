    "Content": " Hey everyone! My name is Margo Rey, and I'm currently on my second of four rounds of chemo treatments. I made this video:http://bit.ly/19pvFgb in the hopes of giving back some inspiration to those who've inspired me.\nI'm also a musician and am sharing my journey with all of my fans. I'd really appreciate it if you took a few seconds to check out my music right here:\nÂ soundcloud.com/margorey\nI'm hope someday to be a source of inspiration and motivation. Embrace the mohawk ladies!! ",
