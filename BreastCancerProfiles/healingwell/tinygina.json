      "Content": " my neice had a double mastectomy (sp) she had chemo and radiation, and has new boobs. My sister 64, called 2 wks ago and said she has breast cancer, having a lumpectomy this week, then will have radiation. My daughter is having a mammogram and ultrasound this week for a lump in her breast. Hoping it is just scare tissue from a very severe mastitise infection when she was nursing her daughter 13 yrs ago. Too much of these scares going on right now, as we are trying to care for my mom who fell and broke her hip 3 wks ago. I figure its better to be safe than sorry. They told my neice hers was normal, then found the cancer when she had a second opinion. \nso my brother made me promise to get a second opinion. \nYes we have a community health center, thats who im going through. I go to the doc tomorrow. And will request an ultrasound and biopsy, even if i have to pay for it. Better to be safe than sorry. My brother kind of scared me, telling me his daughter was told hers was neg. then found out it wasnt.\nThank you for talking to me. Trying to not say to much about\n it to my kids. So it is good to have someone to talk to. ",

      "Content": " I live in Oregon. The state program covers a mammogram, pap smear, things related to breast exams, and give me a physical. I go for the physical tomorrow. I am hoping if they find anything, they will put me on Oregon Health Plan, or or maybe medicaid. It took them a week to call me with the results of the mammogram. Gonna see if my moms doctor will see me, when we take her in on Thursday. Im not impressed with the care at the CHC. I will pay to have the biopsy, if i have to. I need to know! I have too much on my plate to have to deal with this unknown. I will let you know when i know more. \nThank you again, for you concern. Dont wait for them to call you, you need answers. If they dont do things like they should, go somewhere else. Im going to go to the other hospital for a biopsy. The tech. at the one i went to was so rude. \nPlease let me know what you find out. I will be praying for you. ",

      "Content": " The clinic called this am, i have a biopsy on the 19th at 1:00pm. But i have to pay for it, it isnt cheap, $2000. to $3000. But i figure it is a small price to pay, for my health. They will make payment arragements with me. too much cancer in my family to take a risk. Im also now borderline diabetic. Will bad news ever stop?!!\nThank you Bev. I will try to find a Womens Foundation between now and the biopsy. It would be awesome to find help for this. \nPoochi, let me know how things go with your visit.
