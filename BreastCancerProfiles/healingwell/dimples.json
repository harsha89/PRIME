      "Content": " Ok, my left foot has been bothering me lately(mostly the toes), so much so I was considering going to the foot doctor. I keep checking it out but there is nothing there! So, I still have numbness in my feet, but this is a deep bruise feeling. Anyway, I go to look for sneakers the other day and decide to get my foot measured. One of my feet is an entire size larger! I went up a whole size since pre-treatment days. No wonder my toes hurt! I haven't been able to feel them hitting my shoes! I'm just feeling the after math-they always feel strange so I didn't pay any attention. Has this happened to anyone else? It seems silly but I was always told there is no such thing as a coincidence and my feet we're nice and uniform before cancer! Anyway, crazy, silly things like this have always happened to me so in a way I feel like I'm getting back to normal. But, I'm still curious to know if this has happened to anyone else??? Let me know, I'd love suggestions on how to buy shoes-I have sooo many I hate to think of giving them all up. It's great that this is the only thing ailing me right now!!!! (smile)\nDimples ",

      "Content": " Hi chicken- I can really relate. For all intents and purposes I am cancer free as well but worry a good amount of the time. I waiver in and out but ever ache, pain or pinch I think cancer has overtaken my body and it will be the end shortly. I'm not really a pessimist and don't think like that all of the time but it's hard not to let it in. How do we stop this?? Any advice would be helpful. I feel you and you're not alone. I've always read that after the disease was gone was one of the toughest points. Crazy huh? We go through all of the nonsense and then after it's gone is the hardest? It's a crazy thing...\nShinko ",

      "Content": " Thank you so much for responding-didn't know if anyone would even read it cause it was just such an oddball thing. The feeling is very strange-there is deep down feeling but the numbness is kind of on the surface. My entire body, but especially my legs was big time swollen from the chemo and that has since passed. I lost 17lbs of water weight a couple months after treatment was complete! Crazy! I will talk to onc next time-is only a few weeks away. I'm dealing with surgeons and healing from that right now. Am doing so much better now though and everything is growing! I love it!\nThanks again,\nDimples ",

      "Content": " oh my goodness, my heart hurts and goes out to you and your family. I don't know where you are located but there seem to be many organizations across the country that help financially with supporting family members who don't have the means to stay in hotels, etc. Ask the hospital social worker in and if they are not helpful look for non-profit support groups in that area. I am in northeast Ohio and we have several support agencies that I know could help out in that situation. Perhaps places like these could also helpyour brother and his daughter-many of these places have programs for family as well as patients. Praying is helpful to me but if you are not a religious or spiritual person, seeking solice through friends and sometimes even nature can be very calming. Peace is what you ask for, healing is not always what we get but I think peace is the most helpful. I'm new to the messaging too. looking for something. I wish I could say something profound and helpful but I'm just a teacher who's surviving breast cancer looking for something as well. But, please know that I will be praying/thinking of you and your family-sometimes it just helps to get it all out, maybe that will be what helps you get through. Be strong and hopefully we will hear from you soon.\nShinko ",
