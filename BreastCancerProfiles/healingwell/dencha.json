I know that Xolair is meant for allergic asthma that is unresponsive to typical treatment.\nWhat did you do to control your asthma? Did the surgery solve the problem for you? My allergy/asthma doc gave me a script\n for the blood test last fall, but then I opted for the surgery, so I didn't go in that direction. I just don't know why my allergies are so bad.\nAnyway...hope all is well. Take care and thanks again, Janice, for your caring and concern.\nDenise ",

      "Content": " Hi Janice,\nActually, my breathing is finally better. Although I had a bad bout of allergic asthma (requiring antibiotic and sadly, prednosone), since then my asthma has improved markedly. I'm being really careful about\n pollen exposure...staying in most of the time. I am venturing out for some afternoon activities, and so far things have been good. \nThere is no doubt that the surgery has made a HUGE difference in the health of my lungs. The past four years or so, they were in a constant state of inflammation, with lots of wheezing and large amounts of mucous. Whenever I'd get an allergic challenge, or a respiratory virus, I'd be thrown into a terrible asthmatic cycle. \nAlso, I'd always cough and wheeze after a large meal--especially when I ate too late at night. The next morning, I'd always be coughing my guts out. No more of that, thankfully.\nI'm glad I had a good family doctor who kept nudging me towards the surgery. My asthma doctor also supported that route, and between the two of them, I finally found Healing Well, and got the courage to move forward.\nUnfortunately, because of my allergies, I'm still on some pretty powerful inhaled steroids. The treatment I've received with inhaled and oral steroids, have caused adrenal insufficiency, so I'm experiencing some health issues due to that. After the allergy season, my doctors are going to try really hard to get my steroid exposure way down. I've got the thinning skin/bruising/tearing tht comes with it. My arms are covered with ugly bruises that are usually reserved for the elderly. Right now I have the skin of a 90 year old. My arms seem to be affected the worst. They're really ugly and embarassing.\nI've been on allergy shots for probably close to 20 years. Although they help, they're not doing the job for me. I may end up trying the Xolair route, if I continue to struggle so much. My allergist is going to try to adjust my serum this winter. He hasn't been able to do it the past couple, because I've been in GERD related asthmatic challenges each time he was planning to try it.\nThanks, Janice, for your concern. You're very sweet.\nTake care, and best of luck with your surgery. \nDenise ",
