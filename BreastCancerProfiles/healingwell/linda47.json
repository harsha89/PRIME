      "Content": " Hello Chantry (what a wonderful name!)\nFrom all the research I did on this, there are really only 4 surgeries;you fall under one of the four. With the surgery I am having, a bi-lateral mastectomy, they must expand the skin so there is room for an implant. Because they are taking the whole breast, there is not enough skin left otherwise. They might have been able to do the 'tummytuck' procedure, if I had not just lost 26 pounds. Also if I was only having one breast removed.\nSo look into the options, talk to the doctor - he will probably have a surgery he prefers or recommends.\nGood luck - we all need it!\nLinda ",

My girlfriend had this same surgery that I am having; she had to go back into surgery a week after the mastectomy to have the tissue expander re-adjusted. Then six months in an expander 'poked' through the skin, so she was in the hospital to have that repaired...where she picked up an infection that had them removing the whole breast AGAIN. Sent her home for 6 months to heal before putting the expander in again. Now she is 'equal' and will go in in February to have the implants put in. No wonder I'm frightened and concerned. I just hope I have better luck than she does! That, or I hope my doctor has a great night sleep and is in a great mood when he does me!! ",
