Can either make it worse or actually initiate it when good bacteria balance is thrown off.\nInterestingly I also came across a number of papers that suggested that cancers may have strong links to fungal balance problems. The whole mechanics of the body really is a fairly delicate balance.\nLots of love to all in the forum and I'm thinking good thoughts for all. ",

      "Content": " My girlfriend has had extremely sore right breast, large red patch extending from niple downward. Nipple is a bit puffy. Two (very painful) mammograms and a thorough ultrasound have not shown anything. She did a 10 day course of antibiotics that threw her digestive system into a tailspin.\nThere is a family history of cancer. She is scheduled for a biopsy now but only by insisting with the doctors.\nI am very concerned but trying to be strong for her. Any thoughts on how I can best support her would be appreciated.\nAlso any ideas on what this could be? Please explain acronyms - I'm a guy who doesn't have any knowledge of this stuff.\nUpdate - pain so bad I'm thinking of taking her to emergency. Pretty scary.\n ",
