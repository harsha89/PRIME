    "Content": " I just also went through the same thing yesterday and had the core biopsy and now won't know results until probably Tuesday. Very stressful waiting, but everything I read is so conflicted. So I don't know whether to worry or not. These microcalsifications are in one breast and in a cluster, and doctor wanted to do an immediate ultrasound and biopsy. So here I am waiting. They put titanium inside the area they took out for the biopsy. Is this new? ",
