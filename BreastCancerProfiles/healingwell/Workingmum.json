    "Content": " Hi, just wondering if anyone can help answer a question......A couple of days ago while routinely checking my breasts i noticed a small lump, only the size of a bb near my nipple area. its very hard and doesn't hurt. I've been checking it daily for any changes but hasn't grown at all. Should i be worried? My mum died last year from breast cancer so its always on my mind. I'm in my early forties. Don't really want to see a doctor in case its nothing. ",
