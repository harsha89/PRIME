    "Content": " Hello,\nI went to the Doctor on April 13, 2005 for a regular mammogram and two days later I got a called telling me that I need to come back for another mammogram or possibly a U/S because they think they saw something that didn't look right on the images. I am kind of nervous but hopeful. No one in my immediate family have a history of cancer. So, do I still need to be concern? I am 45 years old and I don't know what to expect.\nHow should I handle this? Help ",
