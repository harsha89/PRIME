I got the reports and was TRYING to read them.. ha ha... saw one thing that someone might help me with...and that is a BIRADS score.. mine was a 4, with \"suspicious abnormality\"... what type of score is that? does it go to ten? I know my surgoen will answer, but was hoping for a few answers before I go.... thanks! ",

I got a two for one.. they found another smaller tumor underneath the ( and I quote) \"huge\" one.... he said they were both solid, and needed to come out. He also said he wasn't comfortable with some of the signs....\nnow, I know we can't determine anything from that, and the radiologist didn't want to discuss much else.. but I was wondering if any of you knew any of these answers...\nCould the smaller one have come from the larger one? like \"spread\" from the larger one? \nHe wants them both to come completely out and biopsied... does that mean he is more concerned of malignancy? And last question, can a radiologist tell? Or only the path reports from the biopsy? \nThanks again in advance! ",
