    "Content": " Two weeks ago I found a rather large lump in my left breast. It seemed to have a smaller lump on top of it and both appeared rather suddenly. I made an appointment and two weeks later, here I am. Doctor just told me yesterday that it does NOT seem like a cyst, it is too solid. She said, \"this could be cancer.\" Was really not expecting that. I have had fybrocystic breasts since my 20s and most cysts come and go, but this one is huge and not really painful. I am terrified. We had to fight to get a mammo scheduled for Monday. Most places were saying they could see me in a month. I want this taken care of now. :( it seems like I can move it around... I am so afraid... ",
