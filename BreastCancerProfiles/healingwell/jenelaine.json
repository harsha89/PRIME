      "Content": " Hi, I am 46 years old.  I went for my annual mammogram in October and they found 2 clusters of microcalcifications in my left breast that apparently were not there the last year (I know, I request the clinical reports) So they tell me to come back in 6 months (Which is next month, appointment is already scheduled). So far, it doesn't sound scary, right?  Tell me give you some of my history....\n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks so much for your quick replies!!! I am leaning towards having a biopsy done JUST so I can know for sure! I was relying on my GYN to furnish these radiologists for me and so far I don't like them.\nI have a very good internal medicine doctor who I think might steer me toward a radiologist that I might have faith in, I think I might ask him.\nThanks so much!!!\nJen\n ",
