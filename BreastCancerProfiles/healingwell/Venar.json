      "Content": " Hi! I'm new to this forum. \nabout\n a month ago I found a hard lump under my left armpit. After a week I saw a doctor. She gave me a 10 day stint of antibiotics. She told me to come back after two weeks for an ultrasound if not gone. Well, it's been three weeks and the lump is still there! It is much smaller now- it was quarter size, now pea size. I have a 2nd lump too but it\u2019s different though. The first is hard and solid while the 2nd lump is more of a swelling. I have a connective tissue disease so I am always sick. My doctor tends to brush me off because I have such generalized symptoms daily. She did take my lump seriously but that was because it was hard and large. I am worried she will not think anything of the second swollen place. I know my body though and it's not normal. I have had nipple discharge in both breasts since I was 27. I have no children. \nTwo years ago I found large lumps in my left breast. They did a mammogram and u/s but basically said my breast were too dense. They didn't see anything serious though. My left breast is much larger than my right - by a lot! Do I go to the follow up? I have just learned that if I go to the doctor too soon they stop helping me. I would appreciate any guidance. ",

      "Content": " I came back for the ultrasound with my doctor and I'm glad that I did. Though it's already 2 weeks beyond the scheduled one, knowing what my condition truly is lessened the anxiety. Thank God, the lumps are gone! I was just too impatient to see the result. You nana28 should go in for scheduled follow ups and tests because not learning the truth can be harmful to you, both physically and mentally. That happened to me. ",
