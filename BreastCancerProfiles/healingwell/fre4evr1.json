    "Content": " Hi I am new to this form. I need your help. I had a stereo-core needle biopsy. They had some difficulty getting to the site. The moment it was over I had a reddish bruise next to the injection site bandage. As the localized anesthetic wore off. It was burning from the inside. It burned leaving me with a second degree burn to the outside of my breast. Does anyone know how and why that happened? I have to have the other breast done and I'm afraid this may happen again. Please let me know if there is anyone else who has experienced this.\nThanks,\nPermanent scar ",
