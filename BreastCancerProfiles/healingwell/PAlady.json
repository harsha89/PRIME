      "Content": " Hi,\nI spend my time over in the chronic pain forum, but my cousin was just diagnosed with breast cancer so I thought I'd start a thread for her (and myself) to see what experience some of you may have had with the procedure she's considering.\nThey have found two small lumps in one breast, she was told it's an aggressive cancer, so she'll likely be having surgery within the next week or two. I'm sure many of you can relate to having to make a lot of serious decisions quickly. One thing she's considering is having breast reduction surgery, and her surgeon said she does a procedure together with the plastic surgeon where the reduction on both breasts is done after the lumpectomy (both surgeons are in the operating room at the same time). She knows she'll need radiation after the lumpectomy, and possibly chemo. She's still undergoing tests so the surgeon knows everything she's dealing with, but so far it appears localized to these 2 small lumps.\nI did a little research and found the procedure is called Oncoplastic Surgery. Have any of you had this - a breast reduction along with your lumpectomy? If so, I wondered what your experience was, or if you have any suggestions for my cousin. She may be reading responses, and she's got a lot on her plate to consider in a short amount of time, so I'd appreciate it if you could keep that in mind as you respond.\nThanks!\nPaLady ",

      "Content": " Jane,\nThanks so much for your response. It's great that you had such a positive experience, and that your lymph nodes were clear! I've had friends who have had breast cancer, but none have had this kind of surgery (with both onc. & plastic surg. in OR together). My cousin just learned of her diagnosis last week, and the reduction was the one thing she was unsure about\n. I sent her some info. I found from NY Presby. hospital and it was enough for her to feel comfortable making that decision. I'm trying not to overwhelm her with info. right now, as I'm sure all of you here know how many decisions need to be made in a short amount of time. I do plan to tell her about\n HW and link her to this thread, and let her read it if she wants. After surgery, I suspect having the support (although she has many supportive friends and family, including too many who have had BC) of places like HW may be helpful as you can always learn more. Or find a place to vent feelings and fears and anger and grief and just about\n everything - like I do over on the CP forum.\nYep, I'm in PA., but in the other corner of the state - in NW PA. near Erie. It seems every time I \"meet\" someone on here from PA they're from the Philly area. The state must be leaning with all the people you have over there! LOL\nThanks again for responding. And good luck with your radiation!\nPaLady\np.s. Love the quote in your signature. \n ",
