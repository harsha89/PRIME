You should feel satisfied that all of your questions were appropriately addressed when you leave the office. If you're not comfortable with your doctor, you can always get a second opinion. \nI think that it's great though that there was nothing that was suspicious for malignancy on your mammogram. That's wonderful! Please though--tell your doctor about\n the lump on your collarbone. It's better to have peace of mind, than to stress and worry. ",
