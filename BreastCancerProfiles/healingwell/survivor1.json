    "Content": " I'm a 3yr. cancer survivor but today I fear I have IBC. I will call the doctor tomorrow. It started as a small pimple (I thought) in my surgical incision. Now 2 weeks later I have all the symptoms of IBC. I've never heard of this type of cancer until I started researching my symptoms. Of all the research I've done, this is the only web site that I have seen hope. Thank you for giving me a better outlook. ",
