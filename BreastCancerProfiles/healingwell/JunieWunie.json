YAY!\nI just got an email from a friend of ours who knows two women who lost weight AFTER getting done with tamoxifen. She said that one woman that she knows, didn't exercise or diet. The weight just melted off. I also found out that I have been on Tamoxifen since Sept. of 2003. SO, I have a little over 2 more years to go.\nI have to get moving. I have a treadmill, eliptical machine, stationary bike and power rider. I have not been in great health this year. Sinus infection, skin problems and intestinal problems.\nI asked my doc if people who have had chemo+treatments for cancer..are their immune systems shot or what? I've seen her so much this year it's ridiculous!\nWish I knew what vitamins to take to get healthy and stay that way!\nJunie Bugie ",

JunieWunie here again.  I've been having weird skin problems  I finished all treatments in 2003.  I had to see a dermatologist for little blisters that have been showing up. They have blood and a clear fluid in them (boils they think). When I pop them (ITCHY!), a pockmark is left with itchy scabs. They are a royal drag. I also have super dry skin over my mastecomy site.  Anyone have such things happening? ",

Chemo, radiation and herceptin followed. I've been on tamoxifen for a little over two years. I was told that I would be getting something different soon. I can't remember the name of the drug tho. I had a period back in January and was told I can't start the new drug till I go a year without a period. I think that's what was said. My memory is so bad (lack of estrogen). I'm doing ok.
