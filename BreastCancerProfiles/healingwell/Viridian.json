    "Content": " Had my last Taxotere treatment for TNBC in April 2012. Was not told that my hair might not grow back. I now have Alopecia total from talking this drug. Have not found anyone getting over it if it does not grow back pretty quickly. \nThe estimated percentage of women that their hair never grows back is 8 to 10 percent. A terrible situation. This is the worse part......Doctors do not have a clue as to why this happens. Even today in 2014 I have not found a solution. I wear a wig everyday. ",
