He and Katie [fiance soon to be wife] have already invited me to move to Seattle so I can be near them. Makes me feel better even if I never do move - at least I am invited. Now maybe when they do make me a 'grandma' I will move:> Their plan is 5 years!\nI appreciate the internet so much - for years I have used it for research - especially in graduate school - now it has become a blessing that I am not walking through this alone. \nThanks to each and every one of you for responding and being so kind. I hope that I am able to help others also.\nPam ",

He has grown into a great young man and he is marrying a wonderful young lady but I am going to miss him terribly. I appreciate your empathy. \nI shopped for an outfit to wear to the wedding today - drove around for an hour at the mall for a parking place and then Dillard's had nothing [i am round from the 5 months of steroids] finally found something at Avenue - now I am exhausted. Still have to find another outfit for the family dinner - that will have to wait a few days:>\nI am also thankful to hear from you - that you are still here after being diagnosed 'a long time ago'. I am continually amazed at how strong women we are and that we prove those doctors wrong!\nBlessings.\nPam ",
