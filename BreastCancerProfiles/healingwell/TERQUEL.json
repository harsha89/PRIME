    "Content": " First of all I want to say that I'm new to this Forum and I'm happy I happened to fine it. I am 52 yrs old and had my annual mammogram 2 weeks ago and I got a call from my OBGYN's office wanting me to get a second mammogram and ultrasound on my left breast only. I have very dense breast tissue and in 2006 had a biopsy done on my right side and the test results came back negative. Yesterday was the1st time I ever had an ultrasound and I'm nervous, worried and scared. I also want to mention that I have a mammogram done every year since 2006 and never missed an appointment. Anyhow the radiologist found something behind my left nipple yesterday and now I'm waiting to get a call from my Dr. How long does it take to get results? Also the technician asked me if I have felt any pain on my left breast which I replied \"no\" not until today. Having the mammogram before ultrasound hurt like heck she pressed down extra hard to get a better imagine of the nipple area...OUCH!! Is there usually pain associated with cancer in the breast? Its going to be a long weekend if I don't hear anything today. ",
