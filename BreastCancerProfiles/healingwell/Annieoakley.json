    "Content": " I notice a few days ago the pain in my left breast and I really didn't think anything of it then today the pain was more noticeable and I felt where the pain was and there was a lump and not a small one it was really noticeable I even got my husband to feel it and he said yes that he felt it too. I know this is a dumb question but for breast cancer is the lump suppose to be sore? this is all new to me and I thought I'd come here and ask you all.\n \n \n \n ",
