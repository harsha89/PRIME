Thank goodness they were ok.\nI know it was not the smartest thing to do but my husband and I went dancing when I still had the staples in my incision! Very carefully of course.

      "Content": " Lisa, I am so sorry you have to go through this. I was dxd in 2012. It was a fast growing cancer that was in 3 spots in one breast. I had a mastectomy and chemo and also one year of herceptin treatments.\nI lost my hair and eyebrows but came through the treatments pretty good. I tried to keep a very positive attitude.\nAfter all the treatments I began to wish I had had a double mastectomy. No one had brought this up to me before my first surgery. I was HER2 positive which is aggressive.\nI decided to have a second mastectomy, which I had this past March. I am very happy I made this decision. I also decided against reconstruction surgery and my husband supported my decision.\nI know waiting is the worse part and then the unknown about\n how the treatments are going to be. The oncology nurses were so wonderful that they made the time at infusion easier.\nThinking of you in July!\n \n. ",

      "Content": " Hi livenlaugh. Your name sounds familiar. I'm usually on the fibro site. Maybe that's where I know you from.\nI had my first mastectomy in 2012 and I was sacred to death. So many unknowns at that time. My recovery was not too bad. I took the pain meds as directed and just took it easy. I did use extra pillows in the bed and in the lounge chair. My husband was a big help. I stocked up on lots of stuff to read and my sudoku puzzles. I also stocked up on TV dinners (which we never had before) and a lot of easy to fix food.\nStrangely my fibromyalgia wasn't any worse. Maybe because of the pain meds. I did have chemo and a year of Herceptin infusion because I was HER2 positive. This was after a biopsy of the removed breast. I did not know what any of this meant until after surgery when I did lots of computer research.\nI am cancer free now. I did have the second mastectomy earlier this year. Not because of cancer but because of symmetry issues. My remaining breast was heavier than the breast form I used on the other side and I was always uneven. Also my shoulder hurt from the bra strap on the remaining breast side. I recovered fine from this surgery too although I had a little more pain from the drains this time but nothing unbearable.\nI dealt with the surgeries kind of like I deal with fibro. I tried to keep busy and slowly increased my activity level. I also tried to keep very positive. I had one small cry in the beginning and then just planned on what I was going to do to get well.\nGood luck to you. I know it is so difficult just waiting. That was the worse part for me.\n \n. ",

They measured me and figured out what size bras and implants to use.\nTo be honest I love going braless most of the time.

      "Content": " Hi Englishtea.\nI'm visiting here for the first time. I'm usually on over at fibromyalgia. I go Thursday after a 2 week wait for a stereotactic biopsy and ultrasound guided biopsy, 3 spots on 1 breast. I waited 3 weeks for the call back mammogram and ultrasound. I'm going a little nuts just waiting. My doctor sent me the report and it said something was \"suggestive of DCIS\". I had never heard of this but have been spending my days researching BC and I know now what it is.\nI am nervous about\n Thursday for many reasons, but it is very hard for we fibromites to be still for too long. Our muscles tighten up. The nurse told me to plan for for at least 3 hours. Stress really affects how we feel and believe me, I'm stressed! And of course, no NSAIDS for a week before the procedure. This has my arthritis flaring too.\nI've tried to keep busy, even been baking homemade bread and trying new recipes. I've tried to be very positive too. I know a lot of these things are benign. I won't know the results until at least next Monday afternoon.\n \n. ",
