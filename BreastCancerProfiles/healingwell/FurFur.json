    "Content": " Hey everyone~ Hope everyone is doing well!! I have recently been diagnosed with having 2 radial scars in my right breast. I went to have a 6mnth follow-up mamm.on Dec 3rd- my birthday! I didn't think anything would come of it- it was just supposed to be a follow-up, where everything was gonna be just fine...NOT! I was there for 2 hours. I knew something was up. I was informed that they found 2 lumps and they wanted to do core needle biopsies on both of them. They did that on Dec. 14. I got the results quite quickly. The procedure was on a Friday and by Monday afternoon, I got the call. The raidiologist said it wasn't cancer and then proceeded to say what it was.... I didn't hear much after \"It's not cancer\", except that she thought I should still be seen by a surgeon. I met with the surgeon on Dec 26th. He is a very nice man. He explained a lot to me and after his examination, he concurred that they are radial scars and should be removed. I am now waiting for my surgery to be scheduled sometime in the middle of Jan. The only question that hasn't been answered is: How did I get them??? I am now 36 years old, never have had any breast trauma, no implants, no biopsies before this, nothing!!! Where did they come from? If anyone has any info on this I would greatly appreciate some incite. Thanks :) ",
