    "Content": " I am old(er)!!! 54!!! Anyway - I've been getting routine mammograms since I was 40 - and today I had my annual one. They called me later today and told me to come back in tomorrow so that they can take more pics of one breast. The woman mentioned 'calcification'. At any rate --- I am a mess --- and scared! Reading this thread helped quite a bit --- I just hope it is 'nothing'!!!\nThanks for listening! ",
