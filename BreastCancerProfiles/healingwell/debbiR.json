This is NOT something to fool around with. I am sure that you will have a difficult time getting her to see a dr if she is a strong believer in alternative medicine. You might remind her that Suzanne Sommers was a strong believer in alternative med and attempted to treat her bc that way. She finally went to a medical dr and received treatments. This is very serious. Hopefully it will turn out to be nothing but....She is very lucky to have you as a friend. \nPlease let us know what happens and come back if you need some more advice or support. ",

The one thing that everyone seemed to find that helped was making sure that advil or whatever form you use, was taken at least one hour before the shot was given as well as continuing every 4-6 hrs. One individual said that they used the advil arthritis med and it helped. I would check w/ your onco and see what he/she thinks. Try a nice hot bath w/ some good bath salts. That should help relieve some of the aches. Call your onco today and tell them the side effects that you have been experiencing and have them call in a prescript\nion for nausea meds and something for the pain. My onco made sure that I had all of the needed meds before first chemo.\n \n \n ",

There is a chance that one of the premeds, if it is a steriod, might cause you not to sleep very much the first night. Why not give yourself this first treatment and see how your body reacts. Don't put unnecessary pressure on yourself. If you feel good the next day, then work but if you don't, then give yourself the option of staying home. Your reaction to the remainder of your treatments will probably be the same as this first one. Remember, you need to be careful of being around large groups of people.

As the others have said, HAVE THE BIOPSY! I am surprised that your dr didn't order it right away. Call tomorrow and get an appt as soon as possible. Don't let them put you off for 3 or 4 weeks by saying that it isn't something that can't wait. You won't rest easy until you have an answer and that is reason enough to get them to do it asap. Remember, YOU are your own best health advocate. \n \n \n \n ",

I saw my onco 2 weeks after my mastectomy, so there was a healing time of 4 weeks. Actually, she wanted to start it w/in 3 weeks but my daughter was getting married and I didn't want to take any chances of not feeling well. As someone said, your onco may want you to have a whole set of scans..PET, bone scan, muga, bloodwork, etc. This can take up to a week or more. Once those results are back, then a time will be set for your chemo to begin. Also, if you don't have a port, please ask your surgeon about\n getting one put in. \n \n \n \n \n ",

I don't know who made the rule about\n the age a mammogram should first be done on a woman. It could have been the NHI or ACS or insurance companies. There are many insurance companies that will not pay for a mammogram on a young woman unless ordered by her physician. You are absolutely correct when you say that age does NOT matter. When I talk w/ an individual or speak before a group, I always stress the importance of SBE as well as a mammogram. Esp if there is a family history. The sooner one has a base mammo the better. My dd had to fight and eventually go to an ER to get a mammo. Even though there is a long history of bc in our family. Keep fighting for yourself and others!\n \n \n ",

Our dream has been to \nopen a house for anyone in Central Missouri that is diagnosed w/ bc. We have worked very hard to raise monies. Had numerous fundraisers (some worked well...other ideas needed to be flushed..lol) In August we found \"the house\". It is over 100 years old and is perfect! Well, now it is after we have completely remodeled it..including having to have all the wiring redone before it would pass inspection. One of our biggest fundraisers has been our Mother's Day 5K Walk/Run. This year we will have over 200 participants. But the most exciting thing is that the Race will begin and end at our Community Breast Cancer House! I am putting the link to our site below. It will give you all an idea of what our organization is about\n. Hopefully next week I will be able to post some pictures.\n \n \n \n ",

Many people the age of your mil grew up to believe that they aren't to question drs or say no. (my mother is one of them) Have her write down all of her questions to take w/ her.

Write down all of the questions that you might have (no matter how silly or small they may seem) and take them w/ you to your appt. The tape recorder is one of the best ideas. You will be given so much info and, as each of us can attest, you will remember little of what you are told.

I have had friends that have had a port put in after surgery and it is a fairly simple procedure. You can't knock it out or move it as it is put in under the skin and sutured there.

Thank heavens I was able to use chemo as an excuse for the way that it looked. It finally grew enough that my beautician could cut it and shape it. (still very, very short). Okay, so I am at the store looking for some type of hand lotion for dry skin. My hands are like sand paper. Usually I buy $1 jar of Dollar General lotion but I decided to go \"name brand\" this time. Finally I decide on a product by Oil of Olay. The tube read...\"For Dry Skin...Revitalizes and Moisturizes\". It felt good so I bought it. This was on Saturday. On Monday I panicked because the palms of my hands were a yellow colors. I immediately jumped out of bed and looked at my eyes. Hmmm, no yellow there so guess that my kidneys weren't failing. I wait on calling my onco in a panic! When I washed my hands, I noticed that whatever was on them was coming off. After much thinking (which can be time consuming and difficult w/ chemo brain) I decided to check the lotion that I had purchased. On the back of the tube, in very, very small black letters it said...\"this will bring your skin the tone it has missed after summer\". The darn stuff was a TANNING LOTION! So now I have yellow-orange hands and feet. When I had chemo yesterday my nurse was looking at me funny. I finally asked her if there was something wrong. She was wondering what was wrong w/ my hands. Rofl. Everyone enjoyed my mess, once again. BTW...I did take the tube of lotion back to the store and got a full refund. Guess that I will stick w/ Dollar General brand. At least I won't turn orange!\n \nDeb\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks for the kind words. When I was first diagnosed w/ bc 5 yrs ago, I had been working for a private company for over a yr. I was working 39 1/2 hrs a week. Promised for 6 mos that I would be \"fulltime\" w/ a newly created position. Now, I have no choice but to stay w/ medicaid as no other insurance co will cover me. I have been in touch w/ Cancercare. They put me in touch w/ a group called PSI (Patient Service, Inc). They are going to pay my spenddown beginning in January. I placed a call to my onco and hopefully she will cb tomorrow. My first 2 chemo treatments were in the hospital. I can't walk in there w/out getting sick to my stomach. My grandson was born there in June and the min I walked thru the front door I headed straight for the nearest restroom. Associate the smell w/ the chemo. I also talked w/ an attorney today. He said that if they refuse to allow me to make payments for the spenddown amt, that is discrimination as they allow those that have private insurance to make payment arrangements. I don't know if I will file a lawsuit if I can't get this worked out but I am thinking about\n it. I also talked to my surgeon and got the name of an onco here where I live. I called and the earliest that I can get an appt is 12-23. NOT! I am going to have my surgeon, manipulative therapist, bil (who is an obgyn) and anyone else I can think of to call and get me an earlier appt. It is the almighty dollar now that is more impt than the patient. Whether it is in an ER or a drs office. Maybe I shouldn't be so old. I can remember when a dr would make a house call to see a patient that was sick. Oh well. Deep breath (many of them) taken and going to bed!              \n \n ",

      "Content": " It seems like every Christmas there is someone that gives a really strange gift. This year it was my mother's gifts that she gave. My dd and sil just built a new home this spring. It is in a subdivision that has NO trees. In fact, they just sodded their front lawn and seeded their back lawn this fall. So what does my mother give to my preppy sil? A gadget that she ordered from QVC (she is a QVC junkie) that picks up leaves out of the yard. Then she give him this camouflage ball hat that you put batteries in the front and there is a light. He does NOT hunt and does NOT ever wear anything that is camouflage. Now this hat, when you turn the light on, you have to push on the light, which is right where the batteries are, which in turn leaves a big red spot on your head. We all laughed until we cried but of course my dear mother didn't realize that we were laughing at the gifts. You can imagine what the rest of us received.\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hello Donna! I know how frightened you are about\n a recurrance. We all live w/ that fear daily. Even if it is in the back of our mind. I can tell you from personal experience that when I was told 2 yrs ago that my CEA had climbed from 12-29 I was scared to death. I think that I was more in shock than when I received my original diagnosis. Like you, I had only been out of treatment about\n 18 months. I can remember my onco calling and telling me that I had to come immediately for a bone marrow. When the results came back negative, I cried w/ relief. Then I went thru the CT scan, MRI, etc. Each came back negative and each time I fell apart. Finally I had PET scan and it was positive. I was so frightened but yet relieved to know that the spot had been found. I also was relieved to know that it was treatable. As my onco told me she believed that we could be this but she couldn't assure me that it wouldn't show up someplace else later. I looked at her and said that all I wanted to do was beat this one and I would deal w/ later when it happened. She couldn't promise me that I wouldn't walk out of her office and get hit by a truck so my odds sounded pretty good. Just try and remember all of the new treatments that are out there. Several have shown positive results that I was a part of the clinical study 5 yrs ago. Don't be afraid to post how you feel. We are here for you. \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Said that they sent her home w/ a pain pump and it seems to be doing the job right now. They did the sentinal node on the right arm and found one lymph node involved. Didn't do one on the left side. She will post as she feels up to it. I do believe that her dh is going to attempt to keep her under control but that may be a difficult assignment. lol\n \n \n ",

I am sick of the office staff denying me the right to pay my spenddown on a monthly basis. The billing office told me that I could make payment arrangments, which I did. Now this little know it all...hmmmm, what word can I type to describe her?...calls me this morning and tells me that I can't have chemo until I pay the $200 up front. Now where the heck am I to get that kind of money? I have an organization that will be paying my spenddown starting in Jan but they won't accept that. I am soooo sick and tired of fighting all of the bureaucracy. I wonder if it is even worth continuing treatments? I have been w/ my onco for over 5 yrs and this is the way that they treat their patients! I am going to start getting my state retirement in Jan. It will only be 175 a month but that ups my spenddown from $200 to $409. Is it worth it? Maybe our wonderful governor should have to live as some of us are in Missouri. I pray to God that I don't meet him on the street or in the capitol. Just needed to let off steam. Think all of the tears have dried up.

It has completely different side effects than the A/C. Yes, your eye lashes and eye brows will get thinner but they grow back. Talk to your onco BEFORE you begin the taxol and get meds for muscle cramps. Don't let him tell you that there isn't anything because there is. The muscle aches may remind you of having the flu or that a mack truck hit you. Take hot baths w/ bath salts that help w/ muscle aches. Sometimes I took 2 or 3 during the night.

As I am sure you are aware, the arm will get very large. If you get lymphodema, then usually you have to wear a sleeve 24/7. There is no way for the fluid to drain if there is an infection. That is why we are told to be sure and wear a glove if doing garden work and keep the arm covered when out in the sun. I was also told to be careful w/ manicures and getting any scratches or bites on the arm. As for the lifiting, my onco told me 10lbs. If your onco is not concerned, then take it upon yourself to get the documentation you need. I can't believe that he hasn't warned you about\n this.\n \n \n ",

Maybe you could try and eat a little something before you use the mouthwash...jello, pudding..to just have something in your stomach. I had horrid muscle aches when I was on the taxol. WalMart has a product called \"batheraphy\". It is really inexpensive and works great. Just fill that tub w/ hot water and dump a couple of packets in as the tub is filling.

This \"jerk\" does not have a valid drivers license because of numerous reasons, including having the wreck that paralazyed him from the waist down (drinking, drugs, driving unregisteresd vehicle, no insurance, stolen plates the day he was released after serving 90 days in jail for driving w/out a license.) My 2 oldest granddaughters (5 & 10) were camping. Who brings them home but the \"jerk\". He had a stick that he used for the brake and gas. Drove them 45 miles, winding 2-lane road. I was furious but, and anyone that knows me won't believe this...kept my mouth shut. I got the girls into the house. Then I called the local police, gave them his license # of the car and left the rest in God's hands. Jo-Ann, we just might have to come and visit and have some teenytinytown adventures!\nPlease keep those prayers coming! \nDeb\n \n ",

This is the only bad side effect that I have found w/ the herceptin. Sometimes they are so bad they also will wake me up from a sound sleep. I also get spasms/cramps in my feet, the small of my back. chest area where I had the mastectomy and sometimes my neck. I have meds that I got from my oncologist and manipulative therapist just for that problem. Sometimes a hot bath or a heating pad helps. Also a massage helps, even though it hurts. lol Please ask your onco for some meds. I can give you the name of the ones that I am on if you would like.\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi Donna! I hated the radiation. Not the treatment itself. It actually took longer to get undressed and into the gown that it did to have the treatment itself. My problems came after the treatments were completed. I was burned badly and my rad onco didn't do anything to help. I finally had to go to my onco and she helped me. That was the only time that I had to take pain meds. I used the powder w/ cornstarch also. But the one thing that seemed to help more than anything was a gel pack. They are small and can be reused. You put them in the fridge and then when your skin feels hot or uncomfortable, you just place them on that particular area. Towards the end of my treatments I went to the ER and got more as my rad onco didn't have any. I also was tired and would take a nap afterwards. My skin in the chest area and on my neck looked like I had a good tan for several years. As for the scar tissue, that does happen. I am fortunate enough to have a manipulative therapist that can loosen the tissue when it begins to hurt. The main thing is just keep an eye on your skin. Treat it carefully. And as someone else said, listen to your body.\n \n \n \n ",

First, if your gut feeling is telling you that there is something wrong, then go with it. Don't let the receptionist make you feel that you are bothering her. Who the heck is she anyway? You help to pay her salary. I would suggest that you get copies of all of your films and reports and get a 2nd opinion. If your dr doesn't like this idea, then I would really begin to question his qualifications and dedication to your health. I wonder if this physician would be as relaxed if you were his wife, sister, daughter or mother? I seriously doubt it. One thing each of us here at this board has learned is that we have to be proactive when it come to our healthcare. We have to sometimes force a dr to listen to us or take the time to answer our questions. As one dr told me, you pay my salary. If I don't take the time to listen or answer your quetions, remind me that I am your employee. I never did have to remind her!\n \n \n \n \n ",

(ages 26 and 30) I wish that I had some answers for you right now, but as Lori said, you just don't have enough info. Call and get a copy of your reports. Do you think that if you went in and spoke personally with your obgyn that she would give you more info? If so, call and tell them that it is imperative that you see her today. Or what about\n your family physician? The waiting is horrid. I am so sorry. about\n the only advice that I can give you is to try and stay as busy as possible until you either talk with one of your physicians or see the surgeon. When you do go to the appointment, please be sure and take someone w/ you. You will be given lots of info and trust me, you won't remember most of it. Also, if you have a small tape recorder, take that w/ you. You might also want to get a notebook and write down all of the questions that you think of between now and your appointment. Make sure that you get answers to them. We all know what you are going through, so please don't hesitate to come back here and post. We will be w/ you through this journey.

I talked to my chemo nurse about\n it on Tues but I really didn't have any symptoms other than a small cough and a runny nose. No temp. Blood counts were all fine so I had my chemo. She told me the standard alert\ns...call if I had a temp, chills, etc. As this week has progressed, the cough got worse but no temp. I took Ibuprofin 800 and it took away any little aches that I had. Well, I noticed yesterday that I was having more problems breathing and my cough was worse but we have had a change in the weather here in Mo...RAIN FOR 24 HRS...FIRST IN 3 MOS! So I attributed my breathing difficulties to the damp humidity. Tonite I finally decided that I needed to go to the ER. I requested a chest xray and I have pneumonia. So, please be aware that a small cold can turn quickly into something bigger. If you get a cough, get it checked out or call your onco and get on an antibotic. Dumb thing is that I had the antibotic in my med cabinet and didn't take it. The ER dr said that he had seen several patients that were presently on chemo that had pneumonia. \n \n \n \n ",

The 3 girls are very anxious for mommy to get home and I have to admit that I am too. lol They were suppose to have done surgery to remove her gallbladder on Mon but, once again, the wonderful staff at the hospital screwed up and it didn't get scheduled. I had chemo on Tues. When I arrived at the office (30 miles from home) there was a message that she was having surgery some time that day. My nurses and the lab were fantastic. They got my chemos ready and I was back at the hospital w/ Cari by 11:00. (I had arrived for chemo at 9:45 and had to see my onco) When I got to the hospital, my dd told me that the surgery was scheduled for 1:00 or 1:30. 5 mins later a nurse comes in to take her to surgery. grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I swear that this hospital needs to be audited or shut down. The surgery went fine. The surgeon was a guy that I dated in hs. She was able to eat something and keep it down on Tues for the first time in 11 days. \n \n \n \n ",

I also had a mastectomy, 21 lymph nodes removed (19 positive) 4 rounds of a/c followed by 12 weekly taxol treatments and 36 rads. My CEA jumped from 12 to 29 in a 3 month period. (I was continuing to go every 3 months for checkups rather than every 6). I was in total shock. Same bc cell but a small spot on the sacrum. I am now on weekly regime of Herceptin and Navelbine. Every 3 weeks I get something to help strengthen my bones. (can't remember the name of it) The Herceptin has been proven to help keep the bc from recurring. My CEA counts now are between 2.8 and 3.0.

I am surprised that your onco hasn't given you any meds to help counteract this. grrrrrrrrrrrr Hopefully you will see some improvement as time passes. My onco was very aware of this problem and if I was really having difficulty or pain, she would stop the chemo for a week or two, and still does today. This gives my system a chance to recover somewhat. I am on a new med and it is working great. In fact, when I saw her on Tues, she told me that this med she prescribed was just now being used for neuropathy symptoms and was delighted to hear that it was working so well. I have found that putting a pillow or blanket between my knees helps my legs when I go to bed. If I am really uncomfortable, I do one of two things...get up and soak in a hot bath or take an ibuprofin 800. It just helps to relax me. I wasn't able to take the tamoxifan so I am no help to your there. But I know that there are several ladies that have been on it and are presently taking it. I'm sure that they will share their experiences with you.\n \n \n \n ",

I take herceptin and navelbine weekly and had thought that those symptoms were from the navelbine. But, my onco gives me a break from the navelbine when the neuropathy is bad, and I discovered that I ached more after the herceptin than usual. Normally, a hot bath in w/ some bath salts and an ibuprofin 800 will help the aches.  I have a pretty high pain threshold, but there are times when my knees hurt so much that I have to take a tylenol 3. Don't hesitate to ask your onco for pain meds. My onco is a big believer that none of her patients need to suffer from pain. Do your chemo nurses give you ibuprofin before your treatment? I always have to take one. If they don't, then take one before you leave for treatment and then take one after you get home. Get a jump on it...just like you would if you had the flu. I have my treatments every Tues, and there are times that I think I just can't go anymore. I don't want to sit in that chair and be hooked up to those darn drugs. But, I know that it is keeping my cancer in check and it is worth it. I have to be honest and tell you that there have been a couple of times that I have called on Tues morning and told them that I wasn't coming in. I needed a \"mental health break\".

We now have approximately 30 members - physicians, bc survivors, laywomen - and have had fundraisers to enable us to find a house. We are now NFP, which I discovered is a lot of hard work. To make this long story short, we have found our house. It is about\n 2 blocks from our state capitol in a historical district. The house was built in the late 1800's and is wonderful. The front yard and driveway are flat (which is unheard of in Jefferson City) so we can make a ramp for wheelchairs easily. The front doors are tall, old double doors. It is a 3 story house with 4 fireplaces! We have already been promised free labor by the different labor associations and unions. (pays to live in the capitol city) We have new furniture donated. All that is left to do is draw up the plan for remodeling and present it to the owners and get to work.\n \n \n \n \n ",

Yes, it is true that the treatments will help you continue to wear clothes but perhaps they should change places w/ you and see what it is like. My rad onco (whom I now detest) said something similar to me when I was going thru rads and I told him that I really didn't need his smart a** comments. I needed a straight, honest answer. And if he couldn't give it to me then I would go elsewhere and find someone that would. I also mentioned that I would file a report with the AMA and whatever other group could investigate him. His attitude did change after that for the better. As for families, we all encounter problems during treatment w/ them. They can't understand what we are going thru..emotionally or physically. I haven't asked my family for help since my original diagnosis in 2001. It doesn't hurt for you to let people know how you feel. Also, remember it also is good for you to let them know exactly what you need from them, if they offer to help.\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " I had my PET Scan on Monday. Had rescheduled it 2x. Always had a good excuse but knew that I had to have it done. You would think that having one every 3 mos I wouldn't mind but I do! Anyway, the good news is that there is no new cancer anywhere. The spot on my sacrum is no larger but no smaller. So things are stable at this time. My tumor tag tests are all still ok. So, I will continue on the weekly chemo regiment that I am on now. I don't know about\n the rest of you, but I am so tired of thinking that each new ache or pain is a new area of mets. I dispise having to have all of these scans and tests run every 3 mos but relieved when I get the results. Oh well, the world of being a cancer survivor!\n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi! First, don't feel that you are by yourself in what you have been feeling and experiencing. We have all been there. Please start the meds that your onco prescribed. Trust us when we say that they work. Once you get them into your system, you will find that your sleeping will improve as well as your emotions. Some of the emotional ups and downs that you are experiencing are from your chemo and surgery. Don't be afraid to cry or yell or scream or throw something. (the shower or car's a great place to do this) \n Have you asked your onco for something to help you sleep? I am surprised that he/she hasn't already given a prescript\nion for this. I take ambien when I am having problems sleeping. I don't take them every night. Remember that your body has been through a great deal in the past few months. Don't be ashamed to rest. It is what you need to help heal both emotionally and physically. If you think that you are leaning on your fiance too much, then why not ask him? I am sure that he will tell you that you aren't but by asking this might relieve some of the tension that you are feeling. Let the ones that care about\n you help. Also remember, you need to tell your family and friends what you need. They won't be able to know otherwise. \n \n \n \n \n ",

You wouldn't believe all of the nails, including concrete nails, and hammers that I have ruined before I figured out that I needed a drill.

I worried about\n every little ache and pain. As everyone has said, as time passes, there will be days that you won't even think about\n the cancer and there may be days (esp when you hurt) that it totally takes over your thoughts. But, don't be afraid to cry or yell or feel sorry for yourself. It's ok. I have had back and shoulder pain since my radiation. Just one of the little gifts that it leaves with you. I have also found that it is very easy for me to have a rib out of place. Thank heavens for my manipulative therapist. \n \n \n ",

I was extremely tired. The night after chemo I usually didn't sleep as the premeds kept me awake. I didn't have mouth sores. I would stop at McDonald's on the way to chemo and have a sausage biscuit and a diet coke to eat on the way. My taste buds did change. I had to find a different brand of toothpaste other than the one that I had used for years. I cooked everything w/ onion in it. I found out that if I used plastic forks and spoons I didn't get the metal taste. I also didn't drink anything that was in a can...soda, juice, etc. I was very careful not to be around anyone w/ a cold or the flu if possible and avoided crowds. My family and friends were more careful usually than I was. Chemo is very doable. It reacts differently in each person. Just remember that there are meds to help counteract everything.\n \n \n ",

Today both the House and Senate passed legislation that makes deep, deep cuts into the Medicaid/Medicare program. In fact, at this moment, I am wondering how my treatments are going to be paid.(almost $10,000.00 weekly) When I was first diagnosed I had no insurance (I was working 39 1/2 hrs a wk..supp to go full time for 3 mos) so I qualified for medicaid. After treatments, I went back to work. Then when I was rediagnosed with mets to the bones, I qualified for full disability. But still not old enough to qualify for Medicare. My employer fired me once I had the diagnosis. I couldn't go after him because he had less than 15 full time employees. Now, thanks to this ignorant, silverspoon fed, daddy's boy (daddy was Mo Sec of State and now is in Congress) I may not be able to continue with my treatments. He has cut hospice care, oxygen, hearing aids, prothestics, wheelchairs, eye and dental as well as lowered the income you can make from $900 a month to $500. I'm not sure what I am going to do. I testified before both the House and Senate committees (what a joke since the repub have the majority and our gov is repub) along with about 300 others. Tonite I have allowed myself to cry but tomorrow I am going to seek an attorney and start a class action suit to see if this can be stopped. Thanks for letting me vent. If there is anyone on the boards from Mo, please let me know.\n \n \n \n ",

She is rather shocked to find out that she just stepped on me one time to many and now can't act as though nothing happened. I have to tell you the one thing that has really irritated my ds and db. I was so angry at my sibilings and mom that I told my dds and best friend that when I died (and I am not planning on doing so anytime soon) that I did NOT want my mom, db, ds, or bil at the funeral home or cemetary. That if they couldn't show love and concern when I was alive then I didn't want them making a big show after I was dead. Well, my best friend got cornered by my ds. After listening to my ds ***** about having to take care of mom (all of 2 weeks) she said that she was sure I was upset by what they had done. My friend told her that I wasn't, in fact, I was relieved to have the stress removed and then preceded to tell her what I said about the funeral home. I wish that I could have seen her face because it evidently shocked her. rofl \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

Don't worry. Excuseeeeee meeeeee. The kids are barking like seals and coughing. Having problems breathing. Thank heavens I have a personal friend that is a dr. She immediately got a breathing machine for treatments, antibotics for pneumonia. I have to agree that it doesn't take a rocket scientest to know if a child has pneumonia. And we wonder why our insurance costs are so high. Too many unnecessary tests!\n \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Gail: I have to agree with you. I am tired of this gift that just keeps on giving. I go to a manipulative therapist every week and have since my mastectomy. She can work such magic! I have learned that if I am having problems in one part of my body, it is usually connected with another part of the body. So, don't think the worst. Our bodies are complex, even with all of the treatments and surgeries. I would strongly suggest that if there is a manipulative therapist in your area (they are listed as such and usually osteopathics) see if you can get an appt. Have you ever tried acupuncture?\nGood luck and please try and don't worry about this. \nHugs\nDeb \n \n ",

The waiting is worse than the treatment. Usually the side effects that you have after the first chemo will be what you will have after each of them. Remember that there are meds to counteract most of the side effects. Just hang in there and keep smiling and laughing and crying. I had \"fun\" w/ my cancer and still do today.\nHugs..\nDeb\n \n ",
