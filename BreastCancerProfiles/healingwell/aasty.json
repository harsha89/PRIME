      "Content": " Hi I am a 33 yo woman who about\n a month and a half ago had sweeling and drainage of my left breast. I dismissed it and it went away after a week or so.Last week my nipple started tingling and the drainage became daily there was blood and a yellowish white mix with pain swelling and tenderness in my breast as well. I went to the doctor and they put me on antibiotics but said it was not normal to get an infection if I wasn't lactating. They sent me for an ultrasound that showed a few cysts in my nipple. Then they scheduled me for a mamo today which I went for ( they didn't tell me much except they needed to take more pictures because they sawÂ  small calcium deposits).\n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi first I hope everyone is doing well.\nI posted about\n a month and a half ago .I had drainage from my nipple that became bloody but I did not have an injury.\nI took everyones advice and had a sonogram which showed cysts then a mamo that showed calcifications but they said they didn't look cancerouus.\nAnyway after seeing the surgen he said he would test the fluid that was draining. he called me back and said that it would not respond to antibotics. After the surgery I looked up the bacteria \"actinomyces\" and It said in the PDR that with surgery and Chemo it can be cured. Of course I am too scared to call my doctor. I feel like he is waiting for it to happen again before he tells me anything. Why would I need Chemo for a bacteria ? I don't know . Does anyone have any ideas. Anything would be helpful.\nBest wishes to everyone. ",
