    "Content": " I've been noticing that my nipples have been inverted for maybe a week now. For the first time I did a BSE for the first time in my life, and not sure I did it right, even though I looked up the instructions on the internet. It felt weird. Then my nipples change...they are inverted at one point and then poke out, and then they invert. My nipples also sometimes get dark pink. I haven't had my cycle since the end of October. I sometimes have irregular periods. Why is it a concern to get your breasts checked out for any changes such as having the nipples inverted? I'm kinda nervous about\n this, but I don't really see my nipples being inverted as a real concern, except that I read that it could be a sign of breast cancer. My Grandmother had breast cancer. I figured if I f I don't have my cycle in January and/or if my nipples are still inverted I'll schedule an appointment. ",
