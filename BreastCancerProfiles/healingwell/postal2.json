      "Content": " Hi Jane, you certainly have a lot on your plate right now. I just wanted to say that it depends on the tumor (size, type, stage,etc) on whether or not a lympectomy is followed with chemo. My tumor was stage 1, so if I had gone with a lympectomy, I would have had radiation with it, and then on to tamoxafen, as mine was estrogen receptive. That is the part the tamoxafen is for. So hang in there. I am sending positive thoughts and prayers that it is not cancer, but if it is, that it is early!\n \n \n \n \n ",

There is a breast cancer survivor in Yakima, about 80 miles from my area, that was only 17 yrs old when dx. She is still a senior in high school and wrote to Dr Phil about helping her and her family cope. She had a mastectomy and I would assume will be having treatments (they didn't say, but at her age I would think so). The show with Dr Phil was taped today and the news will let us know when it is going to be shown. I definatly want to see this. I also want to write her a letter if I can find out how, maybe through the news team, and thank her. I want to tell her about this board and that we ALL thank her for helping to make it known that bc can hit young women too! I think it is just wonderful that she is doing this. It has to be hard at her age to have a mastectomy and go public with it. She is also making pink bracelets to raise money at school. If anyone here wants to post a message for her, I will print if off and put it in with my letter. I am sure it will be a day or so before I mail it if I get her address. Love you all! Gail\n \n ",

Sometimes the sonogram will reveal for sure that it is a cyst. Even if they think it is a complexe cyst, (solid inside), they may also want a biopsy next. That is pretty much standard procedure I think. Be glad you doctor is on the ball! So many ladies are told to come back in 6 months and then find out it wasn't a good idea to have waited. \nTake it one day at a time, Whatever it is we are here to celebrate with you or help you through.

I have never had a pic line or any of those things but a friend of mine did and said it was awful. They had to try several times to get it right. My veins are very hard to get, and having lymphedema I only have one arm they can use. I always expect to be stuck several times. I know if I ever had to have chemo of any other regular infusion, I would want a port. My veins could not take it. One of my surgeries they were having so much trouble getting the IV in, I had three people at once sticking me in my arm and both feet. That was not fun. Anyway, welcome, and I hope you get some advice! \nGail\n \n \n \n ",

I wasn't long during therapy that my back of the shoulder blade started to swell. I still worked hard and soon had lymphedema in right arm and both sides under arms. Are you seeing a physical therapist? That may be a good idea, one that knows about\n lymphedema. Also one that is qualified as a lymphedema massage therapist. The massage is very gentle so you want someone who has studied to learn the technique. \nI would definately take is slow, but that is just my opinion.\nHope it all goes well!!!\nGail\n \n \n \n ",

As far as something starting as benign changing to cancer, I am not sure, but I'll be someone here knows.

I was having horrible pain at night and would get up and lay on the floor and stretch thinking it was maybe muscles too. NOPE, it was gall stones. Small ones but boy it hurt! The doctor said it can caused flank pain which is what made me think kidney. It was not a bad surgery other than I got so sick from the anitistetic (sp) that I had to stay overnight. That did hurt, so from then on I always had the patch behind the ear. That helps with the sickness.\nHang in there, and I am glad you are getting some answers and it is not you heart! \nHope you have a Merry Christmas!\nGail\n \n \n \n ",

If I were you I would try to schedule it on a Thurs or Fri, so you can have the weekend (or whatever day you have off) to go along with it. \nI am so glad your dr is saying \"biopsy!\" We have lost quite a few women here who were told to wait 6 months. \nPlease keep us informed and come here anytime you need to talk, vent, cry, laugh, whatever, we do it all!

He told me a little while ago \"Grandma, I hope you know that I will love you for the rest of your life\"......melting my heart! =) \nWell thank you all for the bday wishes. Miss you all!!!\nLove and Hugs,\nGail\n \n \n \n ",

I was told I could go either way, lumpectomy with rads or mast. My surgeon, radiologist and my doctor all agreed I would be better off going with mast and tamoxifen (I was highly er+++++ and high S phase and they doubted they could get enough clear margins. So I went with mast. I also did ask for a phophylactic mast on the other breasts. NOW this was just my choice, I am not saying your sister should do this, it is a very personal decision. I am just saying what I chose. =) I will mention that she should pay close attention to her other breast too, as lobular has a tendancy to \"mirror\" itself in the other breast. That is what chinched my decision. Doesn't mean it will, just maybe, so she should be aware of this. \nI am sending my best wishes to you and your sister, and she is lucky to have you!!\nHUGS, Gail\n \n \n \n ",

You have found a great place for info and friends! \nI had two mastectomies (different times) and I also had my gallbladder out before that. I agree that the mastectomies were MUCH easier than the abdominal surgery! There are nerves cut when you have a mast and I guess that is much of the reason. I really didn't have much pain on the chest area. The arm takes some excercising to get back the full movement and that can be uncomfortable, but still I think the ab surgery was much worse.\nPlease keep us updated and hang out with us here.

      "Content": " This was in the news tonight, I thought it was interesting.....\n \n \n01/17/2007 23:06:02 EST\n \n \nCancer Found More Often in Dense Breasts \nBy JEFF DONN \nAssociated Press Writer\nBOSTON - Cancer turns up five times more often in women with extremely dense breasts than in those with the most fatty tissue, a study shows, signaling the importance of a risk factor rarely discussed with patients.\nOn mammograms, fat looks dark, but dense tissue is light, like tumors, so it can hide the cancers. But this study confirms that cancers are also more frequent - not just hidden - in women with dense breasts.\nThat means that density is a true risk factor, along with other strong predictors like age and the genes BRCA1 and 2. Yet specialists say that breast density is rarely considered with other risk factors in discussions between doctors and patients.\n\"It's been ignored to an absolutely unbelievable degree,\" said study leader Dr. Norman Boyd at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto.\nThe Canadian study by cancer centers in Toronto and Vancouver focuses on how and when cancers were found over eight years in existing records of 1,112 women collected between 1981 and last year. It is being reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.\nBreast density comes from the presence of more connective, duct-lining and milk-gland tissue than fat. But a woman can't judge her own density; it is routinely evaluated from a mammogram.\nPrevious studies had linked breast density to a higher rate of cancer, pointing to both masking and a separate biological risk.\nIn this study, women with at least 75 percent dense breasts showed five times more likelihood of cancer than women with less than 10 percent density.\nThe researchers went further by calculating just how many more cancers were found at screening, within the next year, and in the years afterward. Cancers found within a year were considered likely to be present, but masked, during the earlier mammogram. But a true biological risk was seen in cancers discovered by mammogram or long afterward.\nIn this study, cancers were 18 times more likely in women with the densest breasts within the first year after mammograms - the masking effect.\nHowever, cancers in women with the densest breasts were also more than three times more likely to turn up at the time of screening and after the first year following a mammogram. That confirms and helps quantify the true biological link between density and cancer.\n\"I think the masking thing is important, and it does happen, but the most important thing is that this is an incredible risk factor,\" said Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying editorial. \"This probably counts for a large percentage of the cancer that's occurring.\"\nBreast cancers are the second most lethal kind after lung cancers in women. about\n one in eight women will get invasive breast cancer during her lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society. Last year, roughly 41,000 U.S. women died of it. Worldwide, it kills about\n 370,000 women each year.\nIn this study, density of more than 50 percent accounted for 16 percent of all cancers and a quarter in women under age 56.\nRobert Smith, a screening expert at the American Cancer Society, said this study and its predecessors will encourage a rethinking of cancer screening.\nFor now, women can ask their doctor about\n their breast density based on a mammogram and how it might affect their risk. However, experts say it's too soon for doctors to provide solid advice to individual patients.\nFor one thing, quicker, more accurate tools are needed to measure density. Some experts believe that ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging or computerized mammograms may ultimately prove better at finding tumors in very dense breasts, but it's still unclear how much value each might yield for its cost.\n\"In a perfect world, I would have my wife do an ultrasound, MRI, and a digital mammogram,\" said Dr. Gary J. Whitman, a radiologist at University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. He was not involved in the study.\nSome believe lifestyle changes or even preventive drugs may one day be recommended to women with this risk factor.\nMeanwhile, specialists hope to identify genes that promote density, because they might act as targets for cancer drugs.\nIn another study in the same journal, a research team at the University of Michigan described a newly identified set of 186 genes that appears to predict whether a breast tumor will spread.\nOther so-called gene signatures have been discovered for breast cancer, but this one is also linked to survival in lung, prostate and brain cancers.\n___\nOn the Net\nNew England Journal of Medicine: http://nejm.org/\nAmerican Cancer Society: http://www.cancer ",

The only reason I did not, was I have lymphedema in my right arm and chest and both sides. I was afraid it would make it worse. Unfortunately I have gained quite a bit of weight and the implants stay the same. \nI was not happy with the job the Dr here in Tri-cities did after doing it twice, so I went to Seattle to a Dr Richard Baxter. Wonderful Doctor. The Dr I talked to about\n doing the Free Flap is Dr Cooper in Spokane, he is very good also. Myself, I would go to Spokane or Seattle. If you want any phone numbers of either of these, let me know and I will e-mail them to you. Both excellent doctors!\nAnyway, it is great to \"meet\" you, and take care!

The pains were horrible and about\n every 5 to 15 seconds. The Clinic Dr I went to on Sat, cause I could't stand it anymore, said I had an irritated nerve in my scalp and gave me neurontin. Well, my scalp was so tender this AM that it hurt on my pillow.

We will be here waiting with you. Odds are it is B9, so take a deep breath and try to relax a little. If it is not, we are still here, no matter what. {{{{{Hugs}}}}} Gail\n \n \n \n ",

I did gain weight and have hot flashes. I also contribute some bone pain to it and actually quit it for 3 months. I went back to taking it though as my family was not pleased. They were worried that I needed to do everthing possible to keep from having a reccurance so I went back on it. My daughter did work with a lady who had bc and kept forgetting to take her tamoxifen and ended up with a recurrance and then it was too late. She did pass away a short while later. So my opinion is DO take it and do all you can to help yourself. If it is too miserable for you, perhaps they could try Arimidex (sp). I would say at least give it a shot, but it is your decision. My best wishes to you and {{{{{HUGS}}}}} too. \nL&H, Gail\n \n ",

Remember that 80% of lumps are benign, so the odds are in your favor!

This term is used to indicate that the cells seen on the Pap test are consistent with abnormalities in the cervix that may be precancerous (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, or dysplasia). If the threat is low-grade, the size, shape and other characteristics of the cells suggest that if a precancerous lesion is present, it's likely to be years away from becoming a cancer. If the threat is high-grade, the certainty of something being wrong on the cervix is greatly enhanced, and the lesion is likely to be farther down the road to cancer.

Well I guess it got pretty bad during the night and he didn't wake her up! YIKES!

He has a breathing treatment every 2 hours and has the oxygen thing in his nose (which he said is making his nose hurt and he wants to go home). They also gave him some steroids. I FEEL SO BAD FOR HIM AND WORRIED! His blood oxygen level is too low if he removes his nose thing, like 94 or so. They want it higher before they release him.

I sure would have loved a free tummy tuck!! The Dr I saw is in Spokane, WA and from what I have heard he does really beautiful work! My reg dr saw one of his patients and was amazed at how real her breasts looked. \nAnyway, I don't know if anyone on here has had the \"free flap\" . Some have had the tram flap and maybe the diep flap. \nGood luck to you and I hope they come out beautiful!! Let us know, ok? \nL&H, Gail\n \n ",

One is degenerative disease which I know most people end up with even though it may not bother them. Also Arthritus, facet joint problems, possibly, but probably not, ankylosing spondylitius. I do have the gene but now the Rhuemy does not think it is, but is not sure....=( The place the nerve comes out from the spine is narrowing so it is pinching a nerve. A herniated disk and some others buldging (sp?) I can't remember all of it without the MRI in front of my and someone speaking \"english\" for me, lol. Anyway, my Dr said I could try the shots, or he could send me to the neuro surgeon, I said let's try the shots! ={} \nI don't even know if the surgeon would say he could help, but I will try the shots first. What was wrong with your back? You say it has helped with the pain? That is good to know. I am sick of hurting all the time. \nThanks Deb for the help. Hope we can see each other again at another meeting! Miss you! \nL&H, Gail\n \n ",

(I was also on it as an antidepressant) It helped with the \"regular\" hot flashes, but with me it caused me to break out in a sweat on my head. I didn't have to be doing anything, and just like with hot flashes, bam! I literally would look like I just got out of the shower! This happened ALOT. My hair would be soaked! The rest of me would be ok though. I only took it for about\n 6 mo then said forget it! Put me back on Prozac! LOL\nI don't think this happens to everyone on it for sure. I do know I have read about\n other people with this side effect, but , it is not the \"norm\". I am off tamoxifen (hit the 5 year mark in May '05) and still have some hot flashes, but not as many as when I was on the tamoxifen.\n \n ",

I told him how I have felt silver lining of the cloud though, also, and feel I have changed in some ways for the better. I know you all know what I mean. I would have loved to talk to him more about\n it but of course that was not why I was there. This is for a job in the mail room at Battelle, Pacific Nortwest National Laboratories (PNNL) . I is not as hard as what I did at the post office,  there I had to be able to lift 70 lbs. There are 5 employees under him, and they all seemed very nice. Also, at this company everyone gets a chance at promotions, which I would like to be able to be a secretary or something where I can sit more. The standing kills my back. In fact MOST things kill my back so I am hoping I can do this. I think I can, I think I can... lol. I saw the ad through worksource and thought maybe I should give it a try. I have been having a real confidence issue lately and maybe this will help. \n \n \n \n \n \n ",

My daughter was my rock and best friend when I was diagnosed. There are many women that are living good lives since breast cancer. One of the ladies here is over 20 years out since her diagnoses. So there IS life after breast cancer. \nWe will hold your hand the whole way if you want. Please let us know how she is doing.\nHugs, Gail\n \n ",

We haven't had a chance to meet yet as I was on a 2 month trip and just recently got back, but I hope to meet her soon. \nI had a double mastectomy, one at a time, one being prophylactic.\nI had my final reconstrution done by a wonderful plastic surgeon near you in Mountlake Terrace. You have some very good Drs in your area! \nI did not have to have chemo or radiation.Ichose tohave the 2nd breast removed as I had invasive lobular and it ofter mirrors itself in the other breast. I was fortunate to have found mine early and I had neg nodes. \nKeep us informed on how you are doing. We will be with you all the way. L&H, Gail\n \n ",

The DR told her that sometimes after this test patients seem more likely to get pregnant with about 3 months. He does not know why, but it said it seems to happen. Maybe it unplugs something that was plugged, who knows. Yes she does have a tipped uterus, which we knew from her first pregnancy. I hope that it does not mean she would have back labor again.

(Husband was already tested and he is fine) Last Tues, she was to have a scope with dye inserted to look at the cervix and tubes, and they could not for some reason get it inserted more than a tiny bit. It is like they were hitting something. Of course this really upset her and although she knows it is probably not something serious, she still thinks of her G-ma having passed from Cervical cancer and the breast cancer risks she has. She was in tears and so upset. \n   So today I am taking her in again so they can try again. Her gyn usually does not do these himself anymore but as a special favor he is as his nurse is my daughter's MIL. God, I hope it goes ok. If not, he will do a hysteroscopy and lapraoscopy(?) next month. Hopefully that won't be needed. So please, send out prayers for her. It is in two hours (3:30 pm pst) and her name is Joy. Thank you all so much, you are good friends! L&H, Gail\n \n ",

I used to think that Drs hated having people read the internet, etc, and learn about their disease.They hate seeing the list of questions a patient pulls out. \n ut I honestly think that sometimes it is just that they know they do NOT know everything and maybe the patient might just ask them something they don't know. Heaven forbid they admit it. I think the nurse is covering her own a** or someone elses about the 5 weeks. How can she go tell the Dr now that you want a 2nd opinion without him wondering why you waiting so long to ask. I don't know, call me overly suspicious, but \n. I agree, find a new DR. and glad to hear you are getting that 2nd test. Love you, Gail\n \n ",

I think that the important thing about doing them is not necessarily knowing WHAT the things you are feeling are, but in doing them regularly, you notice when something is DIFFERENT than it usually is. I had been to the Dr several times as I had lumpy, dense breasts and sometimes I would feel something that I did not remember being there before. Thank goodness I did, as the last thing (lump) was cancer. I know that there are other ladies on this board that either found it themselves, or their husband's did. \nAs far as a class to help educate, I say great! The more that is done to help with early detection, the better!! L&H, Gail\n \n ",

They called the dealer while I was there, looking to see if they knew of any homes for sale, so they came in and talked to me. It was the elderly lady, her daughter,I believe, she is a little  younger than me. Another young couple, I believe her daughter and son-in- law maybe, I don't remember. ( Am I confusing anyone yet besides myself?) Anyway, the daughter was talking about just getting her hair back after chemo for breast cancer. She was dx'd last May. When we went out to my car for them to follow me home, she said you must know a survivor as I think she saw my pink survivor ribbon magnet on the car. I said, \"yes, me!\" We started talking and we she gave me a big hug as a \"sister\" and when we got to my house all of us ladies (poor son-in-law went out to the car finally LOL) we talked for quite a while and she got the address for here! I told her about all the most wonderful friends I have made here and the wealth of info! Her name is Cheryl, and I really hope she comes here, she is just SO very nice. Anyway, so if she comes, I know you will all welcome her as you do everyone! \n \n \n \n ",

They can give educated guesses, and many times are correct, BUT sometimes as we on this board know all too well, they are wrong. Please insist on a biopsy. If they say no, find another DR. It is not worth taking the chance, especially when you have kids. It is 80% chance it is benign, but you need to know for sure. \nI know otheres here are going to tell you the same thing. Probably most if not all. You are sure to get more responses. \nWe are here for you no matter what, so please take a deep breath and come back, ok? Their also may be one of us near you, we are all over the place. \nHang in there sweetie, and keep in touch, L&H, Gail\n \n ",

We have one lady, Luci, in Henderson right next to Las Vegas. You may hear from her.She is fantastic and so sweet. There is a roll call at the top of the board and you can learn about us there too. My story is I was dx (diagnosed) at 49, with invasive lobular and DCIS. I had double mastectomies (one at a time) one being prophylactic. I have had saline implants for reconstrution done later. Many stories here and you will learn a lot. Stay with us and we will help you through this sweetie. Oh, I am Gail from Washington State. L&H, Gail\n \n ",

In fact she even recommends this before a mast etc even if you don't have a problem. Help with fluids, etc. \nWonderful your biopsy came out ok! Geez, the gift that keeps on giving! Everytime I thing I am through, something else comes up.\nAnd HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! Eat lots of cake and ice cream, it really helps! LOL\nCelebrating with ya, L&H, Gail\n \n ",

Now you have to remember to breathe, I know how this almost takes your breath away.\nAs far as the Dr knowing from the mammo and US, they can make a good educated guess. It still takes a biopsy to know 100% if it is cancer or not. And sometimes their educated guess turns out wrong, sometimes not. Remember, if it turns out right, you will then figure out what to do and fight! You will have a game plan! I know how frightened you are and the waiting is definately the worst part. They are some very long term survivors on this board, so it is not automatically a death sentence! And statitics, which I am sure you will hear from someone, or read somewhere, are JUST STATISTICS! There are ladies here who have proven statistics wrong. It happens all the time. \nI am sorry your husband is out of town when you are going through this, but remember we are here and we will be with you and hold your hand all the way, no matter what the outcome! And for now, I am praying benign!!! \nI know other ladies will be here and answer your other questions for you. Hang in there sweetie, I know it is hard, but you CAN do it! \nL&H, Gail from Washington State\n \n ",

(I am seeing a Rhuemy. in Spokane on March 9th) Anyway, The pain in my back seems to shoot all the way around thru my right hip into my lower right abdomen. Just about where my right ovary would be if I still had one =) . My ovaries were removed about 6 mo after my dx due to a large complex cyst on my right one. Also a smaller one on the left. Both benign. What the heck is still in there that would hurt like this? It does feel like the shart pain I would get from the cyst. If I move and my back gets pain, so does that area. Geez, paranoia! I hate this gift that keeps on giving. I have my last 6 mo onc appt next mo, and I think I will request one last bone scan. I has been over a year since one, and now I am running my imagination again. Ok, I will stop yammerin' now....any ideas? Thanks for listening, you are so great. L&H, Gail \n \n \n \n ",

      "Content": " Hi KD and welcome! I agree with Lauri that it may be just the normal numbness as some of my arm and breast area feeling has never returned, but then I had double mastectomies. As for the swelling, it should be checked out. It may be normal or it could be the beginnings of lymphedema. If it is lympedema you should get started right away on massage. Ask your Dr if he/she knows of a \n lymphedena therapist. It is important to find a therapist who has been trained in the certified methods of massage for lymphedema. It is not your ordinary massage. Go to the website for the National Lymphedema Network  \n   and you can find out if they have any therapists listed in your area. Unfortunately, many Doctors don't seem to have a lot of knowledge about lymphedema. Or they seem to be hesitant to send us for massage therapy. A qualified massage therapist (in lymphedema) probably knows more than the Drs.  Anyway, any swelling should be looked at. My Lymph. therapist says it is best to have massage even before the surgeries to better prepare the body and lymp system. Well sorry to be so long-winded. It could be fine, but please get it checked just in case. \nL&H, Gail\n \n ",

It is quite a roller coaster of emotions, but it does smooth out after a while. It is never the same but it gets better. I too lost my job due to this disease. I developed lymphedema and could no longer due the job which required heavy lifting. I had no choice but to leave. I was lucky that they let me retire on disability although I sure miss the paycheck. This bc has a way of changing your life, but I found some of the ways are good changes. \"Silver lining in the clouds\" as they say. Hang with us and I believe you will see that time will help heal and we will be there with you holding your hand. We have our ups and downs, but we do have some laughs along the way.

      "Content": " Hi Sheldon, Welcome to a great place to talk and get info. I have been on tamoxifen for 4 1/2 years now. I actually did stop taking it last year for about 4 mo. as it has caused me joint pain and I know I have found others, on researching, that also have this problem. I only went back on it because of the obvious reason, to help prevent a recurrance. I do have arthritus, so I thought that maybe that was causing the pain, but when I stopped it I noticed a slight improvement. I asked my onc and he didn't seem to have much knowledge or experience with it causeing joint pain, but I know it does from my own experience/research. It is up to you what you do, and I would talk to your Dr about this. Depending on how much you can stand it and what your prognosis is with the b/c, you need to decide for yourself. I just decided that I would live with a little more pain for a while to try to limit my chances of the bc showing up again. I caught my cancer early, so my prognsis is good, but one never really knows for sure. Anyway, just wanted to let you know it is not all \"in your head\". It can and does cause joint pain whether your Dr knows it or not. =) Hope you do ok, and stay with us. L&H, Gail\n \n ",

I agree Drs need to spread the appts out an allow enough time for each patient AND so no one has to wait a long time! 2 hrs is ridiculous! The cardiologist didn't dictate his findings? What did he do with them? They just don't seem to realize or maybe care, what they put patients through. I hope you find a Dr in NV that you really like and feel comfortable with. Enjoy your trip to NY sweetie, and let us know what the Dr there says.

Well you have found a great board and a great bunch of ladies here who just love to help all they can. So if you have any questions or comments, or just need to talk, vent, scream, cry, or anything, feel free!! There is a lot of knowledge and experiences here. And we all know how you feel. Seems like unless you have been in these shoes, you just don't get it, right? At least that is the way most of us feel. We may have great support at home and friends, but they still don't quite \"get it\". The ups and downs, the fears, the humor, the paranoia over any ache or pain. Well, sorry you had to find us but hang out with us! L&H, Gail\n \n ",

You have found a great place for support here, and there are lots of different experiences and knowledge. Chances are whatever you go through, someone here can help you with it. I am sorry you had to find us, but you are most welcome to come here and talk, laugh, cry, vent etc. You can look above the posts at the roll call posts and learn about many of us. Maybe someone lives near you if you want to talk in person. Would you tell us a little about yourself if you are comfortable doing so? You said you were recently diagnosed, do you know what type and stage your cancer is? Just share what you want, and know we will do all we can to help. Take care. L&H, Gail\n \n ",

It was too heavy for me as I have lympedema in my right arm, under arm and chest. I about killed me. After the 2nd mastectomy I went to a smaller size, about a C. They were also the silicone gel kind and with two of them they still would hurt before long and I couldn't wait to get them off. I know there are some lighter ones out there. The only problem is if they are really light, they don't always stay down. There has got to be a happy meduim out there. Of course if I had had one breast it may have helped? I have mild lymphedema under my left arm also, so any bra etc hurts. I don't wear anything if I can get away with it. I guess that is one good thing about winter clothes! LOL! \nI think it was about 4-6 weeks after surgery before I wore a prosthesis, other than the \"fluff ball\" one they gave meat first. \nWell good luck and sending hugs to you! \nL&H, Gail \n \n ",

The left one was prophylactic and my Dr did get the ok, so insurance paid for it. I had invasive lobular, which many times turns up in the other side. That is the reason they ok'd it. Your Dr is the one to ask about that. He may have some way of writing it to get it covered. If you decide on a mast, your insurance has to pay for it and pay to make the other side match. Probably works that way if you have a lumpectomy and need them fixed to match too. I am sure someone else here can answer that for sure. I know you feel overwhelmed right now, but just take some deep breaths and stay with us, we will help you through this. Hang in there sweetie. L&H, Gail\n \n ",
