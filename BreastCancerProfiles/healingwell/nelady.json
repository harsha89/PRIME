    "Content": " I met with the oncology surgeon yesterday to find that I have invasive carcinoma with ductal and lobular features. MD gave me the option of a mastectomy or a lumpectomy because the area is small. Has anyone here had to make that decision? I don't know if I should opt for a lumpectomy with radiation and hormone therapy, or a mastectomy. The sentinel node will tell us more. Surgery will be in 2 weeks, but I have to give MD a decision by today. Thanks for any help. ",
