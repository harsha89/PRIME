      "Content": " Well this is one of those miracle \"coincidences\" that helps me know I am being looked after from a different level. I have been working out for about a year now in an early morning strengthening class a few days a week. In the class is a young woman with two small children that I have been sharing chit chat and class encouragement with. She had been gone from class for a while and when she returned last week I had asked how she was. I could tell something was up and not comfortable answering around the crowd so I changed teh subject. Monday I got the call I needed to come back in for ultrasound on Tuesday. Tuesday morning I did not go to class but went to the coffee shop to work remotely on a project. She came in after class, had missed me. (long story but both these actions, me being there and here being there are very irregular actions for that day and time). She asked how my shoulder was doing (had some injuring she saw at class) and then told me she had been out because of a historectomy. I asked if she could share why: turned out she was dxed three years ago w/ bc. Stage 5 I think. Had mastectomy, radiation, chemo the work. Was not responding to hormone thpy so had historectomy. Hast mastecised to femur and lungs. She is the most upbeat, energetic person. Says she asks the doctors if they are sure they have the right x-rays because she feels great. She started a new job and has asked for chemo that doesn't take her hair. I shared with her what was happening to me. She is the one who offered to go to ultrasound (I opted to do it on my own) and is the one who called me immediately following to talk aout what was going on and encourage me to not be too pescimistic. Whether this thing turns out to be something or not, I have to feel that part of it is orchestrated to get us together to support each other through whatever happens. Same reason I may be typing this on this site right now. Anway, thanks all. ",

      "Content": " Dear wonderful people, the news was good. The tests came back clean. I will have follow ups every six months but for now I can breath again. This experience has forever changed me. As I mentioned my mother was diagnosed with bc at 40. She had very aggressive treatment and lived almost 19 years more, a very full, beautiful life. Two immediate things that I need to do: get involved in the early detection band wagon. And to see if there is some local study dealing with prevention: I want to be part of any study that will work toward measures that will mean that your daughters, grandaughters, sisters will not have to live the nightmare you are all so bravely marching through. If it's OK, I would like to check in with you all, offer support where I can (what can I do?). Thank you for holding my hand through the long weekend. I have become aquainted with two local women who are in the battle. I will let them know of the support that is offered here. This is a beautiful site.\nBlessings,\n-Time (Jennifer) ",

      "Content": " OK, can't keep these wheels from turning. Just possibly making a connection now. Last summer had extensive blood tests for possible thyroid problem. Results came back, borderline watch for Grave's Disease. Everything else looked very healthy. But my question is more around other thing that has since happened. Blood tests showed no sign of pre-menopausal. Then, suddenly, abruptly, periods have stopped. Haven't had a period since late last summer. Who's complaining, right? It's not like I miss them lol. And since I am separated and sexually inactive I am not concerned about pregnancy. But now I am thinking...is there a connection. I mentioned to my GP last visit about the no period and she said strange but with all I've been through with divorce it could be stress related but to keep an eye. I had forgotten about this so haven't mentioned it to breast center. Know you all aren't doctors but have you heard of anything like this related to bc?? ",
