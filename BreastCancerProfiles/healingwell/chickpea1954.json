      "Content": " Hi - I am 55 - and found a \"ridge\" like tissue, stationary in my right breast. It's not large, but I felt it. I went to my Dr. and the nurse practitioner said I should go for an u/s. I have never had an abnormal mammo, but one of my sisters got b/c in her late 40's. I go in two weeks. I am scared to death. No pain, no abnormal looking nipples, skin, etc. Any comments? Thank you. Chickpea ",

      "Content": " Hi Bev\nThanks for your input. It's so good to hear from a woman with knowledge. My u/s is scheduled for October 26 a.m. I'm hoping all is ok. I cannot believe how frightened I am. It is so easy to be up and positive when it comes to someone else, isn't it? Thanks for your concern. ",

      "Content": " Thank you Bev for the very, very informative reply! You have offered me hope, regardless of which way my diagnosis turns out! Naturally, I am hoping for the best, but I have done a lot of soul-searching and realize I cannot change what 'is' - and I will have to deal with it, if I have to. I too will be doing a 'happy dance' on the 26th if all is well. I will keep you posted. Thank you so much for your words! - Chickpea ",
