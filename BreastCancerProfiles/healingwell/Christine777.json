      "Content": " Hi I'm Christine 777. I am not new to the Healingwell forum. I have been on the Bipolar side of things.\nBut now I'm hit with a lump. I don't know yet if it's cancer. All I know is that it is big, baseball size.\nAnd it hurts. I have had a mammogram but I am waiting to have my ultrasound. I will see a surgeon on Monday.\nI was just wondering how do they know the difference between a cyst and a malignant lump? Does the mammogram tell you anything besides the size? \nI really had a good experience here before when I was on the Bipolar forum. Thanks in advance for posting. \nHope to hear from someone soon.\nThanks \n ",

      "Content": " Thank you. I think mine is not a cyst because of it's hardness and it is not flexible. I am seeing my surgeon this Monday.\nI hope he can get me into surgery as quickly as possible.\nThank you for your quick response.\n \n ",
