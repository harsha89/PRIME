      "Content": " Do what your doctor suggests. However, nothing is bullet proof. I have invasive breast cancer. it is very thin - like jelly - it spreads across the breast. I had many mamos, an many ultrasounds, a number of biopsies and MRIs and they MISSED the CANCER. I asked them to do a prophylactic mastectomy - the doctors told me I was being \"silly\". After the mastectomies, they found Stage 2 Invasive lobular breast cancer.\nNothing is bullet proof. So even mamos, us, biopsies and MRIs can miss it all. Also remember, the mamos you are getting are exposing you to radiation and can also cause cancer as much as they can diagnose cancer. It is a two edged sword. ",

      "Content": " barb, 63, Arizona\nmamo, ultrasound, mri and biopsy negative for cancer. I insisted on prophylactic mastectomy in July 2017. Cancer found in right breast. NOTE: Don't let doctors bully you. Follow your gut feelings.\nALSO: Not doing reconstructive surgery. The risk of infection and clotting is high for any cancer sufferer - also makes finding future cancer harder. Not worth the pain and too many times the results are painful and not too pretty. \nAlso - power port problem. Got blood infection and blood clot from port for chemo. Found out that 62 percent of women who have a port get a clot. Would have loved to have known that in the first place. Ports are not a good thing. Avoid them if you can.\nDiagnosis: Invasive Lobular Cancer; stage 2a, 0 nodes, er+, pr+, grade 2, mitosis rate \"low\", Chemo 4 rounds of T&C, currently on exemestane for 10 years. Bone scan showed no signs of cancer. \nWe shall see how it goes. Depends if I still have insurance.\n ",
