    "Content": " So about\n a month ago I found a lumpÂ on my left breast the size of a grape and now it's grown to the size of a size of a small apple. The skin above the lump is also very red and I have recently noticed a lot of flaking of the skin in that area. It also hurts a lot. I should mention that I am only 16 so the lump is probably nothing serious. I just wanted to confirm this with someone who is actually experienced with this kind of thing. Thank you! ",
