    "Content": " I am here from the ostomy board. I am doing ok, but my daughter just had a double mastectomy last Tuesday and has problems. Under her arm where the lymph nodes were removed, there is a lot of swelling and high pain. She has a low grade temp, also. We live about\n 3 hours from her doctor in a very rural area. Contacting the nurse line was not successful last night. ",
