    "Content": " I was diagonosed with 4th stage breast cancer which had gone to my liver. I had chemo and was fine for almost a year. Then it came back and I had to have a total hystromecty and go on chemo again. I have been on Femara for about\n 5 months. After about\n 3 months the pain in my legs became terrible. I was on tomoxefen for a while with no problems but that did not work for me the cancer came back. I sometimes can take a hot bath and soak and it helps for a while. But I understand where you are coming from. My cancer is hormone receptive so the oco tells me this works better. I work everyday which is an effort, but I have to have insurance. I take pain pills at night or over the counter pain relievers. I get up at 4:30 drive an hour, work 10 hours and drive anothe hour home. I have my grand daughter every evening and that is what keeps me going. You just have to have the determination to live. I will continue to fight no matter how bad the pain is. If femara works I will take it. ",
