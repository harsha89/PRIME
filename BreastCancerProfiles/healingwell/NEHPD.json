    "Content": " Hey y'all,\nSo my wife had her yearly mammogram early last week. She gets the 3D type as she apparently has extremely dense breasts. /she has been doing the 3D version for years now. Anyhow, she got the dreaded \"call back\" because an \"abnormality\" was found on her left breast. She got in yesterday (about\n 8 days after the initial test) and they did the ultrasound. While there, the tech seamed cheery and said it looked good except for one spot close to the surface but that appeared to be some kind of blood vessel since one of the settings on the ultrasound showed it to be nice and red and flowing. Wife said the radiologist was present and instructed the Tech on where to look and focus, etc etc. But, they gave her no conclusive information and sent her on her way. \nWell, today she gets a call back saying that they want to do it again because the ultrasound was inconclusive. She talked to her Doctor's nurse, whom she has a 19 year history with as far as women's doctor stuff...you know...and was told that the 3D mammogram showed some kind of mass but that it was unclear and that the follow up ultrasound saw absolutely nothing. \nNow I know from research that dense boobs are a bit more prone to develop cancer, and a whole lot harder to diagnose...hence the 3d mammograms. I also know that the 3D mammograms are a lot less apt to produce false positives and false negatives. And I know that the ultrasound is even more reliable then the 3d as far as dense ones go.\nSo if something was seen in the 3d, but nothing was seen in the ultrasound (to the point that when wife asked if she could just get a biopsy on the 3rd trip back and stop all this back and fourth, they told her that they would be sticking her blind because there is nothing to aim for while using an ultrasound), what does that mean? She is holding herself well but I'm wigging out (and I'm sure she is nervous on the inside.\nAnybody have some kind of insight or similar experience they would like to share?\nThanks, ladies... ",
