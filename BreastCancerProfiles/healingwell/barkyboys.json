When a post is read and not responded to, it usually just means that no one has been through the ordeal that you have obviously been through, and don't have any suggestions to offer. I'm sorry you felt like it was due to people not wanting to help. I had severe fibrocystic pain, myself, and I can sympathize with that. I tried the laundry list of \"this might help's\" too, and none of it worked for me. Ironically, chemo put me into menopause, which is the only natural cure for fibrocystic pain that I know of. A friend of mine actually had a double mastectomy, not for breast cancer, but for fibrocystic pain. \nI agree with you, that there are a lot of bad doctors out there. There's also a lot of \"crap\" insurance. We just have to be informed and discerning consumers... unfortunately.\nI'm glad you have found some relief. The tamoxifen for fibrocystic pain is new to me, but makes total sense. Thanks for sharing your experience!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

If you want to have the cysts aspirated, you could ask to have that done, but that isn't always done. If there is a complex cyst, they are more apt to aspirate. And there is no guarantee, that the cysts won't refill. It is pretty standard to ask you to come back in 6 months for a recheck for cysts. You are obviously uncomfortable with the fact that they didn't aspirate, so why not go ahead and ask to have that done? It would be worth the peace of mind.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

Fortunately, I had a PCP who insisted I see a surgeon for a biopsy. The older we get, the less dense our breast tissue, so cancers are easier to spot.

An ultrasound is done if they suspect something they see on the mammogram may be a cyst. An ultrasound will tell if what they're looking at is fluid-filled. Some fluid-filled cysts have some \"stuff\" in them. If that is the case, then there is a slight possibility that the \"stuff\" can have cancer cells. If what they're seeing isn't fluid-filled, that doesn't mean it is cancer. It just means it is not a cyst. Even with all the technology they have today, more often than not, a biopsy is negative for cancer. Hope yours turns out to be nothing.

If you are really nervous, you can talk to your doctor about\n aspirating the cysts and having the fluid checked, but it would be very rare to find cancer cells in the fluid.

      "Content": " On the subject of dense breasts...the younger you are, the more likely the breast tissue will read as \"dense,\" as I understand it. I have never heard that it increases your chances for breast cancer, but I'm not a medical person. Dense breast tissue shows up white on a mammogram, and because breast cancer also shows as a white mass, it is difficult to \"find\" breast cancers in dense breast tissue on a mammogram. This is why up to 30 percent of all breast cancers are missed on mammograms.\nI think the \"calcium deposits\" you referred to are probably microcalcifications. This shows up as if salt has been sprinkled on the mammogram. Lots of women have them, and they do warrant watching. If the microcalcifications start to show as a cluster in a small area, this can be an indication of breast cancer, but not always. \nWith dense breast tissue, they probably want to look at a particular area closer, to determine if there is a cluster of microcalcifications, or if there is just a density in the breast tissue. \nI had just been diagnosed with two types of invasive breast cancer when I got a letter stating that my mammogram results were normal. And a few years later, I got called back for a \"mass\" in my remaining breast....waited for weeks for the second appointment, had compression views, and they were normal. No mass, no cancer. Mammograms are not perfect. So my advice would be not to worry too much until you have the next tests done. And we'll be hoping they are normal.\nLet us know how it goes!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Matt. I've never taken either drug, so I don't speak from personal experience here. But I was wondering if your wife is being put on other drugs, as well? For instance, is she taking a taxane for treatment, such as Taxotere? This can cause joint pain. And if she is taking a biphosphonate, such as Zometa, these can, especially initially, cause bone and joint pain. So it may not be simply the switch from Femara to Tamoxifen that is causing the increase in pain. Just something else to consider. I know tamoxifen works differently from Femara, and it is often preferred over tamoxifen because it typically has fewer side effects. \nReally sorry to hear about\n your wife's mets. We never like to hear that someone is having to tangle with breast cancer... especially a second (or third or fourth, as some of our member do) time around. \nHope this helps...\nBEV\n ",

My hubbie is retired, on some very expensive meds, and most of the time, I feel like I'm working for insurance so we afford to keep him on his meds. So I feel for you! \nSue and Alcie... re:the pain, I have no first hand knowledge to share, as I wasn't on any of the estrogen blockers. \nI don't know that depression is a side effect of breast cancer diagnosis. I think attitude has a lot to do with that. I'd like to think that I'm a more positive person after cancer than I was before. I know I appreciate life and all its blessings more. That is not to say that I didn't have days when I had great big pity parties for myself, to which I was the sole invitee, because I did! But then I picked myself up and made myself put one foot in front of the other til I felt like putting one foot in front of the other, and then I felt better. I don't think I was depressed, by the clinical definition. I think I was just dealing with a life-changing diagnosis, an uncertain future (not just mine, but my family's as well), and doing the best I could on a day by day basis.\nWish I had answers... but only have empathy to offer.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " I had fibrocystic breast disease for years before I was diagnosed with breast cancer. At times, the pain was almost unbearable. When I found the cancerous lumps, they were different from the fcbd lumps. They were painless and unchanging. Even my husband could tell the difference. That was what sent me to the doctor. I will say, however, that some women do report pain in their breasts with breast cancer, but that is rare. I have never heard or read that there is a relationship between fcbd and breast cancer. Lots of women get call backs that turn out to be nothing. After my initial dx, I was called back for a \"mass\" in my remaining breast. I was thoroughly prepared for a cancer dx, and you could have knocked me over with a feather when they said there was nothing there. The \"mass\" was a result of the way the tissue was pushed together in the mammo. Compression views showed normal tissue and no mass. I was on cloud nine! So it could be nothing. Try not to worry too much about\n it. I had to wait 6 long weeks to get my follow-up views done. \nGood luck with your follow-up. Hopefully, it will be nothing. And my sympathies with the fcbd. I know how absolutely miserable it can be, and none of the \"remedies,\" such as avoid caffeine, etc.. helped at all. I had a friend who had elective mastectomies with reconstructive surgery, not because of cancer, but because of fcbd. She has never regretted that decision.\nTake care, and good luck...

I had 6 months of chemotherapy (I was only stage II), but I worked all the way through my treatments...I never lost a day of work from it. Yes, I lost my hair, and there were days when I wasn't 100 percent, but chemo bought me many years of life...enough to see my kids graduate from college, both are in post-graduate studies now, and to see my first granddaughter born...what a gift! And they're gifts I would otherwise have taken for granted. So... again, good luck.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

Most doctors, I think, like to do radiation with a lumpectomy, as a precautionary measure. If there is a stray cancer cell or two after surgery, then radiation will take care of it. The tamoxifen is used if the cancer is ER/PR positive. It is a hormone blocker and keeps hormones from \"feeding\" any stray cancer cells. Tamoxifen doesn't typically cause you to lose your hair. Taxanes, like Taxotere, will cause hair loss, but they are true chemo drugs. \nOf course this is all scary! And you have every right to be worried. You are so young, and you've just found out you have cancer! But the good news is, they have caught it early, and it is as treatable as a breast cancer can be. So try to keep that in mind when you are getting overworked about\n the whole thing. \nLet us know how things are going...\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Hi, Striving. It is not uncommon to have bone/joint pain on Femara. For some people, this subsides after the first few months. Some ladies here have just not been able to tolerate it. Why did they choose to switch from Tamoxifen to Femara? Some ladies find that certain \"antidepressants help with hot flashes. They ran me through several before I found one that worked for me. Some women do well with Paxil, some with Zoloft, some with Wellbutrin; for me, Effexor was the \"miracle drug\" that let me sleep at night. When I see a new doctor, they always ask about\n my \"depression.\" LOL. I was never depressed... I just needed to be able to sleep through the night without waking up 10 to 20 times with the \"covers on/covers off\" routine. My hubby was thrilled when it worked as well... he was tired of me throwing the covers on top of him and then pulling them off of him!\nGood luck in finding something that works for you. Most importantly, talk to the doctors! Tell them this they need to help you address these issues!\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Wow. This is a tough one. If I were you, I would insist on going to a breast specialist (here in the US, we have \"breast centers\") to figure all of this out. Cysts are fluid filled. Tumors are solid. So on an ultrasound, the two do not look alike. Some cysts, complex cysts, have fluid in them, but they also have \"junk\" in them. It is rare, but sometimes these cysts have some cancer cells in them. Often they aspirate and look at the \"junk\" to see if they find any cancer cells. Biopsy is always the surest way to rule out cancer, though. \nAs far as dense breasts go, I also had dense breasts. My first mammo came back negative for any signs of cancer and stated breast density as their CYB clause. Fortunately, my doctor insisted on biopsies, which even the surgeon thought was unnecessary, but agreed to because my doctor insisted. I had two different types of invasive breast cancer. Surgeon also said he didn't feel anything \"suspicious\" in axillary nodes (I had thought they were \"just cysts\"), but had three nodes that were cancerous. \nSo if you are uncomfortable with the way things are going, I would encourage to look further until you get answers that you can live with. I was 36 at the time. Had my family doctor not been as proactive as he was, I don't know how many years I would have had before my cancers were discovered, and I seriously doubt that I would be alive today to be answering your post. \nI don't intend to scare you. But you can't let doctors intimidate you! This is your body, your health, and ultimately your life we are talking about\n here! \nLet me know how things go. \nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Lumps and bumps in your breasts are to be expected and are usually just normal breast tissue. At 16, you should be learning what is normal for you. You may find lumps and tenderness that are tied to your menstrual cycle and come and go at the same time every month. These are normal. Cysts are not uncommon, either. They can be aspirated, but they may come back. So if this is a cyst, and they use a needle to remove the fluid, don't be surprised or worried if it comes back. It is highly unlikely that you have breast cancer. 80% of all lumps that make it to biopsy are benign. At 16, I'm sure the likelihood is much less than that, even. \nBut good for you that you are willing to take your concerns to your doctor and do something about\n it! Most of the time when we have young girls come visit with concerns such as yours, they are either afraid or embarrassed to talk to their doctors. So keep being proactive! Get to know what is normal for you, and if you find something suspicious, trust me, you will know that it is different.\nHope this helps.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

      "Content": " Hi, DSB. With your family history, I would think you WOULD be able to find a surgeon who would do a prophylactic double mastectomy, and I would think your insurance would cover it. This is obviously not a cosmetic surgery, and there is reason to believe that this might significantly reduce your chances of getting breast cancer in the future, which would save the insurance company $$$. Hysterectomies to avoid future problems are pretty commonplace; if you think about\n it, the mastectomies would be no different, really. OF course, it depends on whether you have really good insurance (thank goodness if you do!), or really bad insurance (which is becoming more and more common, unfortunately!).\nI don't think a needle biopsy will make any cancer that you might have spread. But I would agree with you that a surgical biopsy would be a better choice. Remove the suspicious area altogether. \nAnother note: a double mastectomy will go a long way in alleviating your risk of breast cancer, that is true. But it doesn't entirely eliminate it. No matter how good the surgeon, it is impossible to remove every breast tissue cell, and those remaining cells could still develop breast cancer. Of course, your odds of that happening are very slim, but you still need to be vigilant about\n examining the breast area and have your gyn check you every year, as well.\nGood luck in your quest to find the right surgeon. A good breast center would be the place to start, I would think.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Parabens and aluminum have both been suspect. A causal link has never been established between deodorants and breast cancer. The studies that have been done haven't really proved anything. It's kind of like the study that concludes that, because people eat more ice cream in the summer and more crimes occur in the summer, ice cream consumption rates can be linked with crime. \nThe study related to breast cancer and deodorants has the same flaw. They found that women who start using deodorants and shaving their armpits at an early age were more likely to develop breast cancer earlier than other women. Now, the problem with this study is this: young girls begin shaving and using deodorant when the hormones start raging... also about\n the same time they start wearing bras and start their monthly periods. We already know that early maturation is a risk factor for breast cancer, so how does that show any correlation to using deodorants? Why isn't there an increase of bilateral breast cancers? And why does this not increase the risk of developing breast cancer in men?\nAnyway, I think that Arm and Hammer makes a deodorant that is free of parabens and aluminum. Secret makes a natural deodorant that uses calcium carbonate. And some people swear by Milk of Magnesia, vinegar, or alcohol.

      "Content": " Hi, K.T. Mammograms. Mammograms in younger women are not a definitive answer. Younger women have denser breast tissue, and that tissue often reads white, hiding tumors and other masses. I had a mammogram at 36 because I had two lumps in my breast. Showed no abnormalities. My doctor insisted on a biopsy. Two days after I was diagnosed with two different types of invasive breast cancer, I got a very nice letter from the hospital saying my mammogram showed no signs of cancer, and I should go back when I turned 40. Mammograms can miss as many as 30% of breast cancers. So I hope your doctor is not going only by your mammogram.\nBreast cancer doesn't usually hurt. \"Usually\" is the key word here. Mine didn't hurt. But I know several women who did have pain as a result of there tumors. It is not that uncommon. And I don't know how breast reduction would affect that.\nChances are, your doctor is right. This is probably not cancer. But to dismiss the pain that you are experiencing simply because it is probably not breast cancer is not good enough. You could have adhesions from your reduction and your weight gain is causing the adhesions to pull. You could have some type of infection. But whatever it is, it needs to be addressed, and my personal feeling is that castor oil with heat is not going to make a big difference.\nIf your doctor won't get to the bottom of this, then maybe you could consult another doctor. \nHope you get some answers!\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

If I were him, I would be throwing a major fit with the technicians or radiologists who made this determination for him. At least they did an ultrasound. You are right, it is probably nothing, but here's the good news... breast cancer is a slow-growing cancer, so if there is something suspicious there, three weeks would probably be insignificant in terms of outcome. Lots of women have to wait 6 weeks or more to get a mammogram, weeks more to get a biopsy, and weeks more for surgery, even after their doctors have identified a suspicious lump.\nHope it is nothing more than inflamed tissue. And sorry you were treated so poorly! I knew a young lady who was diagnosed at 19, and she passed away at the age of 25, after a 6 year battle with the disease. So probably, this is nothing.

      "Content": " Hi Nan. I agree with you, the changes to our bodies are not always easy to live with. I remember sitting in my daughter's 8th grade graduation. I was so pissed! I was beet red from the Adriamycin, wearing a very uncomfortable wig and false eyelashes because of the chemotherapy, sweating like crazy from hot flashes, and wondering if I would live long enough to see my next one go through her 8th grade graduation, much less high school graduations. I knew full well that none of the other mothers there were wearing wigs or hot flashing or thinking about\n how long they might live. It was horrible. \nAfter 17 years, I'm finally letting my blonde hair grow long again. I'm really too old for it now, but really, I was afraid to let it grow long again, for fear that I would lose it all again. I saw both of my daughters graduate high school, college, and Master's programs! Looking forward to seeing my oldest get her PhD in a couple of years, even! And I've even gotten to see my first granddaughter's birth. And I have felt so blessed to have lived to see all these things come to pass in my children's lives. I don't know that all those other mothers realized how precious those moments were, as I did. Our perspectives do change!\nI posted some info on antidepressants to your other post, so be sure to read that, too. Just know that, this too, shall pass. Life does get better again. \nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

However, male breast enlargement following a prostectomy is often normal.

      "Content": " Oh, I'm so sorry, dj. That really sucks, but the good news is, you've found it, and now you will be doing something about\n it. I don't think all women go to specialists. My surgeon did a lot of breast cancer surgeries, but he did other surgeries as well. I had two types of invasive cancer, so I had to have a mastectomy, but you may have the option of a lumpectomy, I don't know. So ask lots of questions about\n what type of surgery the surgeon is recommending and why. Most insurances will pay for a second opinion, in which case you could pick your own surgeon and choose the one you feel most comfortable with. It might have to be someone who is covered under your plan, depending on what kind of plan you have. If they are recommending a mastectomy, ask about\n reconstructive surgery and who they would recommend for that. You should be able to get second opinions on reconstruction as well. Most plastic surgeons will have pictures of reconstructive surgeries that they have done. Ask to see them. \nAsk what type of lymph node surgery they are recommending. Will they do a sentinel node biopsy (they inject dye and see which lymph node catches it first... they take that node and one or two others and assume they can determine lymph node invasion based on that), or will they do a traditional lymph node dissection (they take a sample of several lymph nodes and look for cancer in them.) Ask why.\nIf you can think of anything else, please let us know. Again, sorry you are joining our ranks, but I'm so glad you took your company's offer of a free mammogram! How old are you, BTW...\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

Usually if you're at a breast center and have diagnostic testing done, the radiologist will speak with you, show you what they have been looking at, and explain why (or why not) they are concerned. If you are going in for a screening, you just get the test, thanks, and call your doctor in a day or two. \nIf you want a surgical biopsy instead of a needle anything, then there is no reason for your hubby to be there, unless you just really want him there for moral support. If you're comfortable with your current surgeon, I would think most any good surgeon would be capable of a simple biopsy.

I called back, and the nurse told me that all my bloodwork looked good, my scans had all come back clean... but my mammogram came back showing a mass in my remaining breast. My thoughts at the time were, \"Oh thank goodness it's just in the breast!\" Of course, I was sure it was cancer, but I still had to wait six weeks to get compression views done that showed there was nothing. Nada. Not a thing. It was a relief, but it is funny how our perspective changes.\nHope that next year, all goes well. \nHugs,\nBEV\nP.S. And here all this time I thought you were a tea drinker!

      "Content": " You can always ask for a biopsy. With a cyst, they can do a fine needle aspiration. Sometimes, a cyst will have \"junk\" in it. Think orange juice... without pulp is my favorite. The kind with the pulp floating around in it? Yuck! That would be a cyst with junk in it. And then, very rarely, there will be a seed that gets through the juicing process. This would be the rare cyst with junk it it that has a stray cancer cell. This is very rare, but not impossible. 6 months, in terms of breast cancer, isn't very long. The smallest mass that will be found on a mammogram would usually have to grow for another three years before it would be a palpable mass. And the cancer probably started growing years before that. So you could wait, you could ask for a fine needle aspiration, or you could ask for a biopsy. Somewhere around 80% of biopsies are benign, even with all the technology we have, but sometimes a small scar is worth you peace of mind.\nHope this helps.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

I wish I could give you an answer, but I'm not a medical professional, and there are so many things that this could be! It doesn't necessarily have to be cancer. There are benign tumors (phyllodes tumors) that can grow very quickly. Your reference to broccoli brought that to mind, because they usually grow from a central \"stalk\" with a cluster of tumors at the \"head.\" I don't think they are typically painful, but they can be very fast growing. They are also pretty rare. Even more rarely, they can be cancerous.

      "Content": " Hi, Cant... Pathology reports. We aren't medical professionals here, but I'll give you my thoughts on your report. First of all, the report says that \"findings are consistent with an inflammatory process.\" This isn't the same as \"inflammatory breast cancer.\" An inflammatory process could be any number of things, but inflammatory breast cancer is not actually an inflammatory process, as far as I know... It is called \"inflammatory\" because of its appearance (redness, heat, and swelling). The hyperemia is increased blood flow to the area, which is consistent with an inflammatory process. Remember, these are just my thoughts on the report. I can't say that your pathologist shares my understanding of IBC. \nYour mammogram reports indicates that there is something going on with the nipple and areola, obviously, but really doesn't indicate what they are thinking this is, although it could be a result of an inflammatory process, or it could possibly be Paget's Disease from the descript\nion. Again, just my thoughts. \nThe best place to get answers is your doctor or surgeon. I'm sorry you are having such a hard time getting answers. It is really difficult to wait for answers, but when you just get answers without any explanation, that's even worse!\nQuestions to ask:\n1) Do I have inflammatory breast cancer?\n2) Do I have Paget's disease?\n(If the answer is Neither, then what is the official diagnosis?)\n3) Why did the surgeon say he removed an abscess, and the pathology report says there is no abscess? \n4) How do we treat this?\n5) Why has it taken so long to get answers??? (That one is for me! LOL)\nAgain, hope you get some real answers soon.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

My first biopsies (they took two lumps from the same incision), was on 11 November. The doctor made the incision right around the areola. By the time I had my mastectomy on Dec 6, you couldn't even tell where the biopsy had been done. I realize that some people bruise more easily than others, but really! Have you called the surgeon before this to report what's going on? \nI would definitely want to know why there is bloody discharge, why there is a hard flat spot under the incision, and why it itches like mad. Next question: What is he/she going to do about\n it???\nHugs to you...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

I know one woman who has been through chemo so many times I've lost count... 5 or 6, I think, and she still alive and kicking!

I know that they are typically not aggressive cancers, even though they may appear to be more aggressive than they actually are. They are typically not as likely to spread as some other breast cancers. Some doctors feel that chemo and radiation are not necessary follow-up, but some doctors believe it should be done as a precaution. The key word here is \"typically,\" and I don't know if your mom's cancer is typical for medullary breast cancer or not. Only your mom's doctors can tell you that. \nIf they advise chemo and radiation, it certainly doesn't hurt to get a second opinion. Hope this helps.\nHugs to you and your mom\nBEV ",

We had very similar treatments. Her prognosis was better than mine, all things considered. Next week will be four years since we lost her. \nA friend of ours was diagnosed with colon cancer a few years ago. He underwent all the surgery and chemo, but it was a difficult battle, physically and emotionally for him. He lost his home because of the medical bills. He lost his wife, who went searching for greener pastures...a woman he thought was his soulmate. To tell the truth, I think he'd have preferred the cancer had killed him, because he has not heart for living anymore.\nWe all just do what we think is best for us. Some of us get lucky. Some of us don't. Chemo, you know, isn't a cure for cancer. The hope is that chemo will buy five extra years of health. For me, 6 months for 5 more years meant seeing my daughters graduate high school. A small price to pay. I watched the birth of my first grandbaby a couple of years after that. Last month, I got to see my oldest graduate college. What a bonus! Those six months I gave up have been worth the price over and again. \nMy brother just got married this last month. Also a cancer survivor. Double bonus! \nAnyway, just want you to know that, whatever path you choose, it is the best one for you because you chose it. Don't let other people's paths confuse you.\nThis board is a give and take kind of place. Sometimes we give, and sometimes we take. And sometimes we just have fun!!!\nTake care...\nBev ",

      "Content": " Hi, Lisa. The good news is that you have had regular mammograms. Microcalcifications are fairly common. When they see clusters, sometimes, but not always by any means, it can be an indication of cancer. Usually if it is cancerous, it is very early stage, especially if you have had regular mammograms. \nListen, a week is really good! I had already had breast cancer and a single mastectomy when my mammogram on my remaining breast showed a \"mass.\" It took 6 weeks for me to get an appointment to have follow-up imaging! \nI had one biopsy done where I found out while I was still on the table that my lumps were cancerous. I had another biopsy done at a different hospital, and it was a week before I got results. So how long it takes really depends on where you are at. Sometimes at a breast center, you will find out that day. So yes, it really just depends.\nJust remember that worrying now is not going to change the results later. So try not to worry until you know there is something to stress about\n. (I know... much easier said than done!)\nTake care, and i hope your clusters are benign. Let us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

Usually compression views are done to verify an abnormal finding on a mammogram. Ultrasound has definite limitations. It doesn't have good spatial resolution, so better detail is found in a mammogram. An ultrasound is only as effective as the technologist is skilled. It may not pick up a deeply seated mass. Ultrasound typically doesn't pick up microcalcifications. And imaging depends on the contrast between the mass and the surrounding breast tissue. \nHope this helps.

As to when is the best time to do a mammogram, there are mixed opinions and conflicting studies. Some say that the beginning of the menstrual cycle is best, because breast tissue is less dense. Some say that is the worst time, because the breasts are more tender, and the technicians don't \"flatten\" the breast as much because the patient complains of pain. Some say it really doesn't matter. \nLet us know how your callback goes.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

      "Content": " Oh, Lmarie... it is so hard, I know. You know, when I was going through treatment, the most important thing to me was to keep my life as \"normal\" as possible. Some days, all I could do was put one foot in front of the other to keep going, but that's what I did. And I tried to keep a smile on my face and humor on my tongue, because otherwise I might just cry and scream and fall apart. I did the same as you, I went out and got very long hair whacked off short before it fell out, went wig shopping... my hubbie went with me, and I let him pick out my new hair. Oh, my, it was some big hair! Letting him pick was probably not the best decision I ever made! But he thought I looked beautiful in it, so what the heck! I was always smashing it down, and he was always fluffing it up. It really didn't matter, because the only time I wore the thing was when I was at work. Sinead O'Connor was big then (I'm dating myself here!), so I could easily go out with the bald head and get mistaken for a teenager, especially when I was with my teenaged daughters! But initially, the loss of that long blonde hair that my husband loved so much was worse than losing the breast. \nI remember one of my doctors telling me, \"we're thinking about\n the long term here, we're not even going to think about\n you leaving us anytime soon.\" I tried to keep that hope he had like a promise in my heart. And there were days that were bad, but there were days that were good as well. So you just have to get yourself through the bad days, and enjoy every minute of the good ones. Easier said than done, I know. It sounds kind of silly, but when I was down, I would tell myself that I could get hit by a bus tomorrow and be just as dead, so I shouldn't waste my time grieving over breast cancer. Might not work for everyone, but we all find our ways, no matter how ridiculous they sound to others, and we deal with it the best we can. \nHugs to you!\nBEV\n ",

What I found to be the main problem was that I was very small, and for the amount of skin that they had to remove to reconstruct the breast, it didn't leave much to pull together for my belly. It was weeks before I could lay flat on my back, and months before I could lay on my belly and prop on my elbows. It was about\n two years before I became completely free of that feeling that your sister describes. But I think it really depends on how much \"extra\" skin you have to \"share.\"\nMy plastic surgeon's nurse was diagnosed a couple of years after I was... when I went in for my two-year check-up, she complained of the same feeling and wanted to know how long it would last... she was 6 mos. post-op. I reminded her that she was the one who had told me I would be back to my old self in 6-8 weeks! \nI hope your sister will ask for a referral to a good physical therapist. It never hurts to have a professional help with some stretches and myofacial release to minimize adhesions. Been there, didn't do that, and will always regret that I didn't insist they give me a referral.\nHope this helps...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

However, a mammogram is not necessarily going to determine what this lump in the armpit is. They don't do mammograms on the armpit, they do mammograms on breasts. So it doesn't answer the question of why there is a lump in your mom's armpit. It just means that she probably doesn't have breast cancer.\nEnlarged lymph nodes can indicate lots of different things, from infection to cancer. It could also be a cyst, in which case it is nothing to worry about\n. Personally, I would want to know what, for sure, it is... lymph node or cyst.

      "Content": " First of all, this may not be breast cancer, so don't bury yourself yet! I was kind of where you are 17 years ago. I had lost my own mother to cancer when I was 7. When I was 36, I found a lump in my breast that felt different, went to the doctor, he found a second lump, ordered a mammogram. Mammogram said all is well. No sign of cancer. Doctor insisted on a biopsy. Two types of invasive breast cancer later, the surgeon told me, \"this is not the end of the world.\" Easy for him to say! I thought this was the beginning of the end for me. Did I mention that this was 17 years ago? Yes, I think I did. LOL\nThe good news is, this very well might not be a breast cancer. Cysts are not breast cancer. A sonogram will determine if a mass is fluid-filled. It could also be a fibroadenoma (benign breast tumor) that has been there for years, since you cannot feel it, even now. \nSo try not to dig your grave until you know what is going on! I know how hard it is to watch someone you love die from this disease. We never want our loved ones to go through that. But they get through it. You have. I have. And fingers crossed, our children won't have to see either of us go out that way.\nLet us know what you hear from your doctor.

      "Content": " Okay, so what your report referring to is that it has metastasized to the lymph nodes (technically speaking, when there is cancer in the lymph nodes, it is considered \"metastatic;\" however, when we talk about\n \"mets,\" we are referring to distant mets... to the bones, liver, lungs, brain). With 5/10 lymph nodes, I assume they did initial scans to determine whether or not there are any distant mets. So yes, I would think you should have the scans repeated at this point. Chemo is given in the hopes that it will kill any cancer cells that have escaped the lymphatic system; if it doesn't, then it can take years for few stray cells to grow to a size that it can be detected on a scan, if it isn't a particularly aggressive cancer. Many years ago, chemo was only supposed to buy us 5 years or so. Since they have been finding tumors earlier, survival rates have really gone up.\nHowever... that still doesn't mean that your cancer is back! All you know, for sure, is that your CA 27-29 has gone up a bit. Some women with distant mets have numbers in the thousands! And several women I have known didn't have tumor markers rise until after they were already having symptoms (bone pain, for example). So have the scans, and then you'll have a better idea of what is going on.\nHope that helps...\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

Typically, breast cancer is not painful; however, this is not always the case. Do you have a family history of breast cancer? It is more common in men who have a family history of breast cancer (male or female) and is sometimes linked to the BRCA-2 genetic mutation (prostate cancer is also associated with BRCA-2. I didn't seek out genetic testing for breast cancer until my brother was diagnosed with prostate cancer). You mentioned also that you took drugs that are to reduce the size of the prostate.

      "Content": " As far as path reports go, that is a pretty good report. ER/PR positive means that your cancer likes female hormones for fuel, so you can take hormone blockers, such as Tamoxifen or Arimidex. They are particularly effective for women who are post-menopausal (typically meaning over 55). HER-2 negative is also a bit better than positive, because it is typically less aggressive cancer, as your Grade 1 would indicate. So even though cancer is never \"good,\" you have indications that your cancer could be easier to treat than other types might be. Since your father had breast cancer, of course, there is a higher likelihood that your cancer is genetic. How you go about\n dealing with that is a very personal decision. Many women who have genetic cancers choose to have a double mastectomy to minimize their chances of developing breast cancer in the other breast. So that is something to think about\n. \nHope this helps.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

If anything happened to me, I didn't know how my husband would ever be able to get them through the teenage years. My oldest had to take her private HS entrance exams while I was being wheeled into surgery for my mastectomy. I felt so sorry for her, but it was important that she did that, and she aced it, but still... it was awful knowing that she would be sitting there taking such an important test and I would be the big thing on her mind. I sat in her 8th grade graduation ceremony, bald and hot flashing like crazy, wondering if I would even live to see the next one go through her 8th grade graduation the following year, much less see them graduate from high school! I made it through all that, though, and trying to keep my life as normal as possible was critical, as far as I'm concerned. Not saying that I didn't have my pity parties, but I just kept putting one foot in front of the other until I got there. Both of my daughters have their Master's degrees now, and the older one is working on her PhD, the younger one concentrating on being a mom for now... and believe me, I plan to see that grandbaby through her PhD, if that is what she wants to do!

      "Content": " Niki... women can have very lumpy breasts and not have breast cancer. If the ultrasound showed a cyst, then you can always have your doctor aspirate the cyst. Ultrasound is designed to differentiate fluid-filled masses from solid masses. Breast cancer tumors are solid masses. On very rare occasions in complex cysts, there can be cancerous cells in \"sludge.\" Again, this is rare. The best way to be sure this is \"just a cyst\" is to aspirate the fluid and have it checked. \nIf your doctor feels other lumps that are suspicious, that is something else. Because you are young, mammography doesn't always pick up cancerous lumps. (I was 36, and my mammogram missed two invasive cancers.) Your doctor should be a good judge of what is \"normal\" lumpiness and what is not. And if you do routine breast exams, you should be able to feel what is normal for you! (I knew that my cancers felt different from my usual lumpy, bumpy breasts).\nSo when you see your doctor, you need to find out specifically what other kinds of lumps the doctor feels. And talk about\n having the cyst aspirated. \nHope this helps...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

If you can't get a referral to a breast specialist who could give you answers about\n infection and further treatment, I don't know what to tell you.

I've seen \"chubbie\" women who have extra flaps of skin under the arm, and \"chubbie\" women who don't. I think it really depends on the size of the breast and the angle of the mastectomy scar. You could probably have a revision at some point in the future and have the extra skin under the arm removed. I would consult a plastic surgeon for a revision... don't just go to your regular surgeon.\nAs far as the tightness in the chest, I would ask for a referral to a good physical therapist who has experience working with mastectomy patients. You don't want adhesions to develop, and you don't want to lose range of motion in your arms due to this tightness. \nSorry you are having to go through this again. Are you going to have chemo now?\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

Having moved more times than I can count, I'll tell you that it is a fact that we spend thousands of $$$ more the first couple of years after a move, because we're spending money on \"the house.\" So hopefully you are about\n through with that phase of moving! Money comes and money goes, and it isn't worth your health to worry about\n it. I know that is easier said than done, though.\nMK, I hope Carolyn will get the disability process started asap. I think Medicaire doesn't kick in for 2 years following approval for disability. Maybe that has changed, but that was the situation when my husband went on disability. It is a long wait when what you really need is the health coverage. I have a friend who is on disabilty for 18 months, and has been waiting for Medicaire to kick in so she can have a hip replacement surgery she desparately needs so she CAN get back to work! Talk about\n a SNAFU. There is Medicaid, but the financial restrictions of that are so stringent. \nKeep your head up, Ellen. Things will have to look better one of these days.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Sorry to hear that you are having to join our group, but glad to hear you are being proactive by getting a second opinion. Good for you! \nI was 36 when I was diagnosed with invasive ductal and lobular breast cancer. I had two young girls (they are both grown women now, and not far from the age I was at diagnosis!) I had lost my own mother to cancer when I was 7, so telling my girls and my dad... the hardest thing I ever had to do! Because I had lost my own mom, I was pretty convinced that this was the beginning of the end for me. And yet, here I am, 17 years later, telling you about\n it and feeling grateful for every day of those 17 years. When my surgeon confirmed that I had cancer, he blithely announced that \"this is not the end of the world.\" And I remember thinking, \"Yeah, that's easy for you to say. You're not the one with cancer. What are you going to say when you have to start taking out parts that I need?\" So far, that hasn't happened! \nDon't beat yourself up for not doing breast exams. That cancer has been growing for years without being palpable, so the time it took you to find it is probably not greatly significant in the long run.\nYou can get through this; most of us have felt like we weren't strong enough more than once, but you'd be surprised how strong you can be! Cry when you need to, rant and rage when you need to, but just remember that every party is best if it ends while you're still enjoying it, and that includes \"pity parties!\"\nTake care,and feel free to vent here.

Not all liver function tests actually measure liver function... some measure inflammation. So the tests you may have had due to a med you were taking may not be the same tests that you oncologist would run. Does that make sense? If you do have a fatty liver, I don't think they have to avoid chemo altogether. They may just need to treat the fatty liver disease so that chemo doesn't do more damage to the liver. \nYour oncologist sounds like he has your long term health interests placed first in his treatment plan. If your staging at 1 is correct, postponing chemo to get your liver in better health is probably not going to impact your outcome significantly. \nAlcie's input is quite valid, as well. Not all stage 1 brca patients decide to have chemo, although most oncs recommend it as standard of care. You didn't mention how old you are or what other health issues you have (since you have been on medication for 17 years).\nI hope this helps. Take care, and let us know how things go.\nBEV ",

I use Atkins, and you really have to read his book to understand the benefits of the diet.

It is hard not to go there, and probably more so for you, with the job you do.

But let me assure you, that is because most of the women who have callbacks don't ever have to post here again. I didn't have a callback when I was diagnosed. As a matter of fact, my two tumors were totally missed on my mammogram! My doctor insisted on a biopsy, anyway, because the masses were palpable. Several years later, I did have a callback for a \"mass\" in my remaining breast. I sweated it out for 6 weeks, sure that I had cancer again. They did compression views. Nothing. Nada. No mass. So hope your callback is the same. As far as family history... my mom died of cancer when I was seven. Lost two aunts to cancer. And then my brother was diagnosed a few years after I was. I had the genetic testing done, and, I was negative. I still think there is a familial link, but there is no proof of that for now.\nHope all goes well for you! Let us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

She may be the only one I get, but I take great pride in my grandpuppies, as well. \nMetastatic disease and mets are the same, yes. Not all oncologists follow tumor markers in patients who have no known mets because they are not completely reliable for diagnosing mets. Other things can affect tumor marker results and give \"false positives.\" For women who are already diagnosed with mets, then tumor markers are a bit more effective in tracking progression of the mets. The distinction is whether or not the doctors know for fact that there are mets. If you have mets to the bones, for example, and they are doing chemo, and tumor markers drop significantly, then that can be a good sign. They aren't going to want to do a bone scan every month to see if the chemo is working. If that same hypothetical patient with bone mets suddenly has a large jump in numbers, that can be a bad sign. If those numbers continue to go up, they might do scans again to see if they are losing ground and need to change treatment strategies. \nThe scans are the key to diagnosing mets. The tumor markers are only an indication of a possible problem. So have the scans done. \nWhy did they think your original cancer was \"most likely metastatic?\" \nHope this helps...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

All of our friends were upset that I had taken him to our smaller \"neighborhood\" hospital the last time he was sick, so I took him to one of the big, fancy hospitals further away. They admitted him, but never even gave him a breathing treatment and sent him home the following afternoon. When we got home, I found that he was satting at 85 percent. They never checked his sats before releasing him. I am just furious!

      "Content": " Johnson, I was 36 at dx as well, with 2 young girls. IF this is cancer, and biopsy is the only way to know for sure, then you will get through this. I found out I had cancer while I was still on the operating table, and the surgeon was closing his incision from my biopsy. The pathologist came and stood in the door, looking at me like he'd just shot Bambi's mother. When the nurse identified him as the pathologist, and he wanted to speak to the surgeon, I knew that this was not going to be good! The surgeon later told me that \"this is not the end of the world,\" but it sure seemed like it at the time. I had lost my mother to cancer when I was 7, and I couldn't help by wonder how old my own daughters would be, how much longer I would be there for them. That was 17 years ago. Two types of invasive cancer, lymph node involvement, mastectomy, reconstruction, and 9 rounds of chemo. I missed 6 weeks of work with my surgery, but I never missed a day of work throughout my chemo treatment. \nI would think that, IF this turns out to be cancer, then the surgeon will be able to recommend a good oncologist for you. I agree with Anne... I don't think a nurse practitioner should be dumping all of this on you. You should not have to be out shopping for oncologists and putting in FMLA papers. That's kind of hard to do without a diagnosis and a treatment plan in place. \nSo let's just hope she's got you all worried for nothing!\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

I would think that would be the first step. I would think, if this is infection, they might do some bloodwork to see what your white count is, and they might aspirate to see what, if anything, comes out of the mass. Or they might just put you on antibiotics to see if that takes care of the problem.\nAs a nursing student, you probably know this could very well be mastitis or other infection. I know our minds always go to breast cancer, but this doesn't sound like what I would think of as a \"classic\" presentation, even for inflammatory breast cancer, as there is usually not a large mass associated with the redness, pain, and swelling. \nI'm just glad you are seeing a doctor ASAP. Whatever it is, it obviously needs to be addressed quickly. \nOut of curiosity, why did you have the hysterectomy? And how long do they plan to keep you on HRT?\nTry not to worry too much... it accomplishes nothing and doesn't change the end result. But again....

I suspect that they are planning to give you Adriamycin and Cytoxin, then Taxol. Adriamycin is \"the red devil.\" I had 9 rounds of it when I went through chemo. And I have to agree-- you'll lose your hair if you have Adriamycin. That sucks, but it does grow back. I, too, missed my eyebrows and my eyelashes more than I missed the hair! My girls loved pulling my hair out for their friends' entertainment. Mine came in just like it was before, but some people get totally different hair! LOL\nI didn't have a port when I went through chemo. Some oncs like them, some don't. My closest friend had one, and she didn't have any problems with it. I had all my chemo through a regular IV. \nHope all goes well for you. Let us know how it goes!\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

      "Content": " Well, we'll take a cyst over a solid mass any day! When I think of simple cysts vs. complex cysts, I visualize them this way. Picture a glass of orange juice. A simple cyst would be like the \"no pulp\" juices... You take a drink, and it goes down nice and smooth. A complex cyst would be like the varieties with pulp in them. Some have more pulp, some have less, but when you look in the glass, you see \"stuff\" floating around, and when you take a drink, you feel the stuff as you sip it and swallow. With orange juice, we know what the \"stuff\" is... or at least we hope we do! With complex cysts, the \"debris\" could be lots of different things... very rarely, some of that \"stuff\" could be a stray cancer cell. It might be like finding a seed in your orange juice, instead of just pulp. So that is why they follow up in six months. \nThis, of course is an extremely simplified analogy. But this is the typical route that most doctors follow with complex cysts. It really is probably nothing. But if they see changes in 6 months, then they probably would want to aspirate or biopsy. 6 months, in terms of breast cancer, is a very short time. It is a slow-growing cancer, for the most part. \nI've read estimates that about\n 5 percent of cysts are classified as \"complex.\" Of that 5 percent, less that 1/2 of a percent are turn out to have malignant cells. \nAre you having your screenings done at a breast center? If you are, talk to your doctor about\n ordering a \"diagnostic\" mammogram instead of a \"screening\" next time. They usually schedule diagnostics on a day when the radiologist is on site, and then he/she reads your mammogram while you wait. If they want follow-up compression views or ultrasounds, they will typically do it right then and there, rather than having to reschedule with them for another day. \nHope this helps! And congrats on being the proud possessor of a cyst! LOL\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Hi, Mama...\nThis must be very scary for you and your daughter. Complex cysts are harder to differentiate from solid masses on ultrasound, which is why they want to make sure this is just a cyst. The main question is: what is inside? A needle aspiration will probably give you that answer, and an excision would not be necessary. If the fluid they draw out is questionable, then they could still order a surgical biopsy. It is not uncommon for young girls to have cysts or other lumps and bumps, dense breast tissue, or fibrocystic breast disease, which are all benign conditions and not precursors for breast cancer. It would be rare for a 13-year-old to have breast cancer, but that is no guarantee. So your doctors are being very thorough, and you can be thankful that they are! A lot of doctors poo-poo young women for their concerns and dismiss their lumps and bumps as \"nothing to worry about\n,\" without further investigation.\nAs far as which to choose, needle or surgical biopsy, only you, your daughter, and your surgeon can make that decision. If this is just a cyst, and you opt to have a needle aspiration, then the cyst will probably fill back up with fluid and reappear. On very rare occasions, an cancer is missed on needle aspiration. If you opt for a surgical excision, your daughter will be losing some breast tissue, and this could make her self-conscious about\n the look of her breasts as she continues to develop and mature. When chances are it is not cancer, and the excision would be overkill, then that might be a big sacrifice for a 13-year-old. \nLet us know how things go. We'll be thinking about\n you two and hoping for good results, no matter the method you choose.\nHugs to you both...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Well, I agree with the other responses about\n getting a new doctor. No one deserves to be treated like you were treated. I had what the call \"fibrocystic breast disease\" when I was young and cute and had two breasts (LOL). My breasts were lumpy and bumpy and sometimes, those lumps and bumps are extremely painful, other times they are not. I was given all kinds of advice, such as take A, avoid caffeine, go on birth control... none of those things worked for me, personally. Apparently, this does work for some women, according to doctors; however. I've never met any of those women! And for reference, fibrocystic breast disease is not consider a precursor to breast cancer, so that is good to know. Another good thing to know is that breast cancer is slow growing, compared to many other cancers. Most breast cancers are 8-10 years old before they can be detected on a mammogram, and of course, they can typically be detected by mammogram before they are palpable. So suggesting you try Vitamin A for a month is not as if the gyn is condemning you to a death sentence if you were to be diagnosed with breast cancer. If she is considering this could be a breast cancer, suggesting that you avoid becoming pregnant before you know what this is could even be plausible. Breast cancers are often hormone driven, and you probably know that pregnancy is a hormonal roller coaster for a woman. Medically, I don't think she is on totally shaky ground with anything. \nHowever, to not explain her reasoning to you or give you any information and to treat you as if you are not worth her time and effort are just plain inexcusable. Ask a friend, a co-worker, someone at church or at the gym for a good gyn and get a second opinion. Most insurances will cover. \nLet us know how it goes, okay?\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Hi, LLL... Sorry you are having to come here to ask questions! So I'll try to give you some info on what is going on. There are often two types of mammography appointments; there are screening mammograms, where they typically have a technician take films, make sure they are good, and then a radiologist looks at them later, and there are diagnostic mammograms, where a radiologist (who is a Dr.) reads your films and orders any additional tests right there. Sometimes they will even do a biopsy at that appointment. \nSo the questions that you ask here are the same ones you should ask the doctor. As long as there are no complications, a biopsy is not a big deal. You can typically go back to work the next day. It's what I'd call a \"band-aid\" surgery. Some doctors will give you results on the phone, some call you back in for an appointment. Ask your doctor how his office handles it. \n80% of the lumps that make it to biopsy are benign. So try not to worry too much. I know it's a big shock when even the possibility of cancer looms in your life, so you're entitled worry just a little bit. ;)\nLet me know what the surgeon says. Hope all goes well for you.\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

      "Content": " Janice is right, that is a tough one! My insurance pays 80% for major medical, then we pay 20% until we hit our maximum out of pocket, which is 2500.00 per person. So check out for sure how your major medical works. The good news is that it is the first of the year, so your deductible would be met for the whole year! Any elective procedures you have been putting off??? Small consolation, huh. What type of biopsy are they considering? A surgical biopsy would probably cost more, for instance, than a needle biopsy, but a surgical biopsy would give the most definitive answer. And typically insurance companies will have a negotiated cost for a procedure, so what the \"cost\" is, according to the breast center, may actually be lower when you find out what your insurance company's negotiated cost is. You can ask your insurance company for an estimate on the actual cost to you. I would also check out to see what someplace like the Komen Foundation could do to help, if it is really a significant financial hardship for you.\nPlease let us know what you find out. I always like to err on the side of caution, but when 80% of all biopsies are negative, it is harder to say, \"have the biopsy.\"\nHugs...\nBEV ",

Did they possibly refer to the lump as a \"lipoma?\" These often don't show up on mammogram or ultrasound. They are basically encapsulated fat that creates a lump similar to what you described. They often do a fine needle aspiration or a core biopsy just to be sure that it is, in fact, fat in the lump. Dense breast tissue is common for younger women, but it can hide a myriad of things, including cancerous lumps (I had two, and both were missed by mammography). So personally, I think you are wise to be getting a second opinion. Hope he agrees that this is nothing to be worried about\n.

      "Content": " Hi, Kim. So, is the only mass they found in your armpit? Or did they actually find something in the breast? A mass can be many things. The fact that they are doing an ultrasound means that they are looking to see if this lump is fluid-filled, which would most likely be non-cancerous. Of course this is a scarey thing! Anytime there is the suspicion of cancer, it is downright terrifying. Especially for a mother of 6! As mothers, that is the first place our minds go, to \"what happens if... \"\nTry not to worry too much. August 5th sounds like a long time away, but really, that's pretty quick. Here in the U.S., we often have to wait six weeks or more for follow-up tests. So it really is a process of \"hurry up and wait.\"\nLet us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

Instead, they use age 50 and above as post-menopausal, under 50 as pre-menopausal. Several studies have shown that \"post-menopausal\" women with high hormone receptors do really well with hormone therapy. \nPersonally, I was er/pr positive, but just barely, and I was pre-menopausal (36). When chemo put me into menopause, it really didn't matter... 36 is under 50, so for treatment purposes, I was still classified as \"pre-menopausal.\" So didn't make a lot of sense for me to take hormones. \nBTW... You are the first person I've heard say that the isolated radiation has been suggested! I'm so excited to know that! Would love to hear how that goes for you, if you have it. \nHope your next surgeon appointment goes well, too. \nHugs...\nBEV ",

Congratulations! There is no evidence of cancer on your mammogram! Unfortunately, the two lumps in my breast begged to differ with the radiologist. I thank my lucky stars every day that I had a doctor who insisted on biopsies, even though the mammo read \"clean.\" I had two different types of invasive breast cancer at the age of 36. Today, I'm 52 and have been NED since mastectomy and chemo those many years ago. \nYour biopsies may be benign, and odds are on your side that they will be. But if they aren't, whoever is recommending biopsies could be saving your life. Thank him, either way for his care and attention. Too many women come here who do not get that level of care. \nAnd we'll be hoping those biospies come back benign! Let us know how it goes.\nHugs!\nBEV\n ",

If your family has a genetic link, then you could think about\n prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction. \nI was dxed at 36 with 2 types of breast cancer. My mom died of cancer at 45, but I also have a cousin with breast cancer, an aunt with ovarian cancer, a brother with prostate cancer, another aunt with adenocarcinoma of the lung... the list goes on! I had the genetic testing done at my daughters' request, and... no gene. \nSince I was dxed, I have had a \"mass\" identified in my remaining breast through mammography. Went back... no mass. I've also had a mass removed that didn't show on mammogram that was benign. BTW, neither of my cancerous tumors showed up on mammogram. \nSo try not to put the cart before the horse! You're thinking about\n chemo before you even know if there is a reason for it! Chemo is not a picnic, but I never missed a day of work because of chemo. They've got terrific drugs that deal with the side effects. \nSo take a breath, as smurfy suggested, and try not to worry about\n all the \"what-if's.\" Easier said than done, I know!

      "Content": " I don't say this to scare you, but I was right where you are 17 years ago. I was 36, found a lump that felt different from the usual, watched it through a couple of cycles, and there was no change. Went to a new family doctor (we had just moved), who also found the same small lump, as well as a second one, and some enlarged lymph nodes. He ordered my first mammogram, which showed nothing significant, but did note dense breast tissue. This is where our stories part. My new doctor called a surgeon, made me an appointment himself, and then called me and told me to go, even though I didn't see the need if the mammo said \"no indication of cancer.\" (I learned later that as many as 30% of breast cancers aren't found on a mammogram, largely because of dense breast tissue.) The surgeon didn't think my little lumps were anything, didn't feel anything under the arm, but would do a biopsy because my doctor had been so insistent. I was diagnosed with two different types of invasive breast cancer before the surgeon had even finished closing the incision. When I had my mastectomy, there was also lymph node involvement. I love that family doctor! \nNow for the good news. Yes, odds are definitely on your side that this will be nothing. Enlarged lymph nodes can mean a lot of different things, only one of which is cancer. This is because the nodes act as \"filters\" for the lymphatic system and are often the first indication of cancerous invasion. But they are much more likely to be an indication of an infection. Lymph node involvement in breast cancer is fairly common, and it usually just means treatment needs to be more aggressive than if it is not present. (In other words... chemotherapy to destroy any stray cells that may have gotten by the \"filtration system.\") Even if this is cancer, the 6-8 months that have passed since your initial mammogram is not very long, in terms of most breast cancers, which are typically slow growing. So that is the good news.\nAs for a second opinion, I think it depends on how comfortable you feel with the doctor's recommendations after the digital mammo and us. If he recommends a biopsy, I wouldn't really find a need for a second opinion, I'd just go head and have it. A small price to pay for peace of mind. If he doesn't recommend a biopsy, I would want to feel that I had a clear and complete explanation of why there is a lump and why there are enlarged lymph nodes, and I would probably want a second opinion that concurs. \nI didn't know anyone with breast cancer 17 years ago, either. And if I had had a doctor who told me \"it was nothing,\" I never would have even thought to ask for another opinion or insist on a biopsy. I didn't have the internet or support groups. So I'm glad I'm able to share my experience with you. Again, not to scare you, but just to let you know that you need to be your own best advocate and get the answers you need to feel comfortable and safe in your own body. \nHope this helps...\nHugs...\nBEV\nBev\nBreast Cancer forum moderator ",

And if these spots are too small for a biopsy, they might be too small to show on a bone scan. My oncologist has always erred on the side of caution and done follow-up tests, but she has never told me she thought I had mets when I didn't. I did have a family doctor tell me I had mets, based on a bone scan, when I didn't, but I had gone to get follow-up tests from her since my onc was out of the country for a few days. I was pretty furious with that doctor, especially when my onc got back, ordered the follow-ups, and the spots were not mets. \nI think going to another doctor for a second opinion is the right thing for you to do. What were the actual findings on the PET? Did you get a copy of the report? \nHugs...\nBEV ",

They did incision at he edge of the areola, and by the time I had surgery a few weeks later, you couldn't tell where the surgery was done. If they take out much tissue, you may have a slight depression for awhile, but it eventually will fill in. I had another biopsy on my remaining breast a few years later. I have about\n a 1 1/2 inch scar from that one. I took Tylenol with codeine the day of the surgery. After that, didn't need anything. I had no restrictions on lifting. I work with infants and toddlers with disabilities, so I do quite a bit of lifting in my job... the babies don't weigh a lot, but those toddlers can pack on the pounds! LOL\nHope you get benign results. Let us know when your surgery is. We'll send good thoughts your way.\nHugs....\nBEV\n ",

I was 7 at the time. So when I was diagnosed with breast cancer at 36, I pretty much thought I was done for! December 6 will be 16 years out from my surgery date. I like to think that maybe some of the experimental treatments my mom had back then helped advance the treatments that have given me so many added years and health and well-being. \nHave you thought about\n having genetic testing done, even if this is not cancer?

You will have a better idea of what your mom is dealing with when her scans come back. I did have an acquaintance who had 13 lymph nodes that were positive, and last time I saw her, she had 10 years under her belt. Did your mom have regular mammograms? Either this cancer has been growing for quite awhile, or it would appear to be very aggressive. Besides knowing HER status, I would want to know (if she were my mom), ER/PR status (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor); if your mom is ER/PR positive, especially if she has been on hormones for menopause, she could respond very well to hormone blockers. ER/PR positive tends to respond a bit better to chemo, as well. \nPlease let us know what happens on Thursday. Sending hugs your way and good thoughts your mom's way...\nBEV ",

Personally, I was given a choice. I chose not to take them. I was young, I had very low positive ER/PR scores, and chemo put me into early menopause. There was no clear cut, \"yes, you should take them,\" and most of the research at the time said there was no evidence that they would significantly benefit me, if they were of benefit at all. I know people who have taken them for a few years, stopped taking them, and then within a few months were dx'ed with mets. I know people who have been told they should take them for life and are doing fine. I know people who have never taken them and are doing fine. \nWith AI's, I think age at diagnosis and ER/PR status are the most important factors. But most people I know who take them begin shortly after they finish other treatments. So again I'm wondering, why are they insisting now?\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I had two types of invasive breast cancer, both of them missed on my mammogram. I don't think I'd be here if my doctor hadn't insisted on a biopsy. And the younger you are, the more dense the breast tissue, the more likely that a cancer will go undetected. That said, as many as 80% of all breast biopsies are noncancerous.

My grandpuppy, Sasha, had surgery on Wednesday to remove her spleen and a very large (bigger than a softball, smaller than a basketball) tumor attached to it. We should get results tomorrow as to whether or not it is cancer. My daughter brought her back here for the surgery. She had to head back to school today (12 hours away), so we are keeping little Sash until she gets her staples out. Then I had my hubby take our much beloved Rottie to the vet about\n two weeks ago because I thought he was working hard to breathe. Vet pronounced him perfectly healthy. I've been watching him, still concerned, while my hubby told me I was crazy, I was just imagining things because of Sasha and her situation. Friday I called the vet and insisted they look at him again. As the vet said to me, \"You can't argue with a mother's instinct.\" He has some pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, and maybe congestive heart failure. He's in the hospital so they can get rid of some of the fluids on his chest and hopefully be able to tell what the root cause of the problem is. Could be any of several things, including tumors in either the lungs or heart. So that's been my last couple of weeks in a nutshell.\nSo send good thoughts this way for Sasha and Pudge. \nLove and hugs to the breast friends...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " JM... just wanted to add that, typically, it takes a breast cancer lump 8-10 years to grow to a size where it can be seen on a mammogram... and a couple of years more to grow to a size where it is palpable. So 2 weeks is next to nothing, in the big picture. When we are first diagnosed, all we want is to get that thing out of our bodies, and 2 weeks can seem like an eternity. But it seems that the process is one of \"hurry up and wait.\" Once she sees the surgeon, it could be weeks before she has follow-up surgery. Then there is a wait to get in to the radiologist or the oncologist. And another wait before the treatment begins. I had my mammogram on October 23, got in to a surgeon right away, then had to wait til Nov 11 to have a biopsy. Mastectomy wasn't until December 6, and the oncologist initially scheduled me for February. My hubby called them and threw a hissie-fit on the phone, so they got me in two weeks after surgery, and I had my first chemo on December 28. In retrospect, I wish I had put off chemo for a few more weeks, so that I could have had more healing time! But at the time, I was glad he had pushed. \nWaiting is hard, but it can have its benefits. You have time to research your options and think about\n what YOU want. \nHope all goes well with your mom. Let us know!\nHugs...\nBEV ",

You are obviously not enjoying the life you have when you are on the AI's, and if you balance that with \"minimal\" gain... I was given a choice about\n AI's 15 years ago (at that time, Tamoxifen), and I chose not to take them because I was offered \"minimal benefit\" at that time. If I were to have a recurrence, I wouldn't for a minute regret the decision I made, because it was the best choice for me at the time. You bet I would take them for a recurrence, though! So far, knock on wood, I've been fine. It really is a very personal choice, at the level you are at. If I had been told I was limiting my survival odds, I think I would have taken them, regardless of the side effects. You've got to do what is right for you, but I think you've been telling us for awhile now that you don't think this is right for you. You just have to be willing to look back and not regret the decision you make.\nIt's a tough one!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

With lumpectomy, radiation is almost always recommended. Jo, I didn't think you were being flippant. I remember when I was diagnosed, my best friend said she wished it were her instead of me, she was old, she didn't need her boobs anymore, and on and on. Well, a couple of years later, she, too, was dx'ed with breast cancer, and someone we both knew said about\n the same thing to her. She was mad as a wet hen! I reminded her that she had said the same thing to me... she said, \"Yeah, but back then I thought they just cut off your breast and that was the end of it. I didn't realize you could actually die from it!\" That seems to be a common misconception. Unfortunately, my friend was one of those who lost the battle with this disease. I have a cousin who was dx'ed a couple of years ago. Her doctor has told her that she is \"cured.\" When we have doctors out there pronouncing cures when facts say there isn't a cure... You look a tLaw1015's post. Her mom was 15 years seemingly cancer-free, and now has mets. There's a dose of reality for anyone who thinks they are cured, I guess. \nAgain, best of luck to your mom.

Came back clean. I was thrilled, but my doctor wasn't. He said about\n the same thing your doctor said: \"I still want you to have a biopsy; the lumps are there, and I've made an appointment with a surgeon for you.\" I had all kinds of reasons not to go, but he insisted and made me promise I would keep the appointment. Surgeon said he really didn't think it was anything, but since my family doctor would be happy with nothing less than a biopsy... So I ended up having two types of invasive breast cancer in the same breast, and it had already spread to the lymph nodes. That was 16 years ago. I don't think I would be alive today had my family doctor not been even more stubborn than I am! \nI'm not saying that will happen to you. Chances are on your side that it will be nothing, since about\n 80% of biopsies are negative. But I'm sure glad my doctors preferred to be safe rather than sorry.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I was very thin, and they had to take a lot of belly and both muscles to make one breast mound. Recovery was long! Haven't had any trouble gaining weight since hitting menopause during chemo, though! LOL Really, I don't know \"how big\" they can make them. After carrying around double D's, I would think you would want a smaller pair now, but to each his own. I know I've seen some pretty large TRAMs. I know my friend, MK, who is a co-moderator here, had a fairly large breast constructed through TRAM. I don't know if she would want to share cup size! \nYou are right, though. Losing some weight prior to the surgery would be a good thing. It is not an easy surgery to go through or to recover from. \nI don't know what motivation I can give you if you are not motivated to do this for yourself. Do they have you on thyroid replacement? And is it an adequate dose? I try to be a low-carb eater these days, and when I stick to it, it works. I don't think I could eat that way if I didn't have Splenda! I knocked 40 pounds off my hubby in 3 months for a necessary surgery by putting him on the low-carb plan. We had Splenda sweets every day... cheesecake, sundaes, crepes, lots of whipped cream, etc... so it isn't a starvation diet by any means. I always recommend people try it, if the haven't yet. Much easier than counting calories and cutting fat out of your diet. Some people think it is not so good for you, but I eat lots more \"good stuff\" on low-carb than I did before I ate that way.\nDon't know if that helps, but hope so!\nHugs....\nBEV ",

      "Content": " I don't think the seroma is from the weight, no. But if you have very little abdominal fat, they typically have to use both RA muscles to create a new breast mound. The skin on the belly has not been stretched by weight, and they really have to pull you tight. And I mean, tight. It is NOT like a tummy tuck, where they get to decide exactly how much excess needs to be removed. This more like, \"how much do I need to make the new breast.\" For thin people, it can just be too much. It took about\n 3 months to stand erect, and it took a lot of effort to stay that way. By the end of the day, I was slumping badly because I didn't have the strength or energy to stay erect. I slept sitting up for months because I could not lie down flat. Lay on my stomach and push up on my elbows? Over a year, and it was very uncomfortable. \nWhen I went in for my two-year check-up with my PS, my nurse didn't look too good. I asked if she was feeling okay. Well, she had been diagnosed with breast cancer about\n 9 months earlier. Had a Tram. And she said, \"When do you stop feeling so tight?\" I told her I would let her know when I found out, and I wasn't kidding. This is the woman who assured me I would be \"back to normal in 6-8 weeks... you'll just never be able to do sit-ups.\" So yes, weight does play a part in how much tissue you have to make a nice new breast. The seroma, not so much. ",

      "Content": " I guess my first question would be how old is your mother? Typically, radiation is recommended following a lumpectomy. Obviously, surgeons can't be sure that they got every cancer cell removed, so the radiation is to take care of any stray cells that may have been missed in the surgery. For early stage cancers, there are new rad treatments that are much easier, such as MammoSite brachytherapy, which I think is very exciting (you can \"google\" it, if you want more info). Radiation following a lumpectomy is not quite like taking a pain killer before you get a headache. Your mom has breast cancer. Breast cancer has no cure. And it can be deadly. Look at the family history. Under the same circumstances, I would not only encourage, I would insist my mom have the radiation. Better safe than sorry.\nBest of luck to your mom.

I have to tell you, I had a heck of a time with my metabolism after chemo... I had to put my hubby on the Atkins diet a couple of years ago, and I shed quite a few pounds (about\n 30), and keep it off pretty well as long as I stay away from the carbs. That's a big leap from the vegetarian/ organic diet you're on, I know! I know that femara blocks estrogen, and estrogen is one of those things that helps us keep our \"girlish\" figures, so it only makes sense to me that Femara could cause weight gain. My estrogen levels bottomed out during chemo during my third treatment... next treatment, I had gained two pounds. Next treatment, 2 more pounds... and so it went! I was 36 at the time, and menopause was permanent. Hope someone with femara experience will post as well.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Janice is right. It is impossible to give you an answer, which is why the doctor didn't give you an answer. So much depends on the agressiveness of the cancer and what treatments it responds to. Each case of cancer is different. Mets to the brain are the most difficult to treat. They typically don't respond well to chemotherapy because of the blood-brain barrier. Sometimes they respond to radiation, and sometimes they are able to do laser surgery. If mets to the brain are extensive, sometimes they will do whole brain radiation, but typically this just buys time and reduces the symptoms from the tumors by shrinking them. Mets to the bones are easier to manage, medically, through a combination of treatments. It all depends on how aggressive your mom's friend wants to be in fighting the cancer. It's a very hard decision this woman is faced with. Sometimes quality of life is more important than quantity, and only this woman can decide what is right for her. I hope you and your mom will be there for her, whatever decision she makes. Let us know how it goes.\nHugs to you, your mom, and her friend.\nBEV ",

My mom's cancer, I have never known point of origin for sure. In my family, I was considered the best candidate for testing because of my age at dx.\nI think my oncologist had to sign a paper that said it would be medically beneficial to know my status. I chose not to be tested early on, as I didn't want a \"positive\" to be hanging over my daughters' chests as they grew, so to speak. But when my brother was dx'ed with prostate cancer at age 50, asked my girls if they would want to know, and they both said, \"yes!\" My elder said she would opt for a bilateral, prophylactic mastectomy and be done with it. My younger said she would still probably wait to see what happened. As it turned out, I was negative for 1 and 2. I still think there is a genetic component at play, so I was not greatly mollified by knowing I was negative. \nIronically, they were more concerned about\n the ovarian cancer and recommended a complete hysterectomy, which I still think about\n from time to time, but just haven't done yet.\nHope this helps.\nBEV\n ",

So let's just go ahead and do a biopsy.\" Let me tell you, there is great comfort in that little scar that got me a \"benign\" dx! And I'm so glad he didn't object to doing a biopsy, because that was the only thing that would have assured me that it was \"nothing.\"\nI didn't have radiation, but I guess it can cause all kinds of changes in the structural tissue of the breast.

What a mess, girl!\nI guess that's not very positive, but it just doesn't sound like a very positive experience! I'm sorry!\nAnyway, feel free to come here to vent. What are you doing with PT?

I took dexamethasone (a steroid) for a few days after chemo, and zofran (antinausea) as a drip before chemo and then in pill form for a few days after. After the steroid, I would \"bottom out\" for a few days and be really, really tired, but not so much that I couldn't function. There were days when I made myself get up and made myself get going to work, but keeping a normal routine was important to me. The worst treatment I had was one that was over Spring Break.

My MIL used to ask to go here and there, then as soon as we got there thought we should go home because she just wasn't up to it, so back home we went. Then she started forgetting to ask to go, and I'd find her out sitting in the car, waiting for me, convinced that she had asked me to take her someplace. When she'd take her medications, it helped a lot, but as soon as she would start doing better, she would insist that she was fine and refused to take them. It was a viscious cycle. I just had to remember to find the humor in it, but some days, it was awfully hard!\nHope you can get that cortisone shot. I don't know how long they like to wait between shots anymore.

We can be vigilant about\n our health in general, and we can do things to decrease our risk factors for cancer, but like all cancers, there is no way to absolutely prevent breast cancer.

I don't know how long that lingers after treatment, but I'm sure others will be able to answer that. \nPersonally, at 84, I think I would be inclined to let my mom's decision be the final one, once she has the knowledge to make an informed decision. But I would certainly push her to keep an \nopen mind until she gets the information she needs to make a decision.\nI think we're all a bit selfish when it comes to wanting to keep our parents with us as long as we can. But it sounds like your mom is at a place in her life where she is much more concerned with quality of life than quantity. Let us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " I've been to North Carolina and New York to see my girls this past week. We celebrated Bri's 8th birthday! (Can she really be 8???) It's always a bittersweet day for me. While I was at one hospital with my daughter, my wonderful friend, JoAnnie, was at another hospital getting the scans that would detect her metastatic disease. I called her early that morning to share our good news, that the baby was on the way, and she was so thrilled! \"It's a good sign, don't you think?\" she said. Everything was a sign to JoAnn! It was also 7 years to the day of my first mammogram, which totally missed my cancer. Thank God I had a doctor who didn't stop there and insisted on a biopsy. Cancer just reaches out and touches the most special of moments, doesn't it? Like a shadow in an otherwise perfect picture. \nBut we had a good day. Took Bri shopping for a new bike and new shoes (oh, but she does take after her grandmama!), and we bought the biggest pinata I have ever seen for her party. It was an 8-pointed star that we barely got in the backseat of the car. That sucker held $80 worth of friggin' candy! The kids had a blast with it, though, and it was a bit like an early Halloween when those kids took their loot bags home. My daughter had bought these cute little bags at the Party Store. Man, those kids needed serious grocery bags, not those little treat bags! I bet their parents are just thrilled with us! LOL My daughter will probably be getting the dental bills as \"thank you's!\"\nThen we headed to NY to see our other daughter and the grandpuppies. I had so forgotten that Long Island is a world unto itself! Except for the hubby being a stick in the mud, we had a great time. \nWe had our house fairy dog sit for us, which was a great idea, because we came home to a spotless house... he even cleaned the carpets while we were gone! It was a real treat!\nAnyway, I really enjoyed the trip, but we're glad to be home. \nHugs to all...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Congrats on finishing chemo! To answer your question: no, not all spots mean cancer. I'm a 15 year survivor, and I've been through lots of scans... bone, CT, and MRI. Something shows up on one, doesn't show up on another, and so on. Bone scans typically pick up on bigger \"chunks\" of cancer. They aren't great for detecting small spots. And even if something shows up, they do follow-ups with x-rays, MRI's, and bone biopsies to determine exactly what it is. I've never gotten as far as a bone biopsy, but close. Sometimes the way the spots are formed can give an idea of what is going on. I had several hot spots on my ribs once on a bone scan. My onc was out of town, so I went to a different doctor, and she told me I had mets and would have to wait til my onc got back to start treatment, but she could give me pain meds. When my onc got back in town, she ordered the more tests. I had x-rays and a chest CT done as follow-up. Two rib fractures showed clearly on x-ray. Two DIFFERENT rib fractures showed clearly on the CT-scan. And the total of 4 fractures corresponded precisely to what showed on the bone scan. Because of the linear nature on the x-rays and CT's, they were sure they were fractures. BTW, the fractures showed on the bone scan, but I didn't start having any pain until the day AFTER the bone scan! I would be asking how they know for sure this is cancer. Did you have a large tumor, lots of nodes involved, particularly aggressive cancer??? \nI'm sure you are a nervous wreck! I don't mean to be offering false hope here, but that has been one of my several experiences with \"it could be/ it's not.\" \nHugs....\nBEV ",

      "Content": " I agree. Don't get yourself all worked up when you don't know if there is something to be worried about\n. There are two categories of mammograms. If you have never had breast cancer and aren't at high risk, they do a screening mammogram... a tech takes a couple of views, and later on, a radiologist reads the films. As NE said, there can be lots of reasons for call backs on screenings. I had a screening, and they called me back because of a \"mass\" in my remaining breast. Went back, had spot compressions done... nothing. Nada. Probably just a fold in the tissue. Those of us who have had cancer usually have \"diagnostic\" mammograms. Tech takes the pics, and a radiologist reads them while we wait. If there are questionable areas, then they look at them more closely right then. So try to stay calm! I know it is stressful, but hopefully, it is nothing.\nLet us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Jeanette, I had two malignant (invasive cancer) tumors in one breast, one benign biopsy on the other side. I was 36 at the time I was diagnosed with cancer (15 years ago!). I had never even had a mammogram prior to finding the lumps. The reason mammograms save lives is this: breast cancer is typically slow growing, so a breast cancer can be often be detected on a mammogram years before it becomes a palpable lump. Of course, the longer the cancer is present, the larger it grows, the more likely it is invasive. So mammograms do save lives. Most women who come here to this board worried and then have a benign biopsy come back to report their benign findings and then we don't hear from them again. That's a good thing! They don't have cancer. So you won't find women posting who had one biopsy and are okay unless you look at old posts.\nYou have certainly been through the wringer, haven't you! I was so sorry to read about\n your daughter. How old is she? And how is she doing? And you, with a kidney transplant? (Diabetes?) And skin cancer, too? What type of skin cancer?\nI truly wish we knew what causes cancers. I had genetic testing done, and I was negative for genetic markers (my mom died of cancer when I was 7, my brother has had prostate cancer, lost one aunt to lung cancer, the other to leukemia, after she survived ovarian cancer, a first cousin with breast cancer... and the list goes on!) I think we just don't know enough about\n how cancers start...and we sure don't know enough about\n how to cure them! In the meantime, I think we just have to do what we can to detect them early so they don't take lives that could otherwise be saved. \nHugs to you!\nBEV\n ",

I know you don't have insurance, but a family doctor appointment is not that expensive, and he may be able to tell you what is going on. If you have still concerns, I would suggest you call your local Susan G. Komen affiliate and ask about\n free mammograms for uninsured women. Most larger cities have their own affiliate. You can also go to ABC News website and search on mammograms. They give a list of places to turn to if you have no insurance. The next catch would be... most places want you to be over 40.

Your doctor is the best one to help you figure out what this is for sure! Good luck, and let us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Bev. I had posted a reply to your message, but it has disappeared. Hmmm... Anyway, I think keeping positive is a good choice. As our friend MK would say: No sense worrying until you know you have something to worry about\n. \nAs far as the genetic testing goes, there are a lot of advertisements out there encouraging women to be tested for BRCA, and I'm not sure why that is. A very low percentage of breast cancers are genetically linked to BRCA 1 or 2, and that is what they test for. Genetic counselors typically review your family history carefully before testing, and they decide who the most likely candidate in the family is to have tested. It is typically someone who has actually been diagnosed with breast cancer at an early age (before the age of 40). In my family, I was the best candidate for the testing. Despite the fact that they didn't know which side of my family was more suspicious, I was negative for either gene. That doesn't mean that other genetic links play into my breast cancer, but not BRCA 1 or 2. \nMy questions would be: Would you do anything differently if you knew you were positive? You are obviously proactive with your breast health care. Would you opt to have a prophylactic double mastectomy if you knew you were positive? Will your insurance cover your testing? It is a very pricey test, so money might be a deciding factor. And finally, who else might be impacted by a positive finding? I waited until my girls were old enough to decide whether or not they wanted to know. I didn't want to take them shopping for their first training bras knowing that their budding breasts were ticking time bombs! When they both said they would like for me to have the testing, I pursued it. For me, it was really a moot point by then. \nBecause of my family history of ovarian cancer, by the way, they did recommend that I consider a total hysterectomy, and that my girls consider it as soon as they have their families completed. \nHope this helps. When will your biopsy happen? Let us know and we'll send out the B-9 chant for you!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hii, chickpea. Believe me, I remember what it was like to be where you are. My mom died of cancer when I was 7. I was 36 when I was diagnosed, with two young girls of my own. I had myself dead and buried before I ever even had a biopsy to confirm it was cancer. I couldn't imagine how my husband was ever going to raise those girls on his own. My surgeon told me that \"this is not the end of the world,\" I remember thinking that that was easy for him to say, he wasn't the one who was going to die. That was almost 15 years ago. I am always, always cognizant that my cancer can still come back. But I don't spend my days worrying about\n it.. I would have wasted a lot of years worrying if I did! \nMy surgeon had obviously had different experiences from me. He had seen lots of women with breast cancer go on with their lives. At the time, I only knew people who had died of cancer. My perspective is a bit different today. We see women come to this board all the time who have found a lump and are scared to death. We hope for each and every one of them that it is nothing, a benign growth. And more come back with good news than bad. Let me tell you, we are thrilled when someone gets a benign diagnosis.\nA few years after my diagnosis, I had my annual round of scans done. I had a mammogram that showed a mass in my remaining breast. My oncology nurse called me and told me that all the scans were clean, but the mammogram... My reaction was very different from my first experience. Again, I assumed it was cancer. But my next thought was, \"but all the scans were clean, so thank god it is only the other breast.\" It turned out to be nothing. I've also had another lump in the remaining breast biopsied. It was benign. \nWhen I answer posts like yours, I try to give some balance. It could be cancer,yes, but it could be something else. Our friend MK would say, \"try not to worry til you know you have something to worry about\n.\" I think those are golden words of wisdom.\nSo no, it is not easy to be up and positive when it comes to someone else. I know exactly what it is like to be scared silly. I know October 26 seems like a lifetime away. And I'll be hoping for you that it is nothing. I'll be happy dancing for you if it is nothing. And if it is something... I know from my own experience that there will be time to deal with that should it happen. \nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

I reminded her that she had said almost the same thing to me. She said, \"Yeah, but back then, I didn't know how bad breast cancer was. I thought they just cut off your breast and that was it... I didn't know you could die from it!\" How quickly we become educated in this disease. I have a cousin who was dx'ed a couple of years ago. She specifically asked that I not talk to her about\n it.

He's a day to day thing, but typically nothing that would keep me from meeting up with you! I'll check my work calendar later and see if I have to work late any of those days, and we'll definitely work something out. Our latest is that he has shingles, probably as a result of the stress his poor old body has been under. I took him to the doctor, and they put his on Valtrex, which I expected, and then added Neurotin to his mix of meds for the neuropathic pain. I got home from work last Friday evening, and he couldn't get out of his chair, his speech was almost incoherent, and he was hallucinating. I might have thought it was a stroke, except for the hallucinations. I called the doctor's office and they assured me that, if it was the Neurontin, he should be doing better the next day if he didn't take any more of it. So I emptied his pockets and put the pills us so he wouldn't accidentally take any more. The next day was significantly better. He now has a note in his chart, at my insistence: \"No more drugs that F&*# with Randy's brain chemistry.\" I can handle a lot, but crazy is not something I deal with well!

I've had one benign biopsy, and the peace of mind it gave me was well worth the few minutes of minimal pain from a bandaid surgery. Of course, the years of life I gained when breast biopsies showed malignant tumors... well, they're priceless. One does not \"create problems\" by having a breast biopsy for a suspicious finding. One creates problems by ignoring suspicious findings. As Lori said, if you wait until you have symptoms other than a radiographic or palpable finding, your chances of surviving are much more limited. \nJeannette, I'm sorry you had such a traumatic experience, and aspet, I haven't read the Reader's Digest article, but I think there are better resources for medical information. If they are seriously recommending that women ignore medically advised biopsies based on suspicious radiographic findings, then I would call that unscrupulous and unconscionable. \nBEV\n ",

When I came back to work post surgery, I had already had my first chemo treatment and lost all my hair, so I wore a wig... I wasn't sure how they would react to bald! So I was sitting on the floor, and one of the little ones standing beside me lost his balance. He grabbed for me and got my wig, which shifted when he pulled on it. He looked at me, at first puzzled... then he said, \"Oh! You got new hair?\" Cracked me up! Another day I went on a home visit. I didn't wear my wig, but wore a hat instead. The little boy was fascinated with this hat. When I sat down on the floor, he immediately went for the hat. He tried it on himself, tried it on his mom, put it back on me, tried it on himself again... for fifteen minutes he played with that hat, and he never even noticed that I had no hair! His mom and I laughed so hard we cried! \nIf I were you, I would just tell the parents, and then they can tell their children whatever they think they can understand. Probably just that their teacher is sick and needs an operation to make her well again. Children that age won't understand the details, so I don't see a reason to go into a lengthy explanation.\nGood luck in your treatment. Keep us posted!\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Okay, here's the thing about\n microcalcifications. If they just look like salt sprinkled over the film, then that is okay. But they watch those little grains carefully. If they change and start to cluster, then that can be an indication of cancer, usually \"in situ,\" which is usually easy to treat. So if they are telling you that you didn't have clusters before, but now you do, then I would check with a breast surgeon. You don't have to have a wire guided biospy... talk to the doctor about\n a regular surgical biopsy. If he knows about\n your past experience, I don't see why they couldn't just put you out and do a surgical biopsy. I never had to take more than a couple of Tylenol 3's after a biopsy. \nI'm assuming the pills you are taking are immunosupressants. They also suppress our bodies ability to fight cancer cells, and they grow like wildfire, which is why the skin cancers keep popping up. If your microcalcifications are clustered, and if they are cancer \"in situ,\" it would be logical to think it could become invasive more quickly than most people's would. Please check this out with your transplant team. I'm sure they could address this more knowledgeably than I can or could direct you to a good surgeon to discuss it with.\nAnd you are right, doctors just don't address pain or complication issues as well as they could. I read an article about\n oncologists who had cancer, and they all said they heard their patients talk about\n fatigue, but they never fully understood the extent of it until they had to go through it themselves. I'm sure the same holds true for pain. I had a rather complicated reconstruction called a TRAM-flap, which takes abdominal muscles to create a new \"breast.\" They told me that in 6-8 weeks I'd be back to normal, I just wouldn't be able to do sit-ups anymore. Ha! Try years later, and I'm still dealing with the ramifications of that surgery.\nI know you didn't go through 4 years of dialysis and the transplant process just to die from the complications of immunosuppressive therapy, so please check on this! \nCan I ask how old you and your daughter are?

Just a mastectomy, and then you have the prosthesis hunt, and frozen shoulder issues, etc. Implants, well, you know about\n those! But TRAM's have their issues, too. Since you have a good PT you're working with, explain the TRAM procedure to her. I really think PT following a TRAM is a necessity, but rarely recommended by plastic surgeons. A good PT can really make the whole recovery process much easier! And with a LAT, they often use small implants in conjunction to get a better result, so I would think they would go with the TRAM.\nHope things hold together for you until February.

      "Content": " Hi, Jane. I have to tell you, there is nothing as reassuring as knowing that you are in good hands. I kind of \"lucked into\" very good doctors. We had just moved to Cincinnati, and my first visit to our family doctor was to have him check a lump a had found in my breast. \nI think you said that you are having a node biopsy with your lumpectomy, and that may influence the chemo decision, as may the HER2/NEU status. Staging really depends on three things: tumor, node status, and metastatic findings (hence, the bone scans, etc...) Breast cancer has certain places it likes to home in on-- lungs, liver, bones are the top three. Herceptin is considered a chemotherapy, by the way, so you do know that you will be having one type of chemo. \nSome oncologists recommend chemo for all breast cancers. The thinking is that micrometastisis cannot be ruled out, even with no nodes and clean scans. In other words, a few cells may have gotten away, settled somewhere, say on the hip bone, and if they aren't stopped from growing and dividing, then sooner or later, you will have evidence of metastatic disease. Other oncologists use the \"wait and see\" approach, assuming that if the tumor is small, the nodes are clean, and there is no evidence of metastis, then either mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation is adequate. \nPersonally, I'm in favor of overkill from the get-go! However, I have two cousins who were diagnosed, and they both chose the \"wait and see\" approach. One had a double mastectomy with reconstruction. The other chose lumpectomy with radiation (and then decided to take Herceptin, as she was HER2/NEU positive.) \nAge can also be a factor in the chemo decision, and honestly, I can't remember if you told us your age or not... sorry!\nWith radiation, I think you can expect fatigue... sorry again! As is true with chemo.\nAgain, I haven't had Herceptin, so I can't tell you what to expect. I've been NED for almost 15 years now, and Herceptin was in trials back when I was diagnosed... never even had my status checked, to my knowledge.\nI'm sure your doctors will give you all the information you need to make an informed decision. It really sounds like you are in great hands!\nTake care.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

Our picture was in the local newspaper (and we had an article in USA Today!), and the lady recognized us at breaskfast our last morning there. She told us she wanted us to meet her daughter, who was also serving in the restaurant. She was about\n 16 or so. Her mom then told us that her daughter had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 11... yes, I typed that right. 11. And she just wanted us to know that she was pulling for all of us. She was just so proud of her daughter, and what a fighter she was! Definitely an inspiration to us comparatively old women! Everywhere we've been, seems we've met extraordinary people, doesn't it?\nI hope this young girl is a fighter by nature as well.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hi. Breast cancer in-situ is a better finding than invasive cancer, no doubt. The high nuclear grade and the comedonecrosis are indications that it is, nonetheless, probably more agressive than your garden variety brca in-situ. Emphasis on \"probably.\" 5-year local recurrence rates tend to be somewhat more likely with these two factors than if there were a low nuclear grade with no evidence of necrosis. (How big were the clean margins that they got? This would also be important to know.) I can tell you that, were it me, I would opt for a more agressive treatment based on those findings. I would think that the lymph node biopsy results would determine whether any more treatment would be necessary. \nGood luck to you MIL, and feel free to visit us anytime...\nAnd congrats on your remission from UC!

      "Content": " When they do a surgical biopsy, they usually try to get as much of the \"suspicious\" tissue as possible. So if the lump is not cancer, it will be gone. If it should turn out to be cancer, the pathologist looks for clean margins on tissue. This means that there is healthy tissue all the way around what the surgeon removes. If there are adequate clean margins, the surgeon won't have to take out more tissue. If there are \"dirty\" margins, or the margins are not large enough to be considered safe, then the surgeon will have to take out more tissue to ensure adequate clean margins. If you're in that 80% of women with a benign growth, then you don't want the surgeon to take out more tissue than he has to... you might be left with a \"less than attractive\" result. The procedure is not that difficult, so I would say less is better for the biopsy.

You aren't going to find women here who are going to agree with the \"wait and see\" approach, because we've all been diagnosed with breast cancer. Some doctors don't agree with that. They see no need to go through a surgical procedure for nothing. But a biopsy is the only way to be absolutely sure, and I'd rather have a biopsy with a benign finding than a mammogram in 6 months that said, \"Oops... we were wrong.\" Honestly, most breast cancers tend to be slow growing, and so 6 months is not going to make a huge difference when a tumor has taken years to grow to the point that it can be seen on a mammogram. Phyllodes tumors are pretty rare, but you are right, they are fast growing. If they suspected a phylodes tumor, I'm sure they would have insisted on a biopsy asap. \nI know it is easier said than done, but try not to worry til you know you have something to worry about\n. Worry won't change the results, and it really sounds like your doctor is saving you six more months of worry and anxiety. \nYou mentioned that you are peri-menopausal... are you taking hormones, by any chance?\nHope this helps!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Sorry to hear about\n your Mom's recurrence, but we never know that we are \"survivors\" until we die of something else with this disease. \"Only in the bone\" is a good thing, and the longer they can keep it that way, the better for your mom. Because of her er/pr+ status, her 15 years of being cancer-free, and her age, hormone therapy could be a really good way to go. Biophosphonates like Zometa are useful for bone mets. They help \"fill in\" the lesions from the cancer and make the bone stronger. There are several women here who have bone mets. One of our ladies has had treatment for mets to the sternum many years ago, and has been cancer-free for a number of years. \nLots of people (doctors and patients) prefer to look at state IV breast cancer as a \"chronic\" illness. I've heard it likened to diabetes; yes, it can eventually kill you, but with proper treatment, you can live many relatively healthy, happy years with it. And we have known lots of women who have done that. But statistically, this is not the average, as I'm sure you know from your research. I say this not in an attempt to discourage you. I'm just one of those people who believes that being prepared for the worst is not a bad thing. We all of us like to hope for, believe in, and expect the best possible outcome. But to me, facing the fact that I have a potential death sentence hanging over my head has made me appreciate each day I've had \"above ground\" all the more. \nI can't really speak highly of alternative medicine. My best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of years after I was, and her cancer later metastisized. Her oncologist was a Chinese gentleman who combined conventional medicine with the Chinese healing arts. So she had the conventional medicines, but he also gave her herbal remedies, acupuncture, etc... We lost her less than two years after the mets were diagnosed. I don't think the alternative medicines hurt. I just don't believe they helped. And the research is just not there to support it. That is just my opinion, and I will be the first to admit that my opinion is worth about\n what you paid for it!\nAs far as diet, I think it is a good thing to eat healthy. But I don't know of anyone who could attribute their demise to the occasional piece of cheesecake, either. And I don't think I would have survived chemo without milkshakes and Graeter's double chocolate ice cream! For a friend of ours, it was fried egg sandwiches. I don't recommend a steady diet of either, but my point is, sometimes, you eat what you can, and what is good for you is really no longer of much concern. My husband is an excellent cook and would make fantastic meals for our family (much better than I would have made!), and I would have to go to my room because I couldn't stand the smells, much less the tastes, of what he had prepared. Of course that was not every night, or even most nights. But when it did happen, someone would show up at my door with a milkshake in hand, and life was good!\nYour mom's world has probably been turned upside down by this diagnosis, as has yours. It is terrific that she has such a supportive and motivated (daughter? son?) who wants to see her through this. Just check with her to see that the changes you want to make are changes she wants to make, as well. Quality of life... never underestimate the importance of quality of life! And only your mom can tell you what that is, for her! \nGood luck to you both!\nBEV\n ",

They typically have the facilities to do a number of procedures there, so you will probably get quicker answers this way. I suspect your doctor told you they saw no microcalcifications, which, when clustered, can be an indication of DCIS, or ductal carcinoma in situ. These are usually seen on mammogram, and they look like salt sprinkled on the mammogram. The ultrasound usually is used to distinguish a fluid-filled cyst from a solid tumor when there is a suspicious area on the mammogram. It sounds like your doctor is determined to find out exactly what is going on, and that is a good thing. You are lucky! \nWhen are you scheduled for your next tests? As far as should you be concerned, of course you should. You're 40 and you have 6 kids, and you don't know what is going on with your body!

So your doctor or NP probably wants to rule this out by doing an ultrasound. It could very well be connective tissue, so don't be too alarmed! As we get older, our breast tissue becomes less dense, and sometimes the connective tissues becomes more prominent and feels a bit rope-like, especially when fat cells \"glom\" onto it. We're going to hope it is the latter. Your doctor or NP is doing the right thing by being cautious. Let us know when your US is scheduled. Hope this helps.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " It really depends on where you are going for the appointment. If you are going to a breast center, they could be doing lots of different things. First, they will want to get a better look at the microcalcifications. They will typically do compression views, which are a bit like a \"mini-mammogram\" over a specific part of the breast. It gives them a clearer picture of the calcifications. If the calcifications are new, and the compression views do not look suspicious, then they may just ask you to come back in 6 months so they can see if there are any changes. Lots of women have microcalcifications and never have breast cancer. They are very common. But sometimes the calcifications will form a cluster, and the edges of the calcifications will be irregular in shape. This can be an indication of a very early stage of breast cancer, called \"in situ\" cancer. If this is what shows up, then at a breast center, they may want to do a biopsy, as well, where they would take a sample of the calicificate area to look for cancer cells. You could always opt to talk to your doctor about\n having a surgical biopsy instead. \nWe'll all be hoping here that it is nothing, and they are just getting a better view to compare future mammograms to. Good luck tomorrow! Hope this helps.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

Let me tell you... a lot of things have changed since I had my treatments, and we always need new people to add to discussions, too! I know sometimes MK and I feel like dinosaurs around here! But we USED to be the younguns, right MK??!?\nAnyway, just want you to know that, when a newbie visits the board, your input is needed as much as any, Jane. So always feel free to share. I know at one time, we had the \"buddy\" system going. When we would get a couple of newcomers at one time, they would adopt each other as \"chemo buddies,\" or \"rads buddies.\" It was really nice for them. We don't seem to get as many newcomers these days, but I always liked that concept.\nTake care, and good luck with your rads!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

Obviously, the most ominous diagnosis would be breast cancer, but that is not your only option. More good news... you say that you've never heard of anyone needing a biopsy and not having it be cancer. about\n 80% of all breast biopsies are negative for cancer. And age is in your favor as well, although young does not rule out the possibility. Breast cancer is not usually painful, but some women do report pain associated with their cancer, so the fact that you have pain there doesn't rule out the possibility of cancer, but it is a good possible indication that it may be something else.\nWhen is your biopsy scheduled? We hope you'll come back and have some good news to share with us! In the mean time, try not to worry too much. I know that is hard, but worry won't change the outcome.\n \nHugs for you...\nBEV\n ",

If there is lymph node involvement, then chemo is probably a foregone conclusion. The chemo cocktails change occasionally, but I have to tell you, the drugs they use to combat nausea are really good. It's been almost 15 years since I went through chemo, and even then, I was never sick from it. Fatigue was a problem, but not nausea. Ironically, most of the women I know (including me) actually gained weight while on chemo! And I never missed a day of work while I was going through chemo, either. I stayed pretty healthy... there were a lot of days I wasn't 100%, but some days you just have to keep putting one foot in front of the other. I had to have a mastectomy because I had two tumors in the same breast, two different types of cancer, but lots of the women here have had lumpectomies and are very happy with them.\nTry not to spend your weekend worrying... easier said than done, I know. \nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Jeannette. DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) is a non-invasive, very early form of breast cancer (sometimes it's even referred to as a precancerous condition). Left untreated, DCIS can become invasive breast cancer. Clusters of microcalcifications can be an indication of DCIS. I can't tell you statistically how many clusters turn out to be DCIS, how many turn out to be nothing. I do know that if you catch DCIS early, it is very treatable, and with your current health situation, it would be much better to catch DCIS before it has become invasive cancer. The only way to know for sure if your suspicious areas are DCIS is through a biopsy. I hope you will get that biopsy sooner, rather than later, because of the immunosuppressants. \nBy the way, I'm 51. I had was diagnosed with two invasive breast cancers with lymph node invasion at 36, had a mastectomy and reconstruction, 6 months of chemotherapy, and I've been \"no evidence of disease\" and no treatment ever since. I still see my oncologist every 3-4 months for blood work and occasional scans. Because breast cancer can be very slow growing, I will never be able to say that I'm cured. I'll have to die of something else first! LOL\nI have two daughters myself, 27 and 28. Daughters are just the best, aren't they? \nAnyway, please get those areas checked! Jeannette, they could be nothing! But if they are something, then it is so much better for you to deal with it now! \nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

My doctor didn't have the best bedside manner, but he was an excellent surgeon. Back then, I think that would have been the opinion of most surgeons. He actually grew on me over the years, and I kind of miss my annual appointments with him. He left here to go to Harvard, and last I heard from him, he had transitioned completely into the research field. My plastic surgeon retired and moved to Hilton Head to golf. My family doctor is transitioning into hospital floor doccing, my gynocologist has just left to head up some kind of menopause organization... I've told my onc that she simply cannot retire, ever!

Just writing this has helped me to relax a little.\nWhile I think you should be concerned, I think you should also remember that it may well be nothing. A few years after my mastectomy, I got a callback on my mammo for my remaining breast. The nurse told me there was a \"mass\" that they wanted to get more views of. It turned out to be nothing. Literally, nothing. No mass at all. It was just they way the tissue had been compressed. \nAnd you are not alone. We're here, and there are lots of women who've been where you are... I think most of us have felt the need to feel strong for our families. So feel free to visit and vent and ask questions... we'll do our best to help you through.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Kath. Sorry you had to come back under these circumstances! But yes, a second primary is so much better than a metastatic finding. It's funny how our perspectives change, isn't it? I remember one day I was told that a good friend had metastatic cancer, I picked up the phone to check my messages, and I had a message from my onc nurse that my mammo showed a \"mass\" in my remaining breast. I was so relieved, because I had just had chest ct, blood work, and bone scan come back clean, so I could deal with another primary...I was just so happy that the message wasn't mets! As it turned out, it was nothing, but I will never forget that feeling of relief that everything but the mammo was clean.\nAnyway, as far as second primaries... lobular cancer tends to mirror in the remaining breast, and as years pass, odds actually increase that you will get another cancer in the remaining breast. Outside of that...well, breast tissue is breast tissue, and I figure if you are prone to brca, then you're prone to it in any breast tissue. (That one's just my opinion...!)\nTake care, and let us know how it goes.\nbev\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Trishy. I'm glad you're seeing the surgeon. You've had lots of \"warning!\" flags, and I don't think a needle biopsy takes enough tissue to assure a \"benign\" finding with as many \"question marks\" as you have. Atypical cells are not cancer, but have obviously undergone cellular changes. If those cells continue to change and proliferate, then they could, theoretically, become cancer. Or they could die off rather than multiply, and then you would revert back to \"normal\" cells. ( I had atypical cells on my PAPs for a couple of years, then they progressed to dysplasia, and then they reverted back to normal... PAPs have been normal for several years now... who knows why!) At one time, there was a lot of discussion about\n a procedure called \"ductal lavage,\" which draws ductal cells out of the nipple with suction, in order to follow atypical cell changes in the breast... (kind of a \"PAP smear\" of the breast ducts). I haven't heard much about\n it lately, but if your surgical biopsy findings are the same (atypical), then it would be something to ask your doctor about\n.\nIf they were to find any cancer in the surgical biopsy, it sounds like you have been diligent in getting your mammograms, so that is a big \"plus\" for you as far a catching things early. \nWith no family history, I can imagine that this is a big shock for you to be dealing with all of this. My mom passed away from cancer at 45, so it was always in the back of my mind, that I could have it, too, but when I was diagnosed at 36, I thought the world was crashing in on me, nonetheless. I wish I'd had \"HealingWell\" back then. I knew no one with breast cancer, and I felt like I just didn't have anyone I could talk to about\n all this stuff. \nRight now, all you have are some red flags, and that ship could very well end up to be deserted! That's what we'll all be hoping for, anyway... positive thoughts. They aren't easy right now, but they're better than negative thoughts any day!\nHope this helps. Let us know when your biopsy is. We'll send out the \"benign\" mantra.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Hi, Brian. How old is your mom, and is she just having a mastectomy, or is some kind of reconstruction planned at the same time? Makes a big difference in how I would answer your question. If she is otherwise healthy, and she is having a modified radical mastectomy with no reconstruction, then physically, there won't be much for you to do. She will probably come home with drains, and if they are the type with reservoirs, then you can attach a piece of first aid tape to the tube and safety pin the tube to clothing to keep the reservoir from pulling. If she is allowed to shower (depends on the surgeon's orders), you can take a piece of rolled gauze bandage to make a long loop to put around her neck and pin the drains to that. If the drains are passive, you'll just have to change the dressings per the doctor's instructions. Other than that, she may have some pain when she moves her arm on that side, so reaching for objects high on a shelf, for example, may be hard for her. And she'll need plenty of rest. But most important, she's going to need emotional support. Cancer is a scary thing, and the last thing most of us want is someone to feel sorry for us or to think of us as \"dying.\" Be positive and let your mom know she can beat this thing and you are going to be there for her. Yes, breast cancer is serious, and yes, you can certainly die from it. But there are plenty of us here who have been around for many years without further evidence of cancer (I've got 15 years coming up!)\nHope this helps. Feel free to visit any time. \nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " I'm not sure what \"series of mistakes\" could make you reconsider your decision to do mastectomy now, reconstruction later. I hope you will tell us more about\n that. At 65, this is a big step to take! I had single mastectomy and immediate reconstruction (TRAM-flap) at 36, and for me, it was a difficult recovery-- no complications from surgery, but just in terms of the recovery process. It was a long time before I felt \"normal\" again. I've known lots of women who had mastectomy and later reconstruction and were very happy with the results. I don't have any personal experience with Dorsi Flap reconstruction, but I know a few women who have had the lat dorsi flap, and they had implants as \"supplements\" as well. I have to say, I always wondered why one would bother with the lat dorsi flap and not just do implants alone, unless one were having a radical mastectomy. Because you don't have breast cancer, there would be no need to do a radical mastectomy. So maybe this is something else to talk with your doctor about\n... is there a reason they are recommending the lat dorsi over other reconstructions.\nI admire your decision to have the mastectomies. I have a family history of ovarian cancer, and genetics has recommended I \"consider\" a total hysterectomy. I have additional tests done annually, but I just haven't gotten up the enthusiasm for the surgery yet. \nLet us know how things go for you!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

I know Suzanne Sommers insists that ERT is necessary, even after BRCA, but that is not the mainstream thought on the issue. I didn't realize that arimidex or femara could only be taken post-menopause, either. I know they are most effective post-menopause, but didn't know they weren't an option pre-menopause. Actually my onc told me a long time ago that \"pre- or Post-\" menopause isn't based on your actual status, but is based on the age of 50, when it come to these things. You must have been awfully young when all this happened to you, if you're nowhere near menopause! Poor thing! Never went on aromatase inhibitors, so I can't help you there. But I think removing that remaining ovary might be a good idea...if you've already had brca and an ovarian tumor, you gotta think you are prone to adenocarcinomas.\nGood luck with your decision, and sorry if I confused the issues earlier.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Mk, I think it depends on the goal of the treatment. Hospice is usually called in when there is about\n a 6-month remaining life expectancy. I think you can be on active treatment, but the goal of the treatment is to relieve pain or symtoms (radiation of the bones, for example, to treat bone pain, or chemo to shrink a tumor that is pressing on a nerve). If the goal of the treatment is to cure the cancer, then hospice would not be appropriate. The oncologist is probably the best person to talk to about\n future expectations, and sometimes they don't volunteer that information, but have to be asked. The purpose of hospice is to make the \"end of life stage\" as easy as possible, physically, mentally, and emotionally, not only for the individual, but for the family as well. Perhaps this is Chris's way of asking you if she should be preparing herself for losing her dad? I know she doesn't like to talk about\n her own cancer, so I don't know how much she asks about\n her dad's.\nTake care, my friend.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV\n ",

I think I told you one time that I had pap tests that came back a little worse each time for quite awhile, and I felt like I was just waiting to have more parts removed... and then they suddenly went to normal and have stayed that way. If Chuck is determined to beat this thing, then whether or not to call in hospice isn't even a question to be asked right now. Nothing, even prayers and good doctors, are more effective than a fighting spirit, as far as I'm concerned. Your story about\n the farm reminds me of my dad. He was in a car accident (hit by a drunk driver) and one leg was severely crushed. They were able to cobble him back together with replacement parts, pins, steel plates, etc, but of course, he never took a normal step again. Well, he was an avid gardener...vegetables, that is. (He couldn't understand why I messed around with flowers...can't eat them, so what good are they?) His accident was mid-February, and he was in the hospital for weeks... got home at planting time. He couldn't stoop or bend, but he could hobble. So he had a friend till for him, and he took his little crippled self down to the garden with a length of steel pipe that he used as a cane, and then he would drop seeds down the pipe so he could do his planting. Putting in that garden was probably the hardest thing he had ever done, but it's also probably what kept him putting one foot in front of the other. Determination is a powerful thing! I'm glad to hear Chuck's got it!\nLove and hugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " It sounds like they probably saw something on the mammogram that they want to check further, especially if this is your first mammogram. This will be your baseline mammogram, one that they compare all future mammograms to in order to look for changes, so they want to be sure they know what everything is. The ultrasound is what they use to determine if a finding is solid or fluid-filled, so it is pretty common in a follow-up. I don't know what the \"call-back\" rate is. When I had my first mammogram, I had negative results for two cancerous tumors. I had one \"call-back\" on my remaining breast that was described in the report as a \"mass,\" but turned out to be nothing in the follow-up mammogram with compression views. Something like 80% of all biopsies performed are \"benign\" findings; on the other hand, I wouldn't ignore the situation either. Call-backs are scary for everyone! And with your sil just diagnosed, I'm sure you are especially fearful. A good friend here would say, \"try not to worry 'til you know you have something to worry about\n!\" Easier said than done, but good advice, nonetheless! Let us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

Another key factor, in my opinion, is your mom's attitude. If she has the determination to fight this thing, all the better. Good luck to you and to your mom. Those of us who have lived with this disease will tell you that the effect it has on our loved ones is the hardest part of having it.

Or you could give gift certificates for a restaurant she really likes. People going through chemo usually only have certain days that they feel nauseous or lose their taste. But they still need to eat! I had a friend who brought me a pint of my favorite gourmet ice cream after every chemo treatment, because he knew that was the only thing that tasted \"right\" to me for a couple of days. I think it would be a great gift to ask people to chip in on a maid service, even if it's only a one-time thing. A nice stack of magazines would also be good. I know my oncology office didn't have many good ones, and I liked having my own stash to take with me. Last but not least, just give her a call, ask how she's doing, and ask if there's anything you can do for her. Offer to drive her to appointments and sit with her.

      "Content": " So sorry to hear your news. As someone said, breast cancer, especially in young women, is not always seen on a mammogram. I had two types of breast cancer in the same breast, and neither were seen on mammogram. I had three positive nodes. I was 36 at dx, and that was 15 years ago. Cancer in the nodes is an indication that cancer cells have gotten into other parts of the body. Your oncologist will probably do scans before you begin treatment, but these tests don't always pick up micrometasteses, which are just a few cancer cells here or there that may have gotten free..these tests find more significant \"chunks\" of cancer, such as a tumor or lesion. (It takes about\n 8 years for a breast cancer to be sizeable enough to be seen on a mammogram). That's why they will recommend that you have chemotherapy, regardless of the scan results, the hope being that, any stray cells that may be left behind will be eradicated. I don't know what effect Prednisone, over time, has on breast cancer, so I can't help you there. I'm sure there is someone in our midst who has experience with that, though, as we all have different backgrounds and histories. I know when I ws going through chemo, I was on dexamethasone for the first few days following every treatment, and that is a steroid as well.\nSo don't give up hope for your future yet! We'll keep you in our thoughts and prayers. And good luck! Keep us posted on how you are doing.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

But one day this summer it was so blasted hot, our air was out in the office, and I just went in the bathroom and stripped off my bra. When I confessed to a couple of coworkers, they couldn't believe I didn't have a bra on, so I guess they're still better than most women my age.\nBTW, you're right, lumpectomies have been around for quite awhile now. It wasn't an option for me for medical reasons, but I think MK probably had the option, and chose mastectomy with reconstruction. We both had TRAM-flaps. Mine was without any difficulty, other than it was very hard on my back, and I have ongoing issues with that. MK is not one to complain, butI'll tell you she had some serious complications with infection and has no muscle left to hold her abdomen in place, so she has to wear some serious binders to support her tummy, and I can assure you, those binders are not comfy! Hind sight is 20/20, and maybe MK would physically feel a lot better today had she opted for the lumpectomy and radiation.... or maybe she would have had a recurrence had she not had the mastectomy. We never know, for sure, that the decision we make is the best one for tomorrow, we can only be sure that it is the right one for the time that we make it. Personally, I think it's a crap shoot, either way! My first choice, had I had the choice, would have been double mastectomy, even though there was no cancer in the remaining breast. At the time, my doctor told me that my insurance wouldn't pay for it, and he wasn't in the business of removing healthy tissue, even if I were willing to pay out-of-pocket. If I had had cancer a few years later, laws enacted would have guaranteed me that choice, and insurance would have had to have covered it. Every time I go for a mammogram on my remaining breast, I wish that law would have been enacted sooner. Some of us would just prefer no breast tissue at all rather than face a possible recurrence! It's a very personal choice, and we all make that choice based on what seems to us the best choice at the time. I don't think \"lumpectomy vs. mastectomy\" is really a \"good choice/bad choice\" decision, but \"what feels right for me right now?\" And you just have to go from there and not look back and second-guess yourself. Otherwise, you could drive yourself crazy!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

So I know where you are coming from.\nFirst, we'll hope for the best for your sister! But if the biopsy shows cancer, there is a good chance that a lot of testing will have been done on the specimen, since it will be a week later when she gets results. They can tell if it is ductal, lobular, etc, whether or not there are clean margins on the specimen, tumor grade, hormone receptor positive or negative status, and so on. As far as staging goes, it is much like prostate cancer. They will look at tumor size, lymphatic involvement, and possible metastatic involvement to determine staging. Tests ordered vary somewhat from doctor to doctor, but the organs they focus on when looking for mets are usually bones, lungs, liver, and sometimes brain. There's usually a chest x-ray or CT and bone scan, as well as blood work, as a minimum. \nIn the meantime, we'll be hoping for benign results for your sister, and good news from you next week.\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " RJ, first of all, try to drive yourself crazy before your appointment! I've been just where you are right now. I lost my mother to cancer when I was 7, she was 45. Back then, they didn't necessarily look for the origin of the cancer, so I'm not even sure where hers started. But I was always convinced that I was going to die young of cancer, too. Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with two types of breast cancer at age 36, and I had two young girls at the time. That was almost 15 years ago... and I've been cancer free all that time... long enough to see them graduate from jr high, then high school, then college, and one from her master's program. Right now, the youngest is in her second year of grad school, and the other just started her PhD program. And did I mention that I saw the birth of my first grandbaby? LOL... she will be 8 on October 23, the date of my first mammogram 7 years before that. What a gift! So, you see, cancer doesn't have to be a death sentence. I remember my surgeon telling me after my biopsies that this wasn't the end of the world, and he was right... but I surely didn't believe him at the time. It was just the beginning of looking at life a little differently. Now, that is easy to say. But then... it was just putting one foot in front of the other, putting a smile on my face, laughing as much as possible, and hoping all the while for the best while preparing myself for the worst.\nI tell you all this first because I know you need to hear that. I believed from the time I found those lumps that they were cancer. And I'm sure you are feeling the same way. But I'm going to tell you now that almost 80% of all breast biopsies are negative for cancer. You've already had one negative finding. And you could have a three more! So please, try not to cry every time you look at your babies! If the worst happens, then you will cope, and you will do it because you have three beautiful little ones who need their mom.\nI'll tell you, too, that I have a strong family history of hormone-related cancers. I had an aunt with ovarian cancer (and then lymphoma), an aunt with adenocarcinoma of the lung, and two cousins with breast cancer, as well a brother with prostate cancer. With that lovely family background, I had genetic testing done at my daughters' request, when they were old enough to make that decision (I didn't want to burden them at a young age with the knowledge that they were genetically pre-disposed to this), and to everyone's surprise, including the genetics clinic staff, I was negative for the breast cancer genes. Negative. So, while my daughters have to be vigilant, because they are at increased risk, they don't carry the genes that make it highly likely they will develop breast cancer.\nSo take a deep breath, pull it together, and get through one thing at a time here, okay? First the appointment. Let's find out if you really have to worry about\n all that other stuff first! I know you said your husband is gone, but do you have other family or friends you can share this with? That would really be great if you do. Otherwise, we're here, and we have so many long-time survivors who were diagnosed young. Annette (desertdreaming), had a young baby, Jordan, the first time we met! And her \"baby\" is turning into quite a grown-up young lady these days! \nI hope this helps! \nBig hugs to you, RJ!\nBEV\n ",

Of course, if it was cancer, she didn't want to do anything about\n it, because she didn't want her hair to fall out like mine did. ( So proud they can be, even in Depends!!! LOL)\nSo i feel for you.

Oh, I miss you posting around here! Always so nice to see your \"smiling\" posts. And miss news from brother George. How is he doing? Sara...heart disease? OMG. Go ahead and blame it on chemo. I've been trying to convince all my other doctors that I had chemo too long ago to have had drugs that caused neuropathy, having been convinced for a long time that I have carpal tunnel. My family doctor, my neurosurgeon, and my orthopedic docs all said, \"Chemo.\" I begged to differ. So I finally brought it up to my onc, who said \"no way was it chemo.\" She ordered an EMG, and sure enough, I have severe carpal tunnel in my left hand ( and I'm left handed), and mild carpal tunnel in the right. So, it's not always a good thing to blame chemo! LOL\nHave to have a brag moment. My oldest dd, who is finishing up her master's at U of Louisville in Sociology, has just been accepted to U of Washington's PhD program w/ funding for her degree. U of L has never had a student accepted there, and she had one prof tell her it was a waste of her time to apply there. She's also got interviews coming up w/ Rutgers and U of Colorado, and is still waiting to hear from a couple of other really good schools Lori, one of them is (U of Mich), which at least means she hasn't been rejected yet.

I hope it is not in the nodes as well. I had an aunt who was diagnosed in her 70's. She had a mastectomy and no other treatment, and she is in her 90's and still going strong. They also have some other treatments, such as Tamoxifen and Arimidex, which are estrogen blockers, that you take on a daily basis and do a good job of keeping breast cancer at bay. They are particularly effective in older women, and they have relatively few side effects, compared to chemotherapy. It really depends on your circumstances...your tumor, lymph nodes, and your overall health.\nBreast cancer is often a slow growing cancer...a lump may be forming for 8 to 10 years before it can be felt. So that is a good thing.\nLet us know how your appointment goes on Wednesday. We'll be thinking about\n you.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

Right now, they only test for 2 possible genetic links to Breast cancer. There are others, like the p53 gene, that are linked to breast cancer, but because they are \"cost prohibitive\" to test for, they don't. So don't take a clean bill on BRCA 1 and 2 as total proof that you are not genetically predispositioned. I understand that you are tired of doctors and tired of surgeries, but you are right about\n one thing...you are in denial. Follow your doctor's advice, get this thing out, get your radiation, and then you'll probably never have to worry about\n it again. One of our former board members had a dx of DCIS, no nodes, had a mastectomy, had chemo, had a baby (talk about\n a hormone storm!), had a recurrence, and eventually lost her battle with BRCA.

Things like running the vacuum are difficult, especially if the surgery is on the dominant side (right-handed, and a right side mastectomy, eg) Your friend probably shouldn't do any heavy lifting for awhile, to minimize the possibility of lymphadema. hope all goes well for her.

Sometimes that is hard, but what she needs most is someone to treat her like they always have...someone to laugh with as well as to cry with, someone to share your problems with as well as listen to hers.

One of the hardest things to do is to \"act normal,\" but that is probably what your friend really needs. She needs to be able to cry with someone, and to laugh with them as well. She will need you to be able to forget about\n the cancer and help her enjoy her life, as well as to support her when she can't think about\n anything else herself.\nThat is a tall order, but you came here to find ways to help her, and only a wonderful friend would care enough to seek out advice.\nAnd you could tell her about\n this great website here that Peter so generously shares with us. If your friend doesn't have much of a support system, she could probably use a bunch of women who have been where she is. \nHope your Crohn's disease is proving manageable. Not an easy disease you are living with. You know, some doctors call a recurrence of breast cancer a \"chronic disease.\" It is often manageable for a long time. I hope you have your friend for a long time to come!\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " Well, my first experience with mammos was...it showed neither of the two (as it turned out) cancerous lumps that my doctor and I could feel. So I have never been too trusting of mammography. However, I do have an area that shows up on my remaining breast that was initially suspicious, then after compression views deemed to be nothing. Initial mammo reported a \"mass.\" Because I trust my doctors, who also agreed we should just watch the area, that is what we have done. It still shows up as a mass on regular mammograms, but it has remained unchanged for several years now. \nRemember that, USUALLY, breast cancer is a very slow-growing cancer. That is not always the case. If you are doing regular breast exams, pay particular attention to that area. If you feel any changes, I would call the doctor and let him know. A biopsy is the only way that I know of to guarantee that your lump is not cancerous. But most lumps are around for 8-10 years before they are large enough to detect on a mammogram, even longer before they are tactilely palpable. So a few months, unless it is an agressive form of breast cancer, won't usually do much harm.\nIf it is a something that worries you constantly, I would talk to the doctor again. A biopsy might be less stressful than worrying for 3 more months!\nAre you taking any hormones? I remember you posting before, but I don't remember all the details.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

      "Content": " First, you need to find out if this is what is called a \"local recurrence,\" which is where the cancer is limited to the same breast (even with a mastectomy, microscopic breast tissue is left behind, so cancers can recur at a mastectomy site), or whether the cancer has, indeed, spread to the lung.\nI see some good news here. If this is a recurrence, it has taken a LONG TIME to come back. That would make it a slow growing cancer, which is typically easier to fight with chemotherapy and/or hormonal therapy. Your mom may have many good years left in her, sweetie!\nChemotherapy affects different people in different ways. Chemotherapy is not painful. I had 6 months of chemo and worked every day, without interruption, for the entire 6 months. I wasn't always 100%, but then I'm not always 100% now, either! They have some very good drugs to fight the side effects of chemotherapy, especially the nausea and fatigue. \nHormonal therapies can also be very effective, and the side effects are minimal\nA close friend of mine had an oncologist who was Chinese. He treated her with both Western and Chinese methods, including herbs and acupuncture. The Western medicine was to fight the cancer, the Chinese medicine to help with side effects. She thought the Chinese herbs and acupuncture were beneficial.\nAgain, your mother may have many good years left! Please don't lose hope yet.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

We, too, had \"behavior problems,\" and as long as we could keep her on an anti-depressant, she did very well. The problem was, when she had had a couple of good weeks, she would insist that she no longer needed the drug, and then in a few weeks we were back where we started. She was so hard to reason with! I loved her dearly, but she certainly tired my patience ( and everyone else's!) at times! She had dementia, and my biggest fear was that she would wander off in the night. She would decide she wanted to go somewhere and just go sit out in the car. I have to admit, we found it amusing, as sad as it was. She was a stinker sometimes. But she was always there when I needed her, and I'm glad I could do for her when she was in need.\nGood luck with your mom, and congrats on finished the Herceptin!\nLove and hugs...\nBEV\n ",

However, when I was going through diagnosis and treatment, a friend who had leukemia gave me a book called From Victim to Victor, by Harold Benjamin. I did read it, and I did find inspiration in it. I passed it along to a friend who was diagnosed after I was. She was very much into the \"inspirational\" books.

I propose that laughter is ALWAYS the best medicine. If she loves George Carlin, buy her a Carlin book. If she loves Calvin and Hobbes, buy her one of those books. If the latest panty raid on poor Britney Spears' closet makes her laugh, buy the latest copy of People magaizine. \nWhen you receive a diagnosis like hers, everyone wants to give you \"inspiration.\" If you can help your friend to laugh and FORGET THE DIAGNOSIS, if only for a few minutes, you have respected her life, who she is, what she is, and what she means to you... and that is a precious thing, when a friend can look past the diagnosis and you know they see YOU, and not \"the cancer.\"\nHope this helps...\nBEV\n ",

I will say that, in order to report that, they are probably pretty sure, but mammograms are not \"fool-proof.\" I had two palpable lumps, and my report showed no evidence of cancer. When my family doctor insisted on a biopsy, I thought he was being overly cautious, but I followed through at his insistence (he had me scheduled to see a surgeon the next day). On biopsy, my lumps were invasive cancer of two different types. They say that the younger you are and the more dense your breast tissue, the more likely you are to have a bad reading. Something like 30% of all breast cancers are missed on a mammogram. I didn't know that then, or I would have been more concerned. Now, I'm not saying I'm the norm, but...\nIf you already have the appt, I would keep it. If nothing else, you will have a second opinion from someone who specializes.

My family doctor takes a rotation running a free clinic in Guatamala 6 weeks a year, and that was during his six weeks, so I agreed to see another doctor. I explained about\n the brca and TRAM reconstruction and the increased risk of herniation (I didn't have any mesh put in at all), and she nodded as if she understood. She started to examine me, admired my tummy scar and asked who had done the work, said what an excellent PS he was...and then she said, \"hmmm...I'm looking for the RA muscle, and I can't seem to find it...\" I had a hard time being nice when I had to explain to her that, if she wanted to find my RA muscle, she would have to look a little higher than the groin area, because mine was on my chest. I just went to see the PS after that debacle, and he pronounced me hernia-free.\nI've also been battling the post-menopausal \"bulge.\" I had to put my husband on a diet, so I went on it with him. The Atkins was his choice, and I've got to say, it works. I've lost about\n 30 pounds since January, and still have 10 or so to go before I get down to pre-chemo/menopause weight. The best part...it eradicated the heartburn I'd been battling since I started chemo as well. I haven't had a pepcid or Nexium or Prilosec since day 3 of the diet. For that reason alone I would never even think about\n going back to my old eating habits.\nI've had to go through a couple of rounds of physical therapy for my back (I developed scoliosis from the TRAM), and that has really helped get the tummy in shape. I spend a lot of time on what Joyce lovingly refers to as the \"naughty ball.\"\nSo...life is good! Even after brca.\nTake care, and don't be such a stranger!\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

It's always so rewarding to celebrate those anniversaries, and I think those \"grand moments\" are all the grander to us, knowing we have beaten back cancer long enough to experience graduations, marriages, births, retirements, and even, with poignancy, deaths.\nOne of my hardest days during treatment was when my older daughter graduated 8th grade. All I could think about\n was, would I be here next year for the next one's graduation? And if I was, odds were against me seeing high school graduations. It was a very private pity party. I haven't told anyone but you guys about\n it! LOL\nMy youngest graduates college MAY 10!!! And then she's taking my GD and heading to North Carolina for grad school.

How lucky I have been to have lived long enough to have watched her birth, her first steps and first words and first lost tooth.

      "Content": " Hi, Mel. I, too, find it worrisome that the doctor would think HRT would cause such a density on a mammo. I don't know how much you know about\n breast cancer, but they usually do a test to determine whether or not a breast cancer is sensitive to female hormones or not...a hormone receptor test. You can be Estrogen/ Progesterone Receptor Positive or Negative (ER/PR + or -). If you are positive, that means that the cancer is, in a sense, feeding off of female hormones. So, if you have breast cancer, hormones are not a good thing to be taking. Some women have really good results from non-hormonal therapies for menopause. Some of the SRI's (anti-depressants) in very small doses give really good results. I use effexor, \"baby\" dose (take 37.5 mcg a day; my husband takes the same drug as an anti-depressant, and he takes 4-6x that). Other women have success with other SRI's, such as Paxil, Wellbutrin, etc... and have good results. I tried three others with no relief and gave up trying, so I was a skeptic...my onc finally convinced me to try Effexor...I could tell a HUGE difference within days. So if you're going off HRT and find that you are terribly bothered by menopausal symptoms, you might discuss an SRI as a possible remedy.\nNow, as far as not \"feeling\" a lump...not all breast cancers (and there are several types), appear as a \"lump.\" They can feel like a slight thickening in an area. (I'm sure your doctor knows this, but doctors don't always tell us what we need to know) This is why regular self-exams are so important. You don't just feel for lumps, you look for any changes in the way your breast feels. So keep in close touch with that area, and if it starts to feel different, let your doctor know! I don't tell you this to upset or worry you, or to \"second guess\" your doctor, but to encourage you to be aware of your own body. \nSeptember is just around the corner, so that is not a long time to wait. I hope the spot disappears (fingers crossed!), but if it doesn't...please insist on a biopsy. It's the only \"guarantee.\"\nAnd let us know how things turn out in September, okay?\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

I know you must be inundated with calls, so while I think of you often, I know that Joyce will give us updates. \nI just got a new grandkitty, Beau, and he is visiting this weekend. He is so adorable! He was born on my sister's farm in Missouri, so our dogs are not so intimidating to him, when compared to my sister's horses!\nI got a call from Liz yesterday, and she tells me she is going to make me a grandmother again as well...this one will be a grandpuppy. She thinks our first grandpuppy, Sasha, needs a playmate.\nI've told the girls I will take all the grandkitties and grandpuppies they want to have...but I'm hoping the actual grandchildren are few and far between! LOL \nTake care, and thanks for the update! Your name is always a welcome sight on the \"posted by\" column.\nLove and lots of hugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Mel, obviously, we are not doctors and can't interpret your test results, just offer suggestions on what it might mean. Areas of density are common in younger women. They become concerned when they see aarea of density in one breast that they don't see in the other. Our bodies tend toward symmetry.   That could be another explantation of asymmetrical density. Your doctor probably has a better understanding of how they use terminology in your area, because it does differ from place to place. \nThe problem with density is that it can hide a breast cancer, so they usually do spot compressions of the area in question to see if they can get a better read on what might be there. It may turn out to be nothing...just the way the tissue was compressed in that area. That has happened to me on my remaining breast.  Or they may want to do additional tests, such as ultrasound, or even a biopsy.\nI agree with MK on the insurance thing. Is this a COBRA benefit? Because you are typically eligible for COBRA for up to 18 months, and while it is expensive, it may be worth it. If you have a serious health issue, then you can, I think, even get it extended for the areas of health concern...and I would think Crohn's disease would qualify. Obviously, we don't know all the particulars there, but I would find out before October 2.\nHope this turns out to be nothing, which is very possible. Sounds like they are just trying to be thorough, and believe me, we have plenty of women who come here who wish they had gotten thorough exams and tests.\nLet us know how it goes, okay?\nHugs...\nBEV \n ",

      "Content": " Hubby is recovering nicely. A week without food took another 10 pounds off, so there is one benefit to being in the hospital! He has been suffering on and off since Christmas with this hernia and intermittent blockage, but this time, the blockage was not moving on its own. So, to make a long story short, he actually already looks better than he has in months. We haven't had any problems with going back on food, and no complaints about\n the Atkins, either. I still have the abdominal aortic aneurism to hang over his head. Fixing that sucker, should we ever have to (he has CT scans every few months to monitor), will make this last hospital stay seem like a cakewalk. Fortunately, it has remained stable for the last 18 months or so. Taking weight off and getting the blood pressure down, I'm hoping it shrinks. Such optimism! Like we would be that lucky??? I'm seriously thinking we should change our last name to \"murphy\" and get it over with!\nLove and hugs and mucho thanks for the well wishes...\nBEV\n \n ",

      "Content": " I agree with MK...if you want a really honest answer, I would say what the doctors give as \"word\" is not completely correct. I had a TRAM many years ago. I was told that I would be back to my normal self in 6 to 8 weeks, and that I would not only get a bonus \"tummy tuck,\" I would never have to do sit-ups again. I was 5'3\", about\n 115 pounds, and 36 at the time. I really didn't need a \"tummy tuck,\" but I did want to be even, and implants were getting a lot of bad press at the time. I didn't have the option of having both breasts removed...no law guaranteeing that back then.\nThey had to take both RA muscles to build one breast because I was so thin. I asked about\n going to physical therapy. I was told that it wasn't necessary, that my other muscles would just \"take over,\" and I would be fine. I couldn't get in my own bed for 5 months, I was so darned tight. I later developed scoliosis from the pull of the muscles on the reconstructed side. I've blown six discs as a result of the scoliosis. Physical therapy every other year or so and religious exercise are all that keep me going.\nI will say this: I think, had I gone to physical therapy to begin with (and someoone who specializes in ortho and spine), my story could be different. \nYou are a dancer. Your obliques and core stabilizing muscles are probably really strong, which would definitely be in your favor...I will admit, I never had great posture, and my core stability has always lacked something. I'm sure this contributed to my later problems. \nThe therapists I use now, and I went to several before I found someone who was really able to help me and keep me going, use a Pilates-based system. They also use stability balls alot. My obliques are nice and tight now, but the damage to my spine cannot be \"fixed.\" The damage is irreparable, aside from having surgery, and then there are no guarantees, 50/50 chance of being better or worse with surgery, and possibly putting a steel rod in to stabilize the spine. I prefer to stick with the exercise!\nMy advice would be: get a referral to a really good PT who specializes in ortho and spine rehab. Talk to them about\n what you are considering, what you want to be able to do, and see if they can keep you doing what you love to do. Then start going to PT as soon after surgery as possible!\nI don't think the doctors mean to be dishonest. They just don't understand something they have never experienced. Ironically, my plastic surgeon's nurse was diagnosed with breast cancer about\n two years after I was. I went in for my annual appointment, and I asked her if she was feeling okay. She told me she had been diagnosed, was going through chemo, and had had a TRAM about\n 6 months previous. She said, \"you know, I am still just so uncomfortably tight...when does that feeling go away???\" I had to tell her that, after two years, I was finally feeling less discomfort. \nI don't want to discourage you, but please make sure you have good info from someone besides the surgeon and plastic surgeon before making your decision, and a course of action to get back where you want to be, physically.\nSorry so long! Hope this helps.\nHugs...\nBEV\n ",

I still have my step-mom, but I can see that, while physically she keeps up with the best of them, she's not quite hitting on all sixes sometimes. She's about\n a 10-hour drive from here, but all the sibs are still within shouting distance for her. I feel like I don't do enough, though. I've been back to Missouri twice this summer for long weekends. My mothier-in-law was the most difficult. After the FIL passed away, she just quit taking care of herself. We brought her to live with us for about\n three years when she could just no longer be on her own. She wouldn't let anyone but me do anything for her. So I can definitely sympathize with you. It's as if the parent becomes the child.\nI am doing well. Graduated from physical therapy (they even hummed pomp and circumstance for me). Got one graduated from college, and she's got a grad assistantship for the fall, so that is good. And the grandbaby will be starting kindergarten in the fall! Where does the time go!\nI'm glad the biggest part of treatment is behind you. I was talking to a friend from work who was diagnosed a few years after I was, and she said she is still having bone and joint pain from the taxotere. I'm glad I didn't have that.\nWell, good to hear from you. Keep us posted. We worry when we don't hear, you know!\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " I've never been much of a drinker, myself. If it doesn't taste like fruit juice or soda pop, I don't drink it, and why pay more for the alcohol??? With an alcoholic brother and husband, I'd rather be sober, thank you. \nI know of a study done several years ago that came to the same conclusion, but don't know if it was the same study. The one I saw was looking at the effects of smoking, which they could not link, and as an interesting side point, they found that women who drank did have a higher correlation. \nTheir conclusion was: women who drink tend to be heavier (although I've known some scrawny alcoholics!), and women with increased body fat are at higher risk of breast cancer. \nWhy are they so intent to find some \"thing\" that we women do that may cause our breast cancer, but try so hard to disprove that what doctors do to us (ie...feed us hormones) could be to blame; and all the while, they could be looking for a cure for the darned disease instead. Does this make sense???\nMy mom was dead at 45, never drank, never smoked, was a pillar of the church. She may as well have enjoyed herself, I say. People always told me, \"only the good die young.\" (This was before Billy Joel, of course.) Sometimes I wanted to throttle people who told me that, because it just didn't make sense to me. Still doesn't. I agree with Billy...sooner or later, it comes down to fate. And that's about\n all there seems to be to it, to me.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV\n ",

A friend of mine actually went so far as to have a double mastectomy with implant reconstruction because of her painful breasts...she didn't have cancer, she was just miserable all the time.\nI found that my pain cycled with my periods. I tried the no caffeine, no sugar, no anything...and you are probably already doing that because of the UC??? Anyway, menopause totally cured the problem for me! At least in the one breast that I had left after the cancer.\nI found sports bras to be the most comfortable for me. The less jiggle, the less pain, and you can buy sports bras that really allow very little jiggle. I thought the compression helped some, too. I found underwires to be very uncomfortable, and I only wore them when the \"vanity factor\" was in play... hot dates (like I remember what one of those is!), formal events, etc...In other words, the underwire kind of went with the pantyhose and high heels! I don't wear too much of those anymore, either! LOL\nLet us know if it helps.\nGentle hugs...\nBEV ",

It sounds much more like fibrocystic changes. which I can tell you from experience, can be extremely painful, but have never been linked, as far as I know to developing cancer later.\nI think your friend would be wise to see her doctor, just to be on the safe side.

      "Content": " I agree with Lori. When we are going through surgeries and chemo and/or radiation, we feel like we are actively fighting the cancer. When we near the end of our treatment, we suddenly realize that, after this, the only thing left to do is wait to see if the darned thing comes back. And that is a very hard and scarey place to be, especially when you are already physically exhausted and emotionally spent from the diagnosis, the surgeries, the radiation and/or chemo. \nWe are all, at some level, afraid of dying from this disease, no matter how good a game face we put on for the rest of the world. Often, it is our family that we feel we need the best game face for. Our husbands don't want to be without their wives, our children don't want to lose their mothers, and we don't want them to know we even entertain the notion that we might be anything less than positive and as close to immortal as a mortal can be. We don't want to burden our families with our emotional wreckage, because we know that cancer has taken such an emotional toll on them as well. We tend to blame ourselves for the turmoil that our diagnoses have churned up in our homes, through no fault of our own, but mothers do that, you know, take responsiblity for things which are beyond our control\nSo just let your mom know you love her, that you are there for her, and let her decide how much of the \"hard stuff\" she can share with you. \nTake care, and best of luck to your mom!\nBEV\n ",

So far, I have been spared the \"time out ball.\" However, I made the mistake of telling Rob that I woke up, got out of bed, had a cup of coffee, and told my husband that my back actually felt pretty decent today. So. Fpr the mistake of being truthful, I will be paying with the \"time out ball\" soon. I've been doing some floor work, and then I've been getting the most fabulous neck massages. I feel two inches taller when I leave that place. So at the end of our visit today, he says, \"Well, I guess since you are doing so much better, it's time to start making you work.\" And we both know that means the time out ball, or worse...the dreaded torture device known as the \"Pilates machine.\" I'll take the time out ball over that thing any old day! I am tempted to tell him that I am going to rip his rectus abdominis muscles at the groin, tunnel them up over his rib cage, tuck them up under his armpit, and then we'll talk about\n this \"core stability\" thing. Alas, I must admit, it helps a lot. The ball is my friend. The ball is my friend. The ball is my friend. If I say it often enough, someday I might believe it.

      "Content": " Dear Anthi... Hubby is doing very well. He looks better than he has in a long time, as a matter of fact. I've slipped another disc, this one in my cervical spine, so I was out of commission for a couple of weeks. Starting to feel human again, and going through physical therapy again! This is my sixth disc to go, the first to go in my cervical spine. The bright side is, there are only so many discs, so as long as I can keep plowing through, that's just what I'm gonna do!\nAlso got a cortisone injection in the right shoulder, so that pain has dissipated greatly.\nYou know you're getting old when all you can talk about\n is your aches and pains, though!\nI'm so excited for you that you have finished the chemo! I didn't have rads, because I had the mastectomy, so I can't be much help there, but from what others tell me, just be prepared for fatigue. When you go for your planning, ask what they will do for rad burns, should you get them, and get a script\n for it before you begin. That way you have it on hand in case you need it. No sense being in pain for a weekend (and of course, it would happen on a weekend, you know!) when you don't need to.\nOther than that...good luck, sweetie! Keep us informed on your progress.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Tammy, obviously you are very concerned about\n your friend, but her doctor will be the best person to answer her questions. Fibrocystic changes can fluctuate with your menstrual cycle means just that. Breast tissue may feel lumpy and sore at different times during your cycle. Lots of women have breast pain the week before their cycle begins. Breast tissue changes with the changes in your hormone levels.\nThe suggestion that you wait thru 2 periods is pretty standard. Breast cancer is a slow-growing cancer, so even if it is cancer, two months is a short time, considering a breast cancer starts years before you feel an actual lump. So obviously, waiting til Thursday is not such a long time as it may seem. \nI hope your questions are assuaging your friend's fears rather than unintentionally feeding it. I don't know what site you were on, but symptom checkers are usually just to see if you need to see a doctor or not, they are not a diagnostic tool.\nI hope you will just reassure your friend that this is probably nothing, and suggest she write a list of questions for the doctor so she'll be sure to get all the answers she needs while she is there. Her doctor will be the best source of information for you and her.\nGood luck on Thursday.\nBEV ",

I meant to mention earlier that, while some women have pain with breast cancer, it is not considered the norm for breast cancer, and fibrocystic changes can be extremely painful. There is no one answer to relieve that pain. Some women find that eliminating caffeine helps. Some women find eliminating sugar helps. Some women use hot compresses, some cold. No one fix works for everyone.

At my doctor's suggestion, we were about\n to the point where we were going to start locking her in her room at night...and she suddenly stopped wandering around and pestering me while I was sleeping.\nSo maybe once your mom settles in and starts feeling more \"at home,\" she, too, will settle down and lay off the darned phone! \nIt's a terrible thing, to feel that you have outlived your usefulness, lost your independence, and know your mind is slipping.

I found that it made me feel a little funny...fuzzy-brained, I guess. So I backed my self right back down to one a day, and I've stayed there ever since ( and that's been several years, I think.)\nGlad the taxotere went well. I hope you don't get the body aches, too. Would love to see that black nail polish! And only 2 more! Wow! You are the lucky one. Seems like here they usually do 4 of each, but I could be wrong. They didn't have the taxanes out yet (they were in clincal trials, I think) when I was going through treatment.\nYes, good news about\n the old shoulder. I have also taken Celebrex for years for arthritis, and I was taking 400 mg a day. Apparently they've decided that isn't good for your heart, so they cut my dose in half. So all my -itis's have been acting up, but I never had problems with that shoulder before. When they went from bone scan to x-ray to MRI, I have to admit I was getting a bit nervous about\n the whole thing. I will probably have to have some surgery to repair some of the tears, but I will put that off as long as they tell me I won't do any further damage by doing so.\nMy fridge is full of eggs, too, but that's because we're getting ready for the Easter Bunny. Do you have kids? You haven't mentioned, I don't think. Mine are for my granddaughter, who is 5. She just can't wait to get to dying the eggs. And I guess for the 25-year-old, too, who still professes that she believes so she can get a basket full of goodies! LOL And that's my psychology major.\nHope to hear you're continuing to feel well over the next few days!\nL&H\nBEV ",

She often wore gloves because her hands looked so bad. She also had problems with eyes tearing. And dizziness. Her onc ended up lowering her dosage, and that helped curb the side effects significantly. But let me tell you, it kicked butt, if tumor markers are any indication of how good it works. I remember they dropped significantly when she was on it. Unfortunately, she had a hard time tolerating the side effects. Hope you have a better experience than she did.

      "Content": " Mk, my onc is one of those who likes to do bone scans, so I have had several. The way the nuclear radiologist explained it to me: a bone scan can spot large chunks of cancer, especially in the large bones. However, at the joints and in small bones, like those in the spine, it is hard to differentiate arthritis from cancer. They usually do an x-ray, MRI, or CT-scan to look at areas of increased activity that they cannot rule out cancer in. As a matter of fact, all the bone scan reports I have had have said they could not rule out the possibility of bone mets, because I have arthitis that shows up as areas of increased activity.\nEven then, the results are sometimes screwy. I just had my bone scan last week. I've been having some pain in my right shoulder. Nothing showed up in my right shoulder on the bone scan, but my left radius had a large area of increased uptake. They kept asking if I was sure I hadn't broken my arm. Went to get x-rays today of the r. shoulder and l. radius. The radius was fine. The shoulder, however, showed bone erosion of the clavicle. So tomorrow I have to go have an MRI of my shoulder. Of course, had I not had cancer, they'd probably be telling me to take two aspirin and call back in six months if it didn't stop bothering me!\nI don't have osteoporosis, thank goodness for small favors (I had my dexa last week, too), so I don't know how that shows up, but the key is, any bone damage that your body is working to \"fix,\" I guess, would show up on the scan. I would guess osteoporosis would fit that bill, but I don't know for sure.\nHope that helps a bit.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV\nHope that helps. ",

      "Content": " Oh, Anthi, I'm sorry you've been having such a rough time. That's what this board is here for! So when you get down, you post about\n it! It's true, HER2 + does have a down side, but we also know that Herceptin makes it very treatable, should it come back...and there's nowhere that says that is a given...you made it 61 years? Right? (I think that's what you posted, forgive me if I'm wrong about\n that!) And you've quit feeding those hungry little buggars estrogen now. You've got an agressive chemo plan in action...And no nodes, if I remember right, as well. Unless you've got an expiration date stamped on you that you haven't told us about\n, then I'd say your chances are very good, Anthi!\nFor all I know, I could be HER2 +. They didn't test for it back when I was diagnosed, because Herceptin was still in trial phases. Only women with mets were tested, and only those who had no other options got the drug. If I've been tested since, no one has told me about\n it. \nWeight gain is something we've all Ior most of us, anyway!) have had to deal with. If they are giving you steroids, there's not much way around it, I'm afraid. You can deal with that when the treatment is over. And walking a couple of miles a day??? Geez, I'd be gaining weight, too...muscle weighs more than fat! LOL\nThey didn't have the Taxanes when I was going through chemo, either, so I can't really speak to that, but my goodness...you're half way through, sweetie! Congratulations!!!\nEnjoy that warm and sunny weather. It's beautiful here today, too, flowers and beginning to bloom...and we're supposed to be having snow showers by the weekend. ARGHHH!!!\nPlease let us know when you're feeling low, though, really! That's what friends are for. And since we've all of us been where you are, we certainly understand.\nL&H,\nBEV\nPS...So are you fluent in French??? And do you speak other languages??? I have a degree in French, but after all these years of not using it, I've forgotten a lot more than I remember! I also took a bit of Spanish and Russian and German...Russian was actually my favorite, but there weren't a lot of programs for Russian when I was in college, so I didn't get far. At the time, my primary interest in other languages was to read them fluently, not necessarily to speak them well. I still force myself to read a book in French occasionally, but, oh, my....it is a test of my tenacity to do so! LOL ",

      "Content": " Linda...my memory is froggy sometimes, but I think I remember reading that a fibroadenoma does have a distinctive image on a mammo that makes it more likely to identify as benign. However, I'll also add that the only guarantee is a biopsy, so be glad your surgeon did one. You have no idea how many women come here, scared to death that they have a lump, have a mammo, and then are told it is \"nothing.\" It sounds like your surgeon wants to cover all the bases, and that is the best kind to have! Many of us might not be here today had our doctors let a mammogram be the deciding factor. (And I'll clarify to say that I am not talking about\n a fibroadenoma...I'm talking about\n mammograms that showed nothing when there was a palpable lump or lumps, which was the case with me.)\nI had two different biopsies, at two different hospitals, and two different wait times...same surgeon. The first, I had no wait at all. Actually, I found out when I was still on the table. The pathologist came down to to OR to see me for himself. The second, I waited a week. In my case, no news was good news. That's a philosophy I think often holds true!\nHope you don't become a member of the \"club,\" either. We never like to see new members.

      "Content": " Dear Kasey...well, that is a bummer. I'll say. first off, that everything has changed about\n how they do things since I was diagnosed, so I can't say comment on the report. Breast cancer is bad enough, without all the mumbo-jumbo of \"pathologese,\" but I think words like \"massive\" and \"extensive\" and \"widespread\" sound very ominous...until you think about\n what a small piece of breast tissue that you are talking about\n, and what they're looking at is a very small slice of that tissue, and through a microscope, no less. Without clean margins, then yes, they will at least do further excision, because they must have clean margins. \nA bone scan is a good idea. If nothing else, it gives a baseline for future scans. Unfortunately, every ache and pain we have becomes fodder for the specialists, so bone scans, xrays, and MRI's become normal tests.\nI can tell you that my initial path reports sounded very ominous as well. I was not given great odds on the 5-year survival test. But here I am, 12 years+ later, with no evidence of disease for all that time, and I am grateful for every minute of that time.\nI can also tell you that we have had women who had rather benign-sounding reports (not that they didn't have cancer, but that the tumor was small, encapsulated, no lymph involvement, etc) who did not respond well to treatment and had recurrences. So it's not as exact a science as the path report may suggest. Personally, I think it's still a bit of a crapshoot, who will do well, who will not. There certainly doesn't seem to be rhyme or reason to it.\nHope that helps. Maybe they will fast-track further surgery to get rid of that infection, too.\nLet us know how things go. I know you must feel like the world has fallen down around you. Do you have friends and family who are there for you? Personally, I didn't know anyone who knew anything about\n Breast Cancer, so I would have loved to have this group of ladies back when I was diagnosed.\nTake care,\nBEV\nHugs...\nBEV ",

Check with your new insurance for any documentation you might need when you move, and then get it from your current insurer before you go. Makes life much easier.

They are all antidepressants, but effexor works differently from the others... I had tried Paxil and Zoloft, both with no effect whatsoever. When I had a hot flash in my onc's office one day, she suggested we try effexor. She had just read about\n a study that showed it had more success than the others at controlling hot flashes. Having tried two other antidepressants, as well as Phenergan (?), with no success, I was very skeptical, but I was also desparate! I could tell a big difference in a matter of 3 days. I still occasionally have a very mild flash, but I'm talking 1 or 2 a week instead of 1 or 2 an hour. \nI take the smallest dose available once a day...I used to think that menopause would just be the \"cat's meow.\" No more periods! LOL I didn't realize that, while periods were once a month, menopause is every DAY!\nI'm glad you're working on that \"positive attitude.\" I don't believe in giving cancer one more minute of my life than I have to...it's taken enough from me as it is. \nTake care, and keep going with those languages!

      "Content": " Hi, Brenda. There are lots of sites that describe the actual process of a mastectomy (check out the resource center here), and of course, there is the staple book that every breast cancer survivor should own, Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. But if you want to know what it is LIKE to have a mastectomy, you have come to the right place. I remember rolling over on my side and crying as they wheeled me off to the operating room. I was out by the time they actually got me there. I had a TRAM-flap reconstruction done at the same time as the mastectomy, so when I woke up, I already had the new breast in place. It was not as traumatic as I had imagined it would be. I remember reading Betty Rollins' book First, You Cry, many years before, and she described hiding in the closet in the dark to change her clothes, afraid to look at herself, much less let her husband look at her scar. Well, I was determined not to be that way, so I was exposing myself to anyone who wanted to look at the breast, even while I was still in the hospital! That sounds kind of crazy, but then, most anyone here will tell you, I am kinda crazy. But you know, I think it actually helped. No one passed out. No one said, \"Oh, you poor thing...\" (Well, my mother-in-law did, but she doesn't count), and almost to a person, they lied and told me how great it looked. I think it really helped me feel better about\n it. Let me tell you, there are worse things, and I can only imagine that being dead instead would be one of them. So keep your chin up, cry when you need to (there are lots of shoulders here), and you'll get through this, too, sweetiie.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Sorry to hear you needed to come visit us here at the BRCA board. I think it's probably as upsetting for you as it is for your sister! \nI had two tumors, one lobular, and I didn't have the double. I would have preferred that at the time, but back then, they wouldn't remove a \"healthy\" breast. While lobular is more likely to \"mirror\" in the other breast, the risk is relatively small. I've been around for 12 years now, with no recurrence.\nWith no positive nodes, chemo is debateable. Some oncs would give it, regardless, based on the size and the infiltrating factors, as well as your sister's age. Others would leave it up to the individual. And some would recommend radiation followed by possible use of something like Femara or Tamoxifen. Because I had two tumors and lymph node involvement, as well as being very young, I went through chemo.\nWe have another lady on the board, Anthi, who is in Great Britain. I know it's a big place, but who knows...maybe your sister lives close to her! Anthi is currently going through chemo. \nTake care, and feel free to throw us all the questions you need to have answered! We're not doctors, but we can share our experiences.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I'm 12 years, 7 mos out from dx...and I'm still wondering if I'll be a \"survivor.\" I prefer the term \"warrior.\" Every day NED is a victory, to me, and a day worth celebrating. \nI'm sure you know that IBC is a treacherous diagnosis. And you are right, the lymph nodes are a sticky wicket. But I will tell you that I met a woman in the waiting room of my onc's office who had IBC, 11 positive nodes, and she was 16 years out from diagnosis. I met another woman at a conference who had IBC and 9 positive nodes who was 3 years out from diagnosis. Both were NED at the time I met them. So while you may be still in \"deep doo-doo,\" as you so aptly put it, I wouldn't consider your situation to be hopeless, by any means. \nIf you are not entirely comfortable with your oncologist's recommendations, then I hope you will consider a second opinion, if for nothing else than your own peace of mind. \nTake care, and let us know how it goes.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Dear Bernadette...oh, how I remember the financially strapped part. I was on a \"school year\" contract, had very little sick time, as I had not been at that job for a year, even, and no vacation, because our \"vacations\" were built into the school year. I also hadn't been there long enough for FMLA, so we had to pay insurance premiums for the time I was off. Used credit cards to make up for the lost income, then had the credit card bills to pay when I was able to go back...so we used other credit cards to make up for what we were spending on the credit cards we had used. It was a very strained time for our marriage as well, not only dealing with the money, but the cancer, too. We had recently moved to OH and were waiting for our house to sell in MD, so we were paying for two houses at the time, as well.\nIt took us a couple of years (actually3 years and two months, I think), once we sold our old house, and sitting down and planning how to get out of the hole we had dug for ourselves. We had to budget, budget, budget, and we cut up all the credit cards, save one for dire emergencies, 'til we had them ALL paid off. We're on solid ground now, but I remember how difficult it was.\nThey say that the average American family is only two paychecks away from bankruptcy, and after our experience, I believe it. \nAs we hear so often...cancer is the gift that keeps on giving.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

I know many of the women here have tramograms, but my onc is not inclined to do them. My surgeon and plastic surgeon were not pro-tramograms either, so I never pushed for it.

      "Content": " Dear Rubyshooz...\nI think I mentioned previously in a post to you that I lost some important (I thought at the time) relationships because of my cancer diagnosis. That was very hurtful. Well, I was born and raised in Smalltown, USA, and my mom took it upon herself to tell everybody and their sisters that I had cancer, gave out my phone number like beads at a Mardi Gras party, and my phone rang day and night with phone calls from people I hadn't seen or talked to in 15 years, many of whom I hadn't even been friends with since grade school. I felt like a circus sideshow, and it really made me mad (livid, to be more precise) that these people would actually call and want to hear all about\n \"the cancer.\" I felt like a freak, and all I wanted was to feel \"normal.\" In retrospect, I realize that they were just trying to be supportive and caring and had no idea how their intrusion into a very difficult time contributed to my feeling that my world was tilting wildly and that \"control\" was a concept I would never grasp again. I know, too, that my mother meant well and was only sharing her grief with anyone who would listen. Your friend is probably feeling very guilty about\n her \"enhanced assets.\" The picture...well, that is just tastelessness. \nI don't blame you for not listing this site on your journal page. We all need a place that we can go and vent without our friends and family reading everything we have to say (believe me, we all vent about\n friends and family here!)\nI am so sorry you are having a rough time, but we have truly all been there. I don't know anyone here whose world was not rocked to its very core by the diagnosis of \"cancer.\" Time is a great healer, as euphamistic as that may sound. So hang in there. It may not be better tomorrow, but one day...\nTake care.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Dear Becky...I think this is one of those times when there is just nothing adequate to say. As a parent of a two on college campuses, I can't imagine the horror of the whole situation. It is certainly a reminder of how precious and how precarious the threads that bind us to this world are. It is just so sad that this young man didn't get the help he so obviously needed. We all have our demons, I know, but think how awful this boy's must have been, to take so many innocent lives along with that of his demons'. Help for mental illness is not easy to get, even when actively sought. In our community, mental health levies fail miserably at every election. Mental health services close their doors because insurance companies make it so difficult to get admittance approval, and the professionals aren't supposed to turn away clients in need because of insurance denial. They can only \"eat\" so many costs before they have to close shop. Insurance companies hide behind privacy policies and refuse to talk to family members...can you imagine, being mentally ill and having to deal with an insurance company??? It would be laughable, were it not so shameful.\nI guess, if my ramblings are going anywhere, it is to say that we need to reform mental health services provision in this country. Support your mental health levies. And never assume that, just because your family is mentally sound, that mental illness will never touch your life. It touched so many in Virginia, across the US, and around the world this week.\nI'm listening to reports of a gunman barricaded in Building 44 of the NASA campus as I write. More lives touched who never suspected. \nLove and hugs to my breast friends, who all know how dear life is.\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Hi. I agree with the others. It is not too early for a mammogram. I, too, had lumpy, bumpy, painful breasts from my early teens on. I did regular breast exams, so I knew what my \"normal\" lumps and bumps felt like, which ones came and went...but then I found a tiny lump that felt different to me. It wasn't painful. It just wasn't like the others. So I watched it a couple of months to see if it changed or went away, and it didn't. I called my doctor, and he did a breast exam. He found a second tiny lump, much like the one I had found. I had a mammogram, which was \"normal.\" And he insisted I see a surgeon and have the lumps biopsied. Everyone assured me that \"it was probably nothing, but just to be sure...\" The lumps were both invasive breast cancers, and of different types. I was 36 at the time.\nHad I gone to a doctor who based his decision on a mammogram, I would not be here 12 years later to tell you to insist on not only a mammogram (which misses something like 30% of all breast cancers, especially in young women), but to see a surgeon and have a biopsy if you are not comfortable with the answers you get. I don't know if you have a center that specializes in breasts, but most larger cities have them, and I would ask for a referral to one, if possible.\nPain is not generally associated with breast cancers, it is more typically associated with cysts or \"fibrocystic breast disease,\" which is basically lumpy, bumpy breasts. However, pain does not rule out breast cancer, either. Some women report their breast cancers as painful. You need a definitive answer that you are comfortable with. Don't settle for a doctor who leaves you worrying.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

So I cut it short before starting chemo so it would be easier to deal with. Getting the cut was traumatic. The hair loss wasn't so bad for me. My kids were 7th and 8th graders at the time, and they had quite a bit of fun grabbing a handful of hair and just pulling it out. A novel way to entertain friends and family at that age! LOL Sinead O'Connor was \"in\" at the time, so I was quite fashionable with the \"teen\" crowd. The good news is, it does grow back! And people with thick hair seem to get it back before people with thin hair...another plus for you!\nIf they didn't \"taper off\" the steroids last treatment, ask your onc about\n it this time. Sure helped me with the big crash that I had a few days after my first chemo. Long time ago, but I think I took it for three days after the first time, then stopped. The next 8 rounds, we went three full days, then lowered the dosage the fourth, lowered again the fifth, and the sixth day I was off. Much gentler on the system that way.\nStock up on the eggs.

There's also the one about\n deoderants causing breast cancer. I don't think many of us have stopped using deoderants, either. So, my advice would be to tuck in that shirt to your heart's content. \n As for male brca, it is rare, and it tends to be genetic, as well. So unless you have dozens of relatives who have breast cancer, chances are slim that you will get it. Many of the breast cancer sites have information on performing a self-breast exam. It's not difficult, and it might give you some peace of mind. \nProstate cancer is really the equivalent for men of breast cancer in women. While you're checking out self-exams, might I suggest that you learn to examine for that as well. Much more likely to save your life. ",

I had both infiltrating ductal and infiltrating lobular, had a mod radical mast. I was ER+ and PR+, stage !!b, 13 nodes removed, 3+. I am fortunate that I haven't had lymphedema to deal with. It can really be miserable. I didn't have a hysterectomy, although I am still considering it due to a family history of ovarian cancer, and the geneticist has recommended it. But chemo put me into menopause at 36, so I know what that is like. That was 12 years ago, and Effexor has really helped me with my menopausal symptoms. Different antidepressants help different women...I went through 3 others before they tried the Effexor, and it worked like a charm. \nDo you have mets to the bones? Is that the cause of the bone pain? Or is it an aftereffect of the chemo? I'm not sure what you mean by 3/4 for all stages? \nGlad you found us and hope you will visit often.

      "Content": " Dear Anthi...I was much younger than you when I went through chemo, but it was years ago, so I had CAF, which they rarely do here anymore. I had treatments every three weeks for 6 months. Only you can decide if chemo is worth what it will buy you. Chemo is not a cure for breast cancer, but is designed to buy time. I've never heard the 3% figure for older women, but I don't know everything. \nI have read that the hormonal treatments (tamoxifen or arimedex) are at least as effective for post-menopausal women who are er+/pr+, but that was before the current standard treatment regimen they give here, which seems to be CA followed by Taxane therapy.\nI will tell you that I continued to work through chemo, and I never missed a day while going through chemo. I was exhausted most of the time, but with anti-nausea drugs, I was never sick...I actually gained weight on chemo, as has been the experience of many of the women here!\nThis is a very personal decision. For me, I had two young kids to raise, and there was not a doubt in my mind that whatever increased my odds by a minute was worth it. So think of it this way. The hope of chemo is that it will buy 5 years that otherwise might have been lost. So...five years. You've just retired, I know...I would say, YES! I want five years! But that's me. You could have five years or ten or twenty, either way. But with positive nodes....I'd take the chemo...or, at the very least, one of the hormone blockers.\nGood luck in your decision, sweetie.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I do know, however, that some of the info is not that bad...and the grade, well, that can be an indication of the agressiveness of the cancer, but not always. \nSentinel Node Biopsies are deemed reliable indicators of lymphatic invasion. Again, I 'm no expert, but they are pretty standard with the procedure your doctor is recommending.\nYou will have better information following your next procedure, and your doctor will be able to steer you better at that time.\nI can imagine that you are in shock right now! We all were right after diagnosis, and sometimes, it takes awhile to sink in. Between now and the next procedure, you will no doubt become a \"mini-expert\" on breast cancer if you visit this board often!\nI am 12 years out from diagnosis, so things have changed alot in those years (ie...they didn't have sentinel node biopsies back then!) But trust me, there is life after breast cancer, although you may not feel that way now!\nSo... I suggest you write down questions you want to ask your doctor, take someone with you to appointments (and ask them to write down answers for you, if you want), and tell us a bit about\n yourself. Where you are in life (age, menopausal status, family history, etc) can sometimes have a make a big difference in how questions are answered.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

Have you given any more thought to going to your Mom's for Christmas? \nIt sounds like your Dr. K has a good head on his shoulders. As Lori says, her tumor was a grade 3, and she only had a lumpectomy; so it is not uncommon to start there. The question becomes getting clean margins that are free of cancer. When I had my mastectomy, I had two tumors, I was small, and I wouldn't have had enough boob left after removing the tumors and enough tissue to get clean margins, so lumpectomy was not even an option for me. So just be aware that you may lose more tissue than you had anticipated. I had a friend who lost a third of her breast by doing a lumpectomy. You can always have the other breast reduced to \"match.\" (At least you can here in the US...there is a law that says they have to give you matching \"headlights\" now...wasn't that way when I had my mastectomy).\nI'm glad you got off the HRT. Are you having to deal with menopausal symptoms again? \nWell, good luck with your surgery. Let us know how it goes!\nBEV ",

He can live with that better than anything, I think. He tried it before, his version of it, and did actually lose some weight. But his version of it was: I can eat all the potato chips I want, because they are mostly fat. I can eat ice cream, because it has a lot of fat. I can put cream sauce on anything because (can you guess???) it has a lot of fat. How he lost weight, I will never know, but I guess it was getting rid of the breads and pastas. \nWhen I bought the book, the diet went by the wayside. But we'll try it the right way, now, and see if it works. \nOf course, making him exercise may require the use of a cattle prod, but I've always wanted to use one of those, and I'm willing to give it a try. Jo-Ann, my good old Texas buddy, any tips on handling those suckers???\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

LOL Honestly, I didn't have all that much to begin with, but when they reduced/lifted the \"good\" side to match the TRAM, it actually looked like I had more than I started with. Like I said, it was PERKY!\nThe nice thing about\n the TRAM is that it loses weight with the rest of your body, so if you do lose some weight later, you won't be \"mismatched.\"\nI've had a lot of back problems that may be associated with the TRAM, but looks-wise, it's fine. I didn't have a good back to begin with, and messing with the support system was probably not the wisest choice for me. But hindsight is 20-20. \nAgain, hope all goes well with your surgery!\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Have you considered doing a mastectomy on the remaining breast and reconstructing both sides at once? I ask that because I have battled back problems after having both muscles taken to build the right side. I don't think this is the case for most people, but please, if you do this, ask for physical therapy afterward to work on core strength and stability so that you avoid problems. The only \"repair\" for my back involves entry through the sternum and steel rods. My doctors insisted I didn't need physical therapy at the time. At the time I had the Tram flap reconstruction done, and it was a long surgery and a long recovery, surgery on the remaining breast was not an option for me...but that would have been my first choice. And that is what most women, these days, choose to do, I think, if they do the Tram. Just a thought to consider. \nI don't share this information to scare you. Whatever choice you make has physical consequences. Wearing a prosthesis can cause back and shoulder problems, having an implant can result in a rupture or a problems with scar tissue...so I want you to know that I am not telling you that this to discourage you from the procedure...just want you to remain as healthy as possible afterwards!!! \nAfter all you have been through, I can't believe that you are ready to undergo an elective surgery! You must be a trooper, my dear! Good luck with the surgery, Kim.\nHope you'll let us know how it goes!\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Azia, you probably think we're crazy to be asking all these wierd questions. You are young, so while it may not be anything, please do not think you are \"too young\" for breast cancer. I was 36 at diagnosis, and I am by far not the youngest dx here. \nDimpling is a concern because of a condition known as \"peau d'orange,\" which is dimpling that is caused by a fixed tumor which pulls against the skin and creates a texturing of the skin similar to an orange rind. So that being said, I will tell you that my daughter (in her 20's) has a bulging area on her breast where the skin \"dimples,\" something like cellulite on the thighs. It is just a fatty growth, and of no concern to her doctors. But you can bet she had it thoroughly checked! And her doctor does keep an eye on it.\nI definitely think you should have it checked out. Waiting a couple of weeks, even if it would prove to be cancer, is probably not going to make a huge difference. Breast cancer is typically slow growing, and it usually takes years for a tumor to grow to a detectable size, so a couple of weeks is small potatoes. \nPlease be aware, too, that mammograms are not foolproof. I had two cancerous tumors, neither of which showed on a mammogram. The only way to be sure is to have a biopsy. So if the mammo and doctor's explanation is not adequate for you, don't be afraid to ask for a biopsy to be sure. \nGood luck, sweetie. Let us know how it goes!\nBEV ",

So take something you can throw over you if you get chilled. Also, it made my nose itch (I can't remember whether it was cytoxin or 5-fu)!

      "Content": " Hi, Kim. about\n the back thing. Yes, the problems I have began with the reconstruction pulling to that side, so it was in the thoracic spine area. I ended up with scoliosis and disc herniations. Because back problems tend to \"migrate,\" the damage later continued into the lumbar/sacral spine. Again, progressive scoliosis and bulging disc problems. \nAdditionally, you have to remember that the abdominal muscles that they move for a TRAM are the primary support system for the spine. And while my doctors assured me that the obliques would simply take over for the missing muscles, and I guess for some people that is true, it wasn't the case for me. \nWhen I finally found a good spine rehab physical therapist to help me, I learned that when you lose one set of muscles, it's not uncommon for corresponding muscles to shut down as well.\nThe scoliosis, I will never be able to correct. I think that, had I had the proper physical therapy to begin with, I would have avoided some of these problems.\nA friend of mine who had a double TRAM is now going through lower back problems as well from the lack of spinal support.\nAgain, I don't want you to avoid the surgery, but just talk to you PS and then get the proper follow-up care! \nBEV\nPS>>>My new nipple started out \"at attention,\" but then flattened out over time, possibly because I prefer sports bras. Even with a \"lift\" on the other side, they just don't fill bra cups the same way (the \"hang\" is different).\nBiggest benefit of TRAM...I can put on the same old swim suit I wore before cancer and not worry about\n anything floating out!

And if you were, did they tell you to discontinue it? Since you were ER+, just want to be sure they have that base covered.\nHope they get your surgery scheduled for Wednesday, as you hoped.\nTake care...\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I lost my mom to cancer when I was 7, so when I was diagnosed, I thought it was all over but for the fat lady singing. I already knew that it was in my nodes, because they (one in particular) were larger and easier to feel than the tumors in the breast. I remember my surgeon telling me, \"This is not the end of the world.\" And I thought that was so easy for HIM to say! The same guy that had told me a couple of weeks before, \"Well, I don't think it's anything, but we'll do a biopsy just to be sure.\" \nAnyway, that was 12 years ago, so I guess he was right afterall. I've done a lot of living in those 12 years, let me tell you! I got to watch my girls grow up, my granddaughter being born, and now she's growing up way too fast (she's 5 now!) I don't know if I'll be around to dance at her wedding, but if I am, let me tell you, and I will say a secret prayer of thanks for that doctor.\nMy family always seems to get hit with grief at the holidays...my mom died the day after Christmas, I had my surgery in early December, I almost lost my sil and nephew in a fire that started in their Christmas tree, I almost lost my daughter to a ruptured appendix a few days before Christmas, and my brother was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few days before Christmas. I dread the holidays like the plague, and I'm sure the season will always be a hard one for you as well. Our dear friend and moderator MK isn't around to say it, because she's in the middle of a move, so I'll offer you her famous line: Try not to worry until you know you have something to worry about\n! Just focus on making this a good holiday for your kids, and enjoy every minute of it with them. \nPS...you have a beautiful name! Is there a significant meaning to it?\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Hi, Im so sorry you had to come here for advice, but you came to a good place for it. \nMy girls were in 7th and 8th grades when I was diagnosed, and I chose to tell them about\n the possibility as soon as I got mammogram results back (which were normal, but the doctor insisted on a biopsy, anyway). I lost my mother to cancer when I was 7, and no one told me a darned thing. I knew my mom was sick, but until my grandmother told me \"the angels came and took your mother to heaven last night,\" I had no clue that she wouldn't be getting better. I was totally unprepared, and knew what that felt like, and I didn't want to do that to my children. So they knew from the beginning of the whole thing. I also told their school, and they were very supportive of the girls. We were new to the area, and classmates told their parents, and parents made sure my daughers had invitations for after school while I was in the hospital and sent meals to the house for my family. It was very touching.\nI just reassured my kids that, whatever happened, we would get through it as a family. They were very supportive and a big help in my recovery. \nI, too, had two tumors, both infiltrating, ductal and lobular, and 3 positive nodes. That was 12 years ago. Both girls are finishing up their undergrad degrees now, getting geared up for grad school. I have a beautiful 5-year-old granddaughter, who is the light of my life, and I've remained NED (no evidence of disease) since surgery and chemo.\nAs for telling other family members, your sister does need to know, if nothing else, for her own health (she is now at greater risk). I told my step-mom and let her tell everyone else. My brother was upset that I didn't give him the news myself, but at that time, I had done all the sharing and crying with people I could handle, and I knew how crushed my brother would be. He was diagnosed a few years later with prostate cancer, and he, too, is still doing well.\nGood luck to you. And please...tell your kids. You'll probably be surprised at how strong they can be!\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I had the older CAF, 9 rounds, so I don't know how that compares with the A/C followed by taxanes that they use today. But I do know that I never threw up and I never missed a day of work. I was queasy sometimes, tired most of the time, but I was determined to keep my life as normal as possible. \nI've heard as many complaints about\n the effects of radiation as I have chemo, I think. \nJust think about\n what you could do for six months when your choice is between that and the rest of your life! I know that 6 months of chemo was well worth the twelve years that I've had to watch my children grow up, watch my granddaughter be born...I'm going Tuesday to see her Christmas program at preschool (she just turned five!)...and let me tell you, in retrospect, I know that 6 months of chemo will be worth that one evening alone! \nAnd believe it or not, I think often of how worth it those six months of chemo were to me. Every day, I am reminded of how lucky I am to still be here. I lost my mother to cancer when I was 7...she had experimental chemo and whole body radiation to try to get more time. She was sick as a dog from the cancer and the treatments alike. But I like to think that her attempts to survive somehow helped the scientific process that has given me these extra years.\nJust my perceptions, and I know...it's so much easier to look back on it now than it was to face the \"unknown\" back then!

      "Content": " Different oncologists have different opinions, but I think most, with invasive cancer, recommend chemo, just to be safe. They don't remove all the lymph nodes in a dissection, but take a sample. In lay terms, if the cancer is invasive, it is always possible that a few cancer cells have escaped the lymph nodes and are roaming free. There can be micrometasteses that go undetected through the usual scans and such, which typically pick up only large chunks of cancer (remember, a breast cancer tumor has been growing for 8 years or so before it is palpable or detectable on a mammogram!).\nRadiation will treat the area of the tumor only, to kill cells that may remain. The hope is that chemo will kill any cells that have escaped the immediate area.\nI know women who had no nodes, had chemo, and still developed metastatic disease. Your age is a consideration because younger women tend to have more agressive cancers. \nPlease remember that there is no \"cure\" for breast cancer. We simply fight with all we have at our disposal. I would take comfort in the fact that your oncologist wants to take every avenue possible to prevent recurrence. \nGood luck in your fight.\nBEV ",

If you've always eaten soy in something...like your cereal or your gingersnaps, for example, go ahead and continue to eat it. But don't go out seeking soy products to add to your diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy milk in hopes of curbing hot flashes, for instance. \nApparently the whole soy thing is very complicated. Studies are showing that where the soy was grown can significantly affect the quality of the phyto-estrogens... Japanese soy has different acting phytoestrogens than soy grown here in the US. \nSo my advice is...follow the advice of a doctor that you trust to have the information that you need. I trust my onc for that kind of thing. I've been with her for 12+ years now with NED status.\nAnd don't drive yourself crazy with this kind of thing! Worry isn't good for your health, either!\nFind something to laugh about\n today instead...there is nothing more healing.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

I had a long history of cysts, but I could feel a big difference between the cysts that I had dealt with for years and the cancerous lumps that I later had. Based on family history, your doctor probably just wants to make sure that cysts are all that you have. \nBased on my family history, I decided to have genetic testing done, and to my surprise, and that of the geneticists, too, I think, I was negative for a known genetic predisposition.\nI hope your visit with the surgeon goes well. He may be able to aspirate the cysts, but he may want biopsies as well, just to be sure. \nBest of luck at your appointment tomorrow. Let us know how it goes.\nBEV ",

As a final note of irony...many women go through a bout of depression after treatment...you spend months having surgery, seeing doctors, undergoing chemo and/ or radiation, and then...suddenly you are doing nothing. Your hair grows back. For months, you don't see a doctor, have a blood test, go to a treatment, and you feel very vulnerable. Suddenly you're doing nothing to activley fight \"the cancer.\" We've all had our share of good cries in the shower, you can be sure. I've been living with the aftermath of breast cancer for almost 12 years now...and I still sometimes have to have a good cry about\n it...and then I remind myself that I just gave cancer a minute (or two or five) of my life that I didn't have to give it. Every minute I give in to cancer is a minute of my life that I have just freely wasted, and personally, that's not how I want to spend however minutes I have left in this life!\nGood luck to you, Leah. And just keep your thoughts on that daughter, how you're going to see her grow up and graduate from college and annoint you with beautiful grandbabies to love someday.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

My first visit to the oncologist was informational (for her and me). We reviewed my family history, all my surgical results, and she gave her recommendations for treatment. I went back a few days later, had baseline bone scans, chest xray, muga, and blood panels run, and then I started chemo that same day. I was 22 days out from surgery at that point. \nSome oncologists don't do baseline scans before chemo, some wait longer before beginning chemo. It really depends on what you and the oncologist think is best for you.\nGood luck on your visit. Any other questions, I'm sure you'll get lots of answers here.\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Bernadette, I would have had them both off if they would have let me. Didn't have that option back then. I like to tell stories, so I'll tell you my \"remaining breast\" story. I had a very dear friend/ coworker who had breast cancer, also. One day I walked into the office and she told me another of our friends, Peggy, had been diagnosed with mets. I was shocked. We had just seen her a few weeks before, and it just didn't seem possible. My phone rang, and I just couldn't talk to anyone right then, so I let it go.\nWhen I checked my messages, it was my oncology nurse. My bone scan, chest x-rays, and bloodwork were fine, but my mammogram showed a mass in my remaining breast, and I needed to call the office immediately. All I could think of was how lucky I was didn't show signs of mets. Losing my remaining breast seemed like a piece of cake. \nThis story had a happy ending for me. Follow-up tests showed no mass present. Still have the breast. Still have the mammograms. But I would much rather have the thing gone and not have the worry.\nThe story didn't end so well for my friends. Peggy came to Cincinnati to help me put JoAnn to rest a few months later, and then we lost our Peggy, too.\nYou know, to have boobs is just not worth it.\nGood luck, Bernadette. I don't post much, because I feel like a lot of my experiences are not very relevant. Surgeries have changed, chemo has changed, even the laws have changed so that women CAN make the decision to have both breasts removed. But I do enjoy reading your posts.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

Through the chest area, where my breast should have been, but have no feeling in the reconstruction, so... turned out to be a pinched nerve that was the culprit. Where the pain is depends on which nerve is pinched, so I'm sure you could have pain in the arm pit as well. \nHope that is all it is. (I hate hoping for things like that! Like that wouldn't be bad enough! But at least it's not \"the cancer.\")\nBTW...my arm pit itched FURIOUSLY for a few months before I was diagnosed. Haven't had itchy pits since. Anybody else? \nAnd another BTW...miss you! Do you have my cell #? Since we moved, we gave up the landline. Would love to hear from you!\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " If insurance is the issue for your friend, there are organizations that can help with the expense of a breast cancer battle. If she has other resources that she is unwilling to use, however, I don't think that information would help her. If she has cancer, and if it is advanced, she could probably qualify for disability from SSA. I think it takes two years before you are eligible for Medicare under the disability program. \nI am sorry you are fighting this battle for her instead of with her. There may be nothing you can do to change her mind. Some people simply choose to do nothing. While that is not a choice we have made here, it is a choice in the options of dealing with cancer, whether it is diagnosed or not.\nIf you didn't think her problem were serious, I doubt you would have made your way to this board. I can't help but believe that she thinks it could be serious as well. Breast cancer, especially when treated agressively and early, is not necessarily a death sentence. Many people don't realize that...and there are many more who don't realize that you can die of breast cancer at all.\nGood luck to you. I know you have made it your mission to help your friend.

      "Content": " Lori gives good advice. I will add my 2 cents, although it probably isn't worth that much. I didn't have a choice...too many factors going against me. \nBut if you are considering a lumpectomy, you should know that you may not have a \"normal-looking\" breast left, either. Surgeons like to get a sizeable clean margin, which means taking out quite a bit of breast tissue. What you're left with depends on how much you had to begin with, and how much they have to remove. You can often have the remaining breast reduced to more closely match the lumpectomy breast.\nAlso, I know several young women who opted for mastectomy over lumpectomy, only to find that there was additional cancer in the breast that had not been detected yet. They would have been looking at a mastectomy down the road. A mastectomy is not a \"cure\" for cancer either. I have a friend who had a mastectomy, reconstruction...and then had a recurrence on the chest wall.\nOn a brighter note, I've been around a good many years since my surgery...11 and still counting, and I can count a long way! So I wish you well in your decision...and know that we don't survive this fight without battle scars, but we can survive. When I look back on what really worried me then, that is the important thing to know.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Hi, Di. I'm really sorry to hear about\n all the health problems. about\n the pap, though, please follow MK's advice and don't worry til you know there is something to worry about\n. Pap tests are tricky little things, and abnormal readings are actually fairly normal. I've had several abnormal readings, gone through all the colposcopies, etc., only to have normal readings later, then an abnormal, and on and on. \nAs far as what can go wrong, I learned a lot from genetics clinic. Apparently things aren't quite as black and white as now you have the organ, now you don't. Our ovaries, vagina, and associated parts start out in utero much higher in the body, and as they travel down to their anatomically correct positions, they leave behind cells. So even with a complete hysterectomy, there is a chance of getting female cancers in these trace cells that are left behind. I think of it as kind of like a mastectomy...while they try to get all of the breast tissue, there may be cells of tissue left behind, and we can get malignancies in those cells.\nAnyway, not to scare you, but just sharing what I was told by the good doctors. (They have recommended that I have a total hysterectomy to lessen my chances of ovarian cancer--right now I'm just sticking to the exams, CA-125, and t-v ultrasounds--just don't want to deal with surgery.)\nBest wishes heading your way.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

Some doctors do initial scans as a baseline, then don't do them again until there appears to be something amiss (aches, pains, etc...) Some doctors do them every year or two. Tests such as bone scans can be misleading. Arthritis and other changes show up and flag as hot spots, but you could have cancer and it not be detected because it may not be a big enough \"chunk\" at the time of the scan. I've had two MRI's and several x-rays in the last 6 months because I had pain in my lower back right after a scan, and it showed up on the scan. Had I not been a brca patient with a \"?\" bone scan, I would have probably gotten perscript\nion motrin and a PT script\n. \nI've had friends who had scans and bloodwork that showed nothing when they had symptomatic mets. I've had friends who were asymptomatic and their mets were found via scans and bloodwork. \nI think if you have good insurance and an onc who wants you to feel at ease, you can decide for yourself about\n the scans.

It is a large therapy ball, and it is extremely helpful in building \"core stability,\" of which I had none, largely because of the TRAM surgery. The PT explained it this way: The doctors tell you that your obliques will kick in and \"take over\" for your rectus muscles. Instead, the obliques begin shutting down as well, and then the back muscles, and then you're in a heck of a shape.\nI was so weak, I had to start with what I called \"remedial\" exercises on the floor...couldn't do hardly anything.\nJoyce, I must tell you that the ball has actually become my friend. I've even mastered the \"clam shell,\" how about\n that?!\nBecky... great news about\n your sister. I'm so happy for you AND her!\nLuci... we could maybe be more politically correct and call them \"chicken bones,\" what do you think?

I haven't had hysterectomy yet, but it has been recommended by genetics that I do...just keep putting it off. Anyway, I hit menopause like a brick wall during chemo (at 36) and never left it, so the parts are just spare at this point anyway. But my question would be, why not have it all out? I'll tell you, I had an aunt who had a partial hyseterectomy and later went through ovarian cancer. Why risk that? It makes no sense to me to keep ovaries if you're having your uterus removed. By the way...I've been in menopause for 12 years now, and dexascans say my bones are fine...as a matter of fact, they said on the last one that I have bone age equivalent to a 36-year-old (I'm almost 48 now), so I don't think lack of estrogen has hurt my bones at all. I don't do anything but drink my milk. \nGood luck, and let us hear from you a bit more often, sweetie!\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

      "Content": " Ah...Dr. Douglass, purveyor of \"the daily dose.\" It's easy to knock traditional medicine until you need it. Yes, chemotherapy is a toxin. It is designed specifically to kill fast growing cells. Did I want to have toxic chemicals pumped into my veins...or did I want to die or breast cancer? For me, the choice was pretty simple. I had young children at the time...I wanted to see them grow up. I didn't want to leave motherless children behind the way my mother had to do. Yes, my mother died of her cancer. I was seven. Chemo and radiation were experimental then, and my mother tried them...of course, by the time they found her cancer, it was in her liver and bones and brain, to name just a few of the places, because it was literally systemic. The doctors told my dad they could see it spreading with the naked eye when they \nopened her up. So they sewed her back up and told her about\n the experimental stuff. Maybe, just maybe, I'm alive today because my mother was willing to be a guinea pig in hopes that she could live just a little longer...long enough, maybe, to see me grow up. I've lived more years now as a cancer survivor than I lived with a mother. I got to watch my children grow up, thanks to chemo. Now I'm a grandmother, and I have a beautiful granddaughter who is the light of my life. And if the cancer comes back, I'll do chemo or radiation or whatever is the best chance of survival so I have the best chance of watching that little girl grow up. And maybe, if all the options left are experimental ones, my daughters and granddaughters will live longer than I, long enough to see their grandchildren or even their great-grandchildren grow up, because I was willing to be a guinea pig.\nSo Dr. Douglas can keep his daily dose, as far as I'm concerned. Cancer is a time for life and death decisions. Chemo is not the cure for breast cancer. There IS no cure for breast cancer. Chemo is time, pure and simple. A short time for some of us, a long time for others. But it is more time than we had on the day of diagnosis.\nPlease be supportive of your sister in her choice to poison the beast that is stealing her life. That bus may come along tomorrow, but I'm not going to stand in the middle of the road and wait for it to get here!\nBEV ",

      "Content": " My best advice is this: have a good attitude, good friends, and live each day as if it could be your last. You could be hit by a bus tomorrow and be just as dead, and all the cranberry juice and vitamins and antioxidants are not going to change that. Encourage your sister to enjoy each and every day. If taking vitamins makes your sister feel like she is improving the quality of her life, by all means, take them. But none of the things on your list are going to be as effective at fighting cancer as chemo and radiation, if they are recommended. So if surviving cancer is the goal, those are the best bets. Your sister's oncologist is the probably the best source for info on diet, etc. Most oncologists are not opposed to nutritional supplements that do not interfere with their chemo or radiation treatments. Or you may have a cancer center in your community that can give you that kind of information. \nGood luck to your sister. Wish her all the best. And she is lucky to have a supportive sister who wants to help.\nHugs...\nBEV ",

I'm just too lazy to go back and finish another one, although it would definitely increase options for the future. \nDeb, my brother's store is in Marshall, Mo, which is about\n 30 miles from Sedalia. It's called \"Court Street Classics.\" You should go check it out...I know for a fact he just got a lot of new inventory! LOL And MK, he could have asked me to pay HIM to take the stuff and I would have! But yes, he gave us a good price, and I think he'll make a few bucks on the deal as well. May as well be family who profits.\nMy kids have been in and out, too, Deb...so we're making sure we don't have enough room for them to keep doing that! LOL No...we'll still have three bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths. Now we have 4 bedrooms and 3 full, 2 half baths. I can spend a whole day just cleaning bathrooms here! And my hub has severe arthritis, fibromyalgia, a few ruptured discs, one knee replacement under his belt...yadayadayada...so we need everything on one floor for him.\nGetting old just sucks, sometimes....but it's better than the alternative!\nLove and hugs to all...\nBEV ",

My last mammogram, I had a call-back because they inadvertently ordered a screening rather than a diagnostic procedure. It took two weeks to get the call-back, then another 6 to get another diagnositc mammogram scheduled. When I saw the \"mass\" on the original mammogram, I thought that was it. Turned out to be nothing once they did the compression views. The radiologist talked to me and showed me the pictures before I left the office. I left in total shock...I had been prepared for and expecting the worst! \nThe moral of this story: You just never know how it's going to work, even if you keep going to the same place!!!\nThe good news is, they want to be sure they have it right.

Anyway, I was not thrilled with the whole concept of the nipple reconstruction, either, but I went ahead and did it, because after all the other cutting and hacking and moving and whacking and nipping and tucking and god-only-knows-what-else they did while I was under....I figured I may as well. I had nipple sharing, which means that they cut and hacked and moved and whacked and nipped and tucked the \"good\" side while they were \"nippling\" the reconstruction.\nAll in all, it was not a big deal. Watched the whole procedure, went home and got myself ready to go help a friend say goodbye to her husband, who was 24and had leukemia. The next day I cooked Thanksgiving dinner for like 20 people. I was just thankful to be alive. Back to the nipple thing, though, I can't say it made me feel good, bad, or indifferent about how I looked or how I felt about \"cancer.\" I see the scars every day. The only thing good about reconstruction, as far as I'm concerned, is I wear the same bras and I don't have to worry about anything floating away in the pool! Back then, I would have just as soon had them both off, but back then, they \"didn't do that.\" Today...well, I'd still just as soon have them both off, not have to worry about a bra, and not have to worry about anything floating away in the pool!\n I hate the frggin' disease of \"cancer.\" \nAnd I hate to tell you, but you are never \"done\" with this disease.

I was suffering from osteoarthritis BEFORE I was diagnosed with cancer, and I was only 36 at DX. Getting out of bed in the morning was pure agony for me. Chemo didn't make it worse or better, and I didn't do the Tamoxifen or Femara thing. But Celebrex really changed my daily pain levels. What chemo did give me was: menopause at 36, chronic heartburn, which I haven't gotten over yet, but never had prior to chemo, and extra pounds that are still hanging on. Now, a \"baby doc\" once told me that she had heard that Celebrex causes water weight, and that if I stopped taking it, I might lose some poundage. Anybody else heard that one before? Not that I would trade the loss of pounds for the return of the pain, but just curious.\nAnd of course, we all know that chemo fries a few brain cells. At least I'm smart enough to know I'm dumber than I used to be! \nAll in all, ladies, you have to admit...it's still better than being dead! Carpe diem.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

In all fairness, he only \"docs\" part time. I probably could have gotten in much sooner if I had been willing to see just anybody (translates to \"resident\").

I was still being stitched up from the biopsy when I noticed a man standing in the door to the operating room, and he was just staring at me with the saddest eyes I had ever seen. It was so disorienting, and I couldn't figure out why he was there, why they were just letting him stare at me like that....and then I heard the nurse saying to my surgeon that the pathologist wanted to see him. I knew exactly what he was there for then, and all I could think to do was lay there and pretend like I didn't know what was going on until I could get out of that room and get my clothes back on. That man's eyes told me everything I needed to know without the word \"cancer\" ever being said. A picture does tell a thousand words. At least he gave me a few minutes to prepare myself for the words that I knew were coming.\nCongrats on your six years!\nLove and hugs, Joyce.\nBEV ",

Check with your gynocologist. All my bloodwork indicated that these were not periods, even though they were very similar....crampsand all!\nLove and hugs...BEV ",

So all I had was my gut telling me it was probably cancer, and everyone else was just trying to ease my mind of that concern. I honestly think the surgeon was more shocked than I was! \nAnd yes...where is Connie? I've noticed her lack of activity here. Hope all is well with her.\nLove and hugs...\nBEV ",

She was opposed to surgery, but has agreed to have it....I missed 6 weeks of work with my surgery, but I never missed a day of work throughout my chemo treatment. I would think that, IF this turns out to be cancer, then the surgeon will be able to recommend a good oncologist for you....I started having back problems a few years after the surgery, and much of it, I can attribute to the surgery. Most Plastic surgeons don't, from what I know, but I think it should be recommended for all mastecomy patients, regardless of the reconstruction....Anyway, not to scare you, but just sharing what I was told by the good doctors. (They have recommended that I have a total hysterectomy to lessen my chances of ovarian cancer--right now I'm just sticking to the exams, CA-125, and t-v ultrasounds--just don't want to deal with surgery.)...Plastic surgeon and surgeon didn't think that was the cause, but family physician, orthopedic doc, and physical therapists all agree it is a result of the surgery. Have they recommended any physical therapy for you?...Typically, radiation is recommended following a lumpectomy. Obviously, surgeons can't be sure that they got every cancer cell removed, so the radiation is to take care of any stray cells that may have been missed in the surgery....",
