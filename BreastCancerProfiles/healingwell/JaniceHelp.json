    "Content": " Let me just start out by saying the process needs to change. I had to wait 2 weeks of my life for a Radiologist to tell me what I already knew. I was notified that the breast tissue on my left breast had a changed and that they wanted me to come back for some additional views. O.K., I thought to myself, that's strange? I am getting older and maybe it was menopause that changed my tissue. You can only imagine, (and I know you can imagine the thoughts that went through my mind) I scheduled the appointment but during that time frame I admit, I was nervous. I went in today and got the two additional views of my left breast then waited for the Radiologist on site to read them. After approximately 5 minutes the Rad Tech and the Radiologist came in and told me, \"Everything looks fine! We'll see you in a year.\" My comment back was, \"Why didn't you just take the 4 views upfront and not take the 2 years off of my life?\" He looked at me and said, \"Well, that is something I can talk to my bosses about\n.\" Really? I thought. Why wouldn't you just take all 8 views up front - have the Radiologist on site and save me the anguish and the stress? Do they really have any idea what that does to a person? I did my research. I went on-line. What does a 2nd mammogram mean? I read the reviews on this site and my heart went out to all the pain I read. I also went on WebMD to get their views of what a 2nd mammogram means. They said that 95% of women that get called back for a 2nd mammogram have no issues, or I will say it, or maybe I won't, the \"C\" word. So, what you are telling me is that you make 95% of women go through the torment and stress of waiting for that 2nd mammogram and their results are fine. I'm sorry, but the process has to change! I also saw the dollar signs billed to thousands of health insurance companies because of a process that could have saved our health insurance industry millions of dollars. Why would it be impractical to take the 8 views you need upfront - have the Radiologist on site and say, \"we're good!\" How dare you make millions of women go through the torture and anxiety of having to wait to find out that the initial 4 views showed something that wasn't there? What if I didn't have to wait 2 weeks? What if I was in a rural area and had to wait 2 months? Of course, my heart goes out to those of you waiting. What I want you to do is be strong in your thoughts. The thoughts that went through my mind over those 2 weeks were, \"My breasts feel exactly the same. It must just be the way they are reading the films. I'm fine.\" But on the other hand it was, \"It is what is it, I can't change it. I'll just have to deal with whatever comes my way and be strong.\" Other thoughts were, \"Well, I guess If I have something I will just have them take it and get breast construction surgery. I've always wanted to have a little lift anyway.\" Other thoughts were, \"How will I tell my sons and my husband? How will we move forward together with this process?\" Other thoughts were, \"How much time will I have to take off of work if I do have something?\" I know that my co-workers will be supportive of me, but it will strain my time off, and the bills.\" As the tears well in my eyes, I am so mad that the process made me go through all these thoughts and doubts. I believe that if the Administrators, Chiefs, Directors, CEOs of these facilities knew what WE as women go through for what they might think is the simple \"call back\" of a 2nd mammogram - Please, change the process.\n ",
