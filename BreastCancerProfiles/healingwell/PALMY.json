Recently had a mammo done and calcium spots were found in my breast. I saw a breast specalist who said  he is not too concerned but wants a biopsy to be sure. The procedure was explained, the biopsy only takes a few minuet but I would  be there for about\n 1 hour with compression on the breast. I went the net and have myself scared out of mind most sites saying it is cancer but some saying fibrocystic changes. Plus read you must lay on your stomach for  hour, I have fibromyalgia and I know I will go into back spasms being in that position for a hour. ",

The dr. did say he did not think it was anything but it must be micro because he had to use a magnifying glass to view the area.\nOne other ?? they told me I need to have compression on my breast for awhile afterwards, how is this done? They ask if I had any ? I could not think.
