    "Content": " I finished Taxotere 12 months ago and my hair has not grown back and am still wearing a wig. I have some hair but it is very fine with bald spots on top. My eyelashes and eyebrows are also very sparse, they started to grow then stopped. In fact I have almost no body hair just the odd hair on my legs.\nTaxmademebald I would be willing to provide data but am not sure how to contact you. ",
