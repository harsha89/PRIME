If you're low income you might even qualify for medicaid which you should check into if it comes back that you do have cancer. My sister has lymphona and she is on the last drug that they can give for it and if it stops working there is nothing else they can do.\nI've read a lot of stories like your niece's. Sometimes these things don't even show up on Mammograms so it's always best to get a lump checked. That's why I'm calling my CHC tomorrow to see if I should wait till the Mammogram result is in that I had last Thursday or just come in and see him. I didn't discover the lump till last night. I decided to check myself from now on since the CHC people do a crappy job at breast exams. I had one three weeks ago and this lump is big enough for her to notice if she had done it properly.\nSince you seem to have a family history I would demand the extra tests for peace of mind. Let me know what happens. Good luck:) ",

      "Content": " Wow-you're state sucks. Mine pays for surgeries(I had 3 last year) plus any other visits you have to make when you're sick. I only have to pay $15 for surgeries. The radiology places they send us to are so nice-I've never had a rude tech. The lady that did my Mammo was even apologizing for keeping me waiting. Even when I had my surgeries I couldn't have asked for nice people-they actually make the experiences more pleasant IMO.\nThe CHC has some people working for them that I've found to be indifferent though. I had to change one doctor because she wasn't following up on the meds she prescribed and kept telling me I had high arches when in fact it was arthritis. I had 2 surgeries last year to have bone spurs removed. I also have a co-pay cap of $120 so if I go over it all my healthcare is free for the rest of the year(I reached that last year)\nI'm calling tomorrow for sure. I was still a little in doubt tonight so I did a BSE lying down with a pillow under me. I could really feel the lump and it's bigger than I thought. And REALLY hard.\nI don't have a job since I am a caregiver so I can't afford to go somewhere else. \nI'll be praying for you too. ",

It seems a shame you have to pay for something like that since there is a family history of the disease.\nI went to the place today that did the mammo and asked for the film for all my mammos-I'm going to look for a radiologist that specializes in dense breast tissue. When I told them that I had dense breast and a lump and that I knew sometimes they don't show up on x rays she shook her head and said she knew. I'm also calling the director of the program that I am part of on Thursday to complain about\n the substandard care I've been receiving. When I went for my exam three weeks ago I didn't need a pap but she was supposed to do a pelvic exam which was as half-a-ssed as her breast exam. She didn't even look at my vaginal area-just had me spread my legs and she performed the part where she feels inside me from the side. \nI'm also annoyed at them because my knee xray came back without an problems yet no one has called me to follow up in why I am having pain in the knee. I told them it wasn't in my joint yet he ordered an xray. Stupid, unqualified people there. ",

      "Content": " Well I had my appointment today with a nurse practitioner and here's what she said.\nShe THINKS the lump is breast tissue. She said that she THINKS it's that because of the way it keeps going in and out of the tissue around it. She said she also feels the same thing on the other breast which I don't even though she tried to show me. I know what I'm feeling. And I DON'T feel the same thing on the other breast.\nShe said that I have what she calls \"donut hole\" breast and that when I push in the tissue in the center area it collapses into something like a donut hole. She said what I was feeling was the tissue around the hole when I felt it. Problem is that the lump is on the outside of the nipple so I'm confused as to what the heck she is talking about\n. In other words, it's my breast tissue that is making the small hard lump I feel.\n She also said I had very dense breast while she was examining me and that mammos do find small changes in breast tissue. I don't know if she's been keeping up on things but that's not what I understand. \nI told the MA that they do bad breast exams and she got defensive and said that they know how to do them. I told her it should take longer than 15 seconds and she patronized me and said, we know how to do breast exams. I got myself so upset that my blood pressure was 170/100. \nThe problem today is that Nurses, Physicians Assistants and everyone else but DOCTORS are examining patients and making diagnosis these days. Since I don't have insurance it's hard to get a second opinion so I'm going to Planned Parenthood for a breast exam. I'm not going to tell them what the NP diagnosed me with and see what they say. It's going to cost $85 but at least I'll have peace of mind. After the substandard care I've been getting at the Community Health Center I have very little faith in them. An example is my knee. I told him the pain wasn't in my joint but he ordered and xray to see if it was arthritis. It came back negative but no one has called to say you need to come in to see what is causing the pain. I'm between providers now since mine left so I'm just going to wait. ",

      "Content": " I didn't get the radiologist report for last Thursday's Mammo but I did get last years results. It seems I have breasts that are hetereogeneously dense(51%-75% fibroglandular) They also added that this may lower the sensitivity of the mammography.\n I am sort of angry right now. I've been doing a lot research today on dense breasts and they say that just having it will increase your chances of BC. I'm angry because it seems that people that do testing for BC are not that informed about\n the OTHER Birad rating chart.The one for breast density, It seems that there are 4 ratings for it and I fall into #3 which is a MODERATE DECREASE IN SENSITIVITY. It doesn't say it MIGHT decrease it so where do they get that from at the radiology place that did it. A woman with dense breast tissue cannot soley rely on a mammogram to detect cancer and they suggest an ultrasound. It's scary reading the statistics about\n this yet I'm getting the feeling that it's treated as a non issue by those who haven't educated themselves about\n it-your healthcare providers.\n In my case I went for my yearly screening three weeks ago this Thursday. I am fed up with inadequate breast exams that these providers perform. You are lucky if it takes more than 30 seconds for the whole exam. That is why I think this lump was missed. Anyway, I finally decided to do my exams from now on once a month and I am glad I did because I discovered this lump on Saturday night which was after the mammogram on last Thursday. I called this morning and they said it was catagory 1 yet the nurse scheduled me for an appointment next Monday for a NP to examine me. This NP is one I am not too happy with either. She also did the half-a ssed BA too and was supposed to refer me to a Gyno there for my endless period which she never did. When I told the nurse that the first one did a crappy BA she said she would pass it along to the one I am seeing next week.\n I plan on going to my trip prepared. I go to the local CHC because I have no insurance and have very little good to say about\n most of the providers I have seen. I went for 2 years with bone spurs on my big toes because they kept insisting it was high arches. I finally had surgery to remove them last year. I also had one provider make a snarky comment about\n my period last year when it wouldn't stop after 7 weeks. She said, well, if it's any consolation your period will eventually end. I received more compassion from the MALE Gyno who performed my endometrial ablation. He said, but why suffer if you don't have too? I wish I could see him but since I have to be enrolled in the Women's Wellness campaign here in colorado for medicaid to pay for cervical or breast cancer treatment I have to see the NP that are doing the exams.\n I am seriously thinking of filing a complaint with the State medical board if is is cancer(which I pray it isn't) IMO this is medical negligance. If you are a provider who treats women for things like this you MUST be up on the latest research and recommendations. ",

      "Content": " \nJanice is right. If your gut is telling you something is wrong push for a resolution and don''t just take what they say at face value and go away. Too many providers act like the think they know it when they don't. Mine declared the other day that she wasn't worried because she THOUGHT it was breast tissue by the way it kept sinking back into the tissue behind it. She \"THOUGHT\". She also claimed that she felt one in the other breast but I can't feel it. She was comparing my breasts to hers. \nWell she might not be worried because of what she thinks it is but it doesn't stop me from worrying since I have dense breasts and it's hard to tell what is what in them. So I went to someone else that has the same program and she told me to call them and tell them you want a voucher to see a BS. She said that I have to advocate for my health and not let them shoo me off. \nAfter all it is YOUR life involved, not theirs. ",

      "Content": " The CHC is referring me to the Breast Care Center-probably a diagnostic mammo I imagine. They won't refer me to the BS because the mammo came back negative or because she didn't do it on Monday when I saw her. She told me the state would not pay for it. SO....................................................................................................\n I called the office of one of the BS and she said they give a discount out to uninsured people. I thought it would be a few hundred either way but the consultation is only $80 which I can afford. She also can do some biopsies and ultrasound right in her office and those are discounted and they will let you do a payment plan which is fine with me. She also said they could write orders so I can use them at a hospital facility so CICP would pay for it.\nI decided to make an appointment with the BS since the Breast Care Center would have referred me anyway to one. Individual doctors don't take CICP but any orders they write for a hospital or radiology is paid for by the state. If I go to the breast care center it would cost me $25 and if I needed to be referred I would also be paying the $80. So why not cut the middle step.\n Beside, I would rather just see the BS and not go through any more diagnostic tests. Personally I am fed up with the CHC and don't feel like I'll get a proper diagnosis without seeing someone who is an expert. ",

      "Content": " Okay, here's the deal. I'm 49 and will be 50 in August I started my period before I was 12, have had no children and was on BCP until 2 years ago this November. \nYesterday I discovered a small lump in one of my breasts. It's about\n 2 o'clock in the right breast outside the areola. I just had my annual breast exam and since I don't have insurance I go to the local Community Health Center. They have a program where I live that if they find breast cancer and you're on the state's indigent program they will qualify you for Medicaid. Well, the people who do the exams are NP and IMO they are not very thorough when they examine you. She didn't even refer me for a mammo and told me if I wanted one it would probably cost me $150. It's up to the provider's discretion to refer you and if she did it would have been free. She did tell me that I could wait till August when I turn 50 and then it would be free. Regardless I checked and since I am on the lowest level for the co-pay it only cost me $7. She briefly examined my breast and then gave me something that had a simulation of what a cancer feels like in the breast. Well, that's what mine feels like. It hard, fixated, painless and doesn't move. The NP lightly touched me when examining me so there's no way she could have felt it because it's a little deep and you have to use a firmer touch.\nI had the mammo on Thursday and was wondering if I should wait till I get the results before I call my doctor. They say lumps happen sometimes when you get your period but since I had an endometrial ablation last May I haven't had one so I have no clue when it's my period. If the mammo comes back normal and the lump is still there I do plan on making an appointment with the doctor who did my ablation since sometimes lumps don't show up on mammos from what I read.\nSo should I wait or call the office tomorrow and talk to the nurse and see what she suggests?\n ",
