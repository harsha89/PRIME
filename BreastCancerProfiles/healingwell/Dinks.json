    "Content": " hi I have noticed a small lump but it is not on my breast exactly it is underneath my breast where the breast meets the trunk, kind of where the wire on your bra would sit. I don't know if this would constitute on the breast. its not painful and doesn't move around. I am wondering if anyone else has had this before. I am 39 years old and although no history of breast cancer in the family. cancer it self in family is common. ",
