I'm 39 years old. Your comments are very much appreciated !\n~~~ Mammogram ~~~~~\n*I had a routine mamo and found 1 simple cyst in 2007 rated BI-RAD-2. Not a big deal.\n*Found a lump this year (2011) & did mamo along with ultrasound. New findings rated BI-RADS-3.\n* Told to come back in 6 months for \"ultrasound only\" for the following* :\n1.) - Cyst lesion manifest (trilobed anechoic to a slightly hypoechoic lesion)\n2.) -Few course calcifications diffusely scattered bilaterally\n3.)- Numerous complicated cyst\n4.)- Check on suspicious lymph node \n~~ My negative feeling towards trusting doctors started with~ :\nI was misdiagnosed for 4 years with FOUR different doctors that blew off a mark on my skin never went away nor healed. Went with my gut as something told me this didn't look normal. Diagnosed with Squamous Cell Carcinoma skin cancer last year.\n*** FYI- This type of skin cancer can also spread to lymph nodes & the suspicious lymph node from mamo is in the same area of the skin cancer.\nI would love to hear anyones advice or what they have experienced that is similar. I want to know what to look for and ask with my next test coming up.\nThanks a bunch !\n ",
