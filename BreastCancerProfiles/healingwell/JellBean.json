      "Content": " Hi all... I'm new to posting on this site, but was diligently reading everything I could get my hands on over the past week. \nI went in for my routine mammo on Oct. 15th. Was called back the 17th to schedule another mammo and ultrasound. This came as a complete shock. Cancer does not run in my family, I'm only 42. Extremely healthy, no risk factors aside from being a female, over 40 and white. Oh... and I do like wine. But other than that, really not someone that thought about\n getting breast cancer. So I go in on the 18th for the additional tests. The mammo tech was kind of cold to me. I panicked. She went to speak to doc after taking 3 pics. She came back and said I must do an ultrasound. UGH. I asked... should I be worried? Her reply... just go get an ultrasound. It doesn't hurt (wow, that was helpful). So I'm waiting and praying in the \"area\" and this sweet U/S tech comes in. I'm trying to hold in my emotions, but they start leaking out of my eyes. I tell her.. I don't feel good about\n this. She said it's very common and not to worry yet.... YET? what the heck? So there I laid on the dreaded table with my arm propped over my head and my right breast exposed to the heavens. Thank goodness I had left my modesty at home. She took several shots and I tried to watch until I saw this big mass on the screen. My fears were not unfounded. She told me she was getting with the doc and would be right back. \nI sat on that bed absolutely sure it was not good news. The door \nopened and in comes the Doctor and the Tech. I said, oh that's not a good sign. He just smiled and started saying, no I always come talk to the patient. I pretty much snapped and told him to get on with it. He said, Well there's a mass we need to look at more closely. We need to biopsy it. He walked out and I bawled like a little girl. The poor tech hugged me and told me it would be alright. Um yeah, cause it's not your breast.\nSo the biopsy was scheduled. I wasn't really nervous about\n it. Which sounds strange. I lost more sleep waiting before my second round of tests. Maybe because I saw the mass and knew what was going on. Where before I was like.. is there a ton of lumps, is it big, etc.\nSo my biopsy was the 23rd. This, ladies, is nothing. It was a core needle biopsy. No pain whatsoever. Felt like numbing your mouth when you get a filling. Totally quick procedure. Both Tech and Doc were reassuring and told me there's a good chance it's benign. YAY.. but that meant there was also a chance it was cancer. Boo.\nIt's been 2 days. I just called my doc and he got the pathology report. NOT CANCER. So my point to this is... It's okay to go through that roller coaster of emotions and thoughts of what if, how will I deal with it, etc. More than likely it will come back benign...all the studies show that the majority do. But it's okay to go down that bunny trail of... that means some don't. You feel how you need to feel to get through the waiting. Read what you want to read on line, look at images and try to compare yours to theirs. I actually took a pic of the u/s with my phone (I had them pull up the images again). Ask questions... Lean on everyone you can. It's okay, your fears are warranted, not because you have cancer but because you are realizing maybe for the first time that you are vulnerable. Your body is vulnerable and that realization sucks regardless of the outcome! \nKeep the faith, and know you are not alone in any of this! \nHugs and God Bless! ",
