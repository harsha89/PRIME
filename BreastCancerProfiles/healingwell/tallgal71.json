      "Content": " I have had 4 treatments (one every 2 weeks with the last one 2 1/2 weeks ago) of cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and adriamycin(doxorubicin). My question is that I have not had a menstral cycle since May 18. So, I am 2 1/2 weeks late. I have read that both drugs could cause fertility problems. Is it normal to not have a menstral cycle now? My fear is becoming pregnant. I took 2 tests that were both negative, but I want to know if anyone else has had this situation. Is it normal to miss a period now? I did have one before, but the more drugs, does it cause missed menstral cycles? Any input at all is appreciated. Thanks so much\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks for letting me join this group.\nI am 35 years old and have 3 kids already. I really don't want another one...not at this time especially. Anyway, we did use contraceptive, but it still scares me. I just made an appointment with my doctor for a real test just to make sure. I do feel relieved thanks to your responses. The only cancer in my family was one grandparent on one side had colon cancer and another grandparent on the other side had stomach cancer. So, this whole cancer thing is totally new to me. \nThank you so much for your responses. ",
