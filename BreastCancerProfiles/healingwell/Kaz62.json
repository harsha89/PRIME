      "Content": " Hi All,\nI am so relieved to have found this forum.\nI received a recall letter on Thursday last week after a routine screening mamogram 3 weeks ago. \nI am 51 and was really not expecting this.\nI am lucky in that the appointment is very soon, on Wednesday in fact but I am so nervous to the point of feeling constantly sick with worry. \nIt was suggested to me that it is common for a recall if you have never had a mamogram before. \nI am now wondering if I should have gone for the screening at all !\nI will go to the appointment but this stress is consuming my every waking hour !!!
