    "Content": " Hi! I was diagnosed with stage 3 BC in April of 08. Since then I've had the chemo, mastectomy and radiation. Several things I've learned since then is \nto cut way back on the sugar intake (cancer loves sugar), have your vitamin D levels checked and maintained, get some ph test strips for urine and\nsaliva and check to see whether your system is alkaline or acidic. Cancer thrives in an acidic environment. The chart that comes with these will tell you\nwhere your levels should be at. Also take Indole 3-Carbinol as this halts the growth of cancer cells by turning off key enzymes that are important for\ncells growth cycle. This is found also in broccoli and many other raw vegetables. Keep your immune system healthy with anti-oxidants and pro-biotics.\nAnd keep your cells oxigenated by exercizing. You can look up any and all of this information on the internet. If you do decide to buy any of these\nsupplements, go to Vitacost.com as they have the best prices anywhere. Also look at Dr. Mercola's website. There is so much helpful information there.\nOne more interesting thing- look up the German cure for cancer. There is alot of compelling information there that makes you wonder what the FDA and\nBig Pharma are holding back. Take care and good luck! ",
