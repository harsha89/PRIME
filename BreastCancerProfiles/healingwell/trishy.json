Can someone explain what this might mean.\nMy spot mammo showed several calcifications clusters scattered in the m;iddle third region of the left breast at midline and others in the upper outer quadrant anterior to middle third area. 3 clusters have increased in number since 2008 mammo study. They are quite numerous and somewhat pleomorphic in nature at the clusters. Due to their pattern of calcification in somewhat rounded palisading nature, question whether they are papillary lesions. \nIs pleomorphic and rounded bad? What are papillary lesions. Are my odds good that nothing else will have to be done besides the biopsy I just had done? Thank you all. ",

After mammo tech said don't get dressed until she shows pictures to radiologist to make sure she got clear pictures. She came back and said that results will be faxed to my doctor and he will call. This was two days ago and I'm hoping since my doctor hasn't called yet that I don't have to worry anymore. If the spot mammo looked suspicious would I have been told right there that I needed further testing such as a biopsy or are the results sent to my doctor who decides? I'm thinking that if anything looked bad on the spot compression the radiologist would have told tech that I needed more tests that day? I'm very scared. ",

      "Content": " I had surgery done on my left breast after stereo biopsy for microcalcifications. Two benign papillomas were removed and a large area of severe atypical ductal hyperplasia. Now three months later I had my followup MRI with contrast and got a call back from surgeon that I need another biopsy this time MRI guided Core needle. Left breast showed irregular heterogenious clumping with washout. It was a birads 4. I can't believe that in this short time I'm facing this again. Why oh why wasn't the MRI done before the surgery three months ago? I'm now facing possible surgery again and I feel this would have all been taken care of with last surgery. Also I'm worried that this has been there all along and mammo did not pick it up. Also can anyone tell me if the MRI findings look really bad for a diagnosis of Cancer this time? I know only Biopsy can tell but I have to wait two weeks and I'm so anxious again. Thank you ladies. ",

Now I'm more scared. What happens if they find the same in the rest of the tissue they take. Meaning benign but atypical? How is that treated in the furture. If cancer is found, is this very early cancer since only microcalcifications were found on my mammo originally? I don't have the report yet and did not get call back from my gyno to explain what type of atypical cells. Thank you for any info . I didn't expect any of this since my mom is 80 and never even had any abnormalty found ever on mammo. Thank you again. ",

I just want to be around so my daughter (just got married) has me to lean on also when she needs comforting. She is 25 has never had regular periods as well as atypical cells with pap smears. She is on the pill and I always worry about\n the side effects from that also as well as the constant atypical cells. It scares me that it's just like waiting until the cells are no long just atypical and nothing is being done about\n it. \nI just turned 51 and I'm sorry that you had to go through all of this at such a young age. I will let you know how it all turns out. The waiting again is the worst part. Especially around the holidays. Thank you so much for the information and kind words. \nPat ",
