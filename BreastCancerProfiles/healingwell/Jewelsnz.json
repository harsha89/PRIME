      "Content": " Sorry, 3 weeks ago I found a lump and went to my doctor, she decided to send me to the hosp, I waited 2 weeks for that appointment to arrive. So on my arrival at the hosp, they checked me over and said that they would bump me up the waiting list and that could be three weeks from today, for a mammogram, scan, and biopsy, I was not happy I thought that they were going to do it today, and that was what I was there for. That was what my doctor had told me. Can't believe I have to wait another three weeks for my tests, then another weeks before I get results, then Christmas and public holidays it before be a while before l hear any news.\n ",
