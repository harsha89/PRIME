      "Content": " In 2003 I had breast cancer and now almost five years later it is back...one of my greatest fears!!! I to drag my feet....it has been a month since I saw my surgeon just for a checkup I thought.....he took a fine needle biopsy on my lymph nodes.....they came back positive for cancer....here to go again. I have had every test under the sun lately and this Friday they are going to put in a port and biopsy and I am scared. I didn't do chemo last time....I have children and I know your fear so you really need to go see a doctor....find out and you will feel better... if it is something you can come up with a plan which gives you control of the situation....if it isn't anything you will feel soooooo much better knowing. Please, please go to the doctor! Keep us posted. Power ",

      "Content": " I had breast cancer in 2003 with a mastectomy and no chemo/rad only took Arimidex for five years. Until this May almost five years to the day) I was fine, then at a regular checkup the doctor found a axillary node, did a fine needle biopsy which came back positive. Mammograms, ultrasound, MRI, Stereotactic biopsy, CAT/PET scans, Chest X-Ray all came back negative. They think the tumor is in the breast but not sure where. I to am going to have a port put in and begin Chemo. I am so scared, even though I am a Reg. Nurse. with a Bachelors in Nursing. My sister in law had Chemo and has suffered heart problems but other than that she is fine. My other friend had Chemo, went and finished her PhD and worked....she was fine. Remember, you can keep a positive mind which will helpe your healing process. Keep in mind, it isn't ceforever!!! !!!!!!!! Joyce ",
