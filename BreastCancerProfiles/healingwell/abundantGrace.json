    "Content": " Hi I am new to Chat Forums. I have a question, I had a wire excisional breast tumor (non cancerous) removed on Nov 6, 2014. I went for my follow up with the surgeon and I asked when I could go back to work, I was asked what I do, I'm a secretary, he immediately told me not for 5 weeks, I am still in shock with that amount of time doing nothing, he said it's because of the repetiveness of my work. I'm thinking 2 weeks at most. I said that I would listen but I'm still in shock. I am \nopen for comments, thoughts. Thank you. ",
