    "Content": " Hi everybody!\nOver the last few weeks i have been really worried about\n this area of thickening in my left breast it occupies around 2/3 of my breast and is often painful to touch, i have felt both breasts and the right is defiantly not as firm as the other. the thickening seems that it is not in the tissue but on the chest wall. my breast is a bit larger than the other and seems rounder where the thickening is. i have recently been to the doctor to discuss the frequent pain in my breast and he believes it is due to my recent injury to my sternum and he said the pain could be hormonal. I am only 14 and i am really really scared that i may have breast cancer, i know it is not common but it does happen.\nthe pain is beginning to subside but the thickening is still there.\nI have discussed my worries with my family and they believe that there is nothing there, my mum has felt both breasts and she believes that she can't feel anything\ncould the firm thickened mass in my breast be due to breast changes and development during puberty.\ni have read that a thickening in the breast is a common sign of breast cancer, and i am not sure what that feels like does it occupy a large area of your breast or is it usually small and painless.\nI am really worried, and i would love to have some input for anyone.
