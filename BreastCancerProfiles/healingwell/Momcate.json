      "Content": " I have been trying to loose some weight and been exercising quite a bit. One day after doing arm exercises I noticed my right breast at the top had changed. When I felt it I felt a small lump near the surface that wasn't there the day before. There is a small red spot on it. It has be come smaller over time and the skin is fading, but it is still there. Could exercise have done this? ",
