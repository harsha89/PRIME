      "Content": " hello everyone, i am 35 years old and for the past 2 years been having pain, tenderness and itching in the left breast, done ultrasound 2 years ago and mammogram December last year everything was clear, but the itching driving me mad it's inside the nipple and even slightest touch is irritating, lifting my arm is annoying too it's like i have big pimple inside the breast, sometimes it burns underarm as well. i don't feel any lumps or bumps but maybe i am doing it wrong. went to the doctor last week and she sent me to the surgeon(cause she doesn't know what else to do), who's booked out for the next 2 months. so i am not sure what to do? go to another gp and ask for ultrasound again or just wait? i'd appreciate any advice or any idea that will help me to understand what's wrong and fix it. thank you ",
