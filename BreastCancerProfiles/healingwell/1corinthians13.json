    "Content": " Hi Ladies,\nI just joined this forum....wish I had found it sooner! I had a needle biopsy because of some calcification in my left breast that had started to group. They said this was a red flag, hence the biopsy. Results from that biopsy was not cancerous, but they did find some atypical cells which then resulted in a surgical biopsy. I was scared to death! In the past 2 yrs. I had a mother-in-law, father-in-law and brother who died of cancer, and my sister is just recovering from stage 1 ovarian cancer. I was very paranoid about\n the results. They had told me I would have the results before going home, but no one told me anything and the nurses acted like I was crazy to think that would happen! They didn't call me, either. I had to call them to get the results! Thankfully it was negative. I have an appt. this week with the surgeon. I had some soreness and my doctor required that I limit my lifting activity and running until I saw him (about\n 20 days). He gave me Lortab for pain, but I didn't have to take it. I didn't even really need Tylenol. The most discomfort came from the angle they had my arm strapped down during surgery. My muscles are sore. I was not able to bath for 24 hours. Also, had to miss 2 days of work because of anesthesia effects. Constipation was also a big issue. That was from the medicine they gave me before going into surgery. I am still considered a risk because of the abnormal cells, even though they were not found to be cancerous. I will get mammograms more frequently. \n1corinthians13 ",
