If you google Femara and read any of the articles, this is stated in them, so I don't know why doctors would be denying it.\nAs for lubrication, consider trying Osphena. It is a non-estrogen product that binds to the same receptors as estrogen. It helps with lubrication and also helps to maintain health of the cells lining the vagina. I have great results from it.

Billing as a biopsy in these cases often makes the difference in whether insurance covers the procedure. Many policies only cover medically necessary procedures.
