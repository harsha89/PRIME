      "Content": " Hi \nI'm not a medical professional but heres what I did in a similar situation:\nI followed Dr David Brownsteins iodine regime and I got a thermogram. \nIt gave me action and more information at a low cost and piece of mind. As you are younger than I the resulting information may be different but it is information. Check out web pages for Dr Brownstein and Thermograms and see if there is a fit to your concerns. Continue with your physicians advice. ",

      "Content": " Hi, My Name is Cindy and I too have breast cysts. Mine have been with me for 2o years or so but in the last year have more than doubled in size and now cause me alot of pain. I started taking iodine about\n 2 months ago after the results came back suspicious and needing review/removal in 6 months. I have found the iodine has reduced the fibrosity of my breasts and one cyst appears to be gone but the other has only thinned and is becoming itchy and painful. I am not wanting to wait 6 months but dont really know the best next step. ",
