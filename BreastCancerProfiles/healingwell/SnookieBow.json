      "Content": " I started having this stinging, burning like pain in my breast under the nipple that goes to the inside of my breast. It is a random pain. I went to the gynecologist during my spring break and had a mammogram and ultrasound done. The diagnosis was a cyst under my nipple. I did not have it last summer when I had my annual mammo done. The doc suggested vitamin E 800 mg. which I have been taking, but really don't feel improvement. She also suggested they could refer me to a breast surgeon who could drain the cyst. She said it would be uncomfortable since they would go through the nipple! I am holding off and hoping it goes down on it's own. I would say my pain is a level 1 to 3 and I feel it every day for the past 3 months. I found this information and am considering trying some suggestion. http://www.ketogenic-diet-menu.com/2016/09/cysts-in-breasts.html\nSnookiebow\nUC First flare: August 2006, diagnosed September 2006\nHave been in remission since 2009.

      "Content": " I started having stinging pain in my right breast two months ago. I went to a general practitioner and she didn't feel any lumps so didn't feel there was a problem. My mammo was fine last summer. She thought maybe it was a muscle so suggested I take Aleve once a day for 2 weeks. So I did that, but I could still feel the slight stinging pain. I nursed three babies and my ob/gyn said I have dense breasts. I have had some dull achy pain for the past 4 years. I ran into a barbed wire fence when I was 5 and had to have stitches about\n two inches above my nipple. The scar is about\n 2 inches long, but that happened about\n 46 years ago and I never had any problems. I went to a new gynecologist nurse practitioner who ordered a mammogram with a follow up ultrasound. I was told there is a non-cancerous cyst behind my nipple. She said that could be causing the pain. It is hard to feel. She suggested taking 800 mg. vitamin E and follow up with my annual mammogram in the summer. She said if it was still bothering me she would refer me to a surgeon. She said it would be uncomfortable as they would have to go through the nipple. OMG! I don't think I can handle that being away. I have searched the internet, but don't see much on how to deal with these cysts. I am 51 years old and haven't had my period since I was 48. Doctor suggested I take estrogen and progesterone for achy breasts and symptoms he thought were due to menopause. I quit after three months- I read the side effects and ingredients. \nSo what helps other than surgery? ",
