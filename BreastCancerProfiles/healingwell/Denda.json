      "Content": " Hi Spanky!\nJust to let you know. I also have something like this in one of my breasts. Got very scared last year on my monthly breast exam, had 2 mammo's, then an ultrasound on it, and even visited a surgeon, but it ended up being somehow one of the muscles in my breast is hardening. The surgeon didn't seem too worried about\n it since 'it moves with the breast'. I guess cancer doesn't move when the breast is manipulated? BUT I am VERY lumpy and have very dense breasts as well, so I'm watched pretty close as well. Good Luck and Congrats that it's benign!\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks Tavish! This morning was interesting to say the least. I went to the hospital with all intentions of having an ultrasound like the dr's office said, but then the test scheduled was actually a compression mammo. OUCH! :o) The mammo tech showed me my previous mammogram and the suspicious area, which from seeing that, I can see why I was in there at that time. A big white patch on the whole upper left quadrant of my breast. She told me that the compression mammo should make whatever is in that patch 'pop out' for the mammo to detect, or IF there is nothing in that patch, it will continue to show nothing defined. So, I was shooting for nothing's gonna 'pop out', after the check by the radiologist, the mammo tech came back in and said 'it popped right out and the radiologist said that's what we're looking for, your Dr. will talk to you on Wednesday about\n the results'. Stupid me, she must have thought I was nuts, because I said 'oh thank goodness', got dressed and walked out. As I called my husband to tell him the 'good news', he comprehended it a different way, as something is there, that's what 'popped out' and more than likely I had my mind set to hear nothing is there and I totally heard what I wanted to hear and not what was said...... UGH.. I should have went back to the hospital and asked her to elaborate, but I didn't. So, I'll wait until Wednesday for my Dr's appt and find out then. \nI guess if this saga continues I'll learn along the way what to claify before I leave.\nThat's a really good idea to keep copies of the reports. Each time I've had something done on these issues in the last few weeks, they state they will send me the reports, however, every report I have rec'd doesn't say anything but unconclusive. I'll ask my Dr about\n them on Wed too. Oh yeah, I'm 38. Thanks again. ",

      "Content": " Hi again.\nI went to see my Dr this morning and rec'd the following information. Left breast (density issue) is extremely fiborous, but checked out OK. I guess the compression mammo sees if the lump or in my case the density 'squishes', if it does, then it's a cyst, if it does not, it's a solid tumor. Mine squished, yay! :o) \nOn the lump behind my rt breast closer to my chest wall, my Dr, another Dr, and two radiologists feel I should have a biopsy done to determine exactly what it is. I go to the surgeon for an eval next Tuesday. I'll report more after that. ",

The surgeon doesn't feel that it needs to be biopsied. He thinks it's just a muscle that has gotten hard and rigid, ( why?, who knows? ) I'm being watched and will have another mammo in March to make sure nothing has changed, but from my monthly exams it hasn't changed. I'm OK with that for now, but they know I keep a pretty good watch on my monthly self breast exams so anything new comes up, I'm all over it.\nThanks for the support! ",
