    "Content": " I've have been living with this since 2001. It started for me at age 23. I just had my most recent infection this past September. I have had \"Multiple abscess removal and drainage insertion over the past 12 years. It has been very difficult to get a handle on. In 2010 the doctor had inserted a Picc line to give me antibiotic and wanted to remove my breast. I didn't give up. The last time I had the abscess removed quick and cleaned out with the drainage sewed in for 1 1-2 months. The infections have been staph and this past time staph and ecoli. In the beginning it was every 2-3 months. Now it's more like every 2 years. It's a pain and breaks down your immunity with chronic infection. I'm not ready to lose my breast at 36 years old. I went to see a doc at prestigious hospital in NYC who said there is no need to remove the breast. It just needs prompt treatment. ",
