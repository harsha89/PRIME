      "Content": " I am very persistent... I've have a MRI with contrast Then had another one 6 months later... then had two ultra sound and diagnostic mammo and they can't find it.. going to see a breast specialist this week my gut is telling me that there is cancer the symptoms are to great! Severe pain to were I want to go to the er! The nipple is and areola very painful then sometimes itchy! What else can the specialists do. I'm really considering removing my left breast I can't take the pain.. in 2014 I had breast implants removed due to rupture I had them since I was 31 and never replaced them. Anyway my symptoms tell me it's Paget's disease or inflammatory I really hope the dr does a biopsy the last diagnostic mammo and ultra sound was in late July and my pain has gotten worse since then ",
