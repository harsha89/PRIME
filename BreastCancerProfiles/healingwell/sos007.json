      "Content": " I wish I could think of the right thing to say, well here goes.....take a deep breath in and out. Try to think positive thoughts. Don't panic yet it maybe just that, the films may not have turned out, that happened to my sister in law last year and it was truely just that the films from her right breast did not turn out. So just put it to the back of your mind until your appointment day and then allow yourself to think about\n it, if it tries to haunt you sooner just say to yourself \"I am not thinking about\n this today\". I hope this helps some. Keep in touch and let me know how it goes....In the meantime you are in my prayers.\nBless you and take care, Amy\nChronic pain(nerve), fibro and mild depression ",
