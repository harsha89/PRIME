    "Content": " Hello,\nThere is a lot of information on this site, much of which has put my mind at ease.....however...\nI had a follow-up (on my first)mammogram today, I am 39, not quite 40. My Mom was diagnosed with advanced breast cancer at 43. \nSo, the technician took several images and conferred with the radiologist, and then took more images. When she showed me, the mass looked like a light patch with stringy, or variegated edges. More images were taken and then after talking again with the radiologist, the tech simply said, \"Your doctor will call you with recommendations\". Any thoughts about\n what will be outcome?\nThank you, from one whose been there with her Mom, and is, well, just slightly anxious. ",
