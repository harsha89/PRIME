      "Content": " No it was not close to the arm. It was more like around the 5:00 area which is where I thought it was. The radio. dr. could not find it on the ultrasound machine, but I think he could have found it if he had the mammo with him and I would not have had to go through this procedutre. Well I was told I should get the results by Friday or Monday of this week. ",

      "Content": " Well I am 45 a high risk for cancer Mother, Grandma and Aunt on my mothers side. The spot was found in 2003 on a mamo and the dr did a ultrasound and said it is just a cyst and then order a repeat mamo on the left side in 6 mns. So I did that no change so do worry. Now in 2004 I went for my yr mamo and the spot grew 1/4 of an inch so he did another ultrasound and could not find it. So he sent me to have another mamo on the left side. Told me that it needs to be biopsied. So here I am now. I am having it on feb 15th and I am scared to death of what I have read from what other people have gone with this. I am so glad there are people I can talk to about this. I am not afraid of the Cancer part of it because I was told from the time I started my period that one of us girls would get this. So that does not scare me at all. Thank you all for your time I am so glad I posted this. Oh my nodule 15mm. ",
