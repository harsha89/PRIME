      "Content": " I just 68 (yesterday) and had an abnormal mammo.  Got called back for magnified views and an ultrasound. A 9mm mass with spiculated edges showed (hard mass). I have to get a stereotactic biopsy but I have such extreme anxiety, I haven't even been able to make the appointment.  I don't know if I can lay still on the table on my stomach for an hour.  I am afraid with my nerves I will have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the procedure.  Help...anyone else this afraid?

      "Content": " Thanks, JTQ. I finally got the courage to call to make the appt. and the radiologist who will do the procedure said he would rather do an ultrasound guided biopsy. So it has to go back to my dr. for a referral and then approval from insurance. It will be at least another week. I am hoping the ultrasound guided will be easier, as I will be on my back. Darn, I wish I wasn't such a chicken. I pretty much know my results will be bad, just from reading the reports so far. My mom had breast cancer at age 80. \nI'm sorry you got a bad result. Good luck to you. ",

      "Content": " Donna, I just read your post. I completely understand your fear.  When I got to the radiology center I tried to bribe my daughter into taking me back home. lol.  I had my biopsy 2 1/2 weeks ago. I took two Xanax and I was able to relax on the table. I think the ultrasound guided biopsy was easier for me to do since I could lay on my back.  The radiologist numbed my breast pretty good.  For me, the injections weren't very painful, a little stinging. Once numb, I didn't feel a thing.  It was over pretty quick.  Unfortunately, my pathology report came back showing invasive ductal carcinoma.  (I have a solid mass). I just went to see a surgeon a few days ago and now I am stressing out about\n having surgery.  I don't know how I will get over my fear to even show up at the surgery center.",
