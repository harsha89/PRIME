      "Content": " The PET scan in NEGATIVE!!!! So happy. I never thought it was possible with all of those positive lymph nodes. Chemo starts Oct 15. (The same day that I go to NYC for the Avon Breast Cancer Walk). What a coincidence. Chemo will be followed by radiation. She has a long road ahead, but atleast we got some good news. ",

      "Content": " Thank you for your reply Bev.  No, unfortunately my mother did not have regular mamograms.  She has a totally irrational fear of doctors, needles, etc.  I guess that she took chances because there is no family history of any type of cancer.  Everyone on her side lived a healthy life and then died in their late 80s.  \n \n ",
