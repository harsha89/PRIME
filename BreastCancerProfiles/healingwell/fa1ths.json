    "Content": " Hi! I'm also new to this website. I am 29 years old, never had kids, haven't had a menstrual cycle in about\n 6 years, and I have recently had just a burning sensation in my right breast. It goes away for days, weeks, even months, but it does eventually come back. It's a constant burning like the same area on my breast has been scratched over and over again (about\n a hundred times) with a finger nail or rough material. When I look, there's no red mark or blood or anything. There's just the burning situation. I'm deathly scared of getting cancer because I have no insurance, so I'm constantly keeping an eye out for signs. There is no soreness. The sensation seems to be to the bottom and left of my nipple, but when I feel that spot for the sensation nothing jumps out at me until I feel my nipple. The moment I take my hand away, it feels like it's at the bottom left of my breast. Ovarian and breast cancer runs in my family. Any thoughts? ",
