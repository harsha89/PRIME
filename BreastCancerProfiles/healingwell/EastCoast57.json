      "Content": " So---this lump is getting larger--now my same side boob is aching. Hurts to lie on at night...and the axilla has puckered over the lump, and same side nipple has a prominent vein protruding. Yep. None of it sounds promising. \nAnd to add insult to injury, they cancelled the Dr ordered mammo (as clearly I'm too young to have BC) and my urgent U/S is scheduled for jan 14! That is almost 8 weeks from when I first saw the Dr.\nStill jealous of that Free Canadian medical???\nAt this point, I just have to assume the worst, and feel like I already know that this is cancer (because from what i can tell, there is nothing else it could possibly be) and I am assuming it has spread.\nDx: Jan 2014\nAge: 57\nPSA: 12\nG8\nPNI+\nSV+\nLymph 1/14+\nT3b N1 M0\nNegative Margins\nDRE: Normal\nRP: 01/28/14\nContinence: Dry Immediately (Thankful for small favors)\nStarted 6 weeks of Casodex 03/17/14\nFirst Lupron shot 03/31/14\nRadiation began 04/21/14\n10 week post-op PSA: 0.028\nFinished ART: 06/04/14\n7/18/14 psa 1 month post RT: 0.00!!\n2/12/14 psa 6 mths post RT: <0.008!!

      "Content": " Hi Miki:)\nThanks for the advice! I will definitely try those.\nI just came from the Dr here in Canada---flew home last night....and she has requested an appointment for an Ultrasound,mammo and an appointment with a surgeon just in case....meanwhile, she couldn't even find the lump (which has now become 2 lumps...) one is on top of the other...the top one is movable, so you have to actually moe it aside to feel the hard, bumpy attached lump underneath, so I had to show her, and then she got it. My nerves! lol.\nBasically she said, we don't screw around with armpit lumps---ever. She also marked everything as urgent, so hoping to get in within 2 weeks....if she hadn't marked urgent, then she said it would be over a year.
