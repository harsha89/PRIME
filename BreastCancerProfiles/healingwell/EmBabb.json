    "Content": " Hi\nI have never written on anything like this before - but over the last few weeks I feel like my life has been turned upside down! A couple of months ago I noticed one of my nipples (right boob) looked as if it was inverting - whereas the other one at the time was certainly not...... I didn't think much of it (although I knew deep down it wasn't as it should be) A few weeks ago I thought I would look on line to self diagnose as to why this had happened - it wasn't till I looked I realised that an inverted nipple could actually be a sign of Breast Cancer - I nearly fell off my chair! I booked an appointment with the doctor still thinking she would just say its normal but was quickly whisked off to the specialist for a Mammogram and an ultra sound - the specialist I saw had a look and managed to tease it out which he said was a good sign - he put it down to a blocked milk duct but wanted me to have a further test (mammogram and u/s) to just be on the safe side - on the mammogram nothing showed yet on the u/s two small lumps showed up along with a darker mass - the worst feeling I think I have ever felt in my life seeing these two black round marks on a screen - I then had to undergo a core biopsy - I am waiting the results and will have them on Monday! I am so scared and think deep down I know that they are cysts but there is always that doubt in your mind saying what if one isn't......My husband and parents have been so supportive and my best friend was there when I had the biopsy and seems to be the one I cry to the most - but no one really understands that fear that way we feel where we are Not in control of our lives - being a total control freak this has thrown me way out of my depth and I have days where i feel fine and think \"hey its fine this is all going to be ok\" or I have days like today where I think I will go back to the specialist on Monday and he will confirm my worst fears! until then there really isn't anything I can do - I know that there are 3 little pots of my breast fluid in a lab somwhere and I pray that they are going to have a big NEGATIVE result stamped on them!
