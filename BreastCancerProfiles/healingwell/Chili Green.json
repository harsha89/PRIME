      "Content": " ctlyn asked about\n lingering effects from lumpectomy. I can testify to lingering effects from excisional biopsy, and to lingering effects from a long track fine needle aspiration. Chronic. 7 years and 13 years. How lucky you were to have a physician acknowledge this. By the way, after DCIS and LCIS was found in my breast with the excisional biopsy, I was told that I did not need to speak with an oncologist because I was not going to be getting chemotherapy. (Only the excisional bx was done). True. I insisted, thinking that this would be a reasonable request. Of course nothing was offered. Nice, eh? And I was treated as if I had invented the path findings. But yes. Lingering pain with such things. ",

      "Content": " So little information available about\n post-menopausal breasts in general, let alone breasts cysts when no hormones have, nor will be taken - not even through dairy products. So, good to find your posts.\nI thought I was tense, (understatement), with what's going on my left breast, but my right breast, that had a bit of DCIS and LCIS over 10 years ago, is painful and there are cysts, to the point where the whole idea of getting into it all is making me nauseous.\nSomething intense happened in my left breast two weeks ago. Tremendous pain that lasted an entire day. Scared the begeezus out of me. I have recently had blood work that did not show any thyroid-related abnormalities, but darn if it doesn't feel like my body is going nuts, along with me. (It isn't costochondritis).\nOf course, in both breasts, there have been biopsies, and, undoubtedly nerve/tissue damage to some extent, from the needle biopsy. But that wouldn't create cysts.\nAt this point, if these are cysts, and they are painful, (as was my non-imaged DCIS/LCIS), I'm tired of it being passed off as something a woman just has to live with, and, ostensibly, relatively few, non-HRT, post-menopausal women. The whole rigamarole that is imaging and findings is just not where it needs to be. One of the cysts in my right breast is right in the scar-tissue, so, you know, it will be, \"Well, we can't be sure if something isn't there behind the scarring, without a biopsy.\" True. But geeze.\nMeanwhile, there are herbs I will take. Warm compresses. Prayer.\nI am so glad I found your posts. Hope that mine isn't too intensely stated for this forum. ",
