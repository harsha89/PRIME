      "Content": " \n i...it's me again..lol...soooo I'm explaining all this to my husband, and I'm having some pain in my left breast now and there is something that feels like another fibroid...I would think they would have found that during the mammogram or the surgeon or my gyn would have brought it up...but now my husband is insisting that we go and sit and talk about\n this with my gyn tomorrow and possibly have the lump on the other side checked out.  I don't want to keep bothering the dr. and my husband has never reacted about\n any of this in this way, he's been very laid back through my hysterectomy and the last lumpectomy but this time he's very concerned.  I don't know if the lump is there because I have worn a REALLLLY tight bra since my surgery or what, but he is getting angry about\n my taking it so lightly and that I'm acting as though I'm pestering the dr. but I'm afraid that if I keep bothering the dr. about\n all this that he won't take this seriously. Thank you all for your kind words and please don't think I'm a hypocondriact....lol....I just need advice from people that have been there that I can trust.  You have been great!! Linda...P.S.  Linda...good luck with your consult. I hope it goes well for you..please let me know!! \n ",

      "Content": " Hi...I have posted before, had a lumpectomy in my right breast, thankfully everything turned out ok.  I had some pain in my left breast after the surgery and my dr. said it appears to be \"congestion\" I have a follow up on that at the end of may....the scar and breast from the lumpectomy in march seems to be healing well and I have had just a little burning and pain...but today I got out of the shower and noticed a little bump beside my nipple on the opposite side of the breast I had the lumpectomy on.  I am very concerned and can't get in to see the dr. till tuesday.  It is hard and long and maybe could be an infected duct?  It is much smaller than the fibroids and feels like a little marble with a tail on it and it seems on the surface but feels like it is also in the breast as well and it isn't painful at all....any ideas or some positive reinforcements with the infection idea would help...God Bless and Thanks!  Linda  \n ",

      "Content": " Hi again all...i am recovering wonderfully from my lumpectomy, but I had some pain and a lump in my left breast for about\n a week after the surgery, and still have the pain...I chalked it up to wearing the tight bras after the surgery, but my husband insisted I go to see my gyn and have it checked out.  He said he thinks it's \"congestion\".  I've never heard of anything like that, and he now wants to see me in 6 weeks.  He told me to use icepacks etc. for the pain and keep wearing the tight bras. Has anyone ever gone through such a thing?  Also, he said the hyperplasia without atypia is nothing to worry about\n, so I'm hoping he is right.  It seems like I am over reacting or something and just so worried that I am going to get breast cancer that going to the dr. about\n the left so soon after having the lumpectomy in the right is something that someone who just sits and frets about\n their health would do, but honestly I'm not like that...and I know I've posted every little question I have, the ones I should maybe be asking my dr. but I feel better getting the straight answers from those who have been there and done that.  Thanks...

      "Content": " Hi Sarita, I'm new to the site, and have found so much help here. I wouldn't hesitate to follow up on what the PCP has told you. It could be nothing, and probably is, but there is nothing like having the peace of mind knowing for sure that it isn't cancer, and that if it is, that you have a jump on it rather than just leaving it be. I had a recent mammogram and was told to come back in a year and my GYN had me visit a surgeon when he got the results and within a month I had 2 cysts, a fibroid and a benign mass removed. Good luck with everything and God Bless..Linda\n ",

      "Content": " I just want to say THANK YOU all for your support.  Before I had my surgery, I found another forum and the woman that responded to my post basically acted as though I was overreacting and that the mammogram results saying the mass was benign should have been enough.  I have a 7 yr old girl and an 8 yr old boy and I have worried about\n the fact that once a fibroid is found you are more likely to get breast cancer since my first lumpectomy 5 years ago, so needless to say when they found this one I was very nervous and I'm so glad to have found such wonderful supportive people to help me.  I read the posts late last night, so I didn't have a chance to call my Dr., but I have a follow up on Tuesday.  The scar doesn't bother me, looking at it now with the tape and how big the incision was does...ouch...ha ha...I am healing well though and thanks to you and the \"club\", my mind is at ease as well because now I know I wasn't overreacting.  P.S.  If I do ever join the club officially, I am glad to know there are such knowlegable and caring members. \n Thanks again!  Linda ",
