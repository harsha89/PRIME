      "Content": " I am on the same treatment plan and just had my second A/C treatment last Monday. I have the sinus problems and congestion too. Last time I suffered through it, of course I was new and didn't know what to expect. This time my Oncologist suggested taking a Sudafed regularly which seems to be helping a bit. I also take Benedryl for my allergies but it didn't do much by itself last time either.\nI just can't understand the darn muscle aches now. I really hope the Taxol treatments are easier also, any word from anyone who has already done those would be great.\nThanks,\nMary ",
