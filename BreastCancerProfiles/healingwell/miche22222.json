    "Content": " I have had a very large lump on the upper part of my left breast for about\n 10 years. I have asked my dr about\n it on several occasions and he seems not very worried about\n it..he said it was probably a rib??.\n about\n 4 years ago I was pushing him to tell me what it was, he finally agreed to measure it and I would come back in two months, he would remeasure and see if it grew..it did grow 20percent. but he still insisted it was a rib. a couple weeks ago i asked him for a mammogram, he said i was too young ( I am 37) but agreed to an ultrasound..I went for the ultrasound and the lady asked me why he hadnt sent me for a mammogram..geez..so I finally get the results back and they say it is a complex cyst with scar tissue on top of it, I also have multiple simple cysts in the same breast. My doctor said we would recheck it in 6 months. I was not ok with that, especially since it now causes me pain and originally had told me it was a rib..it almost feels like its pinching me from the inside? and I now have sores on my ariola similar to a boil, really hard but I can pick it up and move it a bit. It has a thick white and bloody discharge..as well as small almost like pimples on my ariola as well in the last couple weeks. So i go to see a surgeon on thursday, I really want it removed or checked or something and my dr seems to think the surgeon isnt going to do anything, almost like he thinks its normal? am i worried about\n nothing?
