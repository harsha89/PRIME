    "Content": " I was taught how to do the massage and had therapy for 3 weeks.  Now I have been doing it at home for 2 weeks.  I have been good, except for last night.  Use a sleeve during the day and wrap at night.  I do not have a lot of swelling.  Mostly in my hand and 2 fingers.  I hate it but feel I need to do it.  I do not understand why they think this is a life time thing.  How does anyone feel about\n doing it all the time.\n ",
