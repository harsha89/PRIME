      "Content": " Hello and thank you for any information you can offer. She has been dx with breast cancer that has spread to her side and in muscle tissue and lymphnodes close to the lung. She says its not in the lung but could move there. last year she was dx with stage zero BC and had some form of treatment that she didn't do on a regular basis. She said it is a cancer that starts at the tissue that lines internal organs. They told her the tumors were many and they are hidden underneath fatty tissue. Is there any info you can pass on?\nAll you really need is love, but a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.\nLucy Van Pelt\nSupplements: Protandim, Omega 3s, Vit B Complex, Vit D\nMeds: Ultram, Toprol, Cymbalta, Amitriptyline, Trazadone, Simvistatin, Metformin ",

      "Content": " I had a biopsy of R breast in May 07. The incision site didn't heal well and I am still dealing with the scar, with ointment for the icky scar. I have been feeling twangs for a few months, but about\n 10 days ago twangs turned into sharp, burning pain at the site. It is really getting bad, it kind of takes my breath away. Can anyone help me understand this? Its time [past time] for me to have a mammo, so I will be seeing someone new soon. Thank you for any thoughts or opinions you can share.\n \n \n ",

Do read what you can on the ANA, I will do the same- its been a while since I thought about\n it, my ANA tests have been negative for a couple of years after being as high as 360. Let us know what you learn and how you are doing. Ignore the probably un-intentional insensitive prior post. I'm glad you posted anywhere- most everyone here wants to help.\nPeace!!\nÂ \n ",

      "Content": " Today I learned much more about\n my family's history with breast cancer. I knew that my paternal grand mother had it, but I didn't know that these members of that family also did: her sister [my paternal great aunt], her niece [my paternal 2nd cousin], her daughter [my paternal aunt], and another paternal great aunt]. This is all that I know of. The CDC classifies contagious health outbreaks as \"clusters\". Is the same true of BC? I had a biopsy in early 2007 that showed calcifications and I will continue on 6 mo mammos till they tell me not to. Can any data be collected at this point about\n this family history? It seems extreme to me that so many in one family can deal with this. Any thoughts? And thank you for your listening.\n ",
