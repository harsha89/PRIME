    "Content": " Yes, Yes, Yes...........please get a new doc. Do you know any women in your area that could give you some suggestions? Is there a Women's Health center near you? Did she want you to get a mammogram? This is a very standard test that is readily available. A good doctor would have spent the time to explain to you what she thought was going on and also I think that waiting thirty days is inappropriate. Years ago I found a lump in my breast and called my family doc who scheduled an appointment for me for an ultrasound and 5 days later I had it removed. It was a benign tumor and I was so pleased that the doctors were responsive to my concerns and acted quickly. Please go get a second opinion and a mammogram! We have to be our best advocates. ",
