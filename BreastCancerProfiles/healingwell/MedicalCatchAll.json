      "Content": " I have been getting 2 mammograms per year for the past 4 years due to frequent lumps (mostly fibroidenomas) combined with the fact that I have dense breast tissue.\nAt my last mammogram in August (after 2 hours of \"just a few more images) they found a cluster of Microcalcifications in addition to the large lump I had found on my own in my right breast. They scheduled me for an ultrasound guided needle biopsy for the large lump and a mammogram guided biopsy for the Microcalcifications. After getting the needle biopsy they were unable to do th Microcalcifications because of the position they were in and the doctor referred me to a surgeon to have them removed and biopsied.\nThe surgeon decided that since they had to go in for the cluster, they'd remove the large lump as well.\nLarge lump was confirmed to be a fibroidenoma. On Halloween when I went in for the pathology results & My 2 wk post-op appointment the breast swelling and pain had returned and I was told that the reason it two 2 weeks was because the hospital lab sent the 9 Microcalcifications out for further testing. 3 of the 9 were confirmed to be Stage 1, Grade 2 Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. The cancer is Estrogen and progesterone positive and HER2 negative.\nThey decided to do blood work to test for genetic link and told me I would also need to get a lymph node biopsy. They drew blood for the BCRA 1&2 genetic test and I am currently waiting for those results. I have no clue when the next biopsy will be done.\nThe plans the general surgeon proposed was\n1. HRT for 10 years\n2. If genetic link is confirmed a double mastectomy \n3. If in the lymph nodes - radiation \nI am now 3 weeks post op and my right breast is still swollen and I'm still in a lot of pain. Even the water in the shower hurts and we have pretty crummy water pressure. I'm barely sleeping. I have barely left my room since Thursday. I can't understand why this surgeon is waiting until after the genetic test results come back to do the biopsy. I called a cancer center on Thursday and will go in on Tuesday for a 2nd opinion about\n all of this. Don't think I've ever been this scared about\n my health in my whole life.\nTruncus Arteriosus Type 1A-1979\nArnold Chiari 1 Malformation- 2011\nEndometriosis-2011\nScoliosis of the C-spine- 2014\nMajor Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Insomnia & Obsessive Compulsive Tendancies-2015\nWhite Matter Disease-2017\nInvasive Ductal Carcinoma (stage 1, grade 2, ER/PR +, HER2-) - 2017 ",
