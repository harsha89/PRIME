    "Content": " In 2001 I had reconstruction done to one breast. I didn't have enough \"extra\" tissue or skin to harvest it from my abdomen, so they did the SGAP on me where they use your buttock skin and tissue. They also added an implant because I didn't have enough butt tissue or fat. haha I was a bit on the thin side. \nI hate to say, but my experience doing this was a nightmare! It was supposed to rejuvinate to the normal size as my other butt cheek. It didn't! There was scar tissure built up that the scar adhered itself to the butt muscle. It left me with a huge indention across my buttock. Even after seperating and removing the scar tissue, it still didn't rejuvinate. I had one huge cheek and one flat one! I went into surgery again and they lyposuctioned fat from my normal cheek and from all over my abdomen and thighs to insert that into the altered cheek. They tried to make the cheeks as even as possible, but after 7 years, it is in the same shape as after the surgery. Still never rejuvinated. \nI would NEVER recommend this procedure to be done! I can't say it would happen to you, but I wouldn't take the chance. I ended up having 4 surgeries in a year because of all the problems I had. Parts of the insicion even died and had to be removed making the skin on my butt even tighter! \nI am still very embarrassed to walk away from people looking at me, so I wear long shirts to try to hide my behind. My pants don't fit right. One side is tight on one cheek and baggie on the other, making the difference show. I hate it!\nEven though, they did a great job on the breast reconstruction itself. The only thing I haven't done was to have the tatoo added to the remade nipple. \nAnother downfall to adding an implant is that it can turn hard over time. Mine has. But, I can live with that. I still look great in a bra. HaHa\nYou can email me if you have any other questions. \nI wish you all the best. ",
