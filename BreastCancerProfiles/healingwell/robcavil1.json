It was applied using a thin layer of polyurethane which acted as a base for the human hair strands to be individually knotted onto.\nWhat type of alopecia are you experiencing?\nRobert ",

      "Content": " It took a long while for me to find ethically sourced hair, but eventually I was lead to Bloomsbury Wigs. They have a London salon in Northington Street (near Chancery Lane station).\nI know that the hair is ethically sourced as the company have their own 'hair harvest' procedure whereby the wigs that they make are made solely from hair donated by those willing to sell their hair to the company for a personal profit.\nI found the website - www.hairharvest.co.uk and went from there.\nRobert ",
