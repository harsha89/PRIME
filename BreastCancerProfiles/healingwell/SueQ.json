      "Content": " Thanks for your reply...4 of the 6 months have already passed but I am scheduled to see a surgeon due to my enlarged nodes on 1-28...my 44th B-Day...yikes.....doubt if he is a bc specialist but better than no one. After reading up I do feel an urgency because it does seem that alot if not most people with grouped calcifications are getting biopsied and not waiting. Not sure why I was put on the 6 month follow-up. Guess they weren't quite suspicious enough. Did you have any obvious lymph node involvement ?? ",
