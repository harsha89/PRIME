    "Content": " Hi guys, new to healing well today, found you as i have been searching for answers on my groin pain. I have had it on and off for 2-3 weeks, do feel slightly ill and under the weather. Have a baby and toddler so always picking up infections and have little sleep and always bending and stretching but id does not feel like a strain / pull. Have had a pelvic uss which was all NAD, been to GP she was not sure, but has arranged some bloods. I have never had this pain in my life before and its really scaring me. Any ideas? Would be appreciated. ",
