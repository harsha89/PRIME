    "Content": " Sorry to ask this here. My sister was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and there isn't a forum here for that. Seems like a lack of resources across the board. Can anyone point me in a good direction? I want to help her as much and I can and after her surgery (when she starts chemo) she'll be moving in with me. \nOr maybe you just have basic tips you can give me for being a good caregiver? ",
