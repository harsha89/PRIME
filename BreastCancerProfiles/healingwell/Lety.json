    "Content": " Hi I'm new to this site I'm 43 yrs old and about\n a month ago found a solid mass on my right breast; it does not hurt I had an ultrasound done and was told it was a cyst. To me it seems like its getting bigger and it bothers me especially when I shower cause I can feel the mass. Ive had a biopsy on that same breasted about\n 2 yrs ago it was benign. I have had cysts in both breast for a long time but they always hurt. This one is different and my doctor is really not taking it serious to him I'm overreacting he prescribed antibiotics but nothing happened. What should I do leave it alone and ignore it or seek another opinion? By the way I have no insurance and I have Parkinson's disease stage 1. ",
