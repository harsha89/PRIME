I have not noticed any problems mixing the two. I will tell you that I read somewhere that you shouldn't take Tylenol PM if you are just wanting to sleep. It said you shouldn't take more meds than you need as in Tylenol PM...it also has med for pain and fever, etc. Tylenol has a new product out that I can vouch for called Simply Sleep. It is just to aid in sleeping and no other meds. Good luck!\nL&H\nSara\n \n \n \n ",
