      "Content": " Hello Everyone,\nI have been having breast pain in my right breast for the past three months. I had surgery about\n 18 years ago, and had a bunch of benign tumors and cysts removed. I went to the dr. a couple of months ago, because I noticed over the surgical site it looks different. It's very slight, but I know something has changed. My dr. checked, and didn't seem concerned. I am getting this pain before and after my cycle, and I am noticing it when I wake up in the morning, and other times during the day. It's like a burning, annoying pain that is just there. I am in my mid 40's, and my Mom and other family members have had breast cancer. I will get it checked again, as it is not going away, but I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced anything like this. For the past several years since the surgery, I have not had issues with it. Thank you. \n ",
