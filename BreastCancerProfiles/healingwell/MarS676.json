      "Content": " Thanks for your reply Bev. I'm also 36 and knowing that you were the same age and have been a survivor for 17 years is a real inspiration. From reading this forum and others I can't believe how many different types of cancer there are. I know if I read my pathology report, I'll probably get an idea of what i'm up against but I'm still not ready. It feels good to read about\n all the survivors of this horrible disease and I know I'm heading for a huge battle. I'm trying to read as many \"survivor\" stories as I can because in 17 years I want to be able to say \"I've survived Breast Cancer!\" I've never been much of an optimist but I've begun to realize that if I want to keep my sanity I really have to be much more positive, even if I haven't received any positive news lately.

      "Content": " Thanks for your reply Bev unfortunately the news is not good...Cancer. The shock is slowly beginning to fade and its being replaced by a fear i've never experienced before. I can't sleep, I can't eat and where I would normally read the pathology report and google the findings I'm too scared to know what it all means. The surgeon suggested a lumpectomy and scheduled it for Monday. Today I decided I should get a second opinion and I cancelled the surgery and scheduled an appointment with another surgeon for Wednesday. I don't know what to do with myself, how do I tell my kids, my parents. I can barely talk about\n it with my husband. I don't know how I am going to make it through this, I don't know if I'm strong enough. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ",

      "Content": " I found a lump in my left breast about\n a month ago. Unfortunately I don't make a habit of performing self breast exams but I was feeling some pain in the area and decided to check and found a pretty sizable lump. I went to my primary care physician who immediately ordered a mammogram and ultrasound as well as a consultation with a breast surgeon.\nWhen I went for the mammogram and ultrasound I was scared but optimistic since everything I've read indicates that a painful lump is not usually cancer. I was hoping that it was a cyst and wouldn't need a biopsy. When the radiologist came in to talk to me I knew it wasn't a cyst He said that the mass was concerning and needed to be biopsied. I had my consultation with the breast surgeon scheduled for the next day. The surgeon looked at the films and said that a biopsy was indeed needed. \nI had the biopsy yesterday. The surgeon didn't tell me much but I heard him and the nurses talking. They mentioned how there was a lot of fluid, which the doctor said was good. Then he said it's probably a cyst and when the nurse was bagging the sample she referred to it as a \"mass\" and the doctor corrected her and said it's a \"nodule.\" As I'm googling these terms I don't quite understand the distinction. It seems to me like it's the same thing. Why would the doctor make that distinction? Anyone has any insight? Thanks. ",
