    "Content": " 6 months ago, I went for a baseline mammogram.  I'm 40 years old.  A lesion was detected that the Dr. felt as though it was a cluster of cysts.  He wanted to watch it for 6 months.  Two weeks ago, I had a second ultrasound on which I thought the \"cluster of cysts\" would be gone.  Instead, the now-called \"mass\" has it's own blood flow.  This really concerned the Dr.  I was told I have a high-risk lesion.  He wanted to do a core needle biopsy, which was performed two days ago.  My results are suppose to be in on Monday afternoon.  Once he started doing the CNB, he took 5 samples of tissue and said he felt that it was maybe a cysts but couldn't explain the blood flow.  See, cysts don't have a blood flow but tumors do, per my Dr.  He said that maybe it's a cyst that is attached with a lymph node in my breast.  Does this sound correct or is information being withheld?  I'm very confused.
