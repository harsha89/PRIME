    "Content": " What implications do your partners\u2019 psychological traits and self-conscious emotional factors have on your emotional responses?\nIn the Department of Psychology at the University of Sheffield, we are conducting research into how partners\u2019 psychological traits and self-conscious emotional factors might impact on how people with cancer feel about\n themselves.\nThe study needs you and your spouse/partner to participate as a pair, but for the study to be valid and produce meaningful results you must complete the survey separately. The study involves filling out a series of short questionnaires and will take approximately 15 minutes. All responses are anonymous and will be treated confidentially.\nAs part of the research we would like to carry out follow-up administrations of the same set of questionnaires at 2 and 4 weeks following the initial survey. The aim of these follow-ups is to assess and get deeper understanding of people\u2019s responses over time. Further information about\n the survey will be provided before you and your partner decide whether or not to participate.\nA full debrief will be available following participation and we will give participants feedback on the results at the end of the study.\nÂ£1 will be donated to Worldwide Cancer Research for every dyad that takes part.\nIf you are interested in taking part in the research, please use the following link to access the study pages, find out more information and to take part by following the link to the survey below:\nhttps://sheffieldpsychology.eu.qualtrics.com/SE/?Sid=SV_2bNIc4T8xg8Qu2N\nThe study is password-protected and you will need the following password to log in: sheffpsy\n Approval has been obtained through our institutional ethics committee and Mr. Peter Waite, the Founder & CEO of the Healing Well.\nThanks, your participation is very much appreciated.\nRegards,\nHaffiezhah An-Nadiah Azlan ",
