      "Content": " Hello everyone,\nI have been quietly following along in this forum since I found out I may have a problem - some lumps found on physial exam and I'm waiting on my mammogram/ultrasound appointment in 2 weeks. I don't mean to highjack this thread but I was just wondering what \"reconstruction\" means when talking about\n mastectomy - is this placement of an implant at the same time as the other procedure? Sorry if this is a stupid question, I'm still new to all this. Thanks! ",
