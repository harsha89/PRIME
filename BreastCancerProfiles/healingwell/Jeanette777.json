      "Content": " Bev..I'm so sorry about\n your freind. thats a Shame.. when does it all end?? So you had Two Biopsies.. and a malignancy..does this mean you have Cancer now? doesnt Malignant mean cancer?? So you never had calcifications.. I have a freind in California who said her mamo said they saw something suspicious on her mamo.. and she never went for the biopsy..it's been many years. .and she feels her lump and has pain from it time to time..THIS.. I would go,get checked.. she got a 2nd opinion from a major hospital..and they said they made a mistake..she doesnt need a biopsy..so you're saying.. you got the 2nd biopsy and it was benign? I'm a little confused ..sorry! Is there anybody here who just had ONE biopsy and they are ok..where does it end.. is it the mamos that are causing all this and the radiation ..perhaps?? Who really knows! We dont ! SOrry.I have to Vent.. Btw..I have a young daughter who went through two not one but two brain tumors..I had recently got a kidney transplant and skin cancer.. its just too overwhelming to me. .Oh..to prove that i could live well into my 80's and prove them all wrong that its the mamos/radiation making this all worse.. better left alone..sorry..this is how I feel.. \nJeanette ",

My mom never went on the kidney transplant list.. so she died ,they say..an accidental death from 5 yrs on dialysis..my daughter is doing Great..believe it or not.. Thanks god.. she' is smarter then me.. and knows alot stuff.. sometimes I get embarrassed of how much more she knows then me..she had many jobs thruout all her problems.. never complains or even worrys about\n the past.. its a \"Miracle\" I tell ya! As for me. I had two skin cancers sqaumaus..caught in time.now I see a 3rd one coming up on my face.. its due to this pill im taking.they say..if you get more then 3..time to cut down or stop the transplant pill..nice huh..just dont want to loose my kidney in the process and go back on dialysis..oh btw.. I was on dialysis for 4 yrs too..it wasnt a picnic..but I dealt with it.better then most on the machine! I'm driving my husband crazy that I hope he doesnt get a stroke or somthing.but all in all I feel Great..the last skin cancer on my neck I was in Postpain for 6 mths.. didnt sleep at night tossing an turning.. the pain was so imbearable.. I had to go to {Physical Therapy\" for my neck for 6 mths.. and the stupid cancer dr. said..oh ..the operation had nothing to do with your neck..yo u never know the after affects.. they never tell you the Post Pain.. well I had to ask this Breast Surgeon im going to..and he said.. OH..dont worry about\n that now..! Nice.. the last Breast dr. I saw..two years ago said. .\"There's good Calcifications and there's bad Calcifications. .YOU>.have the good ones.. two years later..they're saying.. its clusters.. I dont get it!

I'm not on as many immunos as I used to be when I first got my kidney..im on much less..my choice.as far as the skin cancer goes, I had it removed and im watching that..btw..I had the skin cancer on my face way before the kidney, but the Prograph im taking is responsible for that..cause that drug alone causes skin cancer and diabetes! I got my second one after the transplant..only one. I'm 55 my daughter is 24! How old are you? If your cancer was Malignant..how many years.. does this mean you're still on Chemo? Radiation? Btw..I have a Breast Dr. he said 95 % you have nothing .but they want to check out 2 areas that need attent. and they're saying it could be Dtis something like that in Situ..like you said!\nJeanette ",

I dont wanna go through life. .wonder ing .what next.. how many more mamos.. is it gonna show up now.. are they gonna send me yet another letter of what they found next.. ya know half of my freinds..didnt go for that biopsy.I had just went to a forum now that knocked the guy..yes a guy that invented them ..in 1963,they say..what did all the people do before that. they didnt go nowhere ..I just r ead an article stating that..since the Mamogram came out. more and more people are dying ! How come now since they came out.. and why would a Dr. invent a machine that had Radiation amed at you ..when they say it very dangerous.. lemme tell yyou.. they caleld me back.. 7 times withint 1 year and also did 8 photos on my one breast alone..this is a little to much .my husband is goind \"Bulistic\" aside from me!

Alot of these drs. are guessing..that is why they have what we call \"Biopsies\" I have already been halfway through a \"Stereotactic\" biopsy procedure went \"Wrong\"! And let me be truthful with you..its Pretty Painful..speaking for myself and small Breasts here.. I spoke to a few freinds of mine that had large Breasts and had this procedure done. and they said its not painful at all..because when you are small breasted they have to lay you on the table ..pull your breast till you cant take the pain no more.. and its worse then childbirth..(speaking for myself and small breasted woman.. That same day..the radiologist felt sorry for me..and saw me in tears..non stop and said. .\"Listen..I'm gonna do films of my own.. and when she did..she said she did'nt see changes for 3 years on my mamo of the calcifications.. and lemme tell you..I will not have my self cut \nopen for this wire-surgery biopsy!
