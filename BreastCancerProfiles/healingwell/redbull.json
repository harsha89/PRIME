      "Content": " Well I went to the general surgean and she said everything looked good nothing alarming,just have my regular mammo in a year which I do, and if anything changes or red flags I will go to San Diego to the breast cancer center where my co-workers are going just to be on the safe side.My mother in 2007 had colon cancer  removed a\"big mass\" they cut it out she had the colostomy bags for a couple of months until she heeled then had her colon put back together, I helped everyday empting the bags put new ones on I am glad she lives on the same property  as I do I learned alot and glad I was here to help.She has been cancer free since then thanks to the good Lord.But yes there is so much cancer I know at least 8 to 10 that have different cancers.My husband has ulcerative colitis so we have to keep a close eye on that to.Thank you for your reply.
