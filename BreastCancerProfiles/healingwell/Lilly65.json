    "Content": " Hi, this is my first post and thank you for taking the time to read and respond if u r able.I had large fibroadenoma w/ very active cells remove from right breast Oct. 2007. When i got 2008 annual mammo i needed follow-up ultrasound. Doc said everything looked good. 2009 basic mammo all cleared. Had 2010 mammo last fri and got the call 3 days later b/c they need better \"compression\"mammo images. Do u think ultrasound will be sufficeint or should i ask for MRI? I go to Breast Center in Lankenau Hospital in Wynnewood Pa and they r supposed to be competent.\n ",
