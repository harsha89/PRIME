      "Content": " I have my biopsy this Wednesday for microcalcifications that were there this year and not last year- I have a strong family history of b.c.- hopefully they will be benign and if not it is early enough to get rid of whatever is there. Has anyone ever heard of having a second opinion on biopsys? I'm thinking that either way this turns out, I would like a second team to look at my mammos, mri, biopsy and sonogram- thoughts? Any questions I should ask at the biopsy? Anything to worry about\n from the procedure during or next day? Thank you!! ",
