      "Content": " Hi\nI felt a small mass in my right breast a couple weeks before Christmas and I just recently had a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound on both breast. The mass was not seen on either, but the doctors are now referring me to a surgeon because the mass is still there and is very feel-able. It is about\n the size of a dime/nickel... \nHas anyone ever been diagnosed with BC and the lump/mass not show on the tests? ",
