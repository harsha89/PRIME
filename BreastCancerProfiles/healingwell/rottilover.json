Please get them ALWAYS checked and get a mamagram done because it was to late for me but maybe not you . I finished my chemo in dec/06 and i am doing not to bad now and just starting to get around now. They told me so many different stories that its large glands and it because i was due for my period which i didnt have because i had at the time my uterus removed and i said no i dont get them no more!!! I am now with out overies as well and in menopause. I am not trying to scare you but please listen to your gutt on alot of things and you can go for a second opionion ok....Let me know how your doing. And yes as you age your breast do change...\n ",

      "Content": " Thanks so much for responding to me. I mean that my cancer was stag 3 & 4. The tumor was stage 4 and the spreading into the breast was stage 3. lymph nodes were negitive. It is invasive breast cancer i have. It has not spread to the bones, they say its the after effects of the chemo and the medications. I had a bone scan done and it was fine thank god and now im going for a bone density test at the end of the month. I love rottie's. I had two of them. I gave my female to my friend on a farm while i was moving and going threw my chemo and the other one i had to put to sleep because he had cancer in his leg. I miss him sooo much. I have my name as rottielover in his memory and always will. I now have a beagal and a boarder collie/shepard mix and they are great. I am glad to hear that there are others like myself that have the after effects and its not just me not that i m glad they have it but you know what i mean. I know im not the only one but id like some suggestions on what else to do. I dont like medications if i can avoid it. Hope to hear back for you .. Thanks.\n ",

      "Content": " Hi Ellen, thanks for your info. The regiment they had me on during chemo was (Doxorubicin ( Adriamcycin), Cyclophosphamide I.V. (Procytox) and Pacilitaxel ( Taxol) and i was HER-2 negitive so i didnt need to be on Herceptin thank goodness. The medication they have me on is Oxycodin (Perks) for the pain but i cant take them because it turns my belly. I have to agree, i was ruff on my knees as i use to be a jazz dancer, gymnastics, skater and its a tuff go right now. I have hurniation (Discs)in my lower back and also have scoliosis due to a car accident i was in when i was 15 yrs old. My head went threw the window and my neck was injured really bad and i now suffer from migrains as well.I dont like to take alot of meds because i have a heart problem since i had my youngest son 13 yrs ago. Heart problems run in my family. What amazes the dr.s is that only one person in my family has had breast cancer but it was a 3rd generation aunt and they dont understand why i got mine at such a young age and for it to be so agresive.. I have done genetic testing to find out if i carry the gene. I pray that i dont because my 16 year old going to be 17 yrs old daughter cannot even go on birth control or nothing till the testing comes back, seeing that i am estrogon + and hormon +. The test takes 6 months to come back and i didnt find out about\n this test till Nov 2006.They say my body has been threw so much in my short life so far that its unreal. When i go see my ONC\" she always says your still with us and you look so good for all you have been threw. I say thanks but i dont go on what WAS, i go on what is new to come. Its funny cause they say \" you do know your sick right?\" I say i now i am not well but thats no reason to give up. I am hoping that when i go and volenteer at my cancer clinic which im just starting that my body loosens up a bit for me that why i can go back to work and start over again. I have learned so much on cancer since i was diagnosed in June/06 and i am greatfull every day that it was me and not some older lady that had what i had. The pain we go threw for chemo is unreal and some day i pray they can get new meds to help us better. Hope to hear from you again. P.S. refuring to my animals i have a ....1 rabbit, 2 ferrets, 2 dogs, 1 cat, 1 mouse, 1 hedgehog and fish. They keep me busy as with so do my 3 children ages 13, 15 and soon to be 17. I quote i do have is\"\n ",

When i had my altrasound mamagram and byopsy done at once , the surgon that did them all told me right away that it was not going to be good. the real results were in with in 3 days of being sent. They called mine a mass after they did the tests because it was not a small encased area. But that was here, now every Dr. has their own way of talking as well so im not to sure either. I agree with Lori and i would call and see what they say ok. Please take care and let us know what is happening with you ok. And by the way your scar is probably bigger or strange because they may have taken more tissue then they expected to, to make sure they can test more to be sure you ok. I think we can live with a scar and come back more sure that it has not spread. They did that with me. I have a scar for the middle of my chest all the way across to the arm pit near my back and it has healed real well. I was shocked to see it was that large but once i thought about\n it i was ok with it that she did what she did to just make sure. Lots of hugz to you ok.. Love Pam :K:\n ",

I had people say that if i didnt loose my hair that they would have never known i was taking treatments and had such a surgery. I had a modified radical mastectomy done and it was ruff. You can stop treatment and start again they probably transfered the files is all. Go to a appointment with her for support to see for yourself and then you will know for sure. The drs always say to me as well you look so good for what you have been threw. Its how you deal with what you have on how you look. Good luck to you..\n ",
