      "Content": " so I had a screening mammo last week, and then needed a diagnostic and ultrasound. Radiologist said I had more calcifications in left breast than last year, and although he could rule out cancer in most of them, there is one he said he cannot make a diagnosis with sufficient certainty unless I had a biopsy. So here comes the freaking out, hopeless thoughts, and general ridiculousness of stress that I can't beat. I had to have my report faxed to the biopsy place, and I have to pick up my scan disc and bring to them on my appointment day, which they haven't called to schedule yet. Pretty much my life is in a holding pattern, and the stress is going to kill me before anything else will for sure. ",
