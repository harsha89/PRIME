    "Content": " Thirty six years old housewife with 2 kids, 9 and 2. Been having right breast pain for about\n 5 months now. I noticed it since the day I purchased a waist trainer that had straps. I wore it off and on for two weeks but it was really tight and I noticed pain on that area so I stopped wearing it. I went to the doctor and she sent me to get 2 sonograms. But she didn\u2019t found anything. I had my pap smear done last month and she checked my breast and found nothing. The pain goes from the side of my right breast to my arm and a little on my shoulder. I don\u2019t see any visible changes on my breast or nipple and have no family history of breast cancer and I\u2019m not on any birth control either, I\u2019m scared! \n ",
