One cancer is hormone related the other is not. \n Thanks for the prayers jko and for any other kind thoughts from anyone else. I am and will be as much support to her as I can be for as long as I live. I know women and men look at things like this with different thoughts.

Heck, after healing she can be much cooler in the Louisiana heat and humidity with out that bra. I know as a man I have a different take on this , but I dont think I would hold on to a part of my body that was trying to kill me, even the parts that are defining as male. I would still be as much of a man without them and she will be just as beautiful and feminine. I will do my best to get her here to talk to you wonderful ladies , but she has to set her own time to do what she needs to do. Thanks again and I will stay in touch..\n \n ",

The surgeon did say they had it early and that the report shows clear tissue around the lumps removed. I am trying to get my wife to ask some questions here but I think she wants more answers from the doctors before ..\n Thank you all for the answers. They confirm what I am thinking but I want her to make her decision based on her research and talks with the doctors. I have told her that I love her no matter what. I am not in love with her breasts, I am in love with her. I pointed out that I have many bad scars and she still loves me. I just dont want to say are do something that will make her feel bad about\n any choice.. Thanks again to everyone..\n \n ",
