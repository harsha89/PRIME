      "Content": " Just an update. She had surgery Monday. She is home and doing well. I am doing my best with drains and help with medical things but mostly I am keeping her spirits up as much as possible. I am so proud of her strength of will. The road will be long but the first step is behind us now and we will go the distance. Thanks for the prayers and kind thoughts. And stkitt,,I try,,But I always tease her by saying,,she sure picked a lemon in the garden of love..\n \n ",

      "Content": " Its no longer a choice for her. She has two different kinds of cancer. One slow growing and the other very aggressive. What are the odds of this??anyway she will have bilateral mastectomy this Monday and then chemo in 4 to six weeks followed by a pill regimen for about\n 5 years to deal with the slow growing cancer. One cancer is hormone related the other is not. \n Thanks for the prayers jko and for any other kind thoughts from anyone else. I am and will be as much support to her as I can be for as long as I live. I know women and men look at things like this with different thoughts. So if I can avoid putting my foot in my mouth I feel I can be a big help to her. Any help here ladies will be very much appreciated...\n \n ",

      "Content": " Thanks Ladies. My wife does not think reconstruction is worth the pain and I agree with her whole heartedly. Heck, after healing she can be much cooler in the Louisiana heat and humidity with out that bra. I know as a man I have a different take on this , but I dont think I would hold on to a part of my body that was trying to kill me, even the parts that are defining as male. I would still be as much of a man without them and she will be just as beautiful and feminine. I will do my best to get her here to talk to you wonderful ladies , but she has to set her own time to do what she needs to do. Thanks again and I will stay in touch..\n \n ",

      "Content": " My wife is 55. Border line per the doctors as she could go either way. Older and it would almost be a sure thing. Yes they did check the lympth nodes and there was no cancer there either arm. She does have the pathology report but I am not sure about\n the clear margin. The surgeon did say they had it early and that the report shows clear tissue around the lumps removed. I am trying to get my wife to ask some questions here but I think she wants more answers from the doctors before ..\n Thank you all for the answers. They confirm what I am thinking but I want her to make her decision based on her research and talks with the doctors. I have told her that I love her no matter what. I am not in love with her breasts, I am in love with her. I pointed out that I have many bad scars and she still loves me. I just dont want to say are do something that will make her feel bad about\n any choice.. Thanks again to everyone..\n \n ",

Do you know how much it costs for all the condos, summer homes , luxury vehicles, yachts and golf clubs.. Plus they have their hands full raising children that turn out as well as say,,Paris Hilton..\n By the way, the drains are slowing down again and all looks like it should. Doc will look at them early next week. They have been in for 5 days now. Guess I was jumping the gun. I am also ticked about\n her being sent home the same day as the double lumpectomy and the same day as the bilateral mastectomy, but somehow I think when the people making these calls end up at the pearly gates old St. Peter is only going to let them stay , for 1 day..\n \n ",

      "Content": "  My wife has just been dx with breast cancer. She has had a lumpectomy done on both breast. Both were cancer. The surgeon  says biopsy shows the cancer was completely removed , but gives her two choices. Chemo plus radiation , or full mastectomy both breast and then chemo. He has sent her to an oncologist (spl) to help her with the choice. Any words of wisdom here ? I am really at a loss as to what to tell her, beside the fact that I support any choice she makes and love her dearly no matter what. I just want her healthy..Thanks for any input....\n \n ",

One of them was less and the other went to 65 CCs and looked more like blood than drainage. It is less this morning but still more than the other side. Is this normal or should I worry ?
