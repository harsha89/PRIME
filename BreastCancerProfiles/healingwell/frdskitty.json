      "Content": " Well, I went to the breast specialist and he explained that there is not just one suspicious area that they were unable to see clearly, but 3. He feels a MRI of the breast is absolutely necessary because otherwise he would have to do 3 separate biopsies. We scheduled the MRI, but the new insurance company is also requiring what is called a pier to pier conference with the doctor. This is where he speaks directly to a physician that works for the insurance company and explains why he feels it is necessary to do the MRI. The protocol for this insurance company as well as our previous insurance company, or guidelines to authorize the MRI is history of an immediate family member having breast cancer, genetic test results showing that you are predisposed to cancer or tissue samples (biopsies) positive for cancer or precancerous cells. Because my situation would require biopsies in 3 separate areas of the breast from areas deep within the breast, it is his opinion that it would be cruel and ridiculous to put me through this, when an MRI would determine whether or not biopsies are even necessary. Unfortunately, the doctor was called out of the office on an emergency in the morning my MRI was scheduled for and was unable to have the pier to pier conference. Therefore, my appointment for the MRI had to be rescheduled for next week, so that the doctor can have the conference and we can get the authorization for the MRI. So, I'm still waiting without answers, with the exception that I have now found out that I have 3 areas of concern, not just one. ",

      "Content": " Thank you for your replies and the information. Waiting for the results once you have had a test is one thing. I can even understand scheduling problems. The part I do not understand is that the tests that have been done thus far have not yielded clear results so that the Dr.'s can make a determination as to what the next step is. Having this mystery area deeper in the breast that cannot be identified and both the interpreting physician and my physician feel it is very important to look to further testing to have a clearer picture of what is there and make a decision as to how to handle it was being delayed and now denied by an insurance company we have paid expensive premiums to for several years now. Without the insurance these tests are quite costly and we cannot afford to pay them out of pocket and so far, all of my doctors are in complete agreement that it is absolutely necessary to either have the breast MRI or the BSGI done. My doctor has referred me to a specialist and I have an appt with him on NOV 2nd. My new insurance will then be in affect and I did receive good news that my deductible balance will be transferred to the new policy. This is a huge relief since I only have about\n $100 left on my deductible to pay this year. One of the administrators at the specialist's ofc has also made me aware of a group in our area called Bosom Buddies, that help those in need with out of pocket expenses & treatments. I have been very upset with myself for going so long without getting a mammogram. I got my base mammo at age 36 or 37, then another after 40 and was suppose to go back 4 yrs ago.....something happened with one of my grandchildren and I had to cancel and never got around to rescheduling, now 8 yrs have gone by and we have a problem. When I get through this, I know that I will no longer put me at the bottom of the to do list. Without me, there will be no one to make the list. https://www.healingwell.com/community/posticons/icon11.gif I am scared, waiting is not easy. Thank you for the reassuring words. I will let you know how it goes. ",

      "Content": " I went for my annual screening mammogram 3 wks ago. I have always had dense breast tissue just like my mother, but we have no family history of breast cancer. My report this year came back that not only do I have considerably dense tissue, but I also have several areas of concern in the right breast that require a diagnostic mammogram with several close-up pictures (very painful) and possibly an ultrasound. I went for those tests this past Friday. After doing the second mammogram the doctor wanted them to continue with the ultra sound. After the ultra sound the doctor came in and explained that I had several unusual cysts with debris in them and that there is an area deep within the breast that they are unable to see clearly. She recommended that my doctor order a BSGI test or MRI to get a clear picture of the unclear area and that I also schedule another mammogram in 6 months to keep an eye on these cysts. My insurance will not pay for a BSGI, so my doctor ordered the MRI. My insurance has refused to give authorization for the MRI after they were the ones that said we feel that the BSGI is an experimental procedure and your doctor will have to order the MRI. I am completely confused, frustrated and scared. Come to find out my husbands company is changing insurance carriers at the end of the month. I know it shouldn't matter and is probably unethical, but I feel that has something to do with the insurance company not authorizing the test they told me my Dr. needed to order. Fortunately, our new insurance will transfer or credit me for meeting my deductible already this year. Finding this out, my Dr is sending me to a specialist along with all of my test results. I'm very happy about\n this decision but I am still very scared. By the time I go to the specialist I will have been waiting for answers for over a month. I don't know what they mean by debris, it's a cyst not the remains of an auto accident. What is this debris? ",
