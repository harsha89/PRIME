      "Content": " Hi, I am 43 and have been on HRT since 2001 due to a hysterectomy because of endometriosis. for the last month or so i have noticed some soreness in my left breast. For the last week it has been much more uncomfortable and I can feel heat. I am also sore under my left arm. \nAt first I felt this might be infection of some sort but it seems to be worse each day and I am on day 4 with Cipro for an ear infection. is HEAT ever a symptom for IBC? I do not see any skin changes but my breast does look a little different. maybe some swelling around the nipple area. my family history with breast ca is that my maternal great grandmother passed away from it. No issues with my grandmother, mother, or aunt. However, my maternal grandfather's sister (my great aunt) died of IBC and her daughter has been fighting the disease for years. \nThoughts? \noh, and yes, i tend to drink a LOT of cokes. Love them. However, i have greatly reduced my caffience intake in recent months. i went from drinking it all the time to only have one or two a day. ",

      "Content": " okay, here is an update... I went to my appt and my dr was called back to surgery so i saw his nurse. She set up the diagnostic mammogram and i went directly to that. Then they did an ultrasound. Then I was told to wait while the dr looked at the results. Then the tech who did the ultrasound advised me that dr didn't see anything and as far as they were concerned, i didn't need to come back for another year. They also gave me a list of things that could cause this sort of pain. The next day my dr's office called stating that had referred me to a surgeon. \nI am aware that with IBC, a biopsy is the next step in the process. However, i am uninsured and currently unemployed. The surgeon's appt is on the 9th. But he will not do the biopsy until I have paid for it. I have decided I will most likely not have the biopsy at this time. I bought some very unattractive, but comfortable bras and I am hoping maybe they are the culprit. We shall see. Maybe a job with benefits will come along. Lord knows I have looked hard for one. ",
