My parents never paid attention to us kids like that growing up, and we always thought she was different, in a quirky sort of way, but after doing research about\n Aspergers, it describes her to a tee! \nI'm going to call her nurse on Monday and discuss what we can do to get her help. I live in South Texas and she is in Michigan so I am not there to rock with her unfortunately! But I am going up there in a few weeks for her last Chemo treatment so we'll see what happens. \n:D\nDiagnosed January 31, 2005\nPrior Meds: Canasa, Rowasa, Lialda, Apriso, Prednisone, Remicade..

She is going to be taking the following medications for her chemo and I was wondering if any of you can chime in and let me know if you've had any of these medicines and how they effected you?\nShe's getting a shot after her chemo called Neulasta to build up her white blood cells.\nHer Chemo meds are: Cytoxan, Epirubicin, and Taxotere or Docetaxel. \nShe's a little worried about\n side effects and will be getting the treatments every 3 weeks for 8 treatments. \nIf any of you can please reply I would appreciate it so I can get this information to her, she doesn't have a computer so I'm trying my best to help her :D\nThank you all so much in advance!\nSusie ",

Well, now she says she's not sure what it is and has me scheduled for a mammo on Thursday morning... UGH.... It feels larger and kind of hard and uneven, and it really hurt when she pushed on it a certain way, I've never felt pain with this lump before... \n So.... Just wanted to ask for special prayers that this lump is B9 and that I can just go on with things..... but a part of me is scared stiff.. just knowing it's changed is concerning to me... If it does come back as cancer, I'm gonna call her and ask her to NEVER dismiss ANY kind of lump as a cyst... to ALWAYS refer women to get it checked out... \n So, I'll be clenching my jaw until then.....\n \n \n ",

Although, I have been flaring up just a bit lately and have increased my meds some, but stress is such a trigger and I'm in a lot of that right now so it's not a big suprise that I am flaring up a little. \n You know, it's a bit funny, I recently posted here stating how you all deserve applause for the bravery in fighting the fight against b/c..., my son's stepmother and a friend of mine have recently been diagnosed with bc and I have been doing a bit of reading here to see what you guys go through with treatments, etc. I wanted to understand what they were going through a little better and now I'm posting here for myself... this lump is driving me crazy.. lol.. It's sore now cause I keep messing with it, hoping it will just go away... geezz... \n Well, I won't freak out too much if they want to do more testing right away, I want to get to the bottom of this ASAP and get on with whatever needs to be done, (if anything).. \n Well, my dr. appointment is tomorrow at 9:45....

I really wish they would, it is so benificial (sp?) to have support from others who know what you are going through. \n I myself have had 3 breast lumpectomies, the first one was only a month after I married my husband, I went in for a checkup and the dr did a breast exam and found a lump... She tried to let me feel it but I just couldn't find the spot she had. I went to a specialist a couple of days later and he did an ultrasound on it. The time I really felt scared was when he told me \"I can't tell you that it IS bc, but I also can't tell you that it's not...\" I had surgery the following week and it turned out to be B9, but they couldn't explain what it was that they took out... seems my body likes to make weird stuff I guess. Since then I've had 2 more, but those were liquid filled cysts and could be sucked out with a needle.. I guess I have fybrocistic breast tissue so I have to really be careful and get my Mammo every year. I do it in October since that's BC awareness month. \n For the last 3 years I have been lump free, let's hope it stays that way!!\n Anyways, I hope my friends check out this website and I just wanted to add that I can relate a little :)\n Take care everyone\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ",
