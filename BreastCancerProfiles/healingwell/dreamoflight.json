      "Content": " Dear concernedmomof2, good luck with the biopsy. I hope everything turns out okay. I just had an abnormal mammogram yesterday and was referred for a surgical consult on 02-19. Just have to see how this goes, but I am certainly with you on the anxiety. Yes, I agree it will help to think positive thoughts. ",

      "Content": " Dear Netbell, good luck with your procedures. I am the same way about\n medications. I had horrible reactions to antidepressants, antiemetics (antivomiting drugs) too and also had to go the hospital because of it. Hopefully your doctor and the tech will explain the procedures well...but I know they don't always. I think the biggest problem I have heard of with contrasts and radioactive dyes is allergies related to dyes and substances like iodine-which would relate to shellfish allergy also. I had some contrast for my thyroid function which they injected. Luckily the tech explained a wierd thing that happens to most people during it...I know a lady who had a panic attack when it happened to her because she didn't know to expect it. When they inject the dye, I got an amazingly strong hotflash feeling and felt like all the blood rushed to my head, a wierd taste and smell and sensation in my nose (like from eating horseradish or chinese hot mustard) almost instantly when they were injecting it, then I felt like I was urinating all over myself...but I wasn't. Apparently, that is normal. Possibly the strangest thing I have ever felt in my life, very uncomfortable, but not harmful if you know it's coming and that it goes away by the end of the procedure, without consequences.   Everything was fine and I didn't have any abnormal reaction...Definitely let them know what your allergies are though, and reactions you had in the past to meds though.
