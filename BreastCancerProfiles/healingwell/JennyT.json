      "Content": " No news for now - but that is good news for a start I think.  I had the clinical breast exam, the ob/gyn said she felt nothing there.  So at least I was not in denial on that.  She questioned my family history and diet habits.  Recommended mammogram and/or ultrasound based on history and the tenderness.  Couldn't schedule today though.  Thinking of having a thermogram to start - anyone ever heard of or had one of these?  Thank you all for the welcome and quick support.  I had no idea such great groups of people were available!  May I also extend my sincerest applause to each of you for having such great attitudes and the time to help others.  I know we are all in our own fight to survive, I hope I may help others also. \n   Jenny ",

      "Content": " From my limited understanding, a thermogram is an infrared scan using a camera type sensor that gives a digital image of the temperatures on your body. What they look for is the independent blood supply to a cancerous tumor in the breast. I guess these blood vessels will not shrink in response to a cooler temperature change like the other blood vessels in your breast so the bad vessels stand out in sharp relief. Supposedly this tool can find the beginnings of a tumor long before a mammogram. I am considering it b/c the obgyn did not feel any lumps and because it is mush less invasive. If the thermogram would show the new blood vessels then I would immediately have a mammo to pinpoint the tumor. That's my take. I was hoping that someone else had had one or knew someone to be able to tell me good or bad. Anyway, thanks again to each of you and have a wonderful Thanksgiving week! Jenny ",

      "Content": " Jenny, 31, 2 boys (9 and 2 1/2), Ludlow Falls OH\nJust doing some research because I have some tenderness/pain in one breast. Can't feel a lump myself, scheduled for a gyno exam soon. Mom died of breast cancer at 54 so I am gripped with fear right now. I can't stop pushing on the spot where it hurts! Is this how we find out? Just a tender spot all of the sudden? How do you deal with the fear and emotion? Help! ",
