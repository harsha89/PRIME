      "Content": " From my limited understanding, a thermogram is an infrared scan using a camera type sensor that gives a digital image of the temperatures on your body. What they look for is the independent blood supply to a cancerous tumor in the breast. I guess these blood vessels will not shrink in response to a cooler temperature change like the other blood vessels in your breast so the bad vessels stand out in sharp relief. Supposedly this tool can find the beginnings of a tumor long before a mammogram. I am considering it b/c the obgyn did not feel any lumps and because it is mush less invasive. If the thermogram would show the new blood vessels then I would immediately have a mammo to pinpoint the tumor. That's my take. I was hoping that someone else had had one or knew someone to be able to tell me good or bad. Anyway, thanks again to each of you and have a wonderful Thanksgiving week! Jenny ",

Can't feel a lump myself, scheduled for a gyno exam soon. Mom died of breast cancer at 54 so I am gripped with fear right now. I can't stop pushing on the spot where it hurts!
