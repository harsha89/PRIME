    "Content": "Mom is 76, scheduled for left breast mastectomy on 5/08/06 since clean margin could not be found after 2nd lumpectomy. Cancer also found from lumpectomy in right breast, however, tumor only 1cm and surgeon feels radiation will be effective to avoid bilateral mastectomy(clean margin found on right breast). Mom desires reconstruction and is considering bilateral mastectomy to feel more comfortable with results. She is in good health, although had suffered congestive heart failure several months ago. Plastic surgeon recommends reconstruction by removing fat from belly area to rebuild breast after radiation therapy and healing (about 6 months) Fully competent surgeon in this field. Has anyone had this procedure and please advise of concerns and/or complications. Forgive me if my terminology is inaccurate, just uncertain and concerned. Thank you",
