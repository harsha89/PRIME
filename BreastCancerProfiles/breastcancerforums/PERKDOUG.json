      "Content": "I will reply to my own thread. After my original post I noticed the CLINICAL TRIALS CATEGORY and sniffed around there. What a Bummer. If you are looking to become a patient in a trial, that is a good thread. If you are looking for data about cancer from finished trials, forget it. So that some of you may know, the place to go is \"pubmed\". Google \"Pubmed\". The Website has a search engine to get at many thousands of completed research papers on all things Medical, cancer included. Bye Bye",
