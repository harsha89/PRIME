My oncologist said that the trials have looked at this protocol, rather than tamoxifen followed by arimidex, which is what I was expecting to get. My question is - is there a disadvantage to aromasin, as I know it is the only one of the 3 aromatase inhibitors which is steroidal, and that the effects are supposedly \"irreversible\". (Which effects???) Also, could you tell me about potential side-effects..... Is there anyone else out there who has done a similar switch, or been taking aromasin from the start? I am feeling a bit nervous about taking this...... Thanks! Sam",

Aromasin/exemestane works in a different way from the other aromatase inhibitors; it is both steroidal and its effects are irreversible.Indeed, it is described in some literature as an aromatase inactivator. My question is - what exactly does it signify that its effects are irreversible? Does this mean that when I stop taking it, the aromatase enzyme will still be inactivated? What implications might this have for my future well-being ? If you could explain this to me, I would be very grateful. Sam",

      "Content": "Hi - from London, UK My \"screen\" name is Sam and I'm 53. I am the sole parent of a 21 year -old young man who has Asperger's Syndrome (autistic spectrum disorder). I was diagnosed at the end of October 2001 and had a mast and axilliary clearance at the end of November, so I have just passed the 3 year anniversary. My pathology was stage II,grade 3, 1.6cm IDC with surrounding DCIS, 3/11 nodes positive and ER/PR positive. I was in the TACT trial and had 4 x FEC and 4 x Taxotere followed by 25 rads.I finished treatment in August 2002, and am now taking tamoxifen. I only came to internet discussion boards just over a year ago - why didn't I think of doing it when I was first diagnosed? It has been a source of great support to find the bc.org board which led me here - so many wonderful people who really UNDERSTAND !! Thank you all and thankyou to Dr.Leo! Stay well, Sam xx",

      "Content": "This was all over the news yesterday here in the UK - I think they always over-emphasise the potential benefit, but nevertheless it is there. I just have to try and convince my oncologist to switch me over from tamoxifen to arimidex - I have been trying (unsuccessfully) for over 2 years. She keeps saying \"not enough long-term reporting\", but now surely this will be enough? No doubt our socialised, and therefore free, Health Service will put a block on switching women from a drug that costs £25 per annum to one that costs £1000 ; but I intend to persuade her if I can .
