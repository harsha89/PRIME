I thought that er-/pr- was good news as I don't have to take hormone therapy but after reading several posts on different discussion boards, I'm not so sure. I was wondering if anybody could give me any advice on this. Love Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, I have a few questions- Do all types of chemo cause hair loss? How effective is the cold cap? My hair is long at the mo & the thought of losing it worries me. Should I get it cut short to get used to the idea of having less hair? I have my first appointment with the oncologist on 10 Nov so I don't know which chemo I'm having yet. I'm sorry if I sound vain. Thanks in advance, Lisa x",

      "Content": "Hi everyone. I'm new to this site & this is my first posting. I'd like to introduce myself. My name is Lisa & I am 29yrs old(30 on 15 Nov) I was diagnosed with breast cancer on 20 Aug and had a mastectomy with ANC on 5 Oct. My results were as follows - 3cm tumor, grade 2, 16 lymph nodes removed 2 involved, er/pr-. I've been told I don't need radiotherapy but I'm having chemo. I was just wondering if there is anybody else with a similar diagnosis to mine. What type of chemo are you having? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance, Lisa x",
