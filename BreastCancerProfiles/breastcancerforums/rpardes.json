    "Content": "My wife will be undergoing chemo (combo of Adriamycin and Cytoxen for 2 months and Taxal and Herceotin for 2 months) She has hair down to her hips and and is having a difficult time dealing with losing her hair as it will take many years to grow back. Has anyone had experience or know of anyone who has had success with a product/cap called SCS II made in Israel or other similar treatment which provides a reasonable chance of avoiding the hair loss. She knows that, at best it iks a question of a reasonable possibility rather than a likelyhoodl. Any advice or experience is appreciated",
