    "Content": "i thought you might want to read some more about the causes and treatment options available are for certain brain cancers. The Brain Intracranial Tumor is considered to be a mass or growth of abnormal cells in a person's brain. This type of disease is usually classified in two groups: primary and secondary types of tumors. Primary types of tumors have the origin in the patient's brain and they can be either cancerous (benign), or non-cancerous (malignant). The secondary types of tumors develop from cancer that started elsewhere and then spread to the brain. Primary tumors are less encountered than secondary type tumors. I hope this provides some help for you",
