      "Content": "Over Weight Mantra for Breast Cancer by Saurabh Verma Over weight is considered as the health condition that has wide negative aspects in the form of plethora of diseases. Medical conditions like high blood pressure, heart related problems are the common one related to over weight that is commonly understood as obesity. Over weight can even act as mantra for breast cancer in women. So never dare to take over weight in as a normal health condition as it is capable of bringing unimagined medical conditions. A study has proved this fact that one in every four cases of breast cancer in post-menopausal women who have not used hormone replacement therapy is caused by weight gain, but the risk can be substantially lowered by losing weight, researchers reported today. If weight loss is extremely urgent affair than put your faith on weight loss medications meant for quick weight loss like Phentermine, phendimetrazine and Adipex. Researchers found that if the women lost at least 22 pounds, they could reduce their risk of breast cancer by about 40 percent. If they managed to keep the weight off for at least four years, the risk was reduced by 60 percent. So Weight loss is the only proved mantra to minimize chances of disease known as breast cancer linked to over weight. Weight is one of the few risk factors for breast cancer women can do something about,\" said lead author A. Heather Eliassen, an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. A recent report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, is the first to look at the effects of losing Weight after menopause. Previous studies have established the connection between fat and breast cancer. Fat tissue produces estrogen, which increases the chances substantially for tumor growth in some kinds of breast cancer. Other risk factors for breast cancer include a family history of the illness, early onset of menstruation, smoking and alcohol consumption. A recent report, which taken in account opinion of more than 87,000 women for 26 years, confirmed that gaining weight increases the chance of breast cancer. A recent report has proved the fact that women, who gained 55 pounds or more after age 18, increased their breast cancer risk by 45 percent. Gaining 22 pounds or more after menopause increased the risk of breast cancer by about 20 percent. Among the women who gained 55 pounds or more throughout adulthood, those who did not use hormone replacement therapy increased their breast cancer risk by 98 percent, while those who did use the therapy increased their risk by 20 percent. If you want to keep the life long tension of breast cancer away from you than always make sure to keep check on your weight. Those women who are over weight must bring down their weight as soon as possible with the help of weight loss wonder medications like phentermine and phendimetrazine.

      "Content": "New Treatment Options For Breast Cancer by Nishanth Reddy Although surgery is the most effective (and hence, the most widely used) breast cancer treatment method, there are several other ways of dealing with the disease, some are more powerful than the others. These include radiation therapy, chemotherapy or hormonal therapy, each of them with their own assets and downsides. Most of them however are used in combination with surgery for best effects, either prior to it, in order to reduce the size of the tumor or after the operation, in order to remove any remaining cancerous cells. For a better understanding of these alternative treatment methods for breast cancer, we'll take a closer look at each, explaining how they work and in what cases they might prove useful. Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy uses powerful gamma rays (x-rays) which target the specific area that needs to be treated with high precision. Usually, radiation therapy is performed after surgery, to destroy any cancer cells that have not been removed or the ones that formed up where the tumor was removed. Although it can't be used as, a treatment on its own, radiation therapy is one of the most accepted post-surgery methods of breast conserving therapy (BCT) and has a high chance of stopping the cancer from recurring. As with all treatments involving x-rays, there are some downsides to radiation therapy. First, in order to wipe out the cancerous cells that might have formed (or remained) in the area where the tumor was removed from, the x-rays will eventually damage some of the healthy tissue too. Although the process is highly precise, the rays cannot make a difference between cancerous and normal cells, so they \"burn\" them together. Chemotherapy Chemotherapy involves the administration of drugs that kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing. Most chemotherapy medications are given through an intravenous line, although some are administered in pill form. Chemotherapy is a harsh regime, which often makes people feel more ill than the illness they are suffering from; however, it has been proved very effective. Chemotherapy is a great treatment method to use both prior and after surgery. With the help of this method, you can virtually contract the cancerous tumor before the actual surgery, making it easier and less complex to remove. In addition, chemotherapy is used in the same sense as radiation therapy after the surgical intervention, to stop the diseased cells to recur. Chemotherapy is administered usually in cycles where each cycle consists of a period of intensive treatment that lasts for a few days or weeks followed by a week of recovery. Most patients with breast cancer have two to four cycles of chemotherapy to start with before tests are performed to see what effects it has had on the cancer. Chemotherapy is different to radiation as it can treat the whole body with the potential of finding other tumor cells that have migrated from the breast and surrounding area. Many people are familiar with chemotherapy's side effects although the side effects do depend upon drugs to treat the patient. The most common side effects are loss of hair, loss of appetite, fatigue, vomiting and low blood cell count making the patient more susceptible to infections, feeling sick or tired. Many notice that they bleed more than usual, especially from gums, sores and small scrapes etc. There are three different chemotherapy strategies are used in breast cancer: Adjuvant chemotherapy - this is given to patients who have undergone curative treatment for breast cancer such as radiation or surgery. In order to decrease the possibility of the breast cancer recurrence, this treatment is given. Pre-surgical chemotherapy - this is given to shrink a large tumor and/or to kill any stray cancerous cells. This will also increase the chance that the surgery will kill the cancer completely. Regular chemotherapy - this is given routinely to people who have breast cancer that has spread beyond the breast or the surrounding local area. Hormonal therapy may also be given, as many breast cancers such as those that have ample estrogens or progesterone receptors are sensitive to changes in hormones. Tamoxifen Breast Cancer Treatment Those women who are genetically at high risk of developing breast cancer may benefit from tamoxifen as it has previously been seen to decrease the incidence of the disease occurring. Raloxifene, which is used to treat osteoporosis, is now being studied for treating breast cancer. In some breast cancer cases, a woman's natural hormones are suppressed with drugs whereas other patients find benefits by adding hormones. Tamoxifen for instance is currently the most commonly prescribed effective hormone treatment. It can be used for treating breast cancer and in the prevention of breast cancer. Tamoxifen has few side effects and can considerably improve the life span of those women who have advanced cases of breast cancer. Fulvestrant Breast Cancer Treatment A further treatment, Fulvestrant has recently been approved in the USA. It is planned to be used for treating hormone receptor positive metastastic breast cancer in women who have been through the menopause. It is given following antiestrogen therapy. Monoclonal Breast Cancer Treatment Another treatment known as monoclonal is antibodies that are antagonistic against the proteins, which are in or around cancer cells. They recognise an invader such as a cancer cell and attack it. This antibody therapy is currently being investigated holds out a lot of hope for breast cancer sufferers. Excessive alcohol intake and obesity following menopause can increase the risk of developing breast cancer although this increase is slight. Those physically active women have a lower risk. Preventative or Prophylactic Mastectomies More and more women who are at a high risk of developing breast cancer are having preventative or prophylactic mastectomies to avoid them developing breast cancer. The main risk factors for women to develop breast are age, sex and genetics. Women can do nothing about some risks so preventing death caused due to breast cancer is recommended with regular screening. Women should undertake regular screening including self-examination, mammography and clinical breast examinations. I hope that reading the above information was both enjoyable and educational for you. That's how things stand right now. Keep in mind that any subject can change over time, so be sure you keep up with the latest news. Summary: The following article covers breast cancer treatment options including chemotherapy, radiation therapy and a glance on other new treatment options available to cure breast cancer. If you've been thinking you need to know more about it, here's your opportunity. --- Nishanth Reddy is an author and publisher of many health related websites.

      "Content": "Is Tamoxifen Effective In Curing Breast Cancer? by Camry James Tamoxifen, known in the trade as Nolvadex, is usually prescribed by specialists in breast cancer and is taken in pill form. A patient will stay on the drug for about five years. Often the woman's cancer will be tested to see if it is sensitive to the amount of oestrogen in the system. If the cancer is oestrogen sensitive, tamoxifen will be given. Because tamoxifen is such a weak estrogen, its estrogen signals don't stimulate very much cell growth. And because it has stolen the place away from more powerful estrogen, it blocks estrogen-stimulated cancer cell growth. In this way, tamoxifen acts like an \"anti-estrogen.\" Tamoxifen may also take the place of natural estrogen in the receptors of healthy breast cells. In that way it holds down growth activity, and possibly stops abnormal growth and the development of a totally new breast cancer. By blocking natural estrogen from getting to the receptors, tamoxifen is helpful in reducing the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk who have never had breast cancer. It also can help women who have already had breast cancer in one breast by lowering the risk of a new breast cancer forming in the other breast. One study found that radiation plus tamoxifen was much better than tamoxifen alone at reducing the risk of breast cancer coming back after a lumpectomy in women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer. This was true even for women with very small cancers. For pre-menopausal women, tamoxifen is the best hormonal therapy. But tamoxifen is no longer the first choice for post-menopausal women. If you've been on tamoxifen for two to three years and now you're in menopause, your doctor may recommend that you switch to an aromatase inhibitor to finish your five years of hormonal therapy. However, you can still get a lot of benefit if you take tamoxifen for up to five years and then switch to an aromatase inhibitor. Tamoxifen was first used to fight breast cancer at the Christie Hospital in Manchester, England, in 1969. It has since proved its worth as means of stopping the spread or recurrence of the disease in women who have already been treated for it. But, it was noticed back in the early 1980s that some women who were receiving the drug for cancer in one breast did not develop any tumorous growth in the other. This prompted the suggestion that Tamoxifen might have another preventative role for those women who are at risk of getting breast cancer but have yet to develop any signs of the disease. ____________ http://breastcancer-health.blogspot.com",
