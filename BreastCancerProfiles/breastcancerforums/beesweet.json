    "Content": "My mother has been hospitalized for about a week having liquid drained from the lining surrounding her lung. She has breast cancer that mestastized to her liver, which was being treated with taxotere and herceptin. The chemo is working on the tumors in the liver, however; there's a spot on her lung that the doctor is concerned about now. She had a thorosentesis to drain fluid, but when it filled up again the doctor admitted her to the hospital. I get most of my information 3rd hand as I live a long distance from her. We've been waiting all week to see an improvement, they've been draining all week and did a pleurodesis which I'm afraid wasn't successful. Could anyone tell me how long it takes a pleurodesis to take effect? Hers was done on Wednesday and by Thursday her breathing was as bad as it's been since she was admitted. We aren't getting a lot of information from the doctor - which is fine as long as he's giving my mother as much attention as she needs, but it's extremely frustrating to my siblings and myself because we live long distances away from each other and my Mother. If the pleurodesis wasn't effective, is it possible that they'll attempt the procedure again or will they have to try something else? If they have to try something else - what would be the next step? Sorry for the long post, we're all frustrated and anxious about my mother's health.",
