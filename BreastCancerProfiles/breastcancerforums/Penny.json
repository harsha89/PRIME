    "Content": "I'm new to this site but it seems to be very professional and I haven't had any luck on other forum sites. I'm 42 with Stage IV Breast Cancer. Origianlly diagnoised in 2004 with Stage I, Infiltrating Ductal Carsinoma 2cm. with no node involvemnt. I had lumpectomy, chemo (adrimiacin and cytoxin), radiation (32 treatments), tamoxofin (unitl after historectomy in 2005). In 2006 I had a small reccurance 5mm and opted for double mastectomy and no chemo. Now I have a 3cm left superior hilar mass, an internal mammary node 13mm, and two chest wall masses one at 2.3cm and one at 10mm. My local oncologist is not very encouraging so I'm seeking treatment at The Cancer Treatment Centers of America. Do you have any information on this treatment center? Can I expect any more than the three to four years my local oncologist is giving me. He also says that surgery is not an option and I don't understand why not. I know they say I'm terminal and there is no cure but would think with all the survivor stories I hear that there must be more that I can do. Any information would be appreciated. Penny",
