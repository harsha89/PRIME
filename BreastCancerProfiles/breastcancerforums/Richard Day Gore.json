      "Content": "Hi everyone. My name is Richard Day Gore. I am a thyroid cancer survivor and normally contribute in various places on the forums. The reason I'm visiting over here is that I am editor at a non profit organization called The Healing Project. We are preparing an anthology of true stories by breast cancer patients/friends/family/caregivers and I'm putting the invitation out to you all. Here is our \"official\" message about it: Breast cancer. Multiple sclerosis. Autism. Diseases that affect millions. Yet the story of a single patient, caregiver or friend has the power to change lives. LaChance Publishing seeks TRUE stories of literary merit about experiences with these illnesses for publication in its \"Voices Of\" series, the net profits of which will be donated to The Healing Project, a non-profit organization. We're looking for works with real emotional impact that will touch the heart and lift the spirit. If you or someone you know is a victim, caregiver, friend or family member who has been touched by these diseases and have a story to inspire and inform, visit http://www.thehealingproject.org/main.html for submission guidelines. Please note: breast cancer, MS and autism only at this time. That's it! We really need accounts that stir the deepest emotions, like we see here in the heartfelt posts on the forums. If you submit a story, please mention that you came to The Healing Project from the Cancer Forums. Many thanks to all. Love and best regards, Richard Day Gore www.thehealingproject.org",
