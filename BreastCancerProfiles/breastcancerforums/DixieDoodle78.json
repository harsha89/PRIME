    "Content": "Sadly, I am not new to this cancer site since I am on the brain cancer portion due to my mother's battle with brain cancer. As for breast cancer, I have a question about how to justify a mammogram before the age of 40 and does it truly have benefits? I have had this off and on pain in my right side of my right breast for two years now. My general doctor said it could be joint pain and my OBGYN flat out refuses to let me get a mammogram until I am 40. I am currently 37 now. I feel my breasts up monthly and don't feel any pebbles or lumps. Sometimes the right side feels harder before my period. My general doctor said she may be able to do a workaround with my age and my insurance company this way - order me a breast ultrasound, then get the mammogram due to needing a better picture than an ultrasound. What would you recommend in this case? How old were you when you got your first mammogram? Thank you",
