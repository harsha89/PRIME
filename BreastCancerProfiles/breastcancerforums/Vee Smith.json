All I can say is that there have been indications of development in liver, abdomen and bone in my CT scans, but that chemo has so far either knocked them back or held them static.

Sad, but frankly life has been pretty intolerable, with sore, cracking hands and sore, cracked feet making movement difficult. The last blood counts were against me, so the decision had to be taken. Onwards and upwards! Probably back to trying hormonals for a while. Fortunately it is a very slow cancer, so my onc. is hopeful. I have been taking the Lifemel honey, but clearly it has not really been of major help so I will probably stop that as well. Disappointing, but one alwys hopes for the best.

There is NO evidence that diet will do what chemo or radiotherapy can do.",

If you can, find someone you can talk to. Often the fear is bound up with keeping the fear to yourself and talking it out can help.

Maybe genetic testing is a better term. An Oxford company has been working on this idea, but it still costs a horrendous amount to implement, and has not been properly tested. A major breakthrough has been achieved to do with HIV, where the leukocytes have been altered to recognise all forms of the virus and to attack it in any form. It seems to me that this could also be a first step towards developing cells that will recognise cancer in any form and that will then attack them. Maybe not in my lifetime, but a real small glimpse of a possible future.",

There were not really any good treatments for cancer those day. He was gone about 2 weeks after he had been diagnosed. Do you know is it possible to have treatments for liver cancer? I mean is liver cancer treatable? Check out the forum on Liver Cancer : http://cancerforums.net/viewforum.php?f=10 All I can really say is that it is often diagnosed very late, too late for satisfactory treatment.

Maybe genetic testing is a better term. An Oxford company has been working on this idea, but it still costs a horrendous amount to implement, and has not been properly tested. A major breakthrough has been achieved to do with HIV, where the leukocytes have been altered to recognise all forms of the virus and to attack it in any form. It seems to me that this could also be a first step towards developing cells that will recognise cancer in any form and that will then attack them. Maybe not in my lifetime, but a real small glimpse of a possible future.",

I have been terminal for 4 years and plan to be around for a while longer. I would encourage you to see if you can get your mother to seek referral to another hospital if at all possible.",

      "Content": "There can be a hereditary link in breast cancer, but in your case it seems unlikely that there is one. As to what triggers it, that is the great question that thousands of scientists are trying to answer. Genetics and hormones are two strong suspects. As Muttsmom says, eating a good diet is always a good thing, and being aware of your own body is vital. Equally, worrying about whether you are developing cancer is a negative activity. Try not to think about it. It sometimes seems that everyone is developing it, but in fact statistically there are many more people who do not have cancer that do have it. As to treatments, don't knock chemo - it can be unpleasant, but it has kept me alive. The nasty effects are relatively temporary, and if the cancer is stopped in its tracks, it is worth it. With reference to your father-in-law, Primary lung cancers are very difficult as they are generally not diagnosed until late in their development, when it becomes impossible to use surgery. There are new treatments being tested which are showing good results. The essential thing with bc is early diagnosis. The quicker it is caught, the better. If your doctor wants you to have regular mammograms, then go with it. But also ask about ultrasound testing as an alternative.",

If none of your immediate blood relatives [mother, grandmothers, sisters, aunts] have developed breast cancer, then the chances are low. Your husband's relatives do not enter any equation.

When you ask what should you do now, do you mean in terms of finding out what will happen under chemo? Or do you mean you want to find out what the doctors are thinking?

Maybe genetic testing is a better term. An Oxford company has been working on this idea, but it still costs a horrendous amount to implement, and has not been properly tested. A major breakthrough has been achieved to do with HIV, where the leukocytes have been altered to recognise all forms of the virus and to attack it in any form. It seems to me that this could also be a first step towards developing cells that will recognise cancer in any form and that will then attack them. Maybe not in my lifetime, but a real small glimpse of a possible future.",

There is strong evidence that cancer markers are not in fact particularly useful and certainly cannot indicate metastasis in itself. There has also been argument that overuse of scanners can itself lead to tumour development. So at the end of the day, so long as the oncologists keep an eye on the situation and so long as the patient is aware of his or her own body's behaviour I would be inclined to stop worrying, keep a check on diet and exercise levels, and get on with life.

It sounds as though she is off her food, in which case seeking the help of the team treating her is the first thing to do. People being treated by chemotherapy often suffer anorexia as a side-effect, and there are ways of helping, such as special drinks which can be used either on their own or as ingredients in other things.

I think you need to talk to someone about all the possible options and what their effects are before agreeing to a mastectomy. It is particularly important to consider the effects on your quality of life. I did not have a mastectomy, so cannot comment on its effects and dangers, preferring to go the route of management through chemo and hormonals. So far, apart from skin mets, the situation is relatively static. But one is always on a knife edge with cancer. Keep us informed. Best wishes",

At the same time, until the biopsies are through, you really can't tell for sure. I presume that the information about your mother and aunt was recorded, so the doctor will be aware of possibilities.

I guess I'm just confused by the negative results and still have a lump the size of my thumb nail. Obviously I'm worried about cancer. I'm otherwise healthy and have had no problems like this before.

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Neeshu Jain Hi Friends, I thanks everyone who is linked with this forum. I have a query for breast cancer problem, Last month was very painful for me as My mother in law observerd symptoms of breast cancer and finally it was diagnosed as the same, later she went through an operation and the affacted portion was removed. But samethime I heard(from the doctors even) that this problem can be genetic too which really make me worry. Can anyone pls share his\\her experience or thoughts on it..? or if it is true then is there any precautionary treatment for this which can reduce the chances .. thanks in advance! Neeshu Hi - there is a test to identify if a person has the faulty gene. Since your mother-in-law is not a blood relative, the people who would need to check are any sisters in law that you might have. It cannot skip across from one family to another. As for yourself, do not worry about it, eat a healthy diet [not too many animal proteins, not too many string spices, good balance of vegetables, fruit and carbohydrates], and keep yourself reasonably fit. Be careful about supplements as a healthy diet should provide all that you need in the way of minerals and other micronutrients. If you feel lassitude, it is worth checking blood levels for possible anaemia or low level thyroid function. I hope your MiL is getting better and that there is no further trouble.",

I think most people I know have felt this way, and a good oncology team will do its best to make sure the patient can feel some control over their life.

As to breast screening, there is much discussion about its value below the age of 50 here or over 70. There is [as always in the NHS] an element of economics but also a belief that below the age of 45, regular screening is not a useful diagnostic tool. However, there is a lobby group pushing hard for mammograms to apply to women as young as 25. Incidentally, I checked out the NHS information and find I misremembered their guidelines - it is every three years unless there is a reason for more frequent checks.

That is why there is so much emphasis on regular [emphasise \"regular\"] self-examination. Until a means of scanning is developed that is more sensitive and less invasive, I suspect that restrictions on using mammograms will continue.

It is not usual to use chemotherapy over a very long period because of its side-effects. These days oncologists can usually target fairly precisely the treatment to the condition. Chemo is often used to shrink a tumour before surgical interference. It can also be used to treat metastatic cancers and keep their development under control. From your post it seems that the lady has metastatic cancer, in which case [unless there is a remarkable discovery very soon] the doctors will seek to control her condition for as long as possible.",

      "Content": "I am glad you have found it helpful. How do I cope? I am thankful that it is so very slow, so that on the whole I am not constantly aware of possible change apart from in the skin, where one form of mets was established early. Skin mets are incredibly difficult to deal with, and extremely irritating [literally], but you are immediately aware of changes. I also have a very elderly mother who lives on her own in a cottage in the country, so I am much occupied in making sure that all is well there. She is selling up and moving into care so my life is about to take another change. She and I have done everything together since my father died, and I am now facing the situation that I will not have her company on holiday or to talk about the past. I also elected to go private early on when it became clear that there was no consistency in the oncology team as it was a teaching department, so registrars and housemen moved every six months, and so have a good ongoing relationship with my oncologist. When not in actual treatment I have 3 monthly check-ups. But if something seems to be happening I go and see her at once. Staying positive - I am still alive 6 years after diagnosis, and so far [unless things change internally] look like living a \"normal\" life span. I see no point in worrying about when I might succumb. That will come in its own time. As I have an older brother with a far more debilitating chronic condition, who determinedly ferries his daughters around all over the country, goes to horse shows with them and his wife, and firmly will not give in, I have a very good example to live up to. As the song goes \"Look on the bright side of life\". Not that I do not have depressed moments - I do, but they are only moments and can usually be suppressed. I think it is often harder for the children to have a positive view. After all, it is their parent who is under threat. Being honest about one's fears and concerns is a good step to take. Remember, the Macmillan Nurses are there for you as well if you need to talk things out. One final point - this forum has been wonderful to be a part of, and also very humbling. There are people here who have been through so much, faced so much, and still manage to be there for those facing a bleak world, maintaining a strength of mind that is quite amazing. Most of them are so amazingly SANE.",

      "Content": "When I was first diagnosed, my cancer had already metastasized. I had a round of FEC to reduce the tumour, at the end of which the full extent of spread had been established. On considering the options, I elected not to have the tumour excised and the surgeon agreed with great rapidity. My cancer is not static, but slow, and is being held by chemo and hormone treatment. The hormone treatment for me has been the least successful. Chemo is a bore, but it does work. When really down one day I asked my oncologist whether I should not have had the operation. Sh looked at me and said, \"You would be in exactly the same situation today\". You ask if it is normal not to operate - I would judge that with secondaries there is a reluctance since the cancer has spread already, and if they can control the new tumour [and even reduce it] with other treatment, then that may well be preferred. Surgical intervention has its own dangers and problems. Sadly it seems your mother is prone to cancer development. However things are changing all the time, and it may well be that in the next few years something will prove successful in controlling tumour development. If you are really not happy with the medical approach, could you seek a second opinion, maybe from the Marsden?",

      "Content": "Hi, Kat - so sorry about the situation. Do not be too frightened about the chemo and possible side-effects. Eveyone is slightly different and many do not suffer the serious ones. Nausea and hair-loss and the most likely, and both have well-tried systems of management in place. I would say that if hair-loss is a fear, then have your hair cut really short before you start - it helps you to get used to the look, and if there is loss, it is far less traumatic than handfuls of long hairs. After the chemo is over, the hair will grow back (with possible minor changes in texture!) Nausea is usually controlled by additional regimes, but there are also many complementary techniques, such as taking ginger, which can also help. You are probably very wise to have a prophylactic mastectomy. I am sure others with experience of chemo and its effects will add to anything I have to say.",

Secondly, a higher percentage of breast lumps are benign than malignant, and so long as diagnosis is quick, treatment should deal with the problem. Ultrasound can show at once what is there, but of course has then to be interpreted by the experts. How long that takes depends on the organisation. Leep in touch and let us know the results.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Sarah Charles Hi Nicole, hopefully your lumps will turn out to be benign. However, if not, time is of the essence since you are so young and breast cancer in young women with a family history tends to be aggressive. Therefore, I would suggest, find out from the technician how soon the followup mammograms and sonograms will be read (the reports describing the results should be ready within 2 or 3 days at most) and go in person to pick up the reports (it is your right to do so -- every center has a procedure for doing this, they're used to it and don't hassle you -- usually it just involves signing a form). Then read the reports. They may be confusing, but will have a summary section at the end. If the report contains a recommendation for any kind of follow up (they may or may not mention the word biopsy), then contact your doctor and get a referral to an appropriate doctor such as an oncologist ASAP. If it is necessary and if you push hard enough (and you should), you may be able to get a biopsy within two weeks. Breast biopsies are done either with a needle or by cutting out a small amount of tissue. Neither procedure is very painful for most women and they do not cause a lot of scarring or disfigurement. Results again will only take a few days at most. Then you'll know. It's better to know. In my case, my mother died of breast cancer, so I was having regular mammograms which always came up clean. However, I finally had a suspicious mammogram and didn't get the results for months. I never got the postcard telling me to come in for a followup. I had tried calling for the results and got the wrong answer. One of my teenage sons came to me with a lump in his armpit when I was on chemotherapy. Very upsetting on many levels, let me tell you. Long story short, I'm in remission after four years and my son's lump was benign. I would also like to suggest that you join a high risk breast cancer program at university-based breast cancer center even if your lumps turn out to be benign (as is most likely). This is for women who are high risk but have not developed breast cancer. They will follow you as closely as you need to be and they have the latest information concerning rare and high-risk breast cancer. Once you are set up with them and figure out your breast cancer screening schedule, put it on your calendar. Then you can go on with your life and not think too much about breast cancer. You've taken care of it in a sense and can compartmentalize this part of your life. So you won't have constant anxiety. Right now, I know it's a very anxious time and I wish you all the best. Exercise doesn't spread cancer and can be a good way to cope. Sarah All very helpful - providing the OP is in the US. It does help to know that as things are not run in the same way in the UK or Europe.",

Milk in this country cannot have IGF added to it, whereas in the US it is the norm in cattle feed. It is always better, where possible, to use organically produced foodstuffs. It is also probably better to obtain raw food rather than treated food [milk is generally pasteurized]. I see no difference in the effectiveness of treatment according to what I am eating. As to milk consumption, having grown up in the 1950s when all schoolchildren were given free milk daily, I have drunk my fair share of it. At school, though, our milk came direct from a farm so was not treated.",

Your existing conditions also add a factor that is difficult to assess for an outsider. Do you have your daughter with you at your consultations? If not, perhaps this time you should ask her to go with you. A second pair of ears can be extremely helpful. Also, work out on paper what questions you want to ask, ask them and write the answers down. It is valuable to have a record to refer back to. It is worth pointing out that if you are not entirely happy about the proposed treatment, you can seek another opinion. Not all surgeons and oncologists necessarily agree and it can be helpful to get a different view. It is really hard, being told that it is your decision what to do! I usually chicken out and ask my oncologist what she sees as the best way forward. However, this time she has firmly placed the ball in my court about two options and I am having to take the decision. I'm not good at that - always convinced afterwards that I should have taken the other route. Keep talking to us - someone is usually around.",

When I was diagnosed it was basically not a surprise. I had known for some time that something was wrong, but life got in the way. I was too busy. The surgeon who was at that time treating me said he had known many cases where cancer had been firmly ignored. I think also that there is still a residual fear that a diagnosis of breast cancer is an inevitable and rapid death sentence, particularly for older people who remember the time in the past when the only treatment was mastectomy. Modern treatments can do a great deal to extend life and I do hope that something can be found to help.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by acyunne and she explained that because below 30's the breast cells were still growing and the result of the mammograph will be blurred by it... IS THAT TRUE?? my question is, what should I do? convince her to take a surgery which she's very very afraid of??? or do a mammograph instead of surgery???. can a mammograph be obtained for her ages??? Hi - the doctor is correct. Young women's breast tissue is dense, and mammograms are not efficient at scanning the tissue. Ultrasound is more effective for this purpose in young women. If you seriously think there should be further examination, you should discuss with the doctor whether to do a CT scan, but she may well discourage you as the costs are high. As to the surgery problem, it is good that the tumours are benign, but your fiancee would be well advised to have a lumpectomy, removing them and allowing for a biopsy which would then confirm the diagnosis. I hope you and she can resolve this matter. Do let us know what happens.",

However, my own response is to say that getting your affairs into order actually can be a relief as it removes a persistent nagging worry as to \"what is going to happen\". Making a will and planning for her children's future may seem negatives, but in fact I feel they will help everyone, and the sooner they are resolved, the better. I would also say that she should continue to plan her daily life as if she was to live forever and not pay any attention to depressing medical pronouncements that she will be unable to do something in seven months' time that she wants to do. As you say, many women do live much longer than the gloomy prognosis given to them. You can best support by being an ear. Someone who can be talked at and to, and who is non-judgemental or keeps their counsel until asked for it, is a lifeline.",

I take a small range of supplements - Resveratrol, CoQ10 [100mg per day], Cod liver Oil, a multivitamin once weekly. Four days before chemo treatment I take Astragalus to boost the white cells. They maintain my general health, which helps to counteract chemo effects. Dealing with specific side-effects is more difficult. There are a number of emollients that can be used on skin disruptions. There is very little to be done about neuropathies apart from painkillers. There is a \"cold cap\" treatment [done while having the chemo infusions] which many claim prevents hair loss. I gave it up as more uncomfortable than losing my hair, but if it can be borne, it is worth trying. I believe that cold compresses on hands and feet can reduce nail loss, but that is more difficult to arrange during the chemo infusions. I am sure others will have their own experiences to share. One thing I would advise is be very, very cautious about miracle products, and make sure the oncology team are fully aware of what is being done.",

      "Content": "Hi, Emma. Sadly, these days, more young people do seem to be presenting with cancer. The process of chemo to shrink the tumour before surgery is quite usual, and your concerns are quite normal. Surprisingly, you will find that you can cope - when it starts happening. It is sometimes more difficult to deal with your loved ones and their reactions that with your own treatment and condition. The hair loss will depend on your chemo. If it is FEC, then yes, you may well lose your hair. But it grows back. It is VERY rarely more than a temporary loss. Before starting the chemo, go to your usual hairdresser, explain your concern and have your hair cut really short. The shock of loss is much reduced if the hair is not normal length. There is something called the \"cold cap\" which you can wear while having your chemo infusions. It almost freezes the scalp, theoretically preventing the chemicals from reaching the follicles and thereby reducing on hair loss. Personally I found it more painful than the treatment. Others have persisted and found it helpful. Your oncology/chemo team should be able to tell you about this. Also, see here: http://www.cancernet.co.uk/hairloss.htm The side-effects of the chemo vary according to the individual. You can check them on sites such as: http://www.chemocare.com/bio/ OR http://community.breastcancer.org/ It is important to have someone with you who can take on board what is said when you see the medical team. If your mother is finding it difficult, is there anyone else who could come? also, keep a notebook - write any questions you may have in that, and write the answers to them underneath. In the meantime, here is a site specifically for young people with cancer which may offer you support: http://i2y.com/ In the meantime, keep in touch and let us know how things go. If you can tell us the precise diagnosis it would help. Good lcuk - we are all rooting for you.",

      "Content": "Hello Julie - I think very many of us suffer these awful joint/muscle pains. Some seem to be the result of the hormonal treatments, and others the long -term effects of chemo, while you have the additional problem of fibromyalgia. I don't have an answer, but do extend much sympathy. Chemo does take up to and over six months to be absorbed, and it can be a struggle. A couple of questions - are you taking any additional supplements and is your Onc. sympathetic to complementary therapies (like massage, reiki etc)?",

      "Content": "Hi Caz. Your mother seems to have a wonderfully supportive and caring health team as well as a supportive family. My cancer was only diagnosed after I had a period of great breathlessness and persistent cough, diagnosed by my GP as \"late-onset asthma\". It turned out that my lung cavity on one side contained a massive quantity of liquid, and on testing some of that the cancer sells were identified. Two drains were made, and I have [touch wood] had no further problem. As to the difficulties relating to food, the way in which chemo can affect the taste buds is a bore. It was months before I could drink coffee again, and then only black and in small quantities. Essentially, I would plan for small, frequent snacks of things that she can enjoy, and be prepared to throw away what she can't eat. Foods that slip down without needing chewing are often more satisfactory - thick chicken soup, egg custards, rice pudding with lots of cream and dried fruit in it and flavoured with cinnamon, ice cream, light white fish poached in wine or milk. You could also look into ways of preparing vegetables so that they can be eaten easily. If she can tolerate cake, perhaps you could set out to make a range of banana bread, carrot cake and other cakes with fruit or vegetables in them. As to the planning of her funeral, that's not a bad thing to do - saves a lot of hassle for the family later; and I have been facing an uncle and my mother both saying for the last 6 years, \"Well, those are the last Christmas cards I shall send\". Yeah, yeah, heard that before, will hear it again My uncle has not passed on, but my mother remains in good health and has just moved herself into a residential home, leaving us to sell her house. My brothers and I regard such comments as gestures and tend to proceed as usual. Anyhow, keep in touch and let us know how things go.",

      "Content": "Hi, VLC - so sorry that the beast is growling. Do you mean diets to counter cancer? There is much discussion about this, and very little hard evidence. The most general position would be to avoid red meats and dairy as much as possible, to increase intake of pulses and grains, vegetables and fruit, and to investigate what trace element supplements will be required. The extreme position is something like the Gerson regime, which is time consuming, expensive and requires great commitment, being based on a high level of juicing. There is an argument going on as to whether \"organic\" produce is better for you, which again is unproven. However, where possible I do prefer to use it as I know that it has to be produced to a stringent criterion and without chemicals or antibiotics. If I can get home-grown vegetables or fruit, then I grab them with a big smile. Whatever you do, make sure your medical team know all about it.",

Whatever, you are both clearly worried. However, you say she is due for a mammogram, which is a first step. Try not to worry and also I really do advise keeping off the reading until you have a diagnosis! Reading about medical conditions is the best way to develop the symptoms - medical students often do. From your description it could well be hormonal in some way. Let us know how things go. We are always ready to provide as much support as we can.",

I am not sure what information you are looking for, but from your account the primary tumour has been excised, the lymph nodes removed which slightly implies that there are signs of the cancer moving into the lymph system, and the radiotherapy will be to kill off any rogue cells left. At her age any major treatment is a strain on the system, and I advise you to look carefully at the possible side-effects of radiotherapy and what can be done to make them easier to bear. One thing to do is obtain top quality aloe vera gel or ointment which often helps to reduce the burning after radiotherapy. The other thing is to try and get to meet her medical team in order to discuss with them what is being done and what the prognosis is. Do you have sister[s]-in law? If so, you need to liaise with them. Keep us in touch with how things go.",

I think it would be good thing to keep the visits short and relatively few. 20 minutes is usually quite long enough for most people in hospital. She is also not sleeping very well (she was never good to sleep in the first place) but as the drains are in her right, that is the side she usually falls asleep on, it is making things that little more uncomfortable. You need to sort this out with the hospital. Do you think she needs time to herself to think and deal with the operation, to mourn her breast? She needs time to herself anyhow - goes back to your question about limiting visits. [b]Yesterday i think was the first time my dad spent some time alone with her and i think he feels awkward around her. How do i help him see she is still Mam, only one breast less. By being quite unemotional about it and talking about her as normal. With due respect, he has known her longer than you have! My question is, what can i say to her what can i do for her to let her know its ok to cry, its ok to hurt and its alright to talk about it? I have to ask - do you think she wants to cry? I feel you must let her decide. The most you can do is to tell her that you are always available if she wants to talk about anything. I am from Ireland and the irish way of dealing with things is sweep everything under the carpet and hope for the best. But i am don't want that, i want my mother to be able to express herself she needs to. Same as above [u]Also what can i say to my dad i don't think he is dealing to well with this, what can i do? I need help to get my family to open up and talk if not it will divide us and we need to be united for this fight. Be upfront - make it clear that everyone is in this together, and ask what they propose to do in order to help your mother get well quickly. Has anyone gone through what i am going through has anyone any advice on what to say to my mother to get her to open up and talk, what to say to my dad. Do i sit him down and explain what my mother has gone through and what the next steps are? I would advise that you be careful. Don't push too hard. Make sure they know you are ready to listen if they want to talk, but if you push, they may well become resistant and angry. Use your anger against the disease. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi LadyHawk. My instinctive response is that she is 87 and if the cancer is not one of the aggressive ones, then non-interference may well be perfectly satisfactory. At her age, the probability is that the cancer is very slow growing, and unless there are signs of metastasis (which from your account does not appear to be something that has occurred), it could very probably be controlled with hormonal treatments. Get another opinion if you can. The effects of a mastectomy and chemotherapy are pretty dire, and at 87 may not be desirable.",
