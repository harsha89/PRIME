      "Content": "Thanks so much for your message, Cindy. I have done my chemo, last one was the 18th of April. My \"8\" weeks of chemo became 12 when the Oncologist changed his mind re what I was taking. Then he didn't renew his contract with the medical group so had to have a new Oncologist half way through. And THAT was the total extent of my chemo problems. Oh sure, my hair came out but I was ready for it and was not quite a shock other than how absolutely terrible I look with no hair! Right now sorta like an unsinged chicken!! But no nausea or other problems and my last chemo was the 18th of April. May 7 began my 33 treatments of radiation and then pills (Aromasin) for 5 years. So I feel I'm about through with the rough stuff & though with our gas prices here ($3.40 to $3.63 for regular) I do not look forward to the 72 miles a day for the radiation, I know I can do that standing on my head! So I have been truly fortunate in my treatment and resiliance. I wish everyone could be the same. My husband asked me how I would know if the cancer comes back. My only answer was mammograms and breast exams and if it metastisied I had no idea. Have you a clue how you know if it shows up elsewhere? Guess that's a good question for Mondays session with the Radiology Oncologist. He's a sweetie and takes time to answer any and all questions! Thanks again, SalTCBug",

      "Content": "Thank you, Ladies, for your opinions and for taking the time to help in this dilemma. After 2 doctors, an oncology nursing specialist, long talks with my husband (my rock) and a lot of soul searching I decided to go the whole route. I have 1 chemo under my belt, and that's exactly where it went! I was fortunate with this first go round that I had minimal nausea but understand I have more to look forward to with each round. I take pre-chemo IV of Dexamethasone & Dolasetron and the Chemo is AC done in a 21 day cycle. 2 to 3 weeks after I'm through with this I will start the rads. I think one of the things that had bothered me was my husband is not in the best of health & in the middle of cataract surgery so I'm doing all the driving. Wonderful friends have offered many times to do the driving for us if I can't but I'm not real good at asking for help and my SH is even worse. Guess we have to learn!! Again thanks for your input and wish me luck as I travel this new road. Seem to be some sneaky pot holes on here!! LOL SalTCBug",

      "Content": "Hi: I'm new to the site and new to this cancer. I've got some questions some may find strange but I really would like some answers if anyone has them. A little background first. I am 68 years old, post-menopause, have had 2 fibroadenomas removed many years ago, had a stereotactic biopsy 2 years ago on the other breast & have a yearly Mammogram. Well, mostly yearly, I went for my yearly Mammogram in November (was due in June) and a lump that I was sure was left over from a bout of Mastitis in my left breast was found to be malignant. The lump had come up to \"feeling\" size in late August or early September. Ultrasound guided biopsy proved it to be an Infiltrating Duct Carcinoma, grade 3. This good news was delivered 11/27/2006. On 1/3/2007 I had a lumpectomy & removal of 4 lymph nodes. Lymph nodes were clear of cancer and the margins of surgery were clear. Tumor was 3.1 cm Grade 3 Stage II (That's a guess since no one has said yet.) The Hormone R & Ps were: Estrogen Receptor 100% Strong Positive Progesterone Receptor 5% Negative HER-2/neu <10% Negative Ki-67 60% High p53 5% Negative E-Cadherin 100% The Medical Oncologist wants to do 4 IV treatments plus a year or more of a pill of some sort and then the Radiologist wants 5 days/5weeks. Now for the questions. Have any of you opted for doing neither chemo or radiation? What are your thoughts on doing neither one of them? Will certainly appreciate some answers quickly as push is getting to shove as far as time is concerned. Thanks in advance for your input. SalTCBug [img][/img]",
