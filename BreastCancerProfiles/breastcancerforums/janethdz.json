    "Content": "Hello Everyone! I'm really excited about Deana Carter's new album \u0091The Chain\u0091! I recently purchased the album because I've loved Deana's unique and beautiful voice since her super- famous single \"Strawberry Wine\". I was so happy to see that Deana Carter took a new and refreshing approach to this album, \u0091The Chain'! She is doing great cover songs, as duets, with amazing artists ranging from; Dolly Parton, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, Shooter Jennings, and more. I absolutely love this album, and I think if you love country music, you will not regret buying this CD! Also, I found out that Deana Carter will be singing at a benefit concert, hosted by WGAR 99.5, for the Susan G. Komen Foundation for the Fight Against Breast Cancer called Girls with Guitars! The event will be at the Stocker Arts Center on Tuesday, October 16th at 7pm, and it will feature Deana Carter as well as Trisha Yearwood and Matraca Berg!",
