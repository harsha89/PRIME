    "Content": "Hi There, I was diagnosed with triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma in January. I immediately had a mastectomy and have a month left of my chemo regimen. After my diagnosis, the ONLY thing I really had control of was when I lost my hair, so I had my head shaved and got some fun hats. It was a small thing, but it was the last thing I had control of. It helped a lot. Since then, I haven't had control over much. So, be strong, fight like a girl and know that it'll get better. Some days it sure doesn't feel like it, but I know that it will, and that helps me move some mornings. Good Luck!",
