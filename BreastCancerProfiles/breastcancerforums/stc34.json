      "Content": "My mom went for a physical Friday and her doctor said she had a \"fibrous mass\" in her left breast. She is going in for her annual mammogram on Tuesday. She's had annual mammograms regularly for 15+ years and nothing has ever shown up. My mom has never had fibrocystic breasts or anything like that before. She is 66 and has been on HRT for many years (very low dose). I felt the lump and it feels like an oval, in between squishy and hard, and it's on the left side of her left breast. I can't tell if it's movable or not. It seems like it is a bit. The strange thing is back in October of last year when she went in for her annual Pap, her Gynecologist didn't feel anything (and never had). She also does weekly exams in the shower and never noticed this lump. So basically this lump shpwed up in a 4 month span. I don't understand?? All the research I've read on postmenopausal breast lumps is NOT encouraging. The articles say that any woman over 60 should EXPECT that ANY mass is cancerous. My aunt's doctor told her that breast cancer takes 10 years to grow. How could this \"fibrous mass\" show up so quickly out of nowhere? We are very, very close. She's all I have. I am so terrified I can't see straight. I don't know what breast cancer lumps feel like, so I can't seem to get any relief and/or calm down until Tuesday. Can someone offer some advice or encouragement? Thanks.",

      "Content": "My mom is scheduled for a mammogram on Tuesday. I'm frustrated because the doctor never went over all the \"what ifs\" with her. I asked mom to schedule an appt. with her gynecologist so I can ask some questions. I'm not sure where to start? We sort of have a family history of breast cancer. Mom's sister and mother got it later in life. My aunt's showed up on the mammogram as calcifications. My grandmother got BC in her 80s. She had a golf ball sized tumor that had not spread. What do cancerous tumors usually feel like?",

      "Content": "What do cancerous tumors typically *feel* like? I was reading somewhere that the majority of cancerous tumors were very hard, jagged edges, and immovable. My mom's is kinda rubbery and moves a little. It doesn't seem thickened, hard, or jagged. Vee, I was wondering why you mentioned seeing an oncologist? Should we wait for the results or find one ASAP? I'm going with my mom tomorrow for the mammogram and want to be as informed as possible. Thanks!",
