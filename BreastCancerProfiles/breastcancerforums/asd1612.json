    "Content": "Trying to understand the pathology report. Here is the pathology report diagnosis Invasive Ductal Carcinoma size of tumor 4-7 mm I thought that was supposed to be in cm. I don't know if that is good or bad. Nottingham score grade 3 score 8. underneath that it says glandular/tublar differentiation score 3, nuclear pleomorphism score 3, mitotic score 2. ER: Negative Pgr: negative ki 67(MIB1) immunostain sho High proliferation index >20 % Her 2 test: negative The doctor said this is stage 1 and to take it one day at a time. Hopefully this does not increase in stage. The doctors still have to do a MRI, Lymph node testing, and even though this is in one breast my mother wants to have a double mastectomy. Even though its not the same thing, I'm able to help my mother somewhat since I have had melanoma removed, and lymph nodes checked. Doctor gave me the all clear on that one. I hope she has same all clear on her sentinel node biopsy as well. This looks like it may be a rough road ahead, and I'm trying to figure out the best way I can help while my mother goes through this.",
