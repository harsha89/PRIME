    "Content": "Hi everyone- Need input. First chemo was rough with nausea. Doc made that better, but now I am so short of breath I can not get a breathe. Hospital says not heart or lung so must be chemo. Anyone had any experience with this. Thanks Peggy Update- After chemo is said and done I believe it was reflux and was also causing a cough. I wound up with severe GI problems- ER diagnosised with Diviticulitis. After 2 rounds of antibiotic, and a trip to GI doc I wound up on Nexium and hydrosycamine(for GI spasms) and a non fiber diet for several weeks. I still can not tolerate lettuce. Thanks, and may the Lord bless all of you! Peggy",
