      "Content": "Please don't be terribly worried until she has a biopsy. In the last 25 or so years I've had numerous biopsies and ( knock on wood) all have been benign. They did place a \"BB\" in my breast several years ago so they could keep an eye on a specific area.",

      "Content": "Sorry you're having to go through this ... I have had at least 8 biopsies and at least 30 mammos. It's always thank God been benign. I think the dr may not think its a cyst by how it feels to him but that's why he wants the scans. Try to remain calm until you're seen and if a biopsy is required . They placed a \"BB\" or little pellet in one area of concern 6 years ago . Then when they mammo each year they know where they took tissue out. They're basically waiting and seeing if it ever changes. Hope this helps. You take care and be positive !",
