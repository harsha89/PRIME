I think the dr may not think its a cyst by how it feels to him but that's why he wants the scans. Try to remain calm until you're seen and if a biopsy is required . They placed a \"BB\" or little pellet in one area of concern 6 years ago . Then when they mammo each year they know where they took tissue out. They're basically waiting and seeing if it ever changes. Hope this helps. You take care and be positive !",
