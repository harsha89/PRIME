    "Content": "i was diagnosed with HER2+ cancer on December 5, 2016, i started treatment end of January starting with 8 sessions of chemo every 2 weeks. I was told i needed surgery to remove the left breast as the cancer was 21 cm and everywhere as well as I needed to have a biopsy of the lymph nodes. I had the surgery June 20, 2017, 3 lymph nodes were also removed. No lymphedema. Now they are RECOMMENDING 16 sessions of radiation but it isn't necessary. I am terrified of the risk of getting lymphedema, which they said is a 15% risk. i've already gone through so much and don't want this to happen. I was also told i need to wait a while for reconstruction which also stresses me out. i had an MRI done before the surgery and no cancer was found, after surgery the biopsies were also all clear. I would like to hear from other people with HER2+ cancer and what they have experienced and the choices they made. I would like to know what the risks of not doing radiation might be. I am really unsure what to do.",
