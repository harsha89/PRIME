      "Content": "Good morning everyone. I was wondering if any of you would be able to point me to previous threads involving Paget's Disease of the Breast. My wife was recently diagnosed with this disease and I have done all of the standards readings, like Symptoms, Treatments, etc, etc, etc. What I'm looking for is some really good discussions about it, to understand people's feelings and their experiences with this disease. Thanks in advance, Sean.",

      "Content": "Liane, I am really sorry to hear about your situation. We were in the same boat. My wife has been complaining to her doctors for quite some time. This started very infrequently back in 2003. My wifes had just started to spread to the areola within the past 6 months too. Unfortunately, I can't tell you it's been the best since being diagnosed. Good news is \"You're not going to die from this\" is what we've heard from two Oncologists and a plastic surgeon. After the biopsy, the problems continued, and they needed to take my wifes nipple. The result of that was \"extensive DCIS.\" The good thing was that even at that painful stage for my wife, it was caught early enough that it had not spread outside the ducts and was fully contained. There were no lumps and it never showed up on 3 mammograms (as it's not supposed to, from what the doctors have said.) We have finally met with an Oncologist in Toronto, and just today we met with the plastic surgeon and we are trying to get surgery booked within the next 4 - 8 weeks. They have recommended a full mastectomy, with immediate reconstruction. Good luck to you and I hope you have a positive outcome from this. Please continue to write here and I can / will give you as much detail and information about our experience as I can. Thanks for the good words, Sean.",
