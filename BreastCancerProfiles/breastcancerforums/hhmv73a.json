In a sense it is true that Tamoxifen is a carcinogen, because it may increase the chance for uterine cancer. But the chance is very small and the benefit outweighs the risk significantly. I think you need to talk to your physician about the side effects since I am not sure if Tamoxifen is the sole reason for the symptoms. I won't suggest you to seek alternative medication to replace Tamoxifen without talking to you treating medical oncologist at this time. Hope you will feel better soon. Regards, Dr. Jay Lu",

      "Content": "Dear All: First of all, mammosite brachytherapy is not the standard type of radiation to be used after surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy). Mammosite is a type of brachytherapy that use very localized radiation to treat the tumor bed. However, recent researches have shown that it may be used but it is still under study. For your reference I have attached a link to a recently published article for the topic. Regards, Dr. J. Jay Lu Acute complications of MammoSite brachytherapy: a single institution's initial clinical experience. Harper JL, Jenrette JM, Vanek KN, Aguero EG, Gillanders WE. Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. [email protected] PURPOSE: To report the acute complications incurred by the initial 37 patients who underwent accelerated partial breast irradiation with the MammoSite balloon breast brachytherapy applicator at the Medical University of South Carolina. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 2002 and March 2003, 37 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma had MammoSite brachytherapy catheters successfully place after lumpectomy by one of four surgeons and were deemed eligible for high-dose-rate brachytherapy. An open technique was used in 32 implants and the scar entry technique was used in 5 implants. Patients had Stage pTis-pT2N1 with negative margins. A dose of 34 Gy was prescribed to 1 cm from the balloon surface using (192)Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy and was delivered in 10 fractions twice daily. CT was used to confirm that the balloon surface was adherent to the lumpectomy cavity and to measure the balloon surface to skin surface distance. CT images and daily fluoroscopic simulations were used for treatment planning. Patients were assessed for acute toxicity on the day of therapy completion and 4 weeks after therapy by the radiation oncologist. In addition, all available data from radiation, surgical, and medical oncology were retrospectively reviewed for documentation of complications. All patients in this series had a minimal follow-up of 3 months; the mean follow-up for all patients was 7 months. RESULTS: The acute complications were categorized as operative wound complications, infections, skin toxicity, seromas, or catheter failures. Operative wound complications occurred in 3 patients (8%). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 2 and Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 2 (5.4%) and 1 (2.7%) patient, respectively. Six (16.2%) developed wound infections and 12 (32.4%) seromas. Catheter failures due to leak occurred in 2 patients (5.4%) and rupture in 3 (8%). CONCLUSION: The types of complications in this experience were similar to those in the Phase I trial of the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. However, catheter failure due to leak occurred in our experience and was not described in the Phase I trial. The incidence of complications was greater in our series than in the Phase I trial; however, differences in toxicity scoring and the length of follow-up between the two series impeded direct comparisons. The incidences of complications over time reflect the steep learning curve for accelerated partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. Finally, radiation recall dermatitis developed in 1 patient treated after this review was completed. Ref: Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2005 Jan 1;61(1):169-74.",

      "Content": "dear liz, sorry i cannot give you a direct answer since that will need a physical examination and some tests (may need a biopsy too). i am not familiar with the word \"cording\" but i guess they meant fibrosis or scaring of the soft tissue, which is a commonly seen side effect from radiation and is always not cancerous. fibrosis is usually firm, and by simple palpation one cannot easily tell the difference between a tumor (malignant or not) vs. fibrosis. although fibrosis is not uncommon, and i have seen many cases, it can be difficult to tell the difference. follow up with your surgeon is extremely important for you. if you have concern about the \"cording,\" ask him why he does not think this is recurrence, and if a biopsy is indicated. unfortunately i cannot tell you what else you need to do over the internet, but you have already brought this to your physicians' attention and it should not be difficult for them to take care of your concern. good luck, let us know if you have further questions. regards, jay J.

      "Content": "Dear Shelly, Sorry I cannot provide you with any recommendations since we need to perform medical history and physical examinations before recommending any treatment. Usually, radiation can be used for patients with 4 or more axillary lymph nodes or with other unfavorable prognostic factors. There is no definite recommenation for radiating the chest wall or not, but radiation may decrease local recurrence or even improve survival for certain patients with less than 4 nodes in the ipsilateral axilla. Chemotherapy is usually recommended for patients with locally advanced (3 nodes is not that advanced) and/or poorly differentiated breast ca. Now for your case, I highly recommend you to talk to the medical oncologist again. You may want to ask him whether radiation is indicated or not and why. If you are not happy with the answer, ask for an consultation after chemotherpy is completed. RT is usually given after chemo unless the surgical margins were positive or close. Good luck, Dr. Jay Lu",

Since the painful spot is in the surgical area, you may consider that surgery or scarring may also be part of the cause. I think you should discuss this with the surgeon as soon as possible. To rule out bone metastasis, bone scan is quite sensitive, and X-ray can be used to rule out lytic lesions too. But since the chance for mets is not very high, your physician has to correlate clinically before making a suggestion to you. Hope you get well soon. Regards, Dr. J. Jay Lu",

      "Content": "Dear Sue, Here is some information about DCIS and LCIS that may help. First of all, DCIS is precancerous, and the cure rate after mastectomy is very high (96-100% depends on which paper you read). After mastectomy for DCIS, no chemotherapy or radiation is needed, although some patient may receive hormonal treatment. Recurrence on chest wall is rare after mastectomy, although no physician will say 0% for relapse. LCIS is not cancer, but a risk for cancer. If left untreated, the patient will have high risk for invasive lobular carcinoma or ductal carcinoma (not DCIS), and thus prophylactic surgery is indicated for some patients. After mastectomy, there is no risk for having a new cancer in the breast because of the LCIS since the breast tissue is removed. I am not sure how soon you should see your physician but he/she may think a physical examination is more important than CT of the chest in follow-up. You can ask for an early appointment simply because you have concern about the recurrence. Hope you get well soon. Regards, Dr. J. Jay Lu",

      "Content": "Dear British, Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Well, this is certainly not normal. Breast cancer, no matter at which stage or grade, is always a serious disease. Stage I breast cancer is usually smaller than 2 cm, and any tumor <=5cm can be either stage I or II. Breast cancer has 3 grades and grade III is the highest grade (poor differentiation). Poorly differentiated breast cancer has higher chance of distant spread and that is why many medical oncologists will recommend chemotherapy for that group of patients, although the T stage (of TNM system) could be relatively early. Although breast cancer is a tough disease, it is treatable with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation. I think all patients has to face it and fight, together with their physicians. The prognosis for most stage I breast cancer is not bad after approp. therapy. You should discuss with your oncologist to confirm your stage and prognosis. Thay may let you feel much better. Good Luck, Dr. J. Lu For more info on breast cancer: http://www.thecancer.net/category.ph...reast%20Cancer",

      "Content": "Surgery may cause damage to the lymph vessels and nerve in the axilla, that is why patients develop lymphedema after surgery. Radiation is for local control, and tangential fields radiation only will cover part of the axillary nodal bed and will exacerbate the symptoms. When the physicians add a supraclavicular field and ?post-antertior boost? for axilla, the probability is higher. High-energy radiation machine (6MVx or higher) also cause lymphedema but the probability is a lot smaller. Usually lymphedema is subtle and patients only feel the ?heaviness.? Once it becomes obvious, there is no treatment except for PT or symptomatic treatment. Numbness is not related to lymphedema usually but caused by surgical damage to the axillary nerves. Radiotherapy rarely (although possible) causes severe neurological symptoms in breast cancer patients because the dose used is relatively low (50Gy). Let me know if you have further questions.

      "Content": "Dear Sue, Here is some information about DCIS and LCIS that may help. First of all, DCIS is precancerous, and the cure rate after mastectomy is very high (96-100% depends on which paper you read). After mastectomy for DCIS, no chemotherapy or radiation is needed, although some patient may receive hormonal treatment. Recurrence on chest wall is rare after mastectomy, although no physician will say 0% for relapse. LCIS is not cancer, but a risk for cancer. If left untreated, the patient will have high risk for invasive lobular carcinoma or ductal carcinoma (not DCIS), and thus prophylactic surgery is indicated for some patients. After mastectomy, there is no risk for having a new cancer in the breast because of the LCIS since the breast tissue is removed. I am not sure how soon you should see your physician but he/she may think a physical examination is more important than CT of the chest in follow-up. You can ask for an early appointment simply because you have concern about the recurrence. Hope you get well soon. Regards, Dr. J. Jay Lu",

Usually for patients with locally advanced breast cancer, radiation is indicated after surgery and chemotherapy. It is proven that adjuvant RT can reduce local recurrence and improve 5 year survival for patients according two large scale clinical trials. However, because of the side effects related to radiation, patients with connective tissue disorder should not receive RT, or should receive the treatment with extreme caution. I think you radiation oncologists has assessed your situation and decided to recommend no RT to you according to your specific information. I think you should talk to him/her again if you have concern. If external radiation is not recommended, usually we won't suggest brachytherapy either because the intensity is higher.
