      "Content": "Hi Danielle: Like the others have said. This is doable. Treatment is so much better now that it was years ago. We women are strong! I always think about the movie Steel Magnolias -- not because of the disease but because it is a reflection of women drawing strength from other women. We have been given the ability to deal with whatever is thrown at us. You and your mom do to. I bought a wig when I started chemo but rarely wore it. I, too, purchased from headcovers.com and found some of the cutest hats. I've since bought more and wear them to work with suits or casually with jeans. My co-workers say I am starting a fashion trend. You have to make the most fun out of this that you can and from that your mom will feel in control and empowered. Take care. We are here when you need us. Marion",

      "Content": "Hi: I'm another going through the same treatment regimen that your mom will go through. I'm stage IIA with a positive node and was told without treatment 50-55% recurrence and with treatment 20-30% recurrence. (Just like your mom) That translates to 80% that it will not come back...that's the number I focus on. I was given an MRI, xray for lungs and EKG for heart to be sure I could tolerate the chemo as well as some other tests to be sure it had not spread. The tests your doctor is going to do sounds normal to me. He's just making sure before everything starts and that's what they should do -- no surprises. I started with Adriamycin and Cytoxin one treatment every other week for 4 treatments. I also took a Neulasta shot at the time of chemo to boost my white blood cell count and was on Zofran for nausea. The nausea meds today are really very good. If your mom has trouble with nausea make sure she contacts the doctor to get something different. After chemo I did 6 weeks of radiation which I just finished. Next week I start chemo again with a different drug, Taxotere (similar to Taxol). I'll do that once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments. Then after that I'll take a Tamoxifen or Arimidex pill for 5 years. It sounds like a lot of work and a long time to get through it but it goes fast. I had virtually no nausea during chemo. When I started to feel sick I just made sure I always ate something even if it was just crackers and toast. You don't really feel like eating but it will help. I sailed through radiation with no problems and have continued working through all of it and just made sure that when I was tired I took time for myself and rested. But this is not the time to be \"wonder woman\". Make sure your mom gets rest if she needs it. Everyone is different but more and more women are going through treatment with few side effects and are able to keep a good outlook and a positive attitude. Well balanced meals and plenty of water will help also. My hair fell out starting with the second chemo treatment and that was worse for me than going through the treatments. Be there for your mom during that time if she needs support. Many women find it traumatic. She might think about having a wig ready for when it happens. My daughter went with me to the hairdresser to shave my head and that helped. I already had my wig but she and I went shopping for hats. There are some really cute ones and I found that I stopped wearing the wig and enjoyed wearing different hats everyday. 8 weeks after last chemo treatment and my hair is already 1? long and feels like velvet, but I plan to continue wearing the hats. They are very fun. It sounds like you found a great doctor. That should reassure your mom and your family. Talk to us whenever you have more questions or need reassurance. We are here. Perhaps your mom would feel comfortable coming here also. There are many, many women (unfortunately) on this forum who have experienced so much and can share their experiences. Also, the doctors can answer any questions that she might not have an opportunity to discuss with her own doctor. Good luck and come back to us when you need us. Our prayers and thoughts will be with you on the first treatment. Marion",

      "Content": "All through my chemo and for most of radiation my WBC remained within range. During the last month the WBC was 3.7 and then raised to 3.8 so I wasn't concerned. However, on the last one yesterday it was 2.7 -- a big drop in only a few weeks. My radiologist doesn't seem to be concerned although she is going to talk to my onc about it. I know that chemo and radiation can do this even after chemo has stopped, and I know there are shots available to boost the WBC back up but was wondering if anyone knows of anything that I can do to get the WBC back up without taking the shot? folic acid, iron? My radiologist did suggest barley green if I wanted to do anything but I don't know too much about that supplement. any ideas? Marion",

      "Content": "Ok. This sounds strange but I've been on Tamoxifen for about 45 days with no side effects but in the last two weeks have noticed that when I exercise, mow the yard, etc that causes me to sweat that I have a stinging sensation on my skin. It's almost like a burning feeling. When I stop sweating the stinging goes away. If I cool down or take a shower it goes away. Does this sound familiar to anyone? I've read a side effect of Tamoxifen is itching but that makes me think it means itching all the time. This is not itching but stinging and only when I perspire and then its gone. Has anyone else had this experience? Marion",

One month ago was diagnosed with breast cancer -- lumpectomy of 1.6 cm and anxillary node dissection with one lymph node involved. Just had first round of chemotherapy which fortunately went pretty well with minimal nausea (exercise seemed to help the most). The bruising around the incision has been extensive and appears blood is now accumulating at the incision. Last week the surgeon aspirated which resulted in reduction of bruising but the incision area seems to be swelling, quite painful and soft. Went back to surgeon and did another aspiration and removed quite a lot of blood. He believes surgery at that site to remove blood might be necessary if this doesn't relieve the problem. From what I've read this is not uncommon and the body usually heals itself although it may take quite a long time. My question, has anyone else had this and is there anything I can be doing to help the process along.

However, on the last one yesterday it was 2.7 -- a big drop in only a few weeks. My radiologist doesn't seem to be concerned although she is going to talk to my onc about it. I know that chemo and radiation can do this even after chemo has stopped, and I know there are shots available to boost the WBC back up but was wondering if anyone knows of anything that I can do to get the WBC back up without taking the shot? folic acid, iron? My radiologist did suggest barley green if I wanted to do anything but I don't know too much about that supplement. any ideas? Marion",

      "Content": "Hi, Mary. I, too, developed shingles at the end of radiation and just before my second round of chemo. I don't quite remember the exact timing but I do remember wondering if it was the radiation or the Taxotere that caused it. Prior to the radiation I had 4 rounds of A/C so my system was pretty well stressed anyway. I am now finished with all treatments except for being on Tamoxifen for the next five years. So far it has not returned but maybe just the relief of being through all the treatments and being diagnosed now NED is making the difference. Just try to keep your body in the best physical condition it can be, excercise and eat properly. I found that made the biggest difference, especially the excercise (which I know is hard to do because you're tired anyway). Best of luck. Marion",

My radiologist has spoken with my onc and I have an appointment on Wednesday to take WBC again and then determine what is the best thing to do before starting chemo in two weeks. I have a feeling they will suggest a Neulasta shot which kept my WBC up during my last chemo treatments. In the meantime, I'm eating all the right things, taking vitamins and supplements, and exercising to put more oxygen into the bloodstream hoping this will all help the blood cells rejuvinate themselves. Its atleast helped my hair to start growing back very quickly....fuzzy like goose down Too bad it will probably fall out again when I start these last 4 treatments....oh well.",

      "Content": "I have just had my first baseline mammogram (6 mo following surgery)after chemo and radiation. I was told the results said normal and follow up in 6 months. However, when I went to the onc today and asked to read the report, it said mass found at surgical site, assume scar tissue, follow up in 6 months. I then questioned the onc and insisted that I have an ultrasound to see exactly what that mass was and not \"assume\" it was scar tissue. This is because when I was diagnosed in October it was because the tumor was hidden behind scar tissue from a previous biopsy 6 years ago. So I don't trust mammograms as an end all to diagnosis. I'm sure they are probably correct that it is scar tissue because that makes sense, however, has anyone else been told on their first mammogram after surgery that they have scar tissue at the surgery site? I can't imagine that I could possibly have a cancer cell left in my body after three chemo drugs and radiation treatment but I don't trust this disease to do what it \"should\" do. I'm just glad I have an onc that is willing to give me peace of mind and order the extra tests that I think need to be done, however, that does require that I be my own advocate for medical treatment and stay up on things. Any information or experience with similar mammogram results would be appreciated. Marion",

I thought it was just my eyesight getting worse but during my weekly visits with the radiologist to do bloodwork, etc the radiologist asked if I had noticed any difference in my eyesight. I told her I had but just figured I was due for another exam and my eyes were getting worse. She told me that often chemo has an effect on eyesight and can make them blurry. She advised me not to do anything now but to wait until my radiation was completed and my next round of chem which is to begin in March and end beginning of June. She said it would then take several months for it to improve after that. She said she has known of women who get their prescription changed soon after chemo only to have the prescription changed again several months later when eyesight improved. I had never seen that as a side effect of chemo but evidently it can be a common problem. Hope that helps. Marion",

You didn't give your age but I can tell you my daughter (Soph in college) had the same questions you did when I told her. She was looking for any answers she could get. She went to the doctor with me and it was not only a great help to me but a huge help to her. Go with your mom if you can. I was diagnosed 10/14/04, had surgery, one node positive, 4 chemo treatments and now in 4th week of radiation. I'll have 4 more chemo treatments when radiation is through and hopefully by June will be finished and then on medication for 5 years and I can tell you I'm looking toward a ripe old age. My daughter was a great inspiration to me and told me \"we're going to get through this together\". I couldn't do this without her. She gives me strength to keep a positive attitude, and a positive attitude will go along way with your mom to make her feel as normal as possible. The treatments are excellent today and the prognosis is so much better for us than it used to be. You stay positive so that your mom will stay positive. Let us know her diagnosis and come back to us when you have more questions or need positive thoughts. We're here for you. Marion",

The other chemo treatments (A/C) had their own side effects to deal with and those were tolerable but this one is new. I just took my first treatment on Wednesday and pain started on Friday. I've talked to the oncologist and am able to take a Lortab (pain killer) for the pain but hate to do that for any length of time. They said the pain would last several days. Has anyone had joint pain with Taxotere and were you able to find relief with anything other than pain killers? How long did the pain last? I assume after treatment was finished the side effects went away? I'm trying to convince my husband that this is a great excuse for a weekly massage Marion",

That's why I'm a little confused with this one although I guess the Neulasta could react differently with a different drug. When I talked with the oncologist they first suspected Neulasta until I told them I had it previously with no problems. I am to see the onc next week for blood work and will ask direct questions then because this is almost unbearable. Thanks.' Marion",

But the day is here! Treatments are finished and all tests show NED. What a beautiful day. I now start Tamoxifen which presents its own issues but if I can get through the last 6 months I feel I can get through anything. Thanks to all of you for your support and encouragement, and answers to all the questions that we pose here looking for reassurance or simply answers to help us get through another day. My daughter and I are taking a trip to Europe next month to celebrate the start of a new life in a new way. How proudly we can all stand and say \"I am a survivor. I am living with this disease!\" God bless you all. Marion",

The ultrasound only found scar tissue at the surgical site and NED. Even the small fluid filled cyst in a totally different part of the breast that was there last fall (not cancerous) is now gone. I'm told that's because chemo puts you into menapause and changes the chemical balance which can make these types of cysts reabsorb and go away. The peace of mind is priceless, wonderous and such a relief. All chemo is now complete, radiation complete and now on to the next stage of Tamoxifen with routine mammograms every 6 months and blood work every 3 months for the next year. Ladies this is doable. You can beat this. At the beginning it seems like a long road and you have to take each day (each treatment) at a time. But there is light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train -- its life! Happy Mother's Day to everyone! Marion",

Unfortunately you'll never get rid of the scar tissue because everytime they go back in to remove the scar tissue or do more surgery, there will always be scar tissue that develops. So a viscous circle develops where at some point we must educate ourselves as best we can, ask enough questions, determine if what we are being told makes sense, and then go on our way always watching. I was told by my onc that they are seeing more tumors develop where biopsies were previously done. He didn't know if that was because that area was just predestined (since the need for biopsy had already occurred) or if the \"disruption\" of tissue and resulting scar tissue was hiding it. In any case, after 3 opinions by radiologist, oncologist and ultrasound technician I trust they are correct and only scar tissue exists. Once you've put your trust in your team, all that's left is your trust in God who I believe always provides the correct answer. Take care. Marion",

My radiologist has spoken with my onc and I have an appointment on Wednesday to take WBC again and then determine what is the best thing to do before starting chemo in two weeks. I have a feeling they will suggest a Neulasta shot which kept my WBC up during my last chemo treatments. In the meantime, I'm eating all the right things, taking vitamins and supplements, and exercising to put more oxygen into the bloodstream hoping this will all help the blood cells rejuvinate themselves. Its atleast helped my hair to start growing back very quickly....fuzzy like goose down Too bad it will probably fall out again when I start these last 4 treatments....oh well.",

      "Content": "Hi, Shelley: I have had blurry eyesight as well since chemo. I thought it was just my eyesight getting worse but during my weekly visits with the radiologist to do bloodwork, etc the radiologist asked if I had noticed any difference in my eyesight. I told her I had but just figured I was due for another exam and my eyes were getting worse. She told me that often chemo has an effect on eyesight and can make them blurry. She advised me not to do anything now but to wait until my radiation was completed and my next round of chem which is to begin in March and end beginning of June. She said it would then take several months for it to improve after that. She said she has known of women who get their prescription changed soon after chemo only to have the prescription changed again several months later when eyesight improved. I had never seen that as a side effect of chemo but evidently it can be a common problem. Hope that helps. Marion",

The every two week regimen has been shown to be more effective and aggressive than doing the three week regimen. During A/C I did extremely well -- very little nausea because I had some great nausea meds. I was able to take a treatment on Wednesday afternoon, relax around the house on Thursday and by Friday felt good enough to go shpping. Everyone is different but it is extremely doable. I found small snacks helped with the nausea. Your mom won't feel like eating but it will help get through the nausea, and drink plenty of liquids. for me it felt like coming down with the flu but after 2 days it was better. Your mom can do this. After the 4 treatments of A/C, I did 30 radiation treatments and now doing 4 treatments of Taxotere. I have no nausea at all with Taxotere but tremendous joint pain that starts on about day 2 and lasts for 2 days and then gone. I have had no neuropathy. While the pain is exhausting, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Keep your mom focused on the success of the treatment and the fact that meds are so much better now than they used to be.

There are a few manufacturers of the generic and each has a different look so that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Pharmacy prices just vary from one company to another. Shopping around is probably a good idea. Marion",

      "Content": "I just finished my last treatment of Taxotere. My onc told me that normally they start Tamoxifen (or Arimidex) about 3 weeks following the last chemo, or as soon as possible. I'm not starting until 6 weeks due to traveling and not wanting to start a medication without knowing how I will react so I will start when I return from my trip. But he reinforced to me that normally they want to start as soon as possible. I don't think we ever hear the words \"cured\". After mammogram, ultrasound, CT scans, etc following my last treatment, the best I could get was NED (no evidence of disease). That's comforting to a great extent but mentally means I will always be on the look out for signs and will never miss my 6 month check up. \"Cured\" would probably make me think I don't need to worry. I don't think I will ever feel that secure again. Marion",

      "Content": "Hi Shelley: I had the opportunity to be a part of a study that was being conducted by a university to determine just this. The only problem was when you signed up you didn't know which group you would be put into -- the group that was allowed to have support via family, friends, internet, hospital support groups, etc., or the group that could not have any support. It was a ten year study I believe. They were going to follow the women through their treatment, recovery, and recurrence (if any) and then compare. All the women had to be in stage II or less with tumors smaller than 5 cm, lymph node involvement, chemo and radiation treatment, specific age range, etc. I chose not to participate because I truly believe support provides the best outcome and recovery and I didn't feel I could take the risk of being put into the group that would not be allowed to have support. I felt for my own sake and the sake of my family I owed it to them and myself to do whatever I could to have the best outcome. I admire those women who took part and were willing to be put into the non-support group for the good of all us with this disease. It will be interesting one day to see what the outcome is of this study. Marion",

      "Content": "Roxanne, I'm sure Dr. Leo and others can provide you with better information but I was told by my surgeon that the surgical incision of the lump is more definitive than a biopsy. According to him, depending on how many samples they take, whether they take them in the right area, get a good cross section, etc they may or may not get definitive results. The surgery on the other hand is the most accurate. They will take enough tissue around the lump to get good margins meaning there is enough clean area around the lump that does not have cancer cells. They put a dye on it to test it I believe. In my case I had the sentinel node biopsy done at the same time as the lumpectomy but I'm not sure its always done at the same time. They use this information to determine if an axillary node biopsy is needed. With the sentinel node biopsy they will inject a radioactive dye in the area of the lump to track where the cancer cells are most likely to go if it were spreading and then do a biopsy on the first node. If the cancer has spread, then the axillary node biopsy is done. In my case I had the sentinel node biopsy done at the same time as the lumpectomy where cancer had spread only to the first node. Then two days later went back for the axillary biopsy on 14 nodes and found nothing else. My experience has been that the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy is pretty easy to recover from, its the axillary node biopsy that is more difficult. Perhaps others can give you additional information.",

      "Content": "Can anyone help me understand a little more about tumor markers? Last fall I had 4 treatments of A/C followed by 30 rads and now have completed 2 of 4 Taxotere. The onc is extremely good about monitoring everying with blood test, WBC, etc each treatment which is reassuring. I just learned that the onc has been looking at tumor markers since the first treatment last fall and I was able to see the results. In trying to help me understand, he indicated they like it to be below 39. When I started first chemo I was at 27 then next blood count it was 35 and then has continually reduced now down to 14. I've read all the reports and studies and understand that by itself tumor markers are not necessarily reliable but \"perhaps\" only an indicator of how successful treatment is. And having looked at the studies I see it is only 50%+ accurate and can give false positives. Knowing all that, perhaps the doctors can help me understand: 1) what would have caused the spike from 27 to 35 in a two week time period from the time of first treatment to the second treatment -- would that be because the chemo started and basically \"disrupted\" all the cancer cells into a frenzy? 2) if I was at 27 and now down to 14 does that indicate that at least the chemo treatment is working and doing what they expected and 3) is the idea to get it to 0 or just low and then to watch for a change upward that could indicate something in the future? In any case, I take it as reassurance that the onc is watching and testing all things for my best treatment and it is a positive sign that things are progressing in the proper direction -- always looking for the encouragement to wake up to another beautiful day!

I also did the shot to boost the WBC. Usually the first treatment is indicative of how she'll do so sounds like so good so far. We're all here as you need us and sounds like your mom is in good hands. Our thoughts are with you. Marion",

      "Content": "Hi, glad you have joined us although not glad that you have to go through this. I finished 4 treatments of chemo Jan 5 and then did 6 weeks of radiation and now in my final 4 treatments of chemo starting today. The only side effects I had with radiation was slight swelling, breast turned brown and started to peel and small rash that cleared up once I stopped using the lotion. I was also tired but I think that was more becuase of the daily routine at 7:30 each morning rather than because it was the radiation making me tired. I have heard that radiation can affect some women with nausea depending on the location and amount of radiation being given. In any case, if this is not normal for your wife and you or she have concerns or questions about what is going on, I would certainly talk to the radiologist and ask questions. I don't remember how long you said your wife had been doing radiation but most doctors will see their patients weekly to take a peek at the breast to see what kind of site reactions are occuring, draw blood occassionally and ask questions about any other side effects. I would call the doctor to see what can be done and what is causing it if you don't have a regular weekly appt in the next few days. Marion",

The only problem was when you signed up you didn't know which group you would be put into -- the group that was allowed to have support via family, friends, internet, hospital support groups, etc., or the group that could not have any support. It was a ten year study I believe. They were going to follow the women through their treatment, recovery, and recurrence (if any) and then compare. All the women had to be in stage II or less with tumors smaller than 5 cm, lymph node involvement, chemo and radiation treatment, specific age range, etc. I chose not to participate because I truly believe support provides the best outcome and recovery and I didn't feel I could take the risk of being put into the group that would not be allowed to have support. I felt for my own sake and the sake of my family I owed it to them and myself to do whatever I could to have the best outcome. I admire those women who took part and were willing to be put into the non-support group for the good of all us with this disease. It will be interesting one day to see what the outcome is of this study. Marion",

The last 2 days, however, I have started to have pain/tenderness at the surgery site. Has anyone had this? Now I automatically assume the worst and wonder what's going on. I don't feel any lumps, bumps, masses, etc except for scar tissue at surgery site. Had mammogram and ultrasound after all treatments 60 days ago to get a baseline and everything was fine. I go again in October. I sometimes have minor fluid retention due to lymph node removal and wonder if it could be that which is putting more pressure on that area. Any thoughts? I've also heard of massage therapy that can be done when lymph nodes have been removed to help keep the fluid moving. Has anyone tried this or can explain exactly what is done? Marion",

As the doctor said, for the next 10 years, everytime something feels odd I will wonder and worry. Thanks for your thoughts. Now on to Phase II and radiation! Marion",

The onc didn't want to start before the trip not knowing how I might react to new medication so we will see what side effects I encounter. Since the last chemo treatments of Taxol end of May I find my leg muscles are weak and have some difficulty going up multiple flights of stairs. I am better after walking all over Europe and feel that it is simply lack of exercise during chemo that has made my muscles tired. I am not looking forward to the Tamoxifen if joint pain reoccurs.

      "Content": "Has anyone had to deal with throat ulcers during or after chemo? I just finished my last round of chemo a week ago. Two days ago I started to develop mouth sores. I have used Biotine toothpaste and mouthwash during the chemo and have never had problems with mouth sores until now. But in addition to the mouth sores, now it feels like I have a sore throat and like something is lodged in my esophogus. My first thought was of course, \"oh no another tumor\" but I'm thinking (hoping) now it might be throat ulcers since the mouth ulcers developed at about the same time. I see throat ulcers are a side effect of the chemo and there is prescription medicine for it. Anybody else had to deal with this and have any thoughts on what can be done? The doctor is having me get a CAT scan tomorrow morning just to be sure nothing else is going on -- I think for my peace of mind more than anything else. Marion",

      "Content": "I have just started my third week of radiation after finishing 4 chemo treatments of A/C on Jan 5. Over the weekend I noticed small bumps (hives) similar to a rash developing on the chest wall. The breast is not red, dry, itching or tender and the bumps are not all over the breast but in a localized area. The bumps are not red but do itch. I've read that radiation can cause a rash but I guess I assumed that it would be more like a red rash, not raised bumps, and would cover more of the breast than just a small area. Has anyone else had anything similar and any suggestions on what to do? I continue to put lotions on the breast as radiologist suggest to keep it moist but wonder now if that could just be contributing to the problem. Any ideas or suggestions? Marion",

I found that if I laid on my other side and hugged a pillow so that it was between my arm and breast, it cushioned the breast and lymph node incisions. On occasion I also took 1/2 pain killer just to take the edge off. You need to do what you have to do to get rest. It will make all the difference in your recovery. I've just completed my 2nd chemo treatment of A/C with virtually no nausea and only headache -- felt like pre-flu symptoms. Able to go back to work after two days. If not for the hair loss, would really not know too much difference. But I believe the key is at least 8 hours good rest each night to let your body start to heal. so do what you need to do to relax.

      "Sample": "I was also tired but I think that was more becuase of the daily routine at 7:30 each morning rather than because it was the radiation making me tired. I have heard that radiation can affect some women with nausea depending on the location and amount of radiation being given....All the women had to be in stage II or less with tumors smaller than 5 cm, lymph node involvement, chemo and radiation treatment, specific age range, etc. I chose not to participate because I truly believe support provides the best outcome and recovery and I didn't feel I could take the risk of being put into the group that would not be allowed to have support....I'm sure they are probably correct that it is scar tissue because that makes sense, however, has anyone else been told on their first mammogram after surgery that they have scar tissue at the surgery site? I can't imagine that I could possibly have a cancer cell left in my body after three chemo drugs and radiation treatment but I don't trust this disease to do what it \"should\" do....The only side effects I had with radiation was slight swelling, breast turned brown and started to peel and small rash that cleared up once I stopped using the lotion. I was also tired but I think that was more becuase of the daily routine at 7:30 each morning rather than because it was the radiation making me tired....",
