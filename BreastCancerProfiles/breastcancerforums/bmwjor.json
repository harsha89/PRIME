    "Content": "hello forum members, I am a 48 year old mother for 4 sons, I complained of pain in the left side of my left breast 5 days ago and when I touched my breast I found a hard lump,, in the same day a red spot 2x2 cm appeared on my breast at the same site of the pain and the area was very warm , after 2 days the redness has subsided and still there is a minimal pain on touching and the lump is still there,,, I am expecting to have my period these days what it could be?? I am planning to go to the doctor after 2 days but I am really worried and frightened and cant sleep from the fear,,, do u think it is not a serious condition bcoz it is a painful lump?? thanks in advance for ur kind response ..",
