      "Content": "Hello- My MIL has breast cancer with lungs, liver, and now brain mets. She has a tumor on the back side of her brain near the area which controls functions such as breathing. They did surgery last week and put in a shunt (sp?) to relieve pressure. It only worked for one side of her brain. As we speak she is having a 2nd surgery to find out why and hopefully fix it. They have her on a 2 week radiation schedule. Just after the 2nd surgery- her doc's told her she would have no problem making our upcomming cruise trip to Mexico. My question is this- is this a reasonable expectation? 1 week after completion of radiation she will be well enough to be on a boat for 6 days away from medical attention? I hope with all my heart that it is possible- because either way- it doesnt appear we have much time left with her, and she is VERY MUCH looking forward to the trip. Its all she talks about. Here's some more backround. The cancer is under controll everywhere else in her body- just a week before she fell ill her scans were good. She became very very tired about 2 weeks ago and it kept getting worse and worse to the point that she couldnt talk or barely move. The doc's said if she had not had the surgery the day she did- she would have died. Her lungs would have stopped working. They did the 1st surgery, and one side of her brain drained so they sent her home with the possibility of a 2nd surgery on Monday. However, not 2hours later she began vomiting- so she was rushed back into ICU last night and surgery this morning. What kind of expectations should I have about all this. People keep saying- she's doing good and she's getting better- but is she?? I need to be able to help my husband through this. I feel like if I can face the hard facts of reality- I wont be blindsided and I can better help him cope. I love this women with all my heart- and I want so badly to beleive we will all be relaxing in the sun in 3 weeks- but I feel like there is just so much I dont know- and it's killing me. Its hard to be strong, and watch my husband suffer. Especially not knowing what to expect. Any info or guidance someone can offer is much appreciated. I'm just so lost.",

      "Content": "thank you for your reply.. she will be complete with her radiation by then.. however, i am afraid she is starting to give up. she keeps telling my husband- \"its your responsibility to make sure Hailey- (our 3 month old daughter) knows how much I loved her.\" It breaks my heart to type those words. She is becoming depressed and down on herself for not bouncing back as usual. I am so scared. I just dont know what to do. I really have no one to talk to- because I'm just trying so hard to keep it together for my husband and children. My two boys are use to Nana being in the hospital- so its not scary for them. We are sheltering them from the reality of what could happen at this point. My husband is my best friend- but I dont want to break down in front of him- I feel like he needs me to be strong right now.. I dont really have any friends where we live because we just moved here. Its just all so terrifying. She was perfectly fine the Sunday before last. She came up (hour and a half drive) to see us and we spent the day at the pool and playing in the park. Then 3 days later she's in the hospital. I keep reading all these stories about women who have brain mets in their 60's-70's and come out just fine after treatment.. Lori is only in her mid-40's. So I keep thinking- no way are we loosing her now. But oh my god- what if we are?? what do i do?? and there's nothing i can do. i feel helpless- and guilty for feeling that way all at the same time. like who am i to feel helpless and afraid- she's the one going through all of this. she's the one facing it. it just hurts so bad to think what she must be feeling. I just love her so much. I cant loose her now. My kids need her. I need her. My husband needs her. The world needs her.",

      "Content": "I appreciate both of your reply's. Visiting this site has certianly helped me cope. Just knowing someone \"listened\" to my fears and thoughts, I feel like I have some where to go to cry. I can be the supportive rock for my husband and feel supported too. I never thought about what my kids may be thinking- I guess my attempt to protect them from the truth is sending mixed messages. I dont think my 5 year old quite understands, but I know my eight year old must be worried. My husband and I are going to sit down with him and let him express any worries and ask questions. He know's Nana is very sick, and we aren't sure if or when she will get better, but I know he must be confused. Hell I'm confused- so I know he must be too. We are going to talk to my five year old seprate. You have to be careful how you word things with him. He repeats everything. If he gets the idea Nana might be dying, he will surely ask her about it the next time we see her. As for my MIL- she is now in \"angry\" mode. She has lost faith in her doctors due to her attempts to tell them she was having symptoms which we know now to be clear indicators their may be a brain tumor- and they just kept dismissing her and telling her it was \"normal.\" Even when they finally did listen and give her a brain scan- they were trying to push her back to a Friday. When she went in on a Wednesday (after her sister demanded they see her continuously) she was rushed into surgery that night. The surgon told my husband she would have had a very hard time living until Friday if she had waited. Thank God for persistance. Anyway- she is still very tired, but only has 4 more radiation treatments to go- and HOPEFULLY we will see a difference. I already see a difference in her- especially since her doc tried to perscribe anti-depressants. That just made her spitting mad!! \"I'm not depressed!- I'm pissed off!!\" she said. Then the following day, they send a chaplin in to talk to her. That just made things worse. She went from thinking she was dying- to being mad that others might think that too. She immediatly went shopping for the cruise when she left. She bought a few outfits. If pissed off is what she needs to be to continue fighting- I pray she continues to get pissed off until her tumor is shrunken to a managable level. Whether she can go or not, I'm just so excited she has the trip to look forward too. To help her get though these last treatments and keep her fighting until her body isnt so tired. Anyway, thanks again for letting me vent and replying. Its nice to know these sites are out there to help. I know there is no way I'll ever be able to know what you all are going through- but I am so thankful you are here to help me deal with my own thoughts. Just knowing there is someone out there who has experianced what this horrible desease can do- and they still take the time to read into someone else's problems and try to help guide them through to understanding... well you'll never know how much I appreciate it. And how much you helped- just by clicking reply.",
