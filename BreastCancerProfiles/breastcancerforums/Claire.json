      "Content": "I have just found this site, I am desperate for answers, explanations - why my mother????? 18mths ago she had the lymph nodes removed from under her arm, this was a secondry cancer. After tests still the primary source was never found. She was treated with chemo for breast cancer and radiotherapy. Now after having all clear in November she was taken into hospital Monday with swollen legs, difficulty in passing urine and shortness of breath. Turns out the evil cancer has returned its spread to her liver and bones. I worry about the time i have left with her. I should be focusing on that not what am i going to do without her. My mind is messed up I can't believe it. I can't believe it , help me pls, what am I going to do. I am a total mess. I've got 2 young children to look after and I just can't cope!!!! Please Help.

      "Content": "Not sure how long you have been on Arimidex, but that is a common side effect. It should go away. I have been on it for a little over a year. I had pain also, but it went away. Now I am experiencing serious hair thinning, which is apparently a very common side effect. Some gals get it right away and some later. Just what I DO NOT WANT!!! I know several others having the same problem. Onc says I can switch to Tamoxifen.",
