      "Content": "hello, would really appreciate any info, as just my luck to be told i have something that i havent heard or read of before! i have just got back from seeing the breast surgeon who examined breasts and the area that i can feel a hardness and where most of the pain is he said is just very nodular, he advised me to have another ultrasound and a fna , the u/s again just showed cluster of nodules, the radiologist said he could see nothing suspicious but would do the fna to check what was causing so much pain, now i have to wait 4 days for the results, does anyone no anything about nodules? i was remarkably calm whilst at the hspt but started to get really anxious again, i have heard of cysts being painful but they are saying these are nodules and the brain is starting to go into overdrrive again. any ideas anyone please. thanks love dawn xxx",
