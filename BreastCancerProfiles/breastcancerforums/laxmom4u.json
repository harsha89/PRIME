      "Content": "Just got my biopsy results back, positive for breast cancer. I see my surgeon on Monday. Not sure how far it has gone or any details but they wanted me in today asap, I said I needed the weekend to process. I feel like I am living in a dream or actually a nightmare. I know I need to be strong but I just keep feeling an array of emotions. Keep thinking what I could of done to cause this. It only in my right breast with cancer but my left breast has the cyst, leaking and adh my right one did 4 years ago. So if one goes I think they both should go because it is always a problem when I go for a mammo, dense breast cyst ect ect. I am only 47, please if anyone out there has a some insight please enlighten me. Thanks",

      "Content": "Ok had my first breast surgery at 16 it was a fibroidandenoma. No biggie and I was ok until 4 years ago , when my wonderful dense breast showed micro calcifications in the same breast, well that was a ductal hyperplasia , another surgery but again no biggie. Just had to go for 6month mammo check ups. Well my recent mammo showed much more microcalcifications. Now going for biopsy on Wed. I'm 47, 5 3 and 115 lbs never smoked, have 4 children I breast fed and had between the ages of 25-33 and my mother and her sister have no issues. The only family history I have is my dad's sister had it at 50 and my grandmothers sister died from it at 48. I am very worried this time. This time calcifications are clustered in two different spots. I'm trying not to think about it but the waiting game is killing me. Anyone have a similar experience ?",
