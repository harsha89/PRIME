      "Content": "Positivethinker, welcome to the place no one wants to be. After reading your post, I am in awe of your name after such a shock. I am a caregiver who gained much information and support from this forum. There are so many questions. Are there two cancers or is one the primary and the other a metastasis? I will be checking in to see what your doctors decide. My son had emergency surgery (perforated colon) and then 4 doses of Folfox6 before his liver surgery. I believe he needed to be off one of the drugs for a month before surgery. He returned for more chemo after a month of recovery time. You have a complicated situation. Prayers for good decisions by your cancer team. Amanda",
