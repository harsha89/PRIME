    "Content": "Hello, I am very confused and was hoping to gain some feedback. I am 45 years old with Invasive Ductal Cell Carcinoma. My tumour size was 2.7 cm, I am ER positive (100%) and PR positive (90%), HER2 negative with no lymph node involvement. I have a Nottinghanm Histiological Grade of 3. I had a lumpectomy with clear margins. I opted to have the Onctotypedx test done which indicated that I was at Low Risk for Recurence with a score of 15. My onco suggested that I enter into the new TailorX Study where I would randomly be selected to receive either Tamoxifen alone or Tamoxifen along with chemo OR opt to have chemo OR opt to receive radiation along with Tamoxifen. I thought that I had made my decsion which I based upon the results of the Onctotypedx and called my Onco to let him know that I would go with the Radiation and Tamoxifen alone with which my onco indicated was an \"acceptable\" decision. I an now making myself nuts as to whether or not I made the right decision which I know is personal however if anyone has any feedback I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, Carolee",
