    "Content": "Me, being a little off my rocker. My kids made me several wigs out of felt and felt strips. One is rege like and the other is the seahawk colors. My hair is not coming back very well after 8 months and I am a hat guy, but for the shear shock value I wear my wigs as often as I can. The patients at the cancer center always have to take a double look and the the med staff finally understands my sense of humor. Do what is right for you and brings you happiness. josh",
