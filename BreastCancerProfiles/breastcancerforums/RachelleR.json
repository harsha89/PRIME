(If I can, is it OK to get a mammo while breast feeding?) I also do self breast exams, mostly in the shower. I am really not sure about the genetic testing either, because of how it could effect my future, such as health insurance, life insurance and such.

      "Content": "Thanks for your reply Rachel, My Ob/gyn is really pushing me to have the genetic testing, she says could save my life, because my chances of getting the disease. I really miss my grandma and I am having a hard time dealing with the fact that I lost her to this terrible disease. I am very fearful of what the future holds for my aunts. My niece has a friend who is 23 and while she was pregnant she found a breast lump and her doc told her that she was too young for breast cancer and that it was probably a clogged milk duct. Well the lump kept growing and she had her baby and found out that she has breast cancer and it mets to the liver. I really cannot tell you how many times I have heard the \"you are too young for breast cancer\" line, and it angers me to no end! Thanks again rachel! rachelle!",

      "Content": "Hi, my name is Rachelle I have 4 kids, 10,7,4, and 2 weeks. I am 28 years old. I do not have breast cancer. I lost my grandma (who is more like my mom) in April. She had breast cancer that mets to her spine and many other bones. She was in remission for several years and her cancer had spread to the spine and other areas 3 years ago this month. During the last three years, her and my grandpa had lived with my husband and I on and off so we could help care for her. My kids got to spend a lot of time bonding with her and for that I am so grateful! I miss my grandma every minute of every day and I really cannot believe she is gone. I was 8 months pregnant when she passed, she fought hard to stay alive because she wanted to see her new great granddaughter. My grandma has 4 kids, three daughters and one son. 2 of her daughters (my aunts) have breast cancer. My mom is the only female sibling without cancer. The age of diagnosis for my grandma was 53, my aunt was 39 and my other aunt 44. They were all diagnosed young. My aunts have not been through menipause. My aunt that was diagnosed at 39 (4 years ago) has already had mets to the bones (literally every bone in her body) and now they are checking her brain. She also has skin cancer. I am mainly here to meet and talk with ppl and get a better understanding of the disease and learn everything I can on how to prevent this from happening to me. My doctor recommends I have the BRCA I and II done. I am seriosly considering having that done. I really think that If I found out that I have a great chance of having breast cancer myself I would take action while I am healthy, such as a double mastctomy and possibly removal of my ovaries. I am lucky that I have an extremely supportive husband. I want to be alive and healthy for my kids for many years to come. I did breast feed each of my kids, and I am currently breastfeeding, I know that this lowers my risk, but will it help if the cancer is hereditary? I know this is a long post, and I am sorry, and if you have read it all, thank you so much. It helps me to talk about my grandma and my family as much as possible, because it hurts so bad! I look forward to knowing you all! Thanks Rachelle",
