    "Content": "Hi KAT1 - I'm certainly not a doctor, but what you described sounds like fibrocystic disease of the breast. This is a common, NON-CANCEROUS condition (I have it) in which one or both of the breasts develop fibrous cysts that may shrink or grow and feel more or less painful depending where you are in your menstrual cycle. You are smart to go to your doctor just in case -- but I don't think it's time to panic yet. Unless you're the stubborn type who needs to be terrified into going to the doctor, I'd also say that your mom is being an alarmist and causing you undue anxiety, so you may need to reign her in too. So, go get your test and then breathe a big sigh of relief if you are one of the many women with fibrocystic breasts! Best Wishes! )",
