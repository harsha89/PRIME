      "Content": "I am looking for ANY information on treatment of metastases through Breastcancer. This is my first attempt outside of Europe. I hope somebody can point me in the right direction. My mother (54 years) was diagnosed with breastcancer in february 2000 after she had discovered a small lump in on of her breasts. Within 3 weeks she had an operation to remove the lump, her lymph glands in her armpit were ok. In the summer of 2000 she had radiotherapy on her breast (36 treatments) to be on the safe side. She had regular check-ups since (every 3 months) and seemed to be doing wel. In May 2003 she was suffering from severe stomach pains, an ultrasound was made but nothing was found, the stomach pain occured every 6-8 weeks. In May 2004 she consulted her docter again, still suffering from the stomach pains, this time the ultrasound showed bad news. After several MRI, scans and a biopsy she was diagnosed with metastases in her liver and lymphatic system. Non curable, and a life-expectancy of several months up to five years. She was instantly given Femara-tablets (hormones) to slow down the process of spreading. This seemed to help for appr. 8 moths. In March 2005 she started to loose weight rapidly and her condition was getting worse by the day. At the end of April 2005 she started chemotherapy (F.E.C. treatment) throught a drip every two weeks untill the end of August. Eventhougt she felt poorly throughout, the chemo did its job and here condition improved very much. She regained weight and was in good condition. After this treatment she was put on Tamoxifen. This again helped her for 9-10 months, but then had to stop as Tamoxifen didn't do much for her anymore, her tumor-markers went up and her belly started swelling up from the lymph glands again. In august this year she started with Faslodex injections, once every four weeks. She has had two, but after her check-up last week, she was told the Faslodex is not helping her in anyway. And that is it...there is no other treatment for her anymore, or at least, not available in the Netherlands or Europe, apart from chemotherapy which will only be done when she starts deteriorating badly, just to give her a few extra months. She is now not given any medication anymore. At the moment she feels ok and actually is in great condition, still able to do whatever she wants and has no pain and leeds a pretty active life. It is therefor that we are looking for any information abroad on medication or treatment/therapy that not yet available in Europe. In Europe, the US are known as the pioneers in medicines and treatments. Many medicines have been used succesfully for years in the US, before finally making it to Europe. This has something to do with European Law (basically, the US is testing new medicines carefully for years and than, instead of trusting the US testing, European Law requires testing for years again, but now under European Law....) Since the Dutch Cancer Institute is not giving any information on medication used abroad we are seeking help. We are looking for any information or experiences from people in the US who have the same form of cancer metastases. My mother had breastcancer before her menopause and her most recent scan of her bones (august 2006) showed they were clear. She has 3 tumors in her liver (which are operable, but doctors here do not want to do that because of the metastases in her lymphatic system). She is not in any pain, just very tired. Maybe somebody can help us to get some information or names of medication (other than the ones she has already had) or anything? We would be very, very gratefull for any help. We are very aware that there is no cure for her, but are just looking for something to slow down the process and give her a few more good years for the spend with us and especially my two young kids, who adore her! If you need more information, please do not hesitate to email me at: [emailÂ protected] Thank you very much! Nathalie Terol(30)",
