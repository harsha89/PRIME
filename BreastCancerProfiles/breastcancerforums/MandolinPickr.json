    "Content": "Hello! I am 36 and was diagnosed with Stage II breast cancer, no lymph involvement, in early March. I had a lumpectomy with 1 lymph node removed on March 21, my port placed this past Friday, and I am going for my first chemo treatment (of 6, followed by radiation) today. I found the lump myself in January; was incredibly sore before my period, and found a large lump. It went down after I started, so everyone thought it was something inflammatory; even the surgeon was surprised when the needle biopsy came back positive. Both my grandmothers had breast cancer (one had 'mirror' cancer, a lump in each breast in the same place), and my great-grandmother died of breast cancer when she was 38. (That was a long time ago and she refused to even go see a doctor.) So you're not alone! MandolinPickr",
