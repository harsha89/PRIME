      "Content": "HI Mary, I am also looking for words to ease my mind. I am and, have been experiencing extreme wrist pain in Jan/06. I started with Arimidex last Nov.. At my last visit to the Onco. they stated that this pain could be from the medication. They said to stop the Arimidex and the pain should go away in a couple of weeks. It has been a month and I am still in pain. The pain interfers with my daily routines, and personal care. I am relieved to find that I am not the only women that is or has experienced this condition from this drug. I thought I was losing my mind. I was complaining to the doc. they were lifting thier eye-brows...ummm I don't know??? I'm tired of the pain, I am tired of the \"I don't knows..\" I don't know... Good Health to you and to all that read this. Any comments or help would be grateful..
