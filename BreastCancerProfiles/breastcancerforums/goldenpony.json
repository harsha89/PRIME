    "Content": "Hi marym. I took Taxol after a heavy round of chemo and was told that it would be \"a walk in the park\" compared to my other chemo. Boy what a walk! I had severe allergic reactions to 8 of the 12 with one being very serious that required massive antihystimates, decadron to then be given before, during, and after, along with having to have oxygen and caused such pain in my spine that I thought a rod was shoved in it. The good news is that I was one of the very rare examples. The other women that were taking the Taxol regimines had no problems other than some of the mild aches and pains in the joints. Good luck and I hope you do well. From everything I have read on it Taxol is a good treatment.",
