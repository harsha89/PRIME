    "Content": "dr leo, or anyone with experience.. i had left mastectomy 9/2003. reconstruction, tissue expander, exchange surgery with silicone implant. all went reasonably well:,i had dcis,two locations,stage 0, er+ i'm postmenopausal, on arimidex. i've developed axillary, down the underside of the arm pain...both sides. mast side worse than right. i know this is weird but if feels like the glands are being \"squeezed\"-a milder version of the parotid gland with sour food response. to complicate matters, i was dx with MS 10/04. i'm trying to sort out what this could be. my muscle relaxers help little: vicodin works. i'm worried. i go back to the onco 1/12. any ideas? (my thyroid shoud be fine) thanks.",
