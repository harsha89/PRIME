      "Content": "Thank you for the info .To tell you a bit this.I went to my regular doctor for a exam he spotted a lump in my left breast.He then sent me to have a mammogram done this was when something was spotted.The doctor that performed the mammogram requested that a ultra sound be done.Went had this done went back to my docs and requested to speak with a surgeon (due to my family history)he was not wanting me to do this as he felt it was just a B9 cyst.At my insistence he gave in and referred me to Doctor Morey here in Port Huron.Doctor Morey then performed the biopsy herself and that is when i got a call back to come back in due to abnormal cell findings is what i was told . If i had listened to my regular Doctor and not gone it would have been another year of waiting and wondering.I am glad that i stuck to my gut instinct and went forward with seeing the surgeon.I see her in fact later today .Got a call to come in at 1 twenty. Thank you for listening. Leah",

      "Content": "Yes i did go back and see my surgeon again .The fluid biopsy that she did showed some funny cells in my left breast where the bigger cyst are.Tomorrow morning i am scheduled for surgery to go in take this cyst out and see if indeed it is cancerous.She called it a needle biopsy with mammagram help.Basically what i was told is i will be sent down for a ultra sound first that will pinpoint where the cyst is then a thing that looks ind of like a wire will be inserted into where the cyst is taped to hold in place then once it has been pinpointed i will go in for the surgery to have it removed.Said i will be in pain for a few days no heavy lifting . So now it is just a wait and see kind of thing .Hubby took the day off of work to go with me .take care of me afterwards .which i think is sweet of him. Kind regards ,leah Ps how have yoy been doing/",
