      "Content": "Thank you for your response. My tumor markers have been very reliable over the years. Xeloda seemed to be the only thing that brought it down and it even put me into remission for a short period of time. I stayed on it for so long to try to keep the cancer under control, which it seemed to do. My onc told me that staying on chemo for too long of a time can cause other problems (lukemia to be exact), so he recently took me off it, and with the belief that the cancer will come back, he had me talk to the bone marrow transplant doctor as a possible next step. I have faired quite well with all of the treatments I have had, but have become increasingly frustrated with the emotional roller coaster of good news, bad news, take this pill, do that treatment, constant blood tests, scans, blah blah blah. I haven't heard of any new drugs out there for quite some time, so I'm thinking if the bone marrow transplant has a chance of giving me back some type of normal life, I should consider doing it. Thanks for listening. Michelle",

      "Content": "I have seen this site before, but have never posted. I now have a question. I was first diagnosed with BC in 1994 at age 36. Stage II, 2.7 cm, 1 postitive node, had lumpectomy, 6 months CMF, 6 weeks radiation, 5 years tamoxifen. High tumor marker in 2000 resulted in finding of chest wall recurrence. Had excision (4.7 cm), which included ribs, sternum, etc. Then did 5 weeks radiation, still high tumor marker, so more chemo--A/C, then as tumor marker still high, did Xeloda which brought it down and went into remission. About 7 months later, high tumor marker and found spot on my spine. Had Cyberknife and that went away, then recurrence in lung-several small nodules. Did Xeloda again and pet scan came back clear, just elevated tumor marker. Was on Xeloda for at least 1 1/2 years. Dr. just said I had to go off of it because can't stay on chemo that long. Dr. referred me to bone marrow transplant Dr. Talked to him yesterday and he said if it shows up again, I should do the transplant. Thoughts? Michelle",
