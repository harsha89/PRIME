      "Content": "Hi, I am 29 years old and i found a lump in my breast last year i went to get it checked in mexico they sent me to get an ultrasound which was the worst moment of my life just to lay there while the doctor is not saying anything and me just looking at his face waiting for an answer then he finally said that it looked like fibroadenoma and that i had 3 more in my other breast i felt the biggest relief I felt like i was born again lol seriously .....but he said it needed to be removed which i couldn't do because i couldn't afford it . Now I am here in the states and i have decided to go to a breast surgeon to get it checked again but , the fear is back , I am so scared i cant sleep i look at my husband and i feel sadness I am scared that it might b cancer actually i have put in my head that i have cancer i know it sounds crazy but it's the truth. I have 4 sisters and 2 of them have had some kind of problem in their breast s , they had benign lumps and my grandma had the same thing. I'd like to talk to someone about what i feel , i dont like to talk about this with my loved ones because they r gonna get worried ...",
