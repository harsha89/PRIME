      "Content": "Hi, all. I'm new here. I'm 42, premenopausal and was diagnosed with LCIS in Feb. 2009. Within one month, I had a repeat mammo (calcifications found in Rt. breast), stereotactic biopsy, and an excisional biopsy. I saw an oncologist last week and have a decision on how I want to treat this - surveillence, tamoxifen or prophylactic mastectomy. This all has happened so fast. And even though they say it's not cancer, I feel like this is something to be really concerned about. Everyone around me seems to think it's no big deal (or at least that's the impression I'm getting.). The closest relative that has breast cancer in my family is my father's aunt and one of his cousins (his aunt's daughter). My maternal grandfather died of bone cancer, and I was diagnosed with melanoma in 1998 (successfully removed surgically with no complications). I am thinking about going the Tamoxifen route. If anyone wants to give me their two cents worth, I wouldn't mind at all! Thanks!",

      "Content": "Thanks, Cureus, for your information. I am sorry to hear that they let your diagnosis slide until it became cancer. That is inexcuseable! I definitely taking the calcifications seriously. My mom was just diagnosed with breast cx last week, so this obviously changes everything! We should find out today how invasive it is. Keeping my fingers crossed! Good luck to you with your treatment.",
