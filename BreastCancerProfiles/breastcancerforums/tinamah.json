      "Content": "Breast, Macroscopic Specimen Type: Excision Greatest dimension: 4.7 cm Laterality: Right Tumor Site: not specified Breast, Microscopic Size of invasive component: Greatest dimension: 3.8 cm Histologic Type: Invasive ductal carcinoma Histologic Grade: Tubule formation: Minimal less than 10% (score=3) Nuclear pleomorphism: Marked variation in size, nucleoli, chromatin clumping, etc. (score=3) Mitotic count (40x objective): Greater than 10 mitoses per 10 HPF (score=3) Nottingham Grade III: 8-9 points Primary tumor (pt): pt2: Tumor more than 2.0cm but not more than 5.0 cm in greatest dimension Regional Lymph Nodes (pN): pNX: cannot be assessed (previously removed or not removed for pathologic study) Distant Metastasis (M): pMX: Cannot be assessed Margins: Margin(s) involved by invasive carcinoma specify shich margin(s): multifocal Extent of margin involvement for DCIS: Extensive Venous/Lymphatic (large/small vessel) invasion(V/L): indeterminate Microcalcifications: not identified ER/PR: ER/PR studies are being preformed on block(s) A1 of this tissue. HER-2/neu: HER-2/neu studies are being preformed on block(s) A1 of this tissue. Gross Examination Received in formalin labeled right breast mass is a 17.3 gram, 4.7x3.5x2.7 cm porton of fibroadipose tissue. The specimen is unoriented. The specimen is inked blue and sectioned to demonstrate a 3.8x3.0x2.5 cm firm, white-pink mass with ill-defined borders. The mass diffusely abuts the blue-inked margin. Centrally, the mass is soft, yellow and red. The mass occupies the majority of the specimen with only a small amount of surrounding soft yellow adipose tissue. Representative sections of the mass to demonstrate it's relationship to the blue-inked margin are submitted a A1-A3. That is pretty much all of it. I wasn't commpletely sure what to look for. I really appreciate any help I can get to understanding what is going on. I just need to know if I should try and get into surgery next week or if it would be ok to wait another week like I had planned. I know there are thousands of other women out there that are going or have gone thru the same thing and it's not fair to any of them. And I don't mean to be whinny but I am just trying to take care of myself and my family right now. I couldn't find any sticky thing on the page and there was no Leo, sorry I don't know what you are talking about.",

      "Content": "Where do you learn what all this means. All I know is that after two months of finding a painful lump, going through several test finding out I have invasive ductal carcinoma, setting a date to have my whole breast plus lymph nodes lopped off. I still don't even know who is doing the chemo or where. After a week of coming to terms with my diagnoses and saying good bye to my womanly curves. I come onto the internet to try and find some understanding of what went wrong, I feel more lost and alone than I did before.",

      "Content": "What pathology report? What Stage ? I did have a biopsy done, that was how I found out about the cancer. I did see what he cut out and it was like a slightly flattened pool ball. He told me a week later that he didn't take it all out. He did say that it wasn't under my arm, but that he was going to take my lymph nodes out. Why? I am the one that set the date and he said it was fine. We have recently moved into a new house. I have 2 children, one I homeschool. Right after the doctor gave me the wonderful news he looks at the calendar and asks, \"when do you want to do the surgery?\" I was numb, I felt like I was in a dream, I was having an out of body experience. I turned to my husband and told him to wake me up I was in a dream and I wanted out. So I set a date that I thought would give me time to pull myself together and come to grips with what had happened. I wanted to find out as much info as I could and get my family set and organized for the weeks ahead. A friend and neighbor told me it was months before she could get in. But my family (mother, sisters etc..) acts like I'm a fool. I also had a needle biopsy done a month before the biopsy but it was inconclusive. I can advance the appointment if I want to. But thats my question, what would 2 weeks matter? From what I have read this thing has been growing for years. So what is two weeks? But I will tell you this it wasn't there Saturday and then there it was Tuesday. My husband loves me inside and out. He loved me in high school when I was skinny and now after 2 kids and a thyroid disorder. And no matter my size I have always had a rack on me, and my husband is a boobman.",

      "Content": "My upper arm is 3 inches bigger than the other. My armpit is so swollen I cannot put my arm down all of the way. My surgery was on the 21st of August. There were complications, the surgeon missed a blood vessel and had to go back in later after I started blacking out and my blood pressure got so low it couldn't be read. Out of 17 nodes 1 was positive for cancer. No I don't know which one. I saw the surgeon this last Wednsday and asked him about it my arm and pit area. He was no help and another doctor told me it could be fixed, he would cut off the excess skin. WHAT? I do have these drainage port things, I will have them till the 5th I think. But I am not noticing any difference.",
