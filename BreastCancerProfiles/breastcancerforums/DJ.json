    "Content": "I'm 47.. will be 48 exactly on the day of round #4 of A/C, and just finished round #2 of my chemotherapy. I started my period (normal) the week before my first treatment, and got it exactly 28 days later (normal). My oncologist told me I would go into menopause too so I'm prepared either way. I still have a total of six treatments to go.. two of the A/C and 4 Taxoterre.",
