      "Content": "Feb 2000 my wife was diagnosed with BC, stage 2 (6 lymph nodes). Surgery/Chemo/Radiation all OK for two years until a scare: A blip on a bone scan sent everyone running but it turned out to be arthritis (CAT scan showed no cancer). The scare caused her onc to change her med from tamox to femara and he didn't switch back after the CAT scan showed no reason to worry. Now my wife has finished 5 years of Femara and she's so ready to be done with it. The feelings of old-age before her time, pains moving around her body (first the right thigh for 5-6 months, now gone, then in the feet, now in her right hip..all elusively hard to pin down), lack of appetite, etc. The pains are alleviated through Alleve and the like but she's taken so much her stomach can't really take any more and so we're looking for a better way to alleve the achy symptoms, namely getting off femara. We've changed oncologist and our meeting with the new onc is in January. Not too far away but she's ready to toss the Femara. Anyone know what the protocol is these days? I'm sure it changes depending on the severity of one's case but I thought originally it was 5 years Tamox., then 5 years of Femara. We're thinking of a preemptive strike-- get off femara now and see what the onc says in January. If she wants to continue with the medication we can ask for alternatives. thoughts?",
