      "Content": "Hi I am new here. I have questions about Arimidex. I have been taking it for about a year, after having taken Tamoxafin for about 4 months. I have very sore joints - especially my feet, ankles, knees and hands. Are there any other aromatase inhibitors that don't have these side effects? Does anyone take any other meds for the side effects?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by MomG Hi PinkGirl! I was on Arimidex last year & had to take five meds for the side effects...I too had joint pain, also food wouldn't digest..threw it up, couldn't have a BM, had blurry vision, ended up in hospital for my kidneys. Dr tried me on another one but it did the same thing....Everyone's body is different, so I suggest you discuss it with your Onc. & see what he says about trying other meds. Some people can tolorate one thing, when others can't. My onc. thoght it best I come off all the meds, as I couldn't tolorate them and since I'm not at high risk , I am much better now...Keep us posted as how you are doing & what your onc. tells you. Thanks MomG I'll be seeing my onc. on Aug. 1 and will ask him. I think I have to stay on it because I am high risk. I am stage 2A, estrogen +, and her2 ++++++ ( They called it her2 prolific !!! ) I am hoping there is another similar drug that doesn't give me the joint pain. I also have fatigue and weight gain but I don't know if that is from the Arimidex. Thanks for your input.",
