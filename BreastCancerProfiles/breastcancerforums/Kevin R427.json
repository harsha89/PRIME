    "Content": "Hey everyone, my wife was diagnosed last Thursday with breast cancer. We have an appointment tomorrow to see an oncologist. Any advice on questions to ask or lifestyle changes to immediately make would be welcomed. Also is anyone familiar with using a Ketogenic diet as a means of combating additional growth and metastasis? Is there any medical studies showing benefit or is it snake oil? Thank you all!",
