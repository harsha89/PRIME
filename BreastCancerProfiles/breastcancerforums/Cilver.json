      "Content": "I just had a Bilateral Thursday the 14th. My left was invasive ductal carcinoma and my right was optional, however came up precancer in biopsy. Thank God for instincts. My nodes were not effected despite the large size of the 2 inch toumour. I have tissue expanders in both breast sites. It conserns me that there is so little information on the recovery and what to expect. I feel like a boa constictor is wrapped around me and I wish I had some ionfo for the range of normal recovery pain and discomfort. Any experience or gooks books on the matter ? Is there a spell check on this site ? My spelling is so poor.",

      "Content": "Thank You. My surgery was only about 10 days ago. I don't need radiation as the cancer was only in the breast. I'm no where near fully filled and see my PS next Monday. The tightness bothers me. When I sleep it gets worce and when I do my exercises it really gets worce. I just wonder if it's normal or not. I'm very muscular by nature and I guess I worry that my musles are non compliant with the efforts of the expanders. I expected a little relief by now. It's really hard to say since I can't find any info on what to expect after surgery. Cilver",
