    "Content": "Hello, My name is Wendy. I had Stage II grade B breast cancer with chemo - no radiation as I had only 2 lymph nodes involved. I had a bilateral mastectomy with tram flap muscle used with reconstruction. I had ductal carcinoma in situ and I was ER/PR positive. I started Tamoxifen in March of 2006. It is now November of 2009 and I really want to stop taking this as my hair is falling out amongst other side effects not seen etc. I wanted to know if there are others who have decided to quit and why? Also I am currently 48 and was actually diagnosed at age 43 and I was not in menopause at the time. So I do not know if I would be in menopause by now naturally. But my main question are there women who have read my post who have quit tamoxifen, and not gone on any other drug after this for only 3 years. Thanks very much, in advance, for your replies.",
