      "Content": "Hi JAW, Welcome to the forums. I do not know anything about breast cancer, although one of my aunts had breast cancer. I did find a link from the American Cancer Society which might shed a little light on the subject. I hope this helps and I will say a pray for you this morning for successful treatments. http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/co..._Returning.asp",

He has been my anchor, and my strength. I will be believing for her fast recovery, and for successful treatment! Rhonda",

      "Content": "Hi ladybug01: I am sorry to hear about your aunt. I felt a need to do some heavy editing on my original post, because I got confused on the origin of your aunt's cancer . I hope I didn't confuse you with my lack of knowledge on the subject (I do not know if you already read my original post). Sorry--she is dealing with metastasized breast cancer as Jim mentions below. I will continue to keep her in my prayers.",

      "Content": "Hi mintjulip, I am sorry about what is happening to your mother and and I know this must be a very trying time for you. It can be a real struggle in making a decision on such a dilemma like you were faced with; but I think its good to be with your mother during this time. There is certainly no easy to answer to these things. I lost my aunt to breast cancer, it was diagnosed about five months after she had a mammogram. My heart really goes out to you, and you and your mom are in my thoughts and prayers.",

I know of a lady who was diagnosed with Stage 4 going on years after her diagnosis. I am sure you and your mom know more now when you first wrote here. My prayers are with you both this morning.",
