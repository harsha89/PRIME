I've read on the net and heard that radiation can be difficult but that did not seem to be your case. Thanks again. L",

      "Content": "HI. New to the boards.... I was diagnosed on Wednesday with DCIS. I am 41, pre-menopasol and never would have predicted this. My lumpecomy is scheduled for July 28th. What type of pain or discomfort should I expect? If all goes well, I go for radiation for 6-8 weeks thereafter. What should I expect from the radiation? Doc says I'll get a sunburn. Net says I will lose my appetite. Will I be tired? HOw tired? Thank you in advance.",
