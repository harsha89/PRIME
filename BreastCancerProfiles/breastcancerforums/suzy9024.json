    "Content": "Hi all im new to this forum and would welcome your advice. My precious Mum has had an awful 5 years firstly she was diagnosed with M MMT uterine cancer and had radicsl surgery to remove everything inc cervix and lymph nodes it was all contained and stage 1 so had no further treatmentsge then had an op for hernia as bowel was protruding through muscle wall. Just over 2 years ago a routine mammogram found a lump which was breast cancer so she had lumpectomy followed by radiotherapy it was also graded as stage 1 . She has made a slow process but us now well but had a routine MRI scan last week and was called in to see her consultant who told her the scan showed some enlarged lymph nodes above her pelvis somewhere one which is pressing on an artery so to avoid blood clot she has to inject herself daily. They are arranging a ct scan asap but fear there are secondary cancers somewhere, the scan of her pelvis area showed nothing else but was only that area they scanned. The lymph nodes tested ehen she had her breast surgery were clear. we are absolutely terrified that it has returned. Any advice would be great thanks",
