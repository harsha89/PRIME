    "Content": "Hi All, My mother was diagnosed this week with invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. She is 62 yrs old. We are considering a few surgeons in the Bay area. Could you please provide feedback on your experiences with any of the following surgeons? 1. Dr. C Denise Ching (PAMF) 2. Dr. Randolph W.Y. Wong (PAMF) 3. Dr. Frederick Dirbas (Stanford) Your advice/ feedback would be invaluable as we embark on the journey to cure my mother. Thank you so much and God Bless! FighterMom",
