I have had the excisional biopsy, and it really was not too bad a procedure. The healing takes a couple of days, and I can barely find the scar from the one breast that had just the biopsy. It is probably a good thing that you won't have to wait long for your procedure. Waiting breeds anxiety! ANd soon, you will have the biopsy results which more than likely will be BENIGN (YAY!!!) It's good to know for sure and not be left to wait and watch and worry. Take good care, and please let us know how it goes! Bethany",

      "Content": "Hi MSN!! Here's a link to a website that will answer many of your questions: www.imaginis.com. Read Evaluating a Breast Lump http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/lump.asp as well as the section on Breast Biopsy http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/biopsy/. Your doctor is recommending an Excisional Biopsy. You might ask why he is making this recommendation instead of a stereotactic core biopsy (which is less invasive and doesn't require general anesthesia). If you're not satisfied with his response, by all means seek a second opinion. I had an excisional biopsy but my BIRADS were 5...highly suspicious. And yes, it was cancer. For that surgery they used an anesthesia that caused a twilite sleep, Versed. I would also ask him/her why use GA and not Versed?? Here's a link to Understanding Mammography Report: http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth...ram_report.asp And a link about BIRADS ratings http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/acrbi.asp I think if you read some of these links you'll have a better understanding and can make a decision about whether to have the excision al bx or go for a less invasive one. If the masses are fibroadenomas, I don't think it is necessary they be removed. Regardless, I believe it's necessary to have a biopsy of some sort and not wait 3-6 months. A biopsy is the ONLY way to be 100% certain the lumps are BENIGN! It sounds likely that they will be B-9!! Hope this is helpful, please post again and let us know that happens!! Bethany",

      "Content": "Hi Julie! Try not to panic yet. 80% of breast lumps turn out to be benign (not cancer). Here is very reliable web page that describes benign breast conditions: http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/menu-benign.asp I visited the web page you referenced. I have never heard of, or visited this web page before. Also, they do not say who put this info together which makes me less than confident in their accuracy. It lists risk factors that cause cancer. This is not exactly true. Nobody knows for certain what CAUSES breast cancer. Many RISK factors have been identified, but they are not CAUSES of cancer, just risk factors that MAY increase your chances of getting breast cancer. I personally know people with many of these IDed risk factors who have never had cancer. I also know many people who do NOT have any of these risk factors and DO get breast cancer. I am glad you are going to have a mammogram. If there is palpable lump you might want to have a needle biopsy just to be certain. Mammograms are not 100% accurate in diagnosing cancer. Hope your lumps turns out to be one of the 80% that are benign!!! Remember, that's a pretty high statistic!! Take care, and please come back and let us know what your tests show!",

      "Content": "Hi Melissa!! Sorry you haven't had many responses to your query, and the one response you had was from a rude, perhaps sick, individual. I didn't respond because I had a lumpectomy only. I have a number of friends who had reconstruction with saline. This was about 6 years ago, and I don't think that silicone was being used widely again at that time. I think there is still a risk of leakage from silicone, and I think that it can still cause medical problems. Of course, that is just my thoughts, and gut feeling. Some recent research show that there is no evidence of this risk. My friends with Saline are happy with their decision. Unfortunately neither implant will give you the sensation of your breast. Nipples hold the nerve ending for sensation, and they were removed during the mastectomy. You might try contacting the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization. 1-800-221-2141. www.y-me.org. They have a wealth of information and you can speak with a trained breast cancer counselor who is also a survivor. They can even connect you with trained peer counselors who have had reconstruction and had to make the same decision as you are facing. This hotline number is available 24 hours a day, and translation services in over 150 languages are available. Good luck with your decision. I wish I could offer more insight! Blessings, Bethany",

And from there you can click on the Rocky Mountain affiliate for details about the walk. Congrats on finishing up chemo!!! Radiation is no fun, but is doable and in some ways easier than chemo. I got very fatigued, and unfortunately I was one of the few who end up with a bad burn. I'm glad you found a good place to go for detox and rejuvenation after treatment ends!

I live near you, and have heard that this clinic (doctor) is well known in Colorado naturopathic circles as the naturopath to go to if you have cancer. www.denvernaturopathic.com He's got a lot of info on his web page as well.

      "Content": "Hi Reece! I'm glad your doctors are being thorough, and checking into your lump. It may be hard to tell on mammogram since at age 23 breasts are very dense, and the pictures aren't as good. My favorite website for easy to understand breast cancer info is www.imaginis.com. Especially check out Evaluating a Breast Lump: http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/lump.asp Remember that 80% of breast lumps turn out to be benign. Also, at your age it is more likely to be benign than cancer. (but don't let the doctors tell you that you are too young for cancer!) Just to be sure, you might ask your doctor to perform a fine needle aspiration biopsy. This is a very easy test where a doctor uses a very small needle to extract some breast tissue. If it is a cyst, fluid will come out, and if it is solid a pathology report can determine the nature of the tissue which was removed. I hope you don't freak out too much in the next two weeks. Try not to freak out until you know that your lump is cancer or not. And even then, most breast cancer is can be treated successfully and is not a death sentence! It's been six years for me! Please post again, and let us know what the doctors say!!!",

Also many of the treatments at CTCA are not covered by insurance and are very expensive. Your gut feeling was that the center you visited was trying to \"sell\" you something. Throughout my treatment, and my dad's treatment fpr cancer, I never had that feeling about the medical professionals I met. I always felt they were more focused on trying to treat my cancer in the best way possible. (Pay attention to your gut feelings and combine it with your research about cancer treatments to help your mom make her decision) Watch out for therapies offering big promises which have no scientific basis, and are based on very subjective anecdotal stories. Quackwatch has information about some of these treatments and claims: http://www.quackwatch.org/00AboutQua...h/altseek.html and how to determine for yourself if a treatment is \"quackery\". My opinion is that the best chance is offered by a comprehensive cancer center... The National Cancer Institute has this list of comprehensive cancer centers listed by state: http://www3.cancer.gov/cancercenters/centerslist.html Take care, my thoughts are with you and your family during this challenging time.

      "Content": "<<the code is BI-RADS: 4 Suspicious Abnormality. So it sounds like it will be b9--at least the odds are good. I think what worried me is the fact so many more appeared between 2004-and now. Thank you for the explanation of the biopsies. I was wondering if it would be a FNA or what and what was the best one for calcifications. It was so nice of you to reply to me. {{HUGS}} I am SO happy to hear you are doing so well after 6 years. More {{HUGS}}>> Hi Suzi! I'm glad the links I posted were helpful. BI-RADS 4 is very hopeful!!! FNA is usually not recommended with microcalcifications, it's easy to miss them with the FNA!! Thanks for the {{{HUGS}}} Hugs are always a good thing! Please post again and let us know how things are going for you!! Hugs & Many Blessings, Bethany",

      "Content": "Hi! Sorry you have to join the club no one wants to join Here's my story. I was diagnosed with: Stage 1, 1.8 cm IDC & DCIS, 0 nodes, ER/PR +, and lymphatic invasion. My cancer was grade 2 (not slow-growing, not fast growing either). I spoke with 2 oncologists, and both felt that chemo was indicated for 3 reasons 1) my age (39) 2) tumor size (between 1 and 2 cm is a grey area for chemo) 3) lymphatic invasion If a cancer cell had gotten into the lymph stream (or in your case the blood stream) it could have travelled to a distant area in the body. Since radiation and surgery only treat the cancer locally, and systemic treatment like chemo was recommended. Since you are ER/PR negative you would not have any benefit from systemic hormone treatments like tamoxifen. And since you are HER2 negative you would not be helped by systemic treatment with herceptin. So, I am guessing your doctor's recommendations for treatment will depend on a few factors 1) how aggressive is the cancer , what grade? 2) your age (altho with ER/PR - that may not be a big factor 3) the vascular invasion 4) how aggressively you want to treat the cancer Because you're in the grey zone, you might want to get two opinions from oncologists. And if possible have one opinion be from an oncologist who specializes in breast cancer. In my personal (not professional) opinion, it's best to treat the cancer more aggressively at the time of original diagnosis rather than waiting to see if it returns and then treating it aggressively. I can only speak from my experience, but I have no regrets about the decision to have chemo. I did not have a lot of horrible side effects from the chemo. I actually looked kinda cute bald!!! It wasn't fun, but it was doable. The chemo did not put me into menopause (that can be either good or bad....) And here I am six years later, and there has been no more evidence of cancer to date! That's the best part! Good luck with your appts and decision making. You're actually going through one of the toughest parts of the cancer process now...the uncertainty of not having a treatment plan. Soon you will have all the info you need and a decision will be made! Take care, let us know what happens, and please let me know if I can answer any questions for you!",

      "Content": "Hello!! Sorry you are going through this stressul diagnostic time. I am glad you're getting a biopsy. If calcifications are arranged in a certain pattern (often in a cluster or spiderweb appearance) the radiologist will say that it looks suspicious of malignancy (cancer). Being \"suspicious of malignancy does not mean that it is cancer. It just means that a biopsy will help determine if it is or is not cancer. This web page explains the diagnostic mammogram http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/abnormalities.asp and this one explains the BI-RADS rating, http://www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/acrbi.asp The only way to know if it's benign (which we hope for!) or malignant is to have a biopsy. There are two kinds which are usually used... one is an excisional biopsy where they surgically remove the suspicious breast tissue. Sometimes this is done with a wire insertion to mark the exact area and confirm it with mammorgrapy before the surgery. Another biopsy is a core biopsy. This procedure involves a radiologist instead of a surgeon. They numb your breast, and use mamography to identify the suspicious tissue and then use a core (wide) needle to extract samples to be biopsied. Both these procedures are explained in depth on this website: www.imaginis.com/breasthealth/biopsy/ I hope you get answers quickly!! Hoping for B-9, but if it is cancer, it's not a death sentence!! Many breast cancers are treatable, and the treatment is do-able!! I'm here six years later to tell you this!!! Take care!!!!",
