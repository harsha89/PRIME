    "Content": "Yes, both my parents have had/have breast cancer. My mom had hers about 20 years ago. She had a mastectomy, chemo, and has been cancer-free since. She is now 80. My dad is 82 and was diagnosed a little over a year ago. He also had a mastectomy, chemo, radiation. His has spread to his lymph nodes. I have three sisters. Needless to say, we all have to go through more testing than normal. I am wondering if there is anyone else here that has had BOTH their parents with breast cancer?",
