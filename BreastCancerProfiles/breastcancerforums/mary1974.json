      "Content": "I am 37 and during my annual a couple weeks ago the doctor found a 3 cm mass in the right breast. I've had two breast reductions in my lifetime one in 1990 one around 2001. I personally noticed a change in my left breast over the last year or so but did not notice what he found on the right. I had a mammo, they found something on the right and the left (the left was the spot I noticed that changed too which I had forgotten to mention to my dr.) I got called back the next day for a diagnostic mammo and an ultra sound. The doctor called me the same day after those tests and said I needed to see a oncology surgeon as they think it might be a lymph node on the left and there was a distortion on the right. I do understand that the only way to identify cancer is to biopsy but I have heard other women get to a clean bill of health after they do the ultrasound and what not. As I'm standing there this morning brushing my teeth it dawned on me, they are sending me to a \"surgeon\" does this mean they are already planning on removing something or know something needs removed or is there a chance the surgeon could just identify these things by looking at the results of the mammo/ ultrasound? It hit me like a ton of bricks that oh my god they already know what it is and now just need proof. Would the radiologist be able to indentify maybe scar tissue or something from my breast reductions years ago?? I mean wouldn't they know what that looked like without going in there or is it possible that it is really just something from the reductions and if so why is it just now being noticed about 11 years later? What bothers me is that I've been under the weather for the past couple months sore red throat, head aches, dizzyness, tired all the time and antibiotics wouldn't help and blood work showed nothing. Also, my little dog the past year or less has been nosing and at and trying to sniff that strange spot on my left breast since I noticed the change (thickening). I've heard animals can detect things, sounds wierd I know but I'm getting kind of worried. I have no breast cancer in my family but i do have other cancers. Also I have had two strange dark skin areas form on both nipples that I have to see a derm about in 2 weeks two that my gyn said might be skin cancer. Can you tell me if this could just be scar/glandular tissue left over from my breast reduction or would they identify that by the ultra sound and diagnostic mammo? I see the surgeon in 3 days and wondering what I should be prepared for if anything?",
