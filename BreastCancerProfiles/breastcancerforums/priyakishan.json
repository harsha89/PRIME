    "Content": "Hi, My mom recently had a MRM(mastectomy-left breast) aged 61 years at hyderabad Diabetic and hypertension. and the biposy result was normal. then the doc suggested ER & PR and HER-2 tests. where the first two were positive and the HER-2 is negative. Then the doc(or same surgeon) suggested for radiation and chemo. He said everything is fine, but to avoid any dangers in future--you need to take these. Is this proper? or should I consult other doc for a second opinion. from what I read(I know this online knowledge is not complete)--based on these three tests--may be we can go for hormonal treatment...little worried abt chemo & radiation",
