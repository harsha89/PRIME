    "Content": "I know you probably get this tons of times... but I am very worried. This morning I found a long bumpy rash on my breast, I didn't worry to much we have tons of spider and fleas in the house. However about 16 hours later, it has gotten larger(it is about 2 inches wide and about 1 inch long) It's very itchy, the skin underneath is bright red and the bumps are purple. It's much warmer then the rest of my breast. I feel stupid, I'm only 21, but I had skin cancer before and I worry very much. This rash is on the breast that still has lymphnoids, my right breast along the outside. As far as inveroted nipples go, i've had those all my life so it's not a symptom for me. Someone please tell me if I should worry, or if I should wait to see what happens, as it stands unless the rash is gone by monday i was planning on making an appointment.",
