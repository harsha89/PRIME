      "Content": "Hello Roberta, The advice that Nancy gave is 'right on'. Beware of surgeons, all they want to do is CUT. Do your homework thoroughly and demand answers to your questions in language YOU understand. When I was going through my 'wild goose chase' my sister went with me to every appointment with every doc....and trust me, there were MANY. She took notes on everything that was discussed. I kept a journal myself during this difficult and stressful time. I have a folder about a foot thick with all the stuff that related to my journey with breast cancer. Make an informed decision that is right for YOU, not your insurance company or your docs. Feel free to email me. Love and hugs, Laura",

      "Content": "Hello all, I've just discovered this webpage and can't tell you how refreshing it is to see proactive women (and men) who have something informative to share. Keep up the important dialogue, I will be reading and toss something in if there is a possibility that it will be of benefit. My particular interest is reconstruction and my experience with an unwilling medical group to provide me with me with what I chose. I did a lot of digging and was fortunate to have a 'medical team' of my own, who both know and love me. Respectfully, Laura Smith",
