      "Content": "Marybeth - I am new around this board, but not new to breast cancer or the BC boards. I have recently had to take a \"vacation\" from chemo and last week did not get Herceptin due to a drop in my MUGA rating. I get the MUGA every three months. I do believe that you can go back to Herceptin after your heart has taken a little break and gotten stronger again. You need to sit down with your onc and discuss your fears and ask what lies ahead. My onc and I talk every three weeks and make new plans as we go along. I never know whats coming next. I was scared like you when I saw the drop in the rating, but have decided to loose the extra weight I gained from Tamoxifen, Decadron, comfort eating and last weeks cruise to Bermuda. I am also taking CoEnzyme 10 (talk to your doctor first before taking anything) and walking. Adriomycin does kick butt, but time will heal it and then maybe you can go back on Herceptin. Good luck and God bless",

      "Content": "I have heard of people getting Herceptin up to a year after treatment. Yes, sometimes things shock us and when we take a breath, we realize it is not as bad as it first sounded. It took a little while after AC/T to recoup. It is a hard treatment - you need time to heal. Several months after finishing AC/T, rads and the MRM, I went back to college full time, worked part time and raised my two kids (and my dog) on my own. You will be just fine after a little r-n-r. Once again, talk to your onc. I am sure she/he will do the right thing for you.",

The hurricane was horrible enough, but can you imagine just being told you have BC then being hit with Katrina? God bless all affected.",

      "Content": "What Nancy writes is true. You are going by stats that are five years old and everyone is different. I am five and a half years out from my original diagnosis. I have Inflammatory Breast cancer - which is the worst of the worst of all BC's. Originally diagnosed at stage IV, according to the stats, I should not be here. This past fall, the BC spread to my lungs and my liver. That should have been the end of me, but I am still here going strong and in remission. And like Nancy, I have NO plans of going anywhere anytime soon!! To look at me and to talk to me, you would not know that according to the stats, I should not be here. You are heading off in to the wild blue yonder by ending treatments. It is a scary thing and it's okay to be paranoid (canceritis). It takes a very long time for it to subside - if it ever truly does. You will continue to have periodic check ups. Stay diligent in your own care. If something doesn't feel right, call. Who cares if they think your being paranoid. Stay positive! Good luck and God bless....",
