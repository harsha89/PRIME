      "Content": "I went to visit my Mom yesterday and things are pretty much the same. She did seem to be a lot calmer (best word to use I guess?) with much less moving around.......in bed, then in a chair and back and forth. Her mental capacity is going slowly and she seemed to be staring with her eyes wide open. I couldn't tell if she was understanding what was being said but she's awfully good at fooling people. Years of practice I believe. Any comments on these latest developments. E",

      "Content": "Thanks, Vee. I'm not even sure it's guilt I feel but I just ready for her to go to what I'm sure is a better place. I think both my brothers feel the same at this point. We go from thinking she's at the end one morning and that afternoon, she's rallys yet again. We also have to deal with our stepfather who is not a bad person but at 87, he can be very difficult to deal with. And of course he's losing his companion of 24 years and facing an uncertain future without her. Just venting at this point, not much else to do right now. E",

      "Content": "Thanks for your note. Things are getting worse and worse. I'm now at the point of praying for her to pass away or at the very least lapse into a coma so she won't be aware of what's happening all the time. One of my brothers had a hugh blow up with our stepfather and tried to get him to move out of the house. He's decided to stay which will keep the stress levels at all time highs. I'm sure this kind of thing happens in all families but it seems that our efforts are being sidetracked from where they should be and that is on my Mom. Keep us in your prayers and thoughts.

At this point I am sad to see her so ill (although not in much pain) and my thoughts that it would be better for her at this point for the end to come sooner rather than later.

      "Content": "After battling breast cancer off and on for almost 23 years, my mother is reaching the end of this ordeal. The cancer spread about 8 years ago to her bones and then to her lungs, liver, kidneys and lymph nodes and still she goes on somehow. She has for all means and purposes stopped eating much of anything and I am now concerned that she may well die of malnutrition instead of the cancer. She is very weak almost to the point of being unable to walk and is on oxygen most of the time. The latest development is sleep walking which is something she has never done. Is this odd or to be expected? She has sitters all night but she's gotten up several times on her own and if she falls with bone cancer who knows what will happen. She has also started showing \"purple\" nails on her big toes. Any comments on that? One of the hospice people mentioned something about that but I have forgotten what she said. Thanks for any advice and your comments. E",
