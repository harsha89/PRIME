      "Content": "Hello everyone, I'll try to make this short, I usually ramble on. I'm on my 3rd month of Bioidentical Hormone cream, And have recently noticed a milky substance (I did breastfeed 5 yrs ago) and some pain and lumpiness, under my arm area. I Don't know if that's the lymph nodes or not. I am 40 yrs old and have 4 children. My Breast Appt isn't until next week, so I'm just Curious if anyone else has encountered an Experience similiarly. Thanks in advance.",

      "Content": "Thank you, Didee. I hope you are doing well. It's a little more of an elevated concern for me due to my Great Aunt passing from Breast Cancer, my Daddy has Prostate Cancer and my Mom has Just had surgery to remove some cancerous cells From one of her breasts. My Grandmother also Passed from lung cancer. I had a \"complicated\" cyst on my ovary, part solid and part fluid, had Surgery in June of this year to remove the cyst Fallopian tube, cervix and Uterus. I had been bleeding For 20 days straight prior to the surgery. That's how They knew something was wrong. They said my hormones were out of whack, in Addition to having Fibroid tumors. I also have Fibrocystic Breast \"changes.\" which is Inherited. I'm just a big mess at 40 yrs old. *sigh* The cyst ended up not being malignant, per the ultrasound Previous to the surgery, they said they couldn't rule Out Malignancy until it was biopsied or removed.",
