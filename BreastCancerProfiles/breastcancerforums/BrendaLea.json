      "Content": "Hi, I am new to this site. I have stage 1 breast cancer, 2cm, Invasive Ductal Carcinoma, Estrogen Pos. I am on tomoxifen for 5 years and yesterday, I did 22nd of my 38 radiation therapy treatments. I am not handling the radiation very well at all, or I should say, my skin isn't. It's very red, blistered and swollen. Is anyone going through this as well? I am trying everything my RO is telling to try, but it still stings quite a bit. Does your skin ever return to \"normal\"?",

My surgeon came in and told me it came back positive and that I had breast cancer. It was like I was in a hollow room, I couldn't hear what he was saying, good thing my husband was with me. I was trying to be brave for everyone, but as we walked out of the room to schedule the surgery, I just broke down and cryed. In May I started taking tomoxifen and on the 9th, the radiation therapy treatments of which, I have to have 38. We can hold each others hands going through this horrible stuff! I'm always here for you!",
