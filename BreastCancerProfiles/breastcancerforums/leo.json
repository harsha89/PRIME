      "Content": "Hello You pose a very interesting question, which is being looked into by many research folks. The quick answer is: we don't know how tumors will behave. We all know that some are more aggressive than others, and also know some markers of which ones can be more aggressive: poorly differentiated, ER/PR negative, HER2 etc. Also it seems that after getting chemotherapy, the recurrence is usually more aggressive, and also resistant to the previously given chemotherapy. Another thing is that after a tumor is metastatic, the biology of the tumor is different: once it is able to travel through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system it has then shown how aggressive it can be. So there are a lot of reasons for the recurrences to grow faster, but in the end we don't really know which tumors have a higher potential for recurrence. regards, Leo",

I'd have to call the pathologist and ask him what that exactly means. But by definition LCIS is in situ i.e. *no* invasion of the ductal lining. What cancerization of lobules means is that a *ductal* cancer extended into the lobular area. That does not mean it is a lobular tumor, it is just the DCIS growing into the lobule. It is only a finding, and does not make it invasive. best regards, Leo",

You can suppress the estrogen production by removing the ovaries (oophorectomy) or by using medications. The first-line seems to be by using medications such as tamoxifen, but some people just can not tolerate it, and some may just opt to have the ovaries taken out. It is a personal and difficult choice. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Dear Francis, Thanks for posting. Here are my thoughts on your questions: 1. What other tests should we do at this time? None, it seems they've all been done. 2. Is not doing chemo an option? I don't think so. For tumors this size and stage, chemo is indicated. 3. What benefit do we get from chemo as opposed to mastectomy w/o chemo? The statistics are hard to pin down. What recurrence or survival benefit does she get by having chemo for this type of cancer? It is hard to predict what is best because the disease is not fully staged yet. Without knowing if sentinel lymphnodes or axillary lymphnodes are affected, a full treatment plan can not be outlined. 4. How quickly should we move to surgery or chemo? Initiating therapy should be done soon, but not necessarily in an unrgent type of situation. Think about it, discuss with other people. I would say don't wait for more than a couple of weeks. 5. Can a mastectomy be safely done given the 1 cm distance from the prepectoral fascia? Does this argue for neoadjuvant treatment to shrinh the tumopr before surgery? Yes, surgeons are very skilled at doing this. If she receives neoadjuvant therapy it could shrink it some and make the procedure easier. 5. Anything else I should be thinking about? Seems like you're doing an excellent job. Find a good doctor that you both trust and move on. best of luck Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Tumor markers are tools that have to used cautiously. Like Nancy said, it is great to have a \"baseline\", so the optimal approach is to get one at the time of diagnosis, see what happens after surgery, then follow it. If they were high before treatment and became normal, great, you have a good marker of recurrence. Otherwise it's of no use. Your doctor is assuming your 16 was your baseline, and if it is rising it may be your breast cancer. But it can be other things as well. From a website: CA 27-29 levels can also be elevated by cancers of the colon, stomach, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and liver. First trimester pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, benign breast disease, kidney disease, and liver disease are noncancerous conditions that can also elevate CA 27-29 levels. So there is no way to know what is causing its rise since you do not have one before treatment. But it is certainly worrysome that it is rising to these numbers. I am sure your oncologist is on top of it. best regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Janie As you know, pathologists have their own terms. Personally I don't think that pathological details play a big role in survival. That's why the clinical stages were invented. To guide treatment and somehow categorize groups of patients in survival groups. That allows us to compare groups of patients with the same disease and different methods of treatment. I'd advise to try to not be to detailed about your labs, tests and reports. Leave that for the physicians who do that on a regular basis. I think that this may just bring more anxiety into context. It's like when you go to the machanic and ask him to explain exactly how he replaced part X, which parts had to be taken out of the way etc. In the end, what you really want to know is: which part was broken, how was it fixed in general terms, and how much it costs, if it may happen again and so forth. You see, cancer is such a difficult disease to deal with, in my consultations I'd rather spend more time discussing how the patient and physician can work together to fight the disease, instead of explaining very difficult concepts that may not be of use at all to the patient. Again, thanks for your support. You can let all your friends know about this. I'll be here regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Barbara Thanks for your kind comments. As you mentioned, it seems your doctor is on top of it. UPMC is really a great institution. Anyway, most studies don't go beyond 5 years, as it is extremely expensive to fund it. So there will probably be little data in the future beyond 5 years. As these studies end, there will of course be open-label studies of people that choose to continue the treatment, and this will be analyzed but the data won't be nearly as good as the well designed studies. As of now, there is really no data showing that people should be on Arimidex for longer than 5 years. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Dear Annie, You have an extremely common question. The question of more aggressive surgery versus breast-conserving treatment and radiation is something that is quite difficult to answer. There is no wrong answer. It seems that it is primarily a personal choice. Radiation damage is unfortunately permanent. Some of it tends to improve, like swelling and skin problems, but the microvascular changes are permanent. So you do have a chance of an infection, but it is not guaranteed to happen at all. Many people to breast implants in irradiated breast, but this is all a risk/benefit ratio. The risks of the surgery are there, as are the risks of radiation and implants. The best thing to do is really talk to your doctor. Certainly the input from other forum members can be important as well. good luck Leo",

      "Content": "Hi \"Confused\" It took me a while to answer, but I am here Your pathology report really looks good. What we look for are obvisouly cancerous cells, but also pre-cancerous changes, such as atypical hyperplasia. This would be a read flag, and the pathologist states that he did not see any of that. Adenosis means an excess of gland in that particular area. Microcalcifications are certainly a radiological red-flag, but it's not always cancerous, as in your case. Honestly I don't see anything concerning for malignancy, but if you have doubts and would like to have an excisional biopsy (to take the whole nodule out) it would not be unusual. If it bothers you I think you should talk to your doctor. Another option is to have your biopsy read by another pathologist. You can request your paraffin blocks, slides and reports and have it sent to another institution. regards, Leo",

I'd have to call the pathologist and ask him what that exactly means. But by definition LCIS is in situ i.e. *no* invasion of the ductal lining. What cancerization of lobules means is that a *ductal* cancer extended into the lobular area. That does not mean it is a lobular tumor, it is just the DCIS growing into the lobule. It is only a finding, and does not make it invasive. best regards, Leo",

Anyway, most studies don't go beyond 5 years, as it is extremely expensive to fund it. So there will probably be little data in the future beyond 5 years. As these studies end, there will of course be open-label studies of people that choose to continue the treatment, and this will be analyzed but the data won't be nearly as good as the well designed studies. As of now, there is really no data showing that people should be on Arimidex for longer than 5 years. regards, Leo",

If it is indeed the skin that is forming nodules, the only way the breast cancer can get there is by seeding when the original surgery was done, and since you mentioned that it was a small tumor, it is unlikely to happen.

I will be having more colleagues join me here to help answer questions. Anyway, about your question. It is very hard to know exactly your situation. I don't know what type of cancer it is, the stage. But assuming it is early breast cancer, which was completely removed and negative nodes, even if you had a local recurrence it would be extremely early. What happened almost for sure is the development of a seroma, or a small cavity containing serum, or fluid. It may get larger and perforate spontaneously. You should have this seen, and you might need drainage once again. This is not too uncommon, but it definitely needs care. I can not consider this normal, but a small complication of the surgical procedure. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for sharing your story with us. I hope we can be of help. About your problem(s), I think there is no question that your breast tissue tends to be abnormal, given several areas of atypia. There is no question that atypia is just a step away from cancer itself. I am sorry I can make no firm recommendations, but one of these areas will probably evolve to breast cancer if left alone. As someone mentioned above, please do talk to your doctor about this. Another thing you can do is to see a geneticist, so he/she can estimate your risk of developing BC, and his/her opinion will be very valuable if you would like to have a bilateral mastectomy, and your insurance will porbably do it with a geneticist's opinion. good luck and please feel free to post here !

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for sharing your story with us. I feel sorry for your daughter. I have one view on things that may be helpful. It is so hard to define what is terminal disease. Is it 6 weeks ? 6 months ? 6 years ? In a sense we are all slowly dying. 6 months to an 80 year-old person might not be terminal, actually this person may die of natural causes before the disease kills him/her. Another consideration is the functional status of the patient. Is she able to do her daily activities ? Can she take care of herself without assistance ? Is her pain (if any) well controlled ? That's why I think it is so difficult to say if this is terminal or not. Maybe someone that is paralyzed for 6 years is deemed terminal, but for that person that quality of life is acceptable. People have an amazing ability, which is to adapt to new conditions. Some people adapt better and faster than others. So you and your daughter should focus on extension of life that is acceptable to her. Your doctor is providing adequate treatment, and if you are satisfied with it, try to work with him in the areas that are not so well. If there's anything I can help you with, I'll be here. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for sharing your story with us. I hope we can be of help. About your problem(s), I think there is no question that your breast tissue tends to be abnormal, given several areas of atypia. There is no question that atypia is just a step away from cancer itself. I am sorry I can make no firm recommendations, but one of these areas will probably evolve to breast cancer if left alone. As someone mentioned above, please do talk to your doctor about this. Another thing you can do is to see a geneticist, so he/she can estimate your risk of developing BC, and his/her opinion will be very valuable if you would like to have a bilateral mastectomy, and your insurance will porbably do it with a geneticist's opinion. good luck and please feel free to post here !

      "Content": "Pastor Rich, Thanks for posting. I hope things are going well. Currently for all newly diagnosed breast cancers, it is pretty standard to test for ER/PR status, and most places also do HER2 identification. HER2 status is more complicated since it uses a different technique and it may take a few days. Maybe some institutions prefer to have the cancer diagnosed, and if the patient accepts therapy, run the tests later on. It may just be an option to save money. Imagine if we get a biopsy on a very old lady and knowing that it is cancer she refuses treatment...the ER/PR/HER2 would be unnecessary, right ? I understand Canada has a different health system, and that may be the reason... regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for posting. Like people mentioned above, there are other reasons for swollen axillary lymphnodes. If you have a chest infection or a pneumonia that is already a good reason to have it. Regardless, you need to be evaluated for this, and you should talk to your physician about this. It is my understanding that you are on hormones because of your histerectomy and oophorectomy. While this is what it takes to avoid menopausal symptoms since you have no ovaries, there are risks associated with it. I would not just stop taking the hormones right now, talk to your doctor and explain your concerns first. As an aside, the participants here are affected by breast cancer, so you are not \"seeing\" people that had swollen lymphnodes and did fine. Again, most likely this is just reactive from the infection, but you need to be evaluated. best regards, Leo",

It is possible that you have very aggressive disease, that appears to have progressed despite radiation. I can not tell you whether you should get chemotherapy and/or radiation at this point, but what I can tell you is that it seems like your oncology has some options for you down the road. It is always important to evaluate whether one form of treatment is working before moving on to the next alternative. I frequently mention that patients can always seek second opinions. Even if you are happy with you current oncologist, you might want to check if there are other thoughts. Despite multiple protocols and guidelines, cancer treatment is not carved in stone, and different oncologists may make different choices when choosing treatments. best regards, Leo",

Having undergone multiple chemotherapy sessions (and radiation), she is at higher risk for lymphoma, which could be the case. Another thing that could happen is if she has extensive liver metastasis or thrombosis of the portal venous system, the veins that drain the bowels to the liver. That could increase the pressure to the spleen and cause enlargement. At this point it is difficult to diagnose a lymphoma without a biopsy, but nonetheless I think it would not make a difference in treatment right now. You should ask her oncologist what he thinks about it. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Sorry it took me a while to answer your question. Things can get pretty busy here. Anyway, let me start by stating that when you get a mastectomy, your whole breast is sent to pathology and examined under the microscope. So you would know if there were additional areas involved by cancer. DCIS is just the histological diagnosis, what the pathologist sees under the microscope. Your tumor size is considered a Tis, \"is\" meaning in situ, no positive lymphnodes, which puts you in a very comfortable position. Furthermore, as your entire breast tissue was removed, you do not need mammograms anymore. Your stage is called 0 per current literature. Let me quote something here from uptodate: More recently, the natural history of DCIS can be estimated from series of women with DCIS who have undergone BCT rather than mastectomy. Although these studies differ markedly in design, the following general conclusions can be drawn [5,18-31]: At 12 to 15 years of follow-up, and regardless of histologic grade or the use of radiation therapy (RT), the majority of women with DCIS treated by breast conserving surgery do not suffer either a local or distant recurrence. Cause-specific survival rates range from 96 to 100 percent. Approximately one-half of all recurrences are invasive, regardless of the type of adjuvant therapy (ie, RT, tamoxifen). Nearly all patients with a noninvasive recurrence, and a large proportion (>80 percent) of those who recur with invasive breast cancer survive their disease after subsequent treatment (usually mastectomy). About the TRAM, sometimes the end-result takes months to achieve. Unfortunately I have no experience with this, as this is not my area, so I can not offer much help :-/. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "DJ56 Sorry for not answering your question, I never got it... but anyway. As said above, ER/PR- tumor cells won't respond to hormonal therapy. Unfortunately the prognosis is a bit worse in that case. Staging and grading are different things. Clinical staging means an assessment of how localized (or not) the tumor is, and is essentially what guides the treatment. A stage II has a very different treatment than a grade IIIB, for example. The grading is what the pathologist does when he looks at the cells. More differentiated cells, meaning tumoral cells that resemble the original tissue more closely have (in general) a better prognosis. So if the cells are undifferentiated, or poorly differentiated it is generally worse. The links posted above will help you as well. Questions to ask your doctor: - What clinical stage you are - What treatment options there are and the consequences in terms of prognosis, side-effects etc. - What is the follow-up I think that's what I'd like to know. Of course there are so many questions, but in general those should be helpful. good luck !! Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Let me see if I get your question straight: - You had a HER2+++ tumor, but received standard chemotherapy without Herceptin, at a time when it was not available or it was not proven beneficial - Now you'd like to know what to do, whether to get the Herceptin now or not ? If that is correct, there is no easy answer for this, as there are no trials saying that giving Herceptin at a later date is beneficial or not. I understand it can be frustrating, but sometimes giving single-agent chemotherapy can just make things worse. I am not expert in this field, but I am curious as to what physicians are doing with this. I suspect they are not using Herceptin outside clearly established protocols. best regards, Leo",

It is nice to try to find out as much as you can about your disease, but at this point I would advise you to try to take one step at a time. You do not even have an official diagnosis. What happens is: if you have a palpable nodule, then it is easy to do a biopsy. In your case the nodule is not palpable, so they will do a wire localization and open biopsy. Then you wait for your path report. I would not go beyond this point. There are so many paths that one can take from here that are dependent on the pathology report. Please visit our forums, and get as much information you can from our folks. Let me know how I can be of help as well ! regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for posting. Even before my answer you already realize how helpful the nice ladies we have here can be. It is nice to try to find out as much as you can about your disease, but at this point I would advise you to try to take one step at a time. You do not even have an official diagnosis. What happens is: if you have a palpable nodule, then it is easy to do a biopsy. In your case the nodule is not palpable, so they will do a wire localization and open biopsy. Then you wait for your path report. I would not go beyond this point. There are so many paths that one can take from here that are dependent on the pathology report. Please visit our forums, and get as much information you can from our folks. Let me know how I can be of help as well ! regards, Leo",

I admit that not knowing what to expect is the worst, but you have a plan, you will see the doctors and they will evaluate and treat you appropriately. So try to do some things you enjoy, go shopping, to the movies, something. I would encourage you to ask things here, not only I am here but there a several extremely supportive men and women here. Just a detail, a core biopsy is not able to define size of the tumor to stage it. The 8 mm you have seen is the size of the biopsy itself. Size of the tumor is defined when there is a surgical specimen, i.e. from a mastectomy or from a lumpectomy. yours sincerely Leo",

So try to do some things you enjoy, go shopping, to the movies, something. I would encourage you to ask things here, not only I am here but there a several extremely supportive men and women here. Just a detail, a core biopsy is not able to define size of the tumor to stage it. The 8 mm you have seen is the size of the biopsy itself. Size of the tumor is defined when there is a surgical specimen, i.e. from a mastectomy or from a lumpectomy. yours sincerely Leo",

I am not sure if your insurance would pay if you wanted to have it more frequently. I understand your desire to have frequent and have early detection of any abnormality, but the medical literature states that 1 year intervals are enough. Radiation associated with a mammogram is not high, you should not have any problems even if you get it every 6 months. regards Leo",

      "Content": "Hello ! Well, as you know ductal carcinoma is situ means really a very localized cancer. The treatment is controversial, but most people opt for breast conserving treatment. Adjuvant radiation is a hot topic, and individual oncologists have differing opinions, and a very individualized approach should be taken. One opinion is that if clear margins > 10 mm are obtained RT should be optional, but again, that is one opinion in the literature. If there are no other breast lesions, staging may be unnecessary, since it is such a localized tumor, but your doctor might want to do it. Good luck ! Leo",

But it is a matter of risk/benefit ratio, meaning that there is so much information that can be gained from a mammogram, and there is little if any evidence out there about the risk of cells migrating when you squeeze the breasts. Sure, MRI is an alternative, but if we just stop doing mammograms and start doing MRIs on everyone we will have to sell our houses to pay the insurance bills. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello, and thanks for posting. Unfortunately, sentinel lymphnode is a very good technique, but in Medicine there is no technique that is 100% certain. So there are cases that even when the sentinel lymphnode is negative, there may be positve axillary nodes. I am afraid this may have happened with your sister, but I can not be sure. So at this point this may be considered recurrent breast cancer to the axillary lymphnodes. She will probably have another staging evaluation, and be treated appropriately. I hope she does well. There are several approaches that may be taken, and it looks like she has a really good doctor. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hi Screening for breast cancer in the remaining breast after a mastectomy is always a must. Having a personal history of breast cancer increases your risk of having breast cancer in the remaining breast. It seems obvious, but there are studies that have shown it. Despite not knowing much about your history, there are so many things that should be taken into consideration when making a decision about a mastectomy. Like Nancy, lobular carcinoma is one that is frequently multi-focal. You should estimate your breast cancer risk using the Gail model or the NSABP calculator. The number given will underestimate your risk, because you already have a personal history of breast cancer. Better yet, you should explore with your physician your reasons for you wanting a mastectomy, and his role is to show you the right direction, that's what we doctors do. There is so much junk on the internet that I find it very difficult to find a truly independent analysis of something for non-medical people. yours sincerely Leo",

Adjuvant radiation is a hot topic, and individual oncologists have differing opinions, and a very individualized approach should be taken. One opinion is that if clear margins > 10 mm are obtained RT should be optional, but again, that is one opinion in the literature. If there are no other breast lesions, staging may be unnecessary, since it is such a localized tumor, but your doctor might want to do it. Good luck ! Leo",

      "Content": "Tracey, Sorry to hear about these findings. Anyway, what they can tell from looking at imaging is: is this suggestive or not of cancer ? Is it worth going in for a biopsy ? It seems that the answer is yes for your case. When they mentioned the other area as stable punctate foci of enhancement means only that there is no change from previous exams. Radiologists can only describe what they see. It is the job of the oncologist or clinician to interpret the data and correlate with the clinical situation, and that is sometimes very difficult. The bottomline is: you have a lesion that is likely malignant, and that you will need something done diagnostically about it. The other area I can't really comment on, your oncologist is certainly the best person to ask. Obs: sorry I overlooked your post before, it is sometimes difficult to follow all the new threads here and answer them accordingly . best of luck, and keep us posted ! Leo",

      "Content": "Hello, and thanks for posting. Unfortunately, sentinel lymphnode is a very good technique, but in Medicine there is no technique that is 100% certain. So there are cases that even when the sentinel lymphnode is negative, there may be positve axillary nodes. I am afraid this may have happened with your sister, but I can not be sure. So at this point this may be considered recurrent breast cancer to the axillary lymphnodes. She will probably have another staging evaluation, and be treated appropriately. I hope she does well. There are several approaches that may be taken, and it looks like she has a really good doctor. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Girls, Just received this from Mayo Clinic and would like to share it with you: Mayo Collaboration: Discovery Blocks Breast Cancer Growth, Stimulates Immunity Mayo Clinic researchers today announced the discovery of a mechanism that blocks the body's natural ability to reject breast cancer. They also described an experimental therapy to remove that block. The findings were announced in a news conference at a major gathering of breast cancer specialists, the Era of Hope -- Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program meeting in Philadelphia. The goal of the research is to prevent breast cancer recurrence in women who've already experienced remission of the disease. In cases where cancer has spread outside the breast, the 10-year relapse rate can be as high as 90 percent. Mayo Clinic researchers -- collaborating with colleagues at the University of Washington -- showed that their experimental therapy to remove the block did not harm the immune system -- in fact, it boosted it. Mice that received the toxic injections that killed the immune system blockages had tumors that were one-tenth the size of mice that did not receive the injections. Breast cancer researchers have known for years that the body's immune system is naturally poised to reject breast cancer -- but in breast cancer patients, something interferes with this rejection, allowing the cancer to grow unchecked. This new finding helps unlock that mystery and may lead to safer, gentler therapies. \"Evidence is emerging that some of the effects of chemotherapy are due to depleting T-regulatory (T-reg) cells,\" says Keith Knutson, Ph.D., the Mayo Clinic immunology researcher who led the study. \"The strategy we use in our investigation may actually be a way to target the T-regs directly, without using the indirect route of chemotherapy. Depleting T-regulatory cells may boost natural immunity against breast cancer.\" Significance of the Research The Mayo Clinic and University of Washington collaborative study is the first to show these two new important aspects of breast cancer: T-regulatory cells play a disease-promoting role in breast cancer. T-regs can be selectively and therapeutically eliminated without harming the immune response of white blood cells. Instead, blocking T-regs boosts natural immunity. Dr. Knutson emphasized that further studies must validate these findings before they can be applied to human breast cancer patients. Even so, he says this is a welcome research advance because breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in women. According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, this year in the United States more than 211,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 43,300 will die from it. About Immunotherapy and IL-2 Immunotoxin Dr. Knutson is a specialist in the cutting-edge field of immunotherapy, and Mayo Clinic is a major immunotherapy research center (http://mayoresearch.mayo.edu/mayo/research/ciip/). Immunotherapy is the strategy that seeks to therapeutically harness the natural healing powers of the immune system and direct them against cancers and other diseases to improve treatment and minimize side effects. The IL-2 immunotoxin used in Dr. Knutson's mouse study is based on a naturally occurring immune-system molecule that has been modified in the laboratory to specifically locate T-reg cells and kill them. The IL-2 immunotoxin is commercially available and currently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat a different disease, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The Experiment and its Findings The researchers studied the effects of the IL-2 immunotoxin in two groups of about a dozen mice each. All mice were injected with invasive human breast cancer cells to produce one group with early stage minimal cancer and a second group with late-stage established cancer. These two cancer stage groups were then compared to control groups of mice injected with breast cancer but not treated with the IL-2 immunotoxin. Results showed that at the end of the treatment cycle, the IL-2 immunotoxin: significantly delayed the growth of tumors in animals with early stage, minimal tumors. slowed the growth of tumors in both early stage and late stage tumor groups. reduced mean tumor sizes as compared to controls. In the minimally diseased group, tumors were 90 percent smaller, and in the late-stage well-established group they were 79 percent smaller than those of the control group. produced tumor response that is dose dependent: more was better. worked through the immune system -- not directly on the tumor. Researchers discovered this by removing the tumors from the mice and treating the tumors with the IL-2 immunotoxin -- and saw no impact. This suggests the IL-2 immunotoxin needs the biological context of the immune system to be effective, not simple contact with tumor cells. Collaboration and Support In addition to Dr. Knutson, the following researchers from the University of Washington were part of the research team: Yushe Dang, Ph.D.; Hailing Lu, Ph.D.; Jason Lukas, M.D.; Bond Almand, M.D.; Ekram Makary, Ph.D.; Ehizoje Azeke; and Mary Disis, Ph.D. Their work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and Mayo Foundation. ### http://www.mayoclinic.org/news2005-rst/2867.html",

      "Content": "Hello In general, breast cancer presents either as a painless lump noticed during exam, or an abnormality noticed on a routine mammogram. It is not frequent to cause pain. In addition, cancer can cause skin changes, such as inversion of the nipple, areas of retraction of the skin. It can involve the skin itself, and it manifests itself as an angry, infectious type of look (but that is fortunately not common). About the smell thing, there are some theories (and some anecdotal reports) of dogs being able to smell not only cancer, but also heart disease and such. I can not corroborate this theory at this point, but there is certainly something about this that is interesting and hopefully can help us detect disease. best regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Unfortunately the answers to cure cancer are not simple at all. All the millions of dollars are working, as reflected by a signifficant increase in survival rates in most cancers. In the specific area of breast cancer, look at all the different molecular markers that were discovered and targeted: ER/PR, HER2 are just examples of what is to come. The request to cure cancer seems so simple, to eradicate a few cells that are not working well, but it sometimes feels just like digging deeper and deeper and things look more complicated. Believe it or not, there are not nearly enough people to conduct enough research in this field, given the enormous complexity of it. Like I said, if I had that magic bullet to tell which of you will remain cancer free I would be extremely happy, but it's just not possible right now... regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Multi-focal IDC means that several *independent* areas of IDC were found. That already shows that your tissue tends to progress to cancer. In your case a bilateral mastectomy would probably be beneficial. Let me quote something from uptodate: The comparative efficacy of a program of careful observation versus prophylactic mastectomy in a population of high-risk women is uncertain. One meta-analysis included 389 women with LCIS who were followed for a mean of 10.9 years after excision: 16.4 percent developed invasive carcinoma, and the breast cancer mortality rate was 2.8 percent [38]. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower breast cancer mortality rate (0.9 percent) among 391 women who were treated initially with prophylactic mastectomy. The study above was only with removal of the area of LCIS. Your case is beyond that, with transformation into IDC. regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Unfortunately getting healthcare without insurance is a big problem. But we can give you some advice. As someone mentioned, there are programs for women who need mammograms. They are free for those who qualify, but I am not sure about the details and whether you would qualify. About your risk, the models take into consideration first-degree family members only, so if you have no sisters, daughters and your mother is not affected it is just like you did not have BC in your family. I am not saying that your risk is not higher, but with the current models it is very difficult to estimate. The lifetime risk of BC is currently 1/8, so there is a chance that your grandmother and aunts had sporadic breast cancer, not linked to genetics. Another thing that would help is to know when their diagnosis was made. If they were old, it is more likely to be sporadic, as opposed to a diagnosis at a young age. regards, Leo",

But it is a matter of risk/benefit ratio, meaning that there is so much information that can be gained from a mammogram, and there is little if any evidence out there about the risk of cells migrating when you squeeze the breasts.

      "Content": "Hello Well, Neupogen and Neulasta are a bit different, but are essentially designed to stimulate the bone marrow to produce white cells. Neulasta is a newer drug that tends to work for longer periods of time. Anyway, there are concerns that this type of drugs could stimulate certain cancers, but these theories are yet unproven. For that reason, oncologists are careful prescribing it. There are side-effects and risks associated with it. Here are the guidelines published in 2001 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation ? Use of CSFs should be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation, particularly involving the mediastinum; the primary reason is a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia [35]. For patients receiving radiation therapy involving large fields but no chemotherapy, therapeutic use of CSFs may be considered if prolonged delays secondary to neutropenia are expected. Secondary prophylaxis ? Secondary prophylaxis refers to the administration of a CSF in later cycles after febrile neutropenia has occurred in a prior cycle. The goal is to maintain chemotherapy dose intensity when dose reduction is not desired. No published regimen has shown improved disease-free or overall survival when the dose of chemotherapy was maintained and secondary prophylaxis was instituted. Except in the setting of curable tumors (eg, germ cell cancer), dose reduction after an episode of severe neutropenia should be considered the primary therapeutic option. Bottomline is: there is no clear indication for Neulasta unless there is fever in the context of neutropenia, i.e. when your ANC is <1.0 regards, Leo",

I admit that not knowing what to expect is the worst, but you have a plan, you will see the doctors and they will evaluate and treat you appropriately. So try to do some things you enjoy, go shopping, to the movies, something. I would encourage you to ask things here, not only I am here but there a several extremely supportive men and women here. Just a detail, a core biopsy is not able to define size of the tumor to stage it. The 8 mm you have seen is the size of the biopsy itself. Size of the tumor is defined when there is a surgical specimen, i.e. from a mastectomy or from a lumpectomy. yours sincerely Leo",

The (small amount of) data that is published about that is scarce; there are no prospective randomized trials.

If you were a physician you would see how much progress we have made in 30 years. From better supportive care to better diagnostic methods. Do you really think that someone with brain cancer would have the same care 30 years ago ? There were not even CT scans 30 years ago. It is true that several cancers have very poor response to current agents, brain cancer being one example. But just a few examples would convince anyone: take the example of breast cancer. Today we have aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, sentinel lymphnode biopsies, more conservative surgeries and less toxic regimens. About the oral chemotherapy, I agree that it is far more convenient and less expensive to receive drugs orally. But it is a problem of pharmacokinetics, some drugs simply have to be given IV. The reimbursement for IV chemotherapy is much better, and it is true that there are people that abuse the system for their own gains, and I condemn that. There are targeted therapies that are IV, actually most of them are IV. They are certainly not the revolution that we had hoped, and I am sure some will cease to be used. I really wish I could individualize a treatment based on the biology of each patient's tumor. That will come. It is just too early. I appreciate your comments and bringing a constructive discussion about the subject. best regards, Leo",

Do you really think that someone with brain cancer would have the same care 30 years ago ? There were not even CT scans 30 years ago. It is true that several cancers have very poor response to current agents, brain cancer being one example. But just a few examples would convince anyone: take the example of breast cancer. Today we have aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, sentinel lymphnode biopsies, more conservative surgeries and less toxic regimens. About the oral chemotherapy, I agree that it is far more convenient and less expensive to receive drugs orally. But it is a problem of pharmacokinetics, some drugs simply have to be given IV. The reimbursement for IV chemotherapy is much better, and it is true that there are people that abuse the system for their own gains, and I condemn that. There are targeted therapies that are IV, actually most of them are IV. They are certainly not the revolution that we had hoped, and I am sure some will cease to be used. I really wish I could individualize a treatment based on the biology of each patient's tumor. That will come. It is just too early. I appreciate your comments and bringing a constructive discussion about the subject. best regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Unfortunately the answers to cure cancer are not simple at all. All the millions of dollars are working, as reflected by a signifficant increase in survival rates in most cancers. In the specific area of breast cancer, look at all the different molecular markers that were discovered and targeted: ER/PR, HER2 are just examples of what is to come. The request to cure cancer seems so simple, to eradicate a few cells that are not working well, but it sometimes feels just like digging deeper and deeper and things look more complicated. Believe it or not, there are not nearly enough people to conduct enough research in this field, given the enormous complexity of it. Like I said, if I had that magic bullet to tell which of you will remain cancer free I would be extremely happy, but it's just not possible right now... regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello I understand your frustrations regarding the perceived lack of adequate monitoring. Current guidelines recommend: history and physical exam every 4-6 months, mammography once a year. I will paste what I read from the guidelines (NCCN, 2004): Posttherapy follow-up is optimally performed by members of the treatment team and includes the performance of regular physical examinations and mammography. In patients undergoing breastconserving therapy, the first follow-up mammogram should be performed approximately 6 months after the completion of breastconserving RT. The routine performance of alkaline phosphatase and liver function tests are not included in the guidelines. In addition, the panel continues to believe determination of the available ?tumor markers? for breast cancer and routine bone scans in the asymptomatic patient provide no advantage in survival or ability to palliate recurrent disease and are, therefore, not recommended. Most doctors feel more comfortable monitoring some blood work as well, so that it will be abnormal if there are bone lesions or liver lesions, for instance. This is a difficult subject, with extensive cost implications. It is the same as doing for example a chest x-ray of all smokers every year to look for early lung cancer. This was done as a trial, and did not help. Further studies about how to best monitor patients after therapy are still necessary, but the issue is: no matter how small (or big) a metastatic site is, the prognosis is the same, so detecting it earlier does not help patients. I will paste some references that you can read re: this subject 99. Rosselli Del Turco M, Palli D, Cariddi A et al. Intensive diagnostic follow-up after treatment of primary breast cancer.

I admit that not knowing what to expect is the worst, but you have a plan, you will see the doctors and they will evaluate and treat you appropriately. So try to do some things you enjoy, go shopping, to the movies, something. I would encourage you to ask things here, not only I am here but there a several extremely supportive men and women here. Just a detail, a core biopsy is not able to define size of the tumor to stage it. The 8 mm you have seen is the size of the biopsy itself. Size of the tumor is defined when there is a surgical specimen, i.e. from a mastectomy or from a lumpectomy. yours sincerely Leo",

      "Content": "Hi Thanks for sharing your story with us. I hope we can help in some way. One of the advices I would give is to not suffer by anticipation. I admit that not knowing what to expect is the worst, but you have a plan, you will see the doctors and they will evaluate and treat you appropriately. So try to do some things you enjoy, go shopping, to the movies, something. I would encourage you to ask things here, not only I am here but there a several extremely supportive men and women here. Just a detail, a core biopsy is not able to define size of the tumor to stage it. The 8 mm you have seen is the size of the biopsy itself. Size of the tumor is defined when there is a surgical specimen, i.e. from a mastectomy or from a lumpectomy. yours sincerely Leo",

A well-known and validated approach to estimate her risk is the NSABP model, available at the NCI website at: http://bcra.nci.nih.gov/brc/start.htm This may be able to give you some numbers to talk to her. I feel that it is very important that she has adequate screening with mammograms. For first degree family members, screening should begin 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the index patient, which means 36 years in your case. good luck ! regards, Leo",

Yes, the study being funded by the manufacturer may weaken the strength of the evidence, but it is there. The recommendations are based on guidelines. Guidelines change whenever the committee meets and re-evaluates the available literature. Some are convinced, while others are not.

      "Content": "Hello Well, Neupogen and Neulasta are a bit different, but are essentially designed to stimulate the bone marrow to produce white cells. Neulasta is a newer drug that tends to work for longer periods of time. Anyway, there are concerns that this type of drugs could stimulate certain cancers, but these theories are yet unproven. For that reason, oncologists are careful prescribing it. There are side-effects and risks associated with it. Here are the guidelines published in 2001 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation ? Use of CSFs should be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation, particularly involving the mediastinum; the primary reason is a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia [35]. For patients receiving radiation therapy involving large fields but no chemotherapy, therapeutic use of CSFs may be considered if prolonged delays secondary to neutropenia are expected. Secondary prophylaxis ? Secondary prophylaxis refers to the administration of a CSF in later cycles after febrile neutropenia has occurred in a prior cycle. The goal is to maintain chemotherapy dose intensity when dose reduction is not desired. No published regimen has shown improved disease-free or overall survival when the dose of chemotherapy was maintained and secondary prophylaxis was instituted. Except in the setting of curable tumors (eg, germ cell cancer), dose reduction after an episode of severe neutropenia should be considered the primary therapeutic option. Bottomline is: there is no clear indication for Neulasta unless there is fever in the context of neutropenia, i.e. when your ANC is <1.0 regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Margot Thanks for your post. From what you are telling me: your friend has a tumor with extension to the chest wall, making this a T4 on the TNM staging system, no lymphnodes or distant metastasis. So she is a stage IIIB. Assuming all the data above is correct, I got the following excerpts from Up-to-Date Combined modality therapy utilizing induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy followed by locoregional therapy (surgery, radiation, or both) is emerging globally as the standard of care for LABC, including inflammatory breast cancer. On average, 75 percent of women have a major clinical response to induction chemotherapy, and roughly one-half of these are clinically complete responses (ie, no evidence of residual tumor on clinical or radiographic evaluation). One-half to two-thirds of clinical complete responses in the breast will be pathologically confirmed complete responses (ie, no evidence of tumor in the surgical specimen). Several studies indicate a correlation between response to induction chemotherapy (particularly the axillary response), and relapse-free survival as well as overall survival. Patients with negative lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy fare better than those with positive lymph nodes, and the risk of recurrence and death increases in proportion to the number of positive nodes (show table 1). One of the major reasons to pursue neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy is to increase the likelihood of successful breast preservation in women with large tumors, although this approach is not applicable to women with inflammatory breast cancer. Some concern has been raised about whether local failure rates are higher in women who required downstaging to be eligible for BCT compared to those who were candidates before chemotherapy (see \"Optimal locoregional therapy\" below). Surgery should only be attempted if a macroscopically complete resection can be accomplished. Patients who remain inoperable after induction chemotherapy should receive locoregional radiation therapy with subsequent surgery, if feasible. So if the tumor is unresectable, therapy is usually chemotherapy and radiation. regards, Leo[/quote]",

Having been diagnosed with cancer is certainly a big deal, and there is a lot of information available, some of it creates even more confusion. You can try to get organized, get all the information that you know about your cancer and you are more than welcome to ask any questions here. Even when you feel that you are overwhelmed, you can be certain that it will get better and you will get through this. regards, Leo",

Anyway, it seems they are convinced that this is breast cancer, otherwise they would not be starting chemotherapy. If they have enough evidence to support a diagnosis of breast cancer in the lymphnode, you should be ok. Also about your other question regarding contamination of instruments...I have seen one case and this was actually published, since it is extremely rare...you should not worry about this. I wish you the best of luck with your treatment, and we will be available ! regards, Leo",

      "Content": "Hello Thanks for your post. I agree with you that since the evidence is available, it should be applied uniformly to all patients. While that is true, there is so much that influences if a patient can receive more aggressive treatment that I think it is not possible to include in these decision guides. For example, take bone marrow transplant for leukemia. Some doctors offer it to patients up to 45y, other go up to 50y and so on. It is the level of comfort that an individual doctor has with submitting a patient to a very aggressive treatment regimen. Another example, if an 85 yo woman who has very aggressive breast cancer is being evaluated, few would offer her aggressive chemotherapy with anthracyclines. But some would. Oncology is such a difficult field mainly because there are so many difficult decisions to make.... Guidelines or consensus are just that: a group of experts that come together an issue a statement. When there is controversy, guidelines are usually not issues because the is no consensus... Hope this helped ! regards, Leo",

But the rationale for removal might be that you are at higher risk of ovarian cancer. Maybe given your family history (if you have a history of ovarian ca, breast ca), it might be reasonable.
