I say if the doctors give up and say they can no longer do any more treatments then it doesnt hurt to try anything. The problem with that is one never knows if the body healed itself or the diet actually helped -not enough solid proof. and really I have no further discussion ,material on that- whatever the case its rare but Im glad shes ok.",

T Most of these symptoms come and go throughout treatment. Some certsin symptoms bother some people more than others no way to predict who when or why. Its definately normal as far as symptoms go. if it becomes unbearable let your doctor know. If the med he gioves you for pain doesnt ease it up-tell him. keep after them untill you get something that makes it bearable. nothings going to mae it go away completely untill treatments are over and even then-it takes time for the chemicals to work out of your system-but in time the pain will diminish. hope this helps answer your question.",

Hopefully you wont be going through round two . as far as reaccurance the biopsy should reveal that, I would think. I pray its a false alarm. keep us posted and let us know what happens with the biopsy. hang in there..wish I could be of more help. but Im usually on the colon cancer forum..I wandered off track for a bit.",

I havent had any real experience in this type of problems , but when someone gets a chance Im sure they will try to help-in the meantime- all I can tell you if the doctors or radiologists claim its a fatty tissue mass- this can happen anywhere on the body and truly isnt anything to be concerned about unless its giving you a problem- usually they are a type of cyst (in a way) and removal isnt usually necessary unless it became a problem /cosmetic reasons. In some cases fatty tissues come and go and sometimes they will break down and dissapear. other times they just stay where they are. If the doctors were concerned they would have recommended further testing.",

I really no-nothing of what your aunt is going through because Ive been focused on moms colon cancer. which is usually the forum Im around. I definately think though. as with any cancer the second opinion is a really good idea before putting her through more treatments. As long as her condition is not emergebt I would go ahead with the retest. I cant ofer ay more advice than that but Im hoping others reading this will have some advice for you. In the meantime I hope all goes well and she will be included in my forum prayers and give it some time for some answers , most of the people here are going through quite alot themselves. keep us posted on how shes doing and if you decide to retest .",
