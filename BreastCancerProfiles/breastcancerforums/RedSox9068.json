    "Content": "My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and i don't think she is giving me all the details which in her mind is her protecting me. I plan on having a sit down with her once i see her this weekend since we live in different states to explain i just want to know so i can be there for her, but anyways. She tells me the tumor is 8mm and is invasive and something to do with mammary carcinoma. We saw her dad/my grandfather through chemo and it was not pleasant so i feel like that will impact her decision for treatment but i just want her to be around to see my kids one day and be a part of their / my life. Anyone have any insight into a scenario like this? She is 61 years old, i would say not in the best health and she WAS a chronic smoker which worries me since the lungs are so close by. Thank you and i know i am most likely over reacting but to be honest i feel helpless and am scared to death for her as she is such a special lady and a big part of my life and was always there for me and now i just want to be there for her.",
