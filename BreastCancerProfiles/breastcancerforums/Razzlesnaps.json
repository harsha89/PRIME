      "Content": "I actually have lung cancer, so I never posted on this part of the forum before now. But, here's my problem. I had metastasized lymph nodes removed from my left armpit area. Now, I get edema there. I wear a sports bra for extra pressure on that side. I have an elastic sleeve I wear when flying or when my arm starts to swell. But I need some pressure for the armpit itself. Does anyone know where I can buy a T-shirt style bra? Christine",
