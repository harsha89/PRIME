    "Content": "Hopelessness is not where you want to find yourselves at this time. You must find a good direction, have faith in creation, and proceed with your challenges and hardships. They will make you stronger. It sounds like your mom is coming out of chemo therapy weakened without the positive results you were hoping for. With the cancer metastasizing the mainstream cancer options are few. Give your mom lots of love and good fresh food to get her strength back at this point. Cancertutor.com is the best site for alternative treatments. The China Study (book and CD Audio) has years of new mainstream U.S. cancer research that might help. It sounds like you have come to the edge of the road and not sure if you want to cross. If the cars stop for you then by all means cross the road to the other side. Standing there hopeless wondering is not a place to be in this time of cancer. Cesium Cloride is maybe the strongest of the protocols in that world. If you google it more and follow the links you will find more info on it. At this point you need a direction, a good direction we hope. Keep the faith.

Your mom needs your strength.",
