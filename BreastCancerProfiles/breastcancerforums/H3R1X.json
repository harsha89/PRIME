      "Content": "hi, 2 years ago my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer, she refused treatment, beliving that she could fight it off by dieting and an relaxed environment and stuff. she had had cancer once in the past and then she got the lump removed but did not have chemotherapy. this time she was determined to fight it off with out getting it removed even. she went on a vegan diet and started doing a lot of meditating. i urged her to at least get the treatment but she was set on beating the cancer, my mother aint the kind of person to sit back and not doing anything, so i had full confidence she would start making a recovery. a few months later she got a scan, the cancer had got a whole lot worse. she refused to believe it saying she was feeling so much better and the lump was so much smaller. she stuck to her vegan diet and about half a year later she started getting serious back pains so so she went once more to the doctors to find that the cancer had not only spead to her bones which explained her back pain but many other places like her lunges and liver. she started looking for other means of treatment other than chemotherapy she found several like; mistletoe injections,raising her body temperature and some others i think. she also had many blood transfusions because her blood had not enough iron in it. she started a fund raising money for the injections because they are expensive and the NHS wouldn't cover it . once money was raised she went down to England and got the special treatments. 1 week later she got back from Westbrom she felt good at first and started taking injections not sure how often. she however, became very ill some days and couldn't take it. this went on for several months before her through went suddenly she was taken to a hospital where they gave her some sort of treatment mum stayed in hospital for 4 weeks. she was given another scan she was given 1 month to live. she got home a few days ago and is living back in the house. but for some reason although i have had many in depth chats with her and talked to her often i can not cry. and i go on like its not evening happening i find it so incredibly unrealistic that this is happening. like some one is going to tell me that its all been a horrible joke . my mums such a strong woman, even now that shes so thin and withered she has helped me get a collage placement. is this normal for me to be in denial about her condition? i wish i could take her to places shes always wanted to go like Aisha but i cant, i want to make her last weeks special but all i can think about is that shes still going to get better even though she gave up hope a few weeks ago. it has helped so much just writing all this down. i feel extremely guilty about not being able to cry. please some one write back sorry about bad grammar skills and such ryan",
