      "Content": "Hello all: I haven't written in awhile as I was writing under newly diagnosed and feel like I am oldly diagnosed now. I have completed the four cycles of AC and have had my first dose of Taxol. They gave me 50 mg of Benadryl, Kytril, and 20 Mg of Decadron prior to the Taxol. I also took 1mg of Ativan orally. All was fine until day four when I broke out in hives on my abdomen which turned into welts. Has anyone had this excperience? The doctor ordered Methylprednisolone in decreasing dosage for 5 days. He said it was a reaction to the Taxol and would take four to five days to resolve./ I am worried about the next dose and if I am going to have more of a reaction. I felt pretty crummy yesterday with nausea and had to take Ativan and Compazine. I thought my stomach problems were going to be over with the Taxol. I am taking Acidex now for the GI problems. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? I will be soooooo glad when this is over. Sharon",

Sometimes it is even hard for me to pull the covers up at night....after I have kicked them off during a hot flash. I did try switching to Femara but the hot flashes were much more frequent and severe so I went back to Aromasin. I think my wrists are feeling better though. My oncologist suggested that I take Motrin for pain relief. I even tried the wrist supports at night that people use for carpal tunnel. I have another friend who had a bilateral mastectomy and never had chemo or radiation, but was on Arimidex and had the same problems you and I are experiencing. My fear of reoccurence keeps me on the drugs. Hope yours improves with time. I started Aromasin one year ago and just started with the joint pain around February. It does help to know that we are not alone or crazy. Keep the faith.....sometimes it helps to go off of them for awhile, or switch, and then resume.. Good luck. Sharon",

      "Content": "Greetings to all: It has been awhile since I have posted. I saw my oncologist this week and was thrilled to hear NED.....I have waited until I could say this...It has been a year ago that I finished chemo, AC/Taxol. I still have some neuropathy in my hands and feet. I am taking Neurotin and Vit B 6 & 12. However, I do feel that it is slowly improving. I have been taking Aromasin since last June. About three months ago I started to have pain in both of my wrists. I didn't know if it was carpal tunnel or arthritis. It almost feels like it is \"catching on something\". Sometimes, upon awakening in the morning I can hardly move my left wrist. I have some point tenderness over the wrist bones. The left side is worst than the right. Could the lack of estrogen be causing this related to the Aromasin? Does anyone else have this problem? Am I going to have permanent joint damage? My doctor felt it was not carpal tunnel and just told me to take Motrin. I have adapted more or less to the neuropathy, but this is frustrating. I am generally stiff when I get up in the morning or after an hour in the car. I know other people have said they feel ancient.....after all this treatment with the joint aches and pains, etc. I would love to hear from others who may be experiencing the same problem. Would it help to change Aromatase Inhibitors? or will it eventually go away and if so when...I do take Glucosamine. I am grateful to be alive and done with therapy, but would like to be functioning better. I will continue to take the AI's as it is more than worth it to prevent reoccurence. thanks, Sharon",

I hope yours is from the Arimidex. My bilateral wrist pain is actually improving. I still have the early morning stiffness in all of my joints especially my feet. Skeetchers are the only shoes I can wear comfortably due to the pain in my feet. the neuropathy is slowly improving and I am still taking Neurotin for it. I will be glad when I can stop taking it. Good health to all who read this....In spirit, Sharon",

I really thought I was going crazy with my wrist problem. I still have neuropathy from the Taxol. I am taking Aromasin. I am just hoping that it will eventually get better. I am very stiff in the morning or after sitting for long periods. I wish more people would respond as I think it happens fairly frequently. My oncologist said the joint pain from the chemo lasts about a year, but mine didn't start until I was on the Aromasin for several months. Blessings to you both...you are not alone, Sharon",

The oncologist did put me on decadron 8mg per day x 5 days for the joint and muscle pain which should take care of any hives as well I think. I notice that my cuticles are peeling and will try to keep them lubricated and will use tea tree oil to prevent an infection. Only two more treatments to go. I think my energy is alittle better than when on AC. This is such a ride, I never know what to expect from one day to the next. Sharon",

With Neulasta, I always recovered enough to receive my next dose of chemo. However, you can only make so many withdrawls from the bone marrow bank. It made sense to me. I think my counts remain ok and I just completed my 21st treatment. I was also worried about my RBC's as I was anemic throughout my chemo with a HGB in the 10 range. I am now up to 13.

I have been told that it takes about as long as treatment to recover your energy level. I don't think anything could make me more tired than chemo. However, I will take it one day at a time. I am finally starting to sleep better which also should help with my energy level. My HGB was low related to the chemo so that should start rebuilding as well. My best to both of you.
