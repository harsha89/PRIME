      "Content": "The two medications my doctor told me about are Marinol (a synthesized version of one of the ingredients in Marijuana) and Megace. I tried the Marinol and it really didn't help me, but I've heard others say it does help them. I would ask the doctor about any medications so you're sure her other conditions are taken into account. I don't get hungry and when I eat I get full immediately. What has worked for me is doing lots and lots of nutritious liquids. I think our bodies move liquids through the stomach faster than solid foods, so I can drink all day without feeling uncomfortably full. I do like to drink fluids, so when I drink coffee I fill the cup almost 1/2 with milk, I drink lots of fruit juice, I try to do a protein drink every day, lots of milk, and cream-based soups. I've been able to maintain my weight pretty well with a mostly liquid diet, but I'm small to begin with so about 1500 calories a day is enough for me. Milkshakes can be made with protein drink powder in them, and I add a lot of peanut butter for more protein and calories. It's very important to stay hydrated, especially during chemo, so the nutritious liquids kill two birds with one stone. She could try very small meals, too -- one egg makes me very satisfied. Or a small bowl of rice. Or one piece of toast. If I try to eat a real meal I just feel sick as well as depressed about my inability to enjoy it. Tiny meals can add up, as long as you keep sipping away at nutritious drinks as well. Powdered milk and/or sour cream can be added to cream-based soups to increase the calorie and protein content without adding bulk. Someone online said she adds some powdered protein drink mix to her coffee -- I haven't tried that, but I suppose it would taste fine, especially in cafe au lait.",

      "Content": "If you still have breast cancer cells hanging around, they are still estrogen positive and they can recur as breast cancer. They should be able to give you something for the hot flashes, though! Estrogen is not the only thing that can help that. I hope they'll give you something that will bring relief. I have ovarian cancer. I went through natural menopause long before my diagnosis. My hot flashes returned recently and my gyn/onc prescribed 300 mg gabapentin at bedtime. It works like a charm. I don't know why it works, or whether they would meet your needs. My hot flashes weren't horrible, but they were waking me every couple of hours and with the gabapentin I sleep soundly through the night.",

      "Content": "I think the side effects can vary, but constipation is very common during chemo. There's a lot she can do to lessen that, though. Another patient advised me to take 1/2 dose of Miralax (a gentle laxative) for one or two days before chemo to make sure I didn't have any constipation before the treatment. Then I took a full dose of Miralax every day until my bowel movements were normal again. Drinking lots of fluid also helps to prevent constipation and it can lessen other side effects too. Eating fruit helps me to prevent/get rid of constipation. I hope the rest of her treatments go well!",

      "Content": "Lara, I think her doctors are your best guides on what all of this means. And they will also help her understand whether it's safe for her to have a biopsy. In PET scans tissues that are using lots of energy light up. Most cancer use lots of energy. Benign tumors shouldn't light up. There can be grey areas -- I have ovarian tumors which are not aggressive and they did not light up when I had a PET scan. My understand is they can't identify a cancer from a scan -- to be sure, the simplest way is to get a sample of the growth and put it under a microscope. I don't think you should assume the worst. There really isn't enough information yet. Waiting for the results is very frustrating, but it can't be avoided.",
