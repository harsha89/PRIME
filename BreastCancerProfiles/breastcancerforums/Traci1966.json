      "Content": "Hi thoughtful. I am so sorry you are going through this, but so glad you posted here. I've been through what you are going through. 5 1/2 years ago. Had both removed and am writing to tell you that my reconstruction job sucks. My best advice to you is to do your homework on not only your breast surgeon but also your plastic surgeon. My Sister had her mastectomies through her nipples. Not everyone is a candidate for this, but if you are...you will be left with no scars, like my Sister, other than around the nipple, which isn't visible compared to mine, that go from my armpits, to the center of my chest. Ask the question: \"What will my scars look like?\" My scars are crooked....the doc was like 80 years old or something...couldn't he at least get the cuts to look alike? (My Sister's surgeon was a 42 year old female.) And as far as the reconstruction, again, do your homework. I went to a guy that did mostly face lifts, and boob lifts, etc. If I could turn back the clock, I would go to someone that specialized in reconstruction after mastectomies. My expanders hurt so bad I wanted them out. My doc could have said: \"We don't have to fill them up so much at one time.\" But, did he? No. He put them too far apart. When I questioned him he said: \"Well, that's how far apart your real boobs were.\" OMG.... It didn't happen to me, I have flat, hard hamburger buns, but for both my Sisters, there 'foobs' are HUGE. Is that what you want? If no, say so! Be clear on what your expectations are when done. Private message me if you would like to know where you might be able to get referrals in your area. In any case, I wish you the best of luck. BC sucks, but you can survive it and come out on the other side with a beautiful reconstruction like so many I know have. You just have to be careful in who you choose to do the work. Don't just automatically go with who your Oncologist/ GP refers you to. (((hugs))) Traci",

      "Content": "I am so sorry about your Sister; that brought me to tears. I feel her fear. I'm also sorry that you are going through this. With your history, you should absolutely be allowed to have preventative mastectomy, and being a triple negative survivor with a family history to include two of my three sisters, I would encourage it. Best of luck to you..... Traci",
