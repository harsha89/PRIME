I recently saw my onco and she wants me to either start ovarian suppression injections once a month for 5 years or have my ovaries removed. I'm on tamoxifin, it's not stopping my menstrual cycle, but neither did the chemo liked she had hoped. I was Er/pr+. I haven't decided which route to take, I'm leaning towards having the ovaries removed. Take care, Sue",

I had 4 rounds of chemo and 35 radiation treatments. I started tamoxifin 2 months ago. My question is does this black cloud that follows me everywhere ever go away. I just can't get the feeling out of my head that there's more cancer in my body. Are these normal feelings? I see my onc. tomorrow. Hopefully she can put my mind at ease. Thanks for listening! Sue",

I'm taking effexer for hot flashes, but it doesn't seem to help any. I just switched about a month ago from celexa to the effexer and I haven't noticed much of a change. I'm having trouble sleeping, and I don't want to take sleeping pills. I'm going to have a consultation first and see what he has to say. If there's any doubt in my mind, I certainly won't go through with it. I've bee through enough!! Again, thanks for your input. I'll keep you posted!! Sue",

      "Content": "Hello eveyone, I am 39 years old, and was put into medical menopause. I receive lupron injections once a month. I am experiencing horrible hot flashes, my face turns so red, sometimes it scares me. A friend of mine recently had a procedure done to get rid of her hot flashes, and it worked!! It's called a STELLATE GANGLION BLOCK. It's an injection you get in your neck(OUCH) and it's supposed to block signals that can cause hot flashes from reaching to your brain. They say it can work up to six months without a hot flash. The only real side effects is a bloodshot eye or droopy eye, sometimes a hoarse voice. It disappears in 3-6 hours. Needless to say, I singed up. It's a study the doctor is conducting. The gal who had it done sleeps better, her mood is much better and those dreaded hot flashes are gone. Has anyone heard of this procedure. Any input would be greatly appreciated. I'm having the procedure on July 6th. I am so ready to be hot-flash free!!! Thanks for listening!!! Hugs, Sue",

      "Content": "Hi Laurajean, Welcome... I had my lumpectomy last June. It wasn't so bad. Like DIO, I took pain killers for a day then tylennol thereafter. They put a drain tube in, it looked like a grenade(sp). I had to carry it in my bra for 3 days. For me it was more emotional pain than physical. I had 7 weeks of radiation, a bad sunburn and very tired but compared to chemo it was a breeze. Just a pain in the butt to have to drive to the Hospital five days a week. Have you had the lymph nodes checked out yet.Like you I'm pre-menapausal. Im currently receiving Lupron injections to stop my periods. Are you estrogen positive or negative? I'll be thinking of you on the 28th. Please let us know how everything goes. Keep the faith, your in my prayers!! Hugs, Sue",

My onco. says it's from the chemo. Has anyone experienced this, does it go away? Also, I had my nodes removed end of June. Just recently, under my arm has become very sore . I just started walking again, about 3 miles 3-4 times a week. I wasn't sure if that could make it so sore. Is this normal? I go for my first mammogram since my diag next week, I'm a bit scared . My sister was recently diagnosed and they were not able to detect one of her tumors on mamm or ultrasound. Thanks for listening, Hugs Sue",

My friend who had it done still hasn't had a hot flash and feels great. When I talked to my radiologist he too had never heard of it and was concerned that it would effect my ability to sweat properly, trust me, I sweat alot... He was also concerned that it might make my eyes dry and very uncomfortable. I told him I'd wait till more info was out there. Thanks again for your input. Sleeping is still difficult but I'm healthy and happy, life is wonderful!!! Hugs, Sue",
