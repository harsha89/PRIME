      "Content": "By now you should have your BRCA results. While it might quantify the risk, I don't think that you needed BRCA testing to know that you are at high risk for breast cancer. You have a strong family history and already have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer at a young age. My mother died of breast cancer and I have it too. I started with a lumpectomy (for a supposedly small, nonaggressive tumor) and ended up with a bilateral mastectomy and complete hysterectomy (for ovarian cancer symptoms that ended up being a fallopian tube cyst). I had one ovary removed when I was 24 because of a benign tumor. I tested negative for BRCA and there are many women like me. I used to love my beautiful, full breasts (full of cancer, it turned out). I had the my mastectomy two weeks after the hysterectomy (which resulted in instant menopause). So the first time my husband and I were together after I healed from surgery, everything was gone. And we got past it (gingerly at first) and it really is ok now (six years later), although I do feel some grief. Because I had five months between the lumpectomy and the mastectomy, I had a chance to adjust a bit before losing my breasts. I went from identifying with them to rejecting them because they had betrayed me. I never felt androgenous, but I did feel disfigured. My husband's attitude is that he's glad I'm alive. And I still feel beautiful (in clothes). Back to familial breast cancer. What are the implications? It means that if you get breast cancer, it might be at a younger age and a more aggressive form than the generation before you. If your mother had breast cancer and survived it, you are also more likely to survive (and vice versa). If you develop breast cancer, the most aggressive treatment for your subtype of breast cancer and tumor characteristics is probably appropriate and \"wait and see\" should prompt a second opinion. If you have not already done so, enroll in a program for high risk women at a respected cancer center so that you will be followed closely with the latest techniques. Below are some study and article names you can Google if interested: \"Association of Risk-Reducing Surgery in BRCA1 or BRCA2 Mutation Carriers With Cancer Risk and Mortality\" \"Prospective Multicenter Cohort Study to Refine Management Recommendations for Women at Elevated Familial Risk of Breast Cancer: The EVA Trial\" \"Women with family history of breast cancer get cancer at younger age\" \"Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Relatives of Cancer Patients, with and without BRCA Mutations\" I hope that lung spot turned out benign (I've got a couple myself and they are not cancer). Wishing you the best, Sarah",

      "Content": "It's actually very common for the surgeon to have to go back in to get remove more breast tissue when there are not clean margins. One researcher has estimated that positive margins are found upon pathology in approximately 30% of lumpectomies. They really cannot see the cancer on the margin in the operating room. I had a lumpectomy without getting clean margins, then a partial mastectomy (1/3 of the breast removed) without clean margins, then finally a bilateral mastectomy. I remember that the surgeon was extremely determined to get all the cancer before the partial mastectomy. This was all for a tumor that was estimated to be less than 1/2 cm based on mammogram. In a way, it's actually good news for your friend that they are going back in to get the rest of the cancer, because it's very important that it all be removed. Hope this helps a bit, Sarah",

      "Content": "You deserve a diagnosis, even if it turns out to be a benign condition. I would insist on this. I have lobular breast cancer, which typically shows up as a area of thickening rather than a lump. I had regular mammograms for years but it was not caught approximately 4 cm in size. This was despite the fact that I was considered high risk for breast cancer since my mother died of it. Even right before surgery, the radiologist estimated the size of the tumor as less than 0.5 cm (he was looking right at it). I also had some breast pain associated with the thickening, which was dismissed as probably a cyst. I'm not suggesting you have lobular breast cancer, but I want to encourage you to get a diagnosis. A needle biopsy is not a huge operation and would rule out cancer.",

      "Content": "Hi Nicole, hopefully your lumps will turn out to be benign. However, if not, time is of the essence since you are so young and breast cancer in young women with a family history tends to be aggressive. Therefore, I would suggest, find out from the technician how soon the followup mammograms and sonograms will be read (the reports describing the results should be ready within 2 or 3 days at most) and go in person to pick up the reports (it is your right to do so -- every center has a procedure for doing this, they're used to it and don't hassle you -- usually it just involves signing a form). Then read the reports. They may be confusing, but will have a summary section at the end. If the report contains a recommendation for any kind of follow up (they may or may not mention the word biopsy), then contact your doctor and get a referral to an appropriate doctor such as an oncologist ASAP. If it is necessary and if you push hard enough (and you should), you may be able to get a biopsy within two weeks. Breast biopsies are done either with a needle or by cutting out a small amount of tissue. Neither procedure is very painful for most women and they do not cause a lot of scarring or disfigurement. Results again will only take a few days at most. Then you'll know. It's better to know. In my case, my mother died of breast cancer, so I was having regular mammograms which always came up clean. However, I finally had a suspicious mammogram and didn't get the results for months. I never got the postcard telling me to come in for a followup. I had tried calling for the results and got the wrong answer. One of my teenage sons came to me with a lump in his armpit when I was on chemotherapy. Very upsetting on many levels, let me tell you. Long story short, I'm in remission after four years and my son's lump was benign. I would also like to suggest that you join a high risk breast cancer program at university-based breast cancer center even if your lumps turn out to be benign (as is most likely). This is for women who are high risk but have not developed breast cancer. They will follow you as closely as you need to be and they have the latest information concerning rare and high-risk breast cancer. Once you are set up with them and figure out your breast cancer screening schedule, put it on your calendar. Then you can go on with your life and not think too much about breast cancer. You've taken care of it in a sense and can compartmentalize this part of your life. So you won't have constant anxiety. Right now, I know it's a very anxious time and I wish you all the best. Exercise doesn't spread cancer and can be a good way to cope. Sarah",

      "Content": "There is no direct treatment that can cure the BRCA2 mutation or change the fact that you have it. Normally, the main choices are watchful waiting with frequent follow up or surgical removal of both breasts (and possibly the ovaries). The latter strategy significantly reduces your risk of breast cancer, but your life circumstances have to be considered. Whoever evaluated you for BRCA testing should be able to refer you for help with this decision. If you have not done so already, you should sign up for a high risk breast cancer program in a top quality cancer center to get your follow-up care, if possible. Although having a harmful BRCA2 mutation increases you risk for breast cancer, not all women with such mutations will develop the disease. In fact, diet appears to influence the risk in carriers. If interested, please Google \"What should BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, breast cancer patients and survivors eat?\" Hope this is helpful, Sarah",

      "Content": "Actually, it is not that rare for the receptor status of a new breast tumor to differ from that of the original cancer. This is known as \"discordance.\" While some researchers have attributed discordance between the original and subsequent tumors to be due to problems with the quality of the pathology workup, variations in testing methods and marginal receptor scores, some careful studies have verified the existence of a substantial minority of such cases. For example, one 2010 Swedish study found a 10% rate of discordance in HER2 status between the primary breast cancer and a recurrence. What researchers do agree on, is that treatment of any recurrence or new primary breast cancer should be based on the profile of the latest occurrence, not that of the original primary breast cancer. It is important that you to be treated for HER2 positive disease if this has been confirmed in your second tumor. Best wishes, Sarah Charles",
