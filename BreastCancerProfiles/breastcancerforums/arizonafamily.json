      "Content": "Hello all, I am new to this forum and need URGENT feedback. My mother is 54 years old. She's been dealing with Stage IV breast cancer since April 2014, and is dealing with excruciating pain through out her back, neck, and spinal cord as a result of breast cancer cells in her cerebrospinal fluid. This has been occurring for around 3 weeks now. She has been doing chemo treatments on and off ever since. As of 3 weeks ago, she has been diagnosed with having excess spinal fluid around her brain after experiencing pain around her gallbladder. A spinal tap revealed that their are breast cancer cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. She started full brain radiation twice-a-day on weekdays at that time. Her bladder pain has gone away, but ever since, she has been experiencing excruciating pain from her head, down to her neck and through her spine. She has been on pain meds and steroids to cope with it but she is very weak and bedridden almost 24 hrs a day. At this point, she has been told to complete the radiation on her brain (2 more weeks) before any treatment can be done on her spine. Could this pain be a result of a tumor(s) pressing against a nerve and/or organ on the spine? I'm assuming this is a symptom of Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM). She has been going through full brain radiation treatment twice-a-day on weekdays since after the pain started. Unfortunately, the pain medicine, steroids, and spinal pain has made her so weak, she hasn't made some of the recent appointments. She is either sleeping or in pain. Can any of you relate and/or KNOW WHY SHE IS EXPERIENCING THIS THROBBING PAIN? I saw that their is a \"metastasis breast cancer\" forum already, but I'm just not sure if that is it. NEED FEEDBACK ASAP! Thanks for your time and input.",

      "Content": "I was thinking there could possibly be a tumor on her spinal column from what you said in the \"matestasis breast cancer\" thread about a tumor pressing on the nerves or organs. She has been seeing this one oncologist for over a year now and I will bring up that possibility to her. I will definitely have her sit upright! She is on a 12 hr. dose of morphine as I speak because her spinal pain has been so bad. She also has other pain meds throughout the day. That to go along with the two-a-day radiation treatments is just making her weaker by the day. I will be calling our oncologist about the tumor theory. Thank you again po18guy!",
