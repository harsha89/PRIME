    "Content": "About 6 weeks ago my left breast began to get a little sore and over the next week I noticed the bottom third of breast felt like the tissue was thickening. I thought that the thickening would go away after my period. after my period was over the thickening tissue became hard and is about the size of a golf ball. I called my Dr. and with out examining it sent me for a mammogram followed by an ultrasound. Today I went in and the lady performing asked me to put the sticker on and I didn't know where to put it. She felt my breast and placed the sticker for me. Afterwards I was sent to ultrasound and about 5 minutes after the ultrasound tech was done she came back in and told me that the radiologist said everything was clear and I could go home. He didn't find anything and my Dr. May follow up later. How can I feel with my hand a golf ball size lump with my hand but have absolutely nothing on a mammogram or an ultrasound? My husband feels it, my nurse friend felt it, and the lady who did my mammogram felt it so I know it's not in my head. What could it be? Why is it there?",
