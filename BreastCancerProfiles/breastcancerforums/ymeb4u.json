    "Content": "My mom was diagnosed with brain tumor 6 mths ago, surgery to remove and was coming through pathology that it was secondary to primary breast. No history of b/c...and 6 mths later tumor is back. Oncologist said radiation killed part of the tumor but not the sarcoma part, which is what recurred in same place on front left lobe. She suffered a stroke with the surgery last week. She is 65 y/o and we can't seem to get answers, always waiting for tests that come back inconclusive. Any one had situation like this, and advise?",
