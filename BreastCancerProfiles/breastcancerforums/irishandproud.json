    "Content": "Hi there, My Aunty was recently diagnosed with BC. She was told the lump was small about 1.3 CM in her left breast. She had a lumpectomy where the tumour was removed together with clear margins. Her surgeon told her all of the cancer was removed. He said there was 'traces' in one lymph node. Cancer was HER2 She is to begin chemo shortly followed by Herceptin, Radium and Tamoxifen. If the tumour is gone does that mean cancer is gone and treatment is purely preventative? She is 5 weeks post surgery and did not get her chemo appointment yet - we are worried there could be a recurrence in this time?",
