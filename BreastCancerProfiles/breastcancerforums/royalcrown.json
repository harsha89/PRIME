    "Content": "There is a new study underway that is testing a new lotion to treat RadDerm. It is called the Primrose study and it is for breast cancer patients. I don't know if they will eventually open the study up to include other cancer types, since for now it looks like it is only for breast cancer patients who have or are receiving radiotherapy. The lotion seems to be some kind of new anti-inflammatory. Hope this helps.",
