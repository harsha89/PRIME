    "Content": "I am worried about a friend. She is a 5 year survivor of stage 4 breast cancer ( in one breast) she had only that one removed. She showed me yesterday an area that looks like a bruise ( a red/ purple , quite a large area). Its just above her scar from her mastectomy. ( she did not get reconstructive surgery) it has just appeared in the last week she said. She has not had a checkup in 2 years she told me because of the cost. Could this be the cancer coming back? She asked a pharmacist about it and showed him it and he said if its not gone in a week she should go to the dr. Is this a common thing or should i try and get her to go asap to be seen?",
