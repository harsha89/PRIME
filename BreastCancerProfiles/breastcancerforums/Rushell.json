Within the region there is a 3.6 cm x 1.7 cm ovoid density identified which is incompletely imaged on both the CC and MLO view. There are pleomorphic microcalcifications identified throughout the right breast which are not readily appreciated on the prior examination. Further evaluation with an ultrasound is recommended. There are two round densities identified within the left breast. 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.9 cm in the upper outer quadrant which is likely to represent a cyst. Within the central aspect of the left breast there is a 1.8 x 1.7 x 1.9 cm rounded density which is also likely to represent a cyst. There are also pleomorphic microcalcifications identified within the superior aspect of the left breast which may be related to the previous surgical intervention.

      "Content": "Hello; I am 38 years old and have had 2 lumps removed. Both were said to be benign at the time. The first one was biopsied and removed four years ago from the upper left quadrant of the left breast, the second one was removed with no biopsy from the lower right quadrant of the right breast in 2009. In May I noticed a new lump in the lower right quadrant of my right breast in close proximaty to where the previous one was removed. Rechecked again in June to find it still there but no change in size. (size at that time felt to be approximately 2 cm.) Rechecked the first week in July to find it had gotten slightly larger and is oddly shaped. Does not roll or move. Went to the Dr. for an examination this week and also found out that I have \"concerning cysts\" (his words) found on cervix. Plans to send me for ultrasound and I have already got my appointment for a mammogram for tomorrow morning. I am glad that I am getting my appointments quickly but am concerned. I am hoping that this is not something that was not discovered before, to now be rearing it's head. I recently lost my mother to adenocarcinoma unknown primary and the suspicion is that she had cervical cancer in early years that went undiagnosed before a hystorectomy. Any thoughts would be appreciated, thanks.",
