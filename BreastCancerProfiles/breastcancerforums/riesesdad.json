      "Content": "My wife's results from her lumpectomy showed angiolymphatic invasion and perinueral invasion. They couldn't find a sentinal node and she didn't have the aux node dissection so they don't know the status of those. She's doing Chemo/Radiation/Tamoxifen anyway. My question is: Is there really a difference between the angiolymphatic/perinueral invasion and having positive nodes? They know that microscopic cancer cells have escaped the tumor into all of the above vessels, but isn't that what they're checking for in the lymph nodes? For all intents and purposes, isn't this really the same? I guess I feel that the invasion(s) are really being downplayed, when I do research that shows it to be a huge factor. Any thoughts on this? Anyone here? Dr Leo?",

      "Content": "Hi, My wife is half way through her 6 weeks of Radiation. She is Stage one, unknown nodes (they weren't done) and she had vascular/lymphatic invasion. She had lumpectomy, chemo and now radiation. Her radiation is for 4 different areas, lump/aux nodes/intermammary/supraclavical nodes. I haven't heard of anyone being this sick from the radiation. I know that it can be exhausting, but she can't function, and is so nauseous that she is back on the anti nausea drugs used during chemo (metoclop?) She says that she just wants to go to sleep and not wake up anymore. This is NOT like my wife at all. Anyone who knows her knows she is very strong and does not complain about anything. Has anyone heard of radiation being this bad or should we insist that she has something else wrong and it needs to be addressed? thanks for any help.",

      "Content": "Yes, I'm leaving soon to take her to the doctor. She was feeling better after the chemo, but has taken a turn for the worse now. It's awful since she was beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, now she is right back where she was during chemo. Thanks for the reply",
