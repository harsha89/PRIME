      "Content": "My wife is a cancer patient and she was HER2 positive and estrogen and progesterone negative. She also had one lymph node involved. She had 16 weeks of chemo, Carboplatin every 4th week and Taxol each week. Three weeks after chemo she had a bilateral mastectomy and the Dr removed a few lymph nodes. We got the pathology report after surgery and there was no sign of cancer. The chemo had completely eradicated the cancer. The original plan was to follow up with two rounds (3 weeks apart) of Carboplatin and Taxol. The Herceptin will be continued for a year. My wife is thinking since there was no sign of cancer that there is little benefit in more chemo. The oncologist can't give us any survival or recurrence statistics either way. She is just recommending to follow the protocol. The surgeon said if he was betting he thinks the cancer is gone but can't be certain. My wife is concerned about the chemo side effects and wants to minimze the exposure. Does anyone have experience with this treatment plan and is there a compelling reason to continue with the follow-up chemo treatments? She has a couple of weeks to make the decision. Thanks, Dennis",

      "Content": "My wife is desperately seeking info from someone who has been through a \"chemo-surgery-chemo\" treatment plan. She specifically wants reassurance that her hair will come back after getting zapped twice in such rapid succesion. I posted in another thread and but the responses were from ladies who lost their hair more than once but at longer intervals. Is anyone who has been through this willing to talk with her? Thanks, Dennis",
