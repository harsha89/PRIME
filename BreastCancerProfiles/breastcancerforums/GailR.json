    "Content": "I completed the 2nd of 6 chemo treatments for breast cancer last Tues. Today at work I find that a coworker is coming down with a cold. How scared should I be? I can't afford to stay home until she gets well. We don't sit close, but are in the same room with cubicles facing each other. I had the neulasta shot the Thurs. after treatment. This is all very new and scary.",
