The insurance company wants her to do an open biopsy of my friendly little tumor. If and when it is determined that the little tumor is malignant, they will authorize an MRI to see if they can find any other areas where the little creeps may be hiding. Well that's all well and good. At least there's forward movement. The only thing is that the surgeon is out on medical leave and is not sure when she will be released back to work. She says it may be as early as tomorrow, but she can't guarantee it. She offered me the choice of going to another surgeon to have the removal done. I want to wait and see if she is released back to work this week. I would really prefer that she did the surgery, and I told her as much. If she is not released back tomorrow, I will have to go elsewhere. It's been a long enough wait at this point I think.",

      "Content": "Let me start by saying that I came across this website for a totally different reason than that which I find myself here for now. A couple of you may know me from another forum in which I began this whole journey, so I'm sorry you have to read this twice. I guess you can scroll to the end if you like..... I found a lump in my right armpit a little more than four months ago during a routine breast self- exam. I made an appointment to see my primary doctor, who prescribed antibiotics thinking it was maybe a clogged duct or something to that effect. After no improvement, I was sent for an ultrasound and then to a surgeon. the report showed a 6mm tumor with blood flow. The surgeon I saw at the time felt around under my arm for a couple of seconds, scanned my report, and decided that it was benign. I was in and out of his exam room in less than five minutes. I went home that day and enjoyed my health. Then the thought process kicked in: how can this surgeon tell me that he knows this thing is benign just by feeling it? The report didn't really say anything either way, so where was he getting the information? I called my primary doctor for a referral for a second surgical opinion, which I was able to get approved. The second surgeon did not have an available appointment for nearly two weeks. I waited. The day came for my second opinion. I showed up smiling and confident I would get some kind of answer more appropriate to my concerns. Come to find out, they had referred me to the partner of the original surgeon, and the office staff told me it was pointless to see this surgeon as the two are partners, and he would probably just back up whatever the original surgeon had said, anyway. Bummer. Well, I got back to my office and got on the phone with the medical group and explained the situation to them. They promptly referred me to another surgeon far away from the first two. She, luckily, had an appointment two business days in the future (it was Thursday that I got the referral and she was available the following Monday afternoon). I booked the appointment and waited. Loooooooong weekend. The day came and I went to see the surgeon for my second opinion. This surgeon did a full and very thorough breast exam, really looked at the images from the ultrasound with me, and took a full history. She tells me \"inflammation and/ or malignancy.\" That was not what I was expecting at all. I thought it was a lymph node, but she said it did not feel or look like one. I asked her if we needed to remove it right away. She said I needed an MRI. She spent over an hour with me and answered every single question, never showing impatience. Now it's a week later and the request for an authorization for a bilateral breast MRI has been submitted. I am now waiting for the authorization as patiently as I possibly can. I expect that the MRI will be authorized in the next day, then I can make my appointment. The thing is, I did not expect this. I had no idea that this could possibly be breast cancer. That's what we are looking at and preparing for. I am only 34, and I know that I am definitely not the youngest person to possibly suffer from this, but that doesn't make it any less shocking. I guess that's what I'm in at the moment: a state of shock. I have a fifteen year old daughter I am still in the middle of raising. I'm starting my own company. I have a family to take care of. What is going on here???",

If she is not released back tomorrow, I will have to go elsewhere. It's been a long enough wait at this point I think.",
