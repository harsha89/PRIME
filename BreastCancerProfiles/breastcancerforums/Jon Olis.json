      "Content": "Hi, My name is Jon. I'm an 8 year Stage III Colon Cancer survivor. Was diagnosed at the age of 36 and now I'm doing great. Unfortuneately, now my sister is dealing with her own cancer. A mamogram discovered a lump in her breast that was biopsied and came back positive last week. She was having bad back pain and an MRI identified what the doctors are pretty certain is cancer in her lower back/spine. It seems its spread quite a bit in the back thru one vertabrae and scattered around. Neuro Surgeon and Oncologist think its cancer but are not sure if the Breast was the primary since its small. They do think the back is secondary though and did a CT Scan mid last week and a bone scan on Friday to try and determine if it could be a secondary tumor from some other type of cancer. She meets with the Neuro Surgeon tomorrow to get all the results and see if a firm diagnosis can be made. What he has told her is he would not operate on the spine as its too risky. Only would consider it if pain was too severe or there was a risk of loss of her legs. He said radiation would b the likely course of treatment there. I know we don't have all the information yet but based on my experience with CC people on the forums who are living it are quite educated and helpful. Looking for any advice you might be able to give to help us keep the docs on the right tract or for suggestion for other forms of treatment if it comes to that, etc. Does Breast cancer go to the bones? Thanks for any help you can give me that might be able to help my sister. Jon Olis",

      "Content": "Well, my sister did 2 weeks of radiation and now is on two different treatments, 1 to build the bone and one is an anti estrogen therapy?? She just had an MRI and the tumors on her spine have grown 10% over where they were at prior to radiation. I really need to find out as much as possible about treating spinal mets. I would appreciate it if anyone could share there own treatment plan and how effective it has been. And if anyone knows of any hospitals/drs that are experts in treating the spine for BC mets that would be appreciated. We are in Southern California but will travel if it makes sense. I think its time for a second opinion. She is currently be treated by a Neuro Surgeon and Oncologist at Hoag Breast Cancer Center in Newport Beach, CA. Thanks, Jon",
