    "Content": "hi i'm 20 years old and i found a lump in my breast. i check my breasts regularly and i can only feel it while laying down with my left arm raised and it hurts a bit when i touch it. i know it could be nothing and i'm going to the doctor to get it checked out. i was just wondering if it's common to get lumps in your breasts like before your periods maybe? and if so, how long do they stay there if they're not cancerous?",
