    "Content": "I am a 53 yr old diagnosed this year with ERpositive Ductal Carcinoma right breast. It was a stage II at that time. I am post menopausal. I have had 4 surgeries to finally get all the cancer. The medical oncologist has had me on Adriamycin, Cytoxin, Herceptin, and Taxotere. I am scheduled to start my radiation on 11/13/06. Last month he said I was to have 1 more dose of Herceptin and Taxotere. This past visit to the oncologist he says it is normal to stay on Herceptin for 1 year. I wonder if that is normal or not. A year on chemo seems like a long time to me since they were able to get all the cancer.",
