I didn't know they could monitor your pain while you are under, so that makes me feel better. As well, he ordered some Ativan for when I get to the hospital the day of. I feel quite a bit more relieved now",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, this is my first post on these forums. All my pertinent info should appear below in my signature. In a little less than two weeks I'll be having a mastectomy and an implant put in on my left side and a reduction on my right side. I have received some good advice from others, like buy hoodies and cut the pockets inside to carry the drains....etc. I am still scared to death. I have never been this afraid of anything in my life and I don't like it at all! Even thinking of the upcoming surgery for more than ten minutes puts me close to hyperventilation. The thing I am most afraid of is the unknown. Just going to sleep, losing control, and waking up missing a body part and a whole new one in its place. Can anyone give me any advice to help me with the unknown part... like what is it like when you wake up... emotionally, physically... I can handle pain, I just need to know it's coming. Please help me understand what it will be like when I come out of anesthesia.",
