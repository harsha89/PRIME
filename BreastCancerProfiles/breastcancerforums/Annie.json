      "Content": "Hi ladies, I send hugs and blessings to all of us who are BC sisters. I will be done with my chemo on June 6, 2005 YIPEE -(12 consecutive taxols prior was 4/A/C dose dense)and have had a visit with a reconstructive plastic surgeon to see if I would be a candidate for implants or what my options can be. I still need to complete 35 rounds of radiation yet, but I am forever researching my options. What a shame to find out that I was not told of the microvascular damages that the rads. do to your lungs, heart, etc. and since I had chose a lumpectomy (recommended to me by breast surgeon) that my chances of infection due to microvascular and germs left behind are high for implant. Ofcourse I want my \"girls\" to be as perfect as can be, but now I see I have maybe three choices. #1. Implant, and very possible infection maybe treated with antibiotics, and or removal of implant and try again. #2. Mastectomy with implant and NO chance(or minute) of recurring cancer to that breast. #3. See how the lump. breast looks after rads. and have healthy breast lifted and reduced to match rad. breast. I certainly now wish that a BC person or my own doctors would have expressed the whole line of \"what if's\" down to the final stage before I chose to have lumpectomy. Seem's the damages of rads. is and will continue to be thru-out my life cycle. And all microvascular. (Inside) So what am I looking for? Anyone with information of what they choose from lumpectomy stand point. And what it took to get them there. The doctor I saw is an artist in her work, but has caustioned me that implants with lump. do pose a higher risk of infection. Also I am not looking to become Dolly Parton lol, I just want the \"look of cancer\" gone and feel femimine again. Now I am a loose 36C (lol) who knows what the lump. breast will be when done with rads. maybe a firmer B - sure wouldn't mind being a small D since I am 5'10\" and after dieting and excersise I will be back to my 160 lbs.-now 171 lbs. So ladies??? What have you done? I appreciate any information. And if you've gotten this far, GOD BLESS ya's!!! God bless all. Peace, happiness, hugs and continue to let the sunshine in!!! Annie S.

      "Content": "Hello, I'm worried about the difficulty of coping with the catheter, the level of pain and possibility of radiation burn, and radiation exposure to other areas of my body. I've read the MammoSite literature which makes it all sound very easy, but when the medical personnel tell me that it has never happened to their patients, the truth is they have had very few patients. My reason for considering the MammoSite treatment is that I understand that a smaller area is radiated and that there are less side effects from the radiation, i.e. heart and lung damage, than when the whole breast radiation, and less damage to skin and tissue. Does that theory hold up in real time experience?? Thanks for any info. Annie Online",

Second I must let you all know that I had called my Radiation Oncologist to let him know that my onco. wanted me to take Taxol (Taxenes) because as he had told me I was NER2NEU Post., well my Rad. Oncol. said he was looking at my reports and I am NOT POSTITVE but I am Negative. SHOCK. He was to call my oncol. to make sure he had the same paperwork and to ask what he had stating that I was Postitive. So now here is the next line of questions since I am so totally confused!! My stats are as follows: Infiltrated Ductual Carsinoma ER-, PR-, Her2-, Ki-67 60% (? I have no clue as to what that is) No Nodes were involved, margins clean, lumpectomy 3cm with 3 cm of clean tissue. I am 50 yrs. old Sentinal Node Biop. (3 nodes all clean), Premenapausal. I have three sessions of Adromyicin & Cytoxin w/Krtril (Alozi), Decadron, Ativan & Emend. I continue with Emend days 2 3 & 4 2 x's daily. Warafin (Blood thinner) daily. I am on Dose Dense of every 14 days. So now the burning question of ISN'T this ENOUGH treatment yet? Or is Taxol still necessary? Thank you all again - Many Many HUGS :)) Annie S[/i]",

      "Content": "First thank you all for your responses to my questions of HER2NEU. Second I must let you all know that I had called my Radiation Oncologist to let him know that my onco. wanted me to take Taxol (Taxenes) because as he had told me I was NER2NEU Post., well my Rad. Oncol. said he was looking at my reports and I am NOT POSTITVE but I am Negative. SHOCK. He was to call my oncol. to make sure he had the same paperwork and to ask what he had stating that I was Postitive. So now here is the next line of questions since I am so totally confused!! My stats are as follows: Infiltrated Ductual Carsinoma ER-, PR-, Her2-, Ki-67 60% (? I have no clue as to what that is) No Nodes were involved, margins clean, lumpectomy 3cm with 3 cm of clean tissue. I am 50 yrs. old Sentinal Node Biop. (3 nodes all clean), Premenapausal. I have three sessions of Adromyicin & Cytoxin w/Krtril (Alozi), Decadron, Ativan & Emend. I continue with Emend days 2 3 & 4 2 x's daily. Warafin (Blood thinner) daily. I am on Dose Dense of every 14 days. So now the burning question of ISN'T this ENOUGH treatment yet? Or is Taxol still necessary? Thank you all again - Many Many HUGS :)) Annie S[/i]",
