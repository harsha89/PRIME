    "Content": "Hi I am 30 years old. I had my uterus and cervix removed 4 years ago but still have ovaries. I found a small hard lump in 10/04 and went for mamm and US. The lump I felt is a sebaceous cyst. US found another solid hypoechoic nodule measuring 4mm. I cannot feel that one. They told me to come back in 6 months. I went on 4/14/05 to have another US and the nodule has grown slightly and now there is another one. Again very small but described as solid hypoechoic. I go today for FNA. Is FNA going to tell me for sure that this is b9? What does solid mean? What does hypoechoic mean? Thank you",
