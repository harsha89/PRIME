      "Content": "Well, I normally would not ask people to go off the board, but it seems this lady is asking for information that may help her mother. I did not want to post information or links to info that might be considered spam only to be thrown out of the forum for that would not help anyone. If anyone chooses to email me for more information outside of the forum then that should be their right as it is their right in choosing to be at this forum. How can people help each other if they aren't willing to look at all options? I understand the importance of keeping the forum free of spammers, but some people have different opinions of what \"spam\" might be. For instance, it really boils down to each persons perspective. I have a great many links to information that would help families here on this forum, however, should I run the risk of someone not educated in orthomolecular science reviewing the material and because they happen to be of a different belief, maybe educated only through the medical mainstream, they may not understand the importance of providing for the body at the cellular level. There was actually a senate bill passed in the 90's that prohibits doctors of the mainstream medical from sharing any information outside of chemicals (drugs), radiation and/or surgery for people suffering from disease. Now that really limits the options for familes when there are proven facts provided by the Nobel prize winning scientists for their discovery. If we limit access to this vital information only because someone may construe sharing links with others here as spam, then that vehicle is not made available and choices are limited. The fact is that people are suffering and dying from a lack of knowledge. That is very apparent from the posts at this forum. All I can say is to please help others find the solution they need and deserve. Let them be the judge. I am In SERVICE and want to share what I know with the world, just like the other researchers that have found the scientific community. The health care crisis that is facing millions can be turned around, what it will take is a new advanced heatlh care program and I am happy to say, that health program is here today. Make the time to learn more. Thanks Ammy [email protected]",
