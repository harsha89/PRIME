    "Content": "I would like some help understanding a couple of things. 1. My grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer 15 years ago. 2. Underwent a radical mastectomy 3. Treated with Tamoxifen for the following treatment period. 4. She has had no problems for the past 15 years, now she is 91 years old, and has been in very good health, despite her advanced age. 5. She has been complaining about pain at the site of the mastectomy for the past couple of months. 6. Just underwent a biopsy of the site last week, and recieved her results today and the Doctor told her that she has lobular carcinoma 7. Not sure of the stage yet, she is going for a CT scan later in the week and then meeting with MD next week. Now the question: With all of the information that I have read, the one thing that is fuzzy is, can it be possible to be diagnosed with Lobular carcinoma on the same side where she had the radical mastectomy? Wasnt all of the breast tissue taken? and Could it be possible to have a recurrance after 15 years of survival (on the same side) or could this be totally unrelated? Any help or information that anyone has would be greatly appreciated. Thank you T.S.",
