      "Content": "Hello, I started having issues with my left breast about 4 weeks ago. I thought I had a breast infection because it was heavy, painful and uncomfortable. I went to urgent care and got a ten day round of levaquin and the doctor said it would probably clear it up in a week or so. Well I finished the medicine five days ago and the breast is still bruised, tender and has a solid mass inside. Tonight after my shower there was bright red blood dripping from the nipple and that scared me a lot. I live in the sticks so I made an appointment with Rush hospital to get a checkup and maybe a biopsy. I take pretty good care of myself but I have mild MS and I take a lot of medicine for that. Cancer is rare in my family so I don't know what to think. I did some research and came across inflammatory breast cancer and hoping I am wrong. Thank you for reading. Wiz",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by PWife How did your tests come out?? Thank you for your concern PWife. My tests were extensive and expensive and I finally had surgery at the end of October on BOTH breasts. There was no cancer in either but the right side had atypical cells so next week I need to see a local oncologist for a risk assessment. The stitched areas are healing slowly too. I also have MS and this caused a bit of a flare up with that, so I have been a mess but I am getting better. I upgraded to premium insurance for next year just in case I have lots more going on after this.",

      "Content": "Thanks Didee! I had an ultrasound and mammogram yesterday and my appointment with the surgeon is on Monday the 19th. I feel like things like this should be done immediately, it is weird having a bleeding breast, and going on each day like nothing is wrong. I am the most health conscious person in my family so this was very unexpected. My sons and my older brother both smoke so if I end up with cancer their lives are going to be filled with misery from me nagging them to stop immediately. Whatever happens, I will make this result in some sort of positive outcome. Originally Posted by Didee Hi, welcome to the forums. I am so sorry you are having these problems. It is such a horrible time waiting for tests and results. Good luck with your biopsy. Please let us know how you go. We are here for you.",
