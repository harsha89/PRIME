    "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March, 04. Had a masectomy on my left side and 4 rounds of chemo. Lymph nodes were negative. THEN in November, I decided to have my other breast removed because of several risk factors. To my utter surprise, there was a .7 cm tumor in it also. The first tumor in my left breast was 7.5 cm x 3.5 cm, pretty big. In the first tumor the path report said estrogen/progesterone negative; her2 negative. The right breast's report was estrogen/progesterone negative, but the her2 was positive! Does anybody know if this happens often? My doctor said I was a very unusual case and that he was going to call other doctors and do more research from University of Alabama. Anybody heard of this before? Please help!!! I'm to see my doc on January 6 and he's to tell me IF I'm to take chemo again! Don't know what to do????? Thanks!",
