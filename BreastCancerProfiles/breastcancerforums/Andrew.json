      "Content": "Have you tried any alternative medicine treatments? It sometimes happens that the conventional medicine alone is unable to help a patient, but if one uses methods of both conventional and alternative medicine, it may often yield good results. A good idea could be to find some medical doctor who utilizes both traditional and alternative methods. I recommend that you read the information at www.WeHealCancer.org, they describe various approaches of this kind to advanced cancer therapies. They are able to provide longer and better quality life even to patients with advanced cancer. You can get the impression of what they actually do from several patients testimonials provided there.",
