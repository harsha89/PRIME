    "Content": "The Radiologist at our local Cancer Center said he believed that chemotherapy in my case would be overkill because my test returns show me to be low risk for reccurrance and I had effective surgery. I had been staged as a II for IDBC and after having a trial treatment of cryoblation followed by a lumpectomy the surgeon and the medical oncologist, at a different cancer center, were advocating that I have chemotherapy. But after seeing the radiologist and weighing his statement I have cancelled the chemotherapy. Has anyone else chosen to forgo chemotherapy?",
