      "Content": "Sir; for a physician you are quick to jump to conclusions with little evidence to back them up! Even some of your 'facts' are erroneous. Although the State of California has deemed the miniscule quantities of coal tar in soaps and shampoos to be 'carcinogenic' there is very little evidence to back up this claim. As for coal tar soap being 'banned in the EU' nothing could be further from the truth. It can still be bought in many outlets across the EU - and especially in the UK where the leading brand (Wright's Traditional Soap, formerly Wright's Coal Tar Soap) can only be purchased in packs of 3 or 4. The only sops to the court's claims have been the legally enforced 'warning' (but only legally required in California) on the packaging and one manufacturer reducing the coal tar concentration from 1.1% to 0.5%. Although my late wife and I preferred a more pleasently perfumed soap for our ablutions we nevertheless bought coal tar soap for our labrador dog in preference to the many possible dog shampoos. Why? Because he suffered from a skin condition that defied diagnosis and cure despite the effects of it being plain to anyone. The skin on his chest would start to weep thick, smelly puss and his fur would come out literally by the handful. I tried many expensive remedies before I started his regular bi-weekly bathings with Coal Tar Soap which totally cleared this up and kept it at bay for the rest of his life; a further 8 years. By the same token many thousands of psoriasis sufferers worldwide are relieved of many of the symptoms of their disease by the use of Coal Tar Soap. Please do not forget that under FDA rules almost anything could be classed as carcinogenic should it cause tumours in specially bred lab rats - bred for their tumour sensitivity - if it causes cancers in more than 30% in any batch that is exposed to the suspected carcinogen IN ANY QUANTITY! I now have two labrador dogs as company for me after the loss of my darling wife of 37 years, both 'rescue dogs' and I will be purchasing some more Coal Tar Soap to give them their monthly baths. I doubt that they or I will see any skin cancers in our lifetimes from its use and I strongly urge anyone who has any skin or scalp condition that responds favourably to Coal Tar products to continue to use them. Please do not be swayed by the venal 'verdict' of one Californian jury!",

She had a partial mastectomy followed by chemo and a partial reconstruction and since takes regular doses of Tamoxifen. She has been diagnosed as clear at every yearly check-up since and seems well on the way to acheiving a ripe and fit old age Good Luck.",
