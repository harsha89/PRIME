      "Content": "Well it is hard to relive what they did but my friends started a site for me. I have my story but they do have a donations tab. Not looking for that here as we are all i the same boat..lol We are just stay at home moms so she is working on an official blog this is all new to me. It is fightfortrina.com. Just see my story page. I will pull this off if I break a rule. It is so very hard to have cancer but the added stress is killing me, it is worse than the cancer. I have to carry the burden of being my own doctor too. Guess I went to the breast cancer as that is what I have but connecting with any type is great. To see what others do in this situation. I am exhausted by fighting so much so I can't focus on the cancer. I see people getting great care and it is frustrating to me. I thought I can't be alone. I hear many other stories from my place but the people have all passed so that doesn't help.",

      "Content": "Thank you so much for the support. The link was www.fightfortrina.com you can copy and paste it if it doesn't work =) I end up spending hours researching trying to be my own doctor which is hard as I have 3 kids who need me too. I can handle a few mistakes as people are human but it never stops and sadly I am not educated in the medical field so I don't have the knowledge to protect me. They now put me on Tamoxifin which for some reason my gut feeling wasn't good but honestly mentally I had no problems trying it. A few days on it and my kidney hurt then dark urine with a bit of blood. I stopped it and called my doctor and she claimed it was a urine infection. When the tests came back normal she tried to say I passed a kidney stone. When I had stopped the taxoifin all the signs went away. She insists I try it again and the kidney is already hurting so she wants more tests. This makes no sense to me, this is in the warning label?? Any thoughts? She also says being on Tykerb and the tamoxifin is sufficient care and I don't need the chemo or Rads unless I want to speed up the work. I really like her but wondering if this is right.",

      "Content": "I am 36 with now stage IV breast cancer and have been left fearing care by my healthcare provider after massive mistakes on me. I am just wondering if there is anyone else in my boat who might understand what I am going through? I have 3 kids so I can't type everything but I do have a website and not sure if that is okay. Not selling anything just has my story on it. But my care is scarier right now than my cancer and I feel so alone. Wondering if there is anyone who is in the same boat.",
