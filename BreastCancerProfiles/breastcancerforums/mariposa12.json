      "Content": "Hello all, I am 46 years old and recently got diagnosed with DCIS. My doctors recommend I have a mastectomy because of the margins and the size of one of the two areas (it is also high grade). I just finished a very stressful time in my life (school) and so I want to see if rest and changing my diet can help me get through this without surgery. Also, does anybody know about DCIS support groups online? Thanks for any information you can give me. I appreciate it and blessings to everybody out there going through this.",
