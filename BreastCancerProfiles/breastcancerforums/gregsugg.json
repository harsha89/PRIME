    "Content": "I'm writing to try and find some peace and guidance for my wife and myself in helping my mother-in-law through a long battle. Any experiences will be appreciated more than you know. My mother-in-law had BC in 2006 and then in 2008 it came back in her brain and liver. After radiosurgery, the brain has been stable since. Just before Christmas 2009, the Oncologist pulled her off all chemo after having used 3 different types. She is currently at 18 months since the cancer came back; but since Dec 09 (when she was still living on her own and driving herself), she has gone downhill rapidly. She needs help in getting up and down, sleeps probably 50% of the time, and has to have fluid (5+ liters) drawn off her abdomen weekly. The doc said don't expect more than 4 months. (That was about 6 weeks ago) Does this fit in with any experiences you guys have had? Thanks, Greg",
