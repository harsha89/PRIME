    "Content": "Hello, I am just starting on this journey and will be having my 2nd chemo treatment this week. My hair started falling out last week so I went ahead and shaved my head. I have two sisters that were insisting on shaving their heads in support but I was absolutely against it. I'm really not sure why it upset me so much but I tried to explain to them that it made me very uncomfortable and I didn'tr want to have to look at them and it be like looking in a mirror. I should also say we are not close and have not had much ch contact in the last 10 years. One of them went ahead and shaved her head and I believe the other one will too. Should this really bother me so much? Should I be touched that they were willing to do this? Age at diagnosis 54 Post menopausal ER pr negative her2 pos Stage 2 Occult primary",
