    "Content": "Hi Forumer, I am new to this informative forum. I have a recurrence of breast cancer that has metastasized to liver but not any other place. I have been under treatment of this for last 2 year with various drugs but one that is appeared to be working is Abraxane. I have gone through 3 cycles of it. The SUV numbers have gone down and the size of tumor is steady. Unfortunately the Abraxane has caused severe itching all over my body. It keep me awake at night many a times and also during the day. It is so sever that I have scratched myself to the point of bleeding. I need help to see if anyone of you have had the same side effect and found some cure/remedy to reduce the intensity of this itching. I have tried benadryl, Zertec etc. but no success. I am wondering how long does one take any of these antihestimine drugs to see its effect. Also are there any shots that should be taken before Abraxane administration? The cold packs seem to help but still significant itching remains. Please help and share your success on getting rid of this itching. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Dee",
