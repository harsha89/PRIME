      "Content": "Thanks Roxanne. You sound like you have experienced what I am about to do quite well. I understand about the pain and catching it before it starts; where I am anticipating having some difficulty is when they want to give me benadryl, valium and scopalomine at 10 am when the wire localization isn't until 11:30, dye injection at 12:30 and surgery at 2:30. Because I am allergic to so many drugs, and any ONE of the above will knock me out, I am hoping that they will let me bypass them and just have the anesthetic at the surgery time. My understanding is that they will be giving me lidocaine to numb the breast prior to the localization; they didn't give me anything for the double core needle biopsies except lidocaine and I did fine. I worked in Canada for a naturopath/homeopath for a number of years, and I have done root canals with only homeopathic remedies, no tylenol, nothing. So I know homeopathy works for me, I am hoping the anesthesiologist will be accepting of that. As far as I know, they are just doing sentinal node biopsy; unless the frozen section shows something, in which case the will do the axillary. I will take your advice to heart, however, about the pain meds afterwards! And I am sure I will be eating something before, since I will have had nothing to eat for 24 hours by the time I get home tomorrow night. Thank you for your response; I hope your Easter was wonderful. We spent ours wallpapering our guest bathroom! Blessings, Diane Originally Posted by Roxi1 It is the Anesthesiologist who will make all the difference in terms of the after effects of any surgery. So talk to him/her. You will see him right before they take you into the operating room. There are very potent anti-nausea drugs out there now. There is minimal pain with a lumpectomy (you aren't have an axillary node dissection too, are you?). and the trick of any pain, is to take something for pain before you experience pain; as pain after surgery increases quickly; starting as a slight pulling or stretching and quickly exaccerbating to deep pain. After surgery, I took my pain pill as soon as I got home (make sure you have a little something on your stomach, or you will become nauseated); even though I wasn't experiencing pain. Then went to sleep. Took pain pills every 4 hours after that the first day. Gosh, listening to your life circumstances, it never rains but when it pours. How awful about your husband losing his job, the sale of your home, etc. You will have to take one day at a time, and not look to far into the future. Do what you can today, and then try not to worry (easier said then done, I know). Happy Easter many hugs let us know how things go Roxanne",

      "Content": "Hi Roxanne: I agree with you about the drugs! I had a wonderful experience (given the circumstances!) yesterday. The surgeon agreed I didn't need the drugs if I didn't want them (they are the standard run down here - apparently most women want to be \"out of it\" for all the pre-op stuff - personally I would rather be aware and alert! Neither the wire localization nor the tracers were painful (like you said, nothing like the biopsies!). I did take the benadryl and pepcid immediately prior to surgery as they were to prevent any allergic reaction to the massive amounts of blue dye they were about to inject in the OR (Have a long history of weird drug reactions). The sentinel node was clean - now we wait for 3 days for the actual biopsy of the nodes to return. I slept well when I returned home. I am using mainly homeopathy for the pain and nausea (of which there was very little surprisingly). I have used tylenol extra strength twice and slept for 3-4 hours each time. The breast pain is almost nonexistent (even tho I am not wearing a bra) and the node site is tender and achy (the reason I'm not wearing a bra!). You have no idea how helpful you have been with your encouraging emails. I am the first of my friends to go through this, and with my mom having her third go-round at the moment I don't want to ask her a lot of questions. Plus she hasn't experienced this procedure, so she wouldn't be of much help! Thank you again! May God bless you abundantly for your care and commitment to this site. Diane Originally Posted by Roxi1 Hi Diane: Gosh, I don't think you need all those drugs prior to the wire localization or the dye. I had both. Didn't have anything for either of them, other than the local anesthetic. That was sufficient. Really didn't need anything else. (and I am the biggest pain whimp that has walked the face of the earth) the wire localization was a piece of cake; especially compared to a biopsy. The radioactive dye/tracer used to be very painful (burning pain, like bee venom); but they have since diluted the tracer, so it is nothing either. maybe you could discuss this with them, especially if you have these adverse reactions to those drugs. Blessings back Please keep in touch Roxanne",

      "Content": "[c olor=indigo][/color] I am scheduled for lumpectomy and SNB on Monday 3/28. I have infiltrating ductal carcinoma 1cm, ER+/PR+ Her2Neu -. I am here from Canada with my husband who was transferred down here with work. His job was terminated the day we got the diagnosis, and we are now faced with selling our home at the same time I am having surgery, and he is looking for another job back in Canada (not allowed to stay in States with visa we have). Has anyone out there had lumpectomy in Atlanta recently that can give me some advice? Also, does anyone out there have any experience with doing this using homeopathy (not for the actual lumpectomy, but for pain management and nausea post-op). My mother was just diagnosed with her third go-around in the same breast (she had a radical mastectomy in 1983, then the cancer resurfaced in 1994 in her pleural sac, same side; treated successfully with Tamoxifen until this month, when it has recurred as a small lump in the surgical scar from the original mastectomy - she starts radiation in April in Canada.) We are feeling just a bit overwhelmed. Any advice or guidance from survivors would be greatly appreciated.",

      "Content": "Thanks for the support. It is encouraging to me to read some of the postings from women who are currently going through what I am about to begin - and everyone seems quite positive about everything. My biggest fear is the anesthetic as I don't respond well to it at all. My previous 4 operations (other female plumbing stuff) were at the same hospital with the same doctor and anesthetist, so they knew me well and were able to accommodate my weird allergies, etc. Thank you for your prayers; I will include you in mine as you go through AC. Happy Easter! Originally Posted by sgishelly Wow...you sure do have a lot going on!! I didn't have my surgery in Atlanta but I grew up there and lived there for 35 years. there are some really wonderful surgeons there. My mom also had BC about 9 years ago and she lived there and had her surgery there. I did go for a consult there when I learned about my cancer. The doc I saw was wonderful!! But he was not on my insurance so he sent me down to Moffitt Cancer Center which is where I ended up. Good luck with selling the house and I'm praying for both you and your mother.

      "Content": "I am, at present, undergoing 6 sessions of Taxotere for advanced Breast Cancer. Original breast cancer was 10 years ago and was treated with chemo and radiotherapy. I have been fine ever since until the end of January this year. The reason I am posting is because one of my side effects of the Taxotere is having a very sore nose. It is extremely painful and dry and feels like I am constantly congested and bleeds. However, I have found a simple solution that really helps. I use the 'Breath Right' strips that adhere to the lower part of your nose. I can't tell you how much these have improved my breathing and reduced the bleeding. I would recommend them to any of you who are suffering in the same way. Give them a go. I was unable to get a decent nights sleep. I was waking up every hour or so unable to breath through my nose. This obvioulsy, meant that my mouth was open and was getting very dry and sore and was not helping with the mouth ulcers. The strips have solved this problem. Also, I had lots of problems with mouth ulcers which were horrendous. Washing my mouth out with soluble asprin (spit out after rinsing), 4 times a day, really helps. Try and do it about 15 minutes before mealtimes. Probably best to check with chemo staff that it is ok for you to do so. Both of the above bring such relief and have helped so much, I just felt that I couldn't feel the benefits of this without passing it on to others. Hope this is helpful for you if you are suffering in the same way.",
