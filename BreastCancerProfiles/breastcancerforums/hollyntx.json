      "Content": "Hey ladies I am 29 and had surgery to remove a very large benign tumor. It started out at 5cm and within a week grew to 10cm. It was unknown if it was malignant or not so the dr wanted a biopsy and to remove it. So I had my very first surgery ever...on my 29th birthday in Dec...lol...and was really scared. I did not know for 2wks if it was cancer or not. Thankfully...it came back as a fiberadenoma..beging. My question is bc it grew so fast and large...what are the chances that I will develope breast cancer or that the tumor will come back? I have also two smaller unknown masses in my other breast that will need an ultrasound in a few months to try to determine if they are cysts or not. I am scared and worried so any adive or thoughts is appreciated.",

      "Content": "Hey ladies a brief info I am 29 with some family history of cancer in both sides. No breast cancer as far as I know. I had a very large 10cm baseball size Fiberoadenoma removed 5 months ago from my left breast. I found the tumor myself and schedule a doc visit. This is my first breast issue and was my first mammo/us. Now the mammo did not find anything in my right breast BUT the u/s did. I have two very small masses in my right breast around my armpit area. They did not remove them but wanted to see me back in 6 months for another u/s of that breast. Well last night at my gfs I was showering and was able to feel a small marble size hard mass that was a little sore but not very movable. It's kind of on the side of my breast near my armpit so I am a little worried. I am calling my dr tom to schedule an u/s to find out what it is.",

      "Content": "Well the ultrasound tech said she did not see anything in my breast..so that is good news. Just waiting for a confirmation report that the radiologist did not see anything either. So far so good! Thanks al for your support and prayers! I am still going to do my monthlys just to be on the safe side so if something does show up, i can catch it early!",
