      "Content": "Good evening all. I am making the transition from working with researchers in respiratory genetics to breast oncology, with a focus on young women. This is a relatively new focus separate from the overall realm of the field due to how it affects young women in a slightly different manner. Has anyone read any good books or websites with information on the topic? I have a good basic understanding of the cancer itself, but I would love to read some more! Any and all responses are appreciated!",

Those asking for surveys, research questions, donations for money are usually banned so please keep this in mind if you post again here. Thank you Didee. Due to the psychological responses to most diagnoses within our studies due to it exclusively focusing on young women, I feel it can come in handy hearing about how carers have dealt with it as well and how they communicate to those affected. I pardon for any infringements I may have caused.",
