      "Content": "Hi everyone! Can anyone pls tell me about \"CyberKnife\" technology for killing cancer cells. PPL who are totally ignorant about this here is a bit of it(The mind-boggling technology, CyberKnife, which promises to treat deadly cancers has come as a miracle for those who gave up hope. The bloodless and painless surgery is performed by a robotic system, using artificial intelligence.) My relative went through an operation for breast cancer and now chemotherapy is going on I heard about this robotic treatment and am keen to know if it helps and avoid complications during chemotherapy. Any comparison in two .. I would appreciate your help guys. thanks. Neeshu.",
