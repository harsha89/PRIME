      "Content": "Hi Lola, My mother has ovarian cancer and I am currently fighting breast cancer. My mother had a lot of fluid retention and yes they can and should have tested the fluid for the cells that cancer gives off as waste. That is basically what the fluid is. The reason it builds up, from my understanding is that the cancer is not something that is supposed to be in the body. For this reason there is no where for the waste to go but to build up in the body. This also causes the discomfort, and I am not sure they can ever take it all out at once. There is no real set area that it all accumulates in. The only way to not have the fluid build up is to not have the cancer. As far as your doctor or the receptionist, the doctor or nurse should be the ones you are requiring answers from. In my opinion it is something they should be doing well. Answering your questions to where you are comfortable with the answers, if not you need to stress to them how important this is to you. I keep telling my mother and sister, who has taken over helping my mom, that the doctors work for them. The doc is a great person but he is human too and sometimes they get desensitised to cancer patients needs because for them it is a daily thing, over and over again. I am not saying they are bad in any way just sometime we as patients need to remember that we are in the drivers seat with our own care, or our family members care. I hope this helps a bit. Anything else I can do just let me know. Good luck..... Jodilinn",

I have a lot of things that put me at a high risk of reccurance and would like to do as much as possible to lower that. The triple negative makes any preventive after my treatments not viable. Also if there is anyone out there in a similar place. Most of the people I have come in contact with are older. I also have a mother with stage 4 ovarian cancer. What do you think about having ovaries removed? Thanks, Jodi",

      "Content": "Hello Peggy, I am new to this site, and just read your post. I had a rare but severe reaction to the taxol that caused me to go into respitory distress. Everyone thought it was over when treatment was over yet two weeks later after telling every one how bad it was and ending up in the ER they finally took me serious. After all kinds of breathing tests and arterial blood gas tests, they finally decided that I was having a more prolonged reaction to the taxol. I am now on two inhalers daily and have one for emergencies. I hope you have found out info by now from your physician's, if not I would be happy to talk further. Take care, Jodi",
