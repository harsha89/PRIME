There is no one else to take this girl & i can tell you she is a hand full at the best of times \" spoilt rotten to boot it all off Im just going totally nuts my friend lives 8 hours away & she's covering alot up, I only found out she was terminal over the weekend thanks to one of her friends ringing me & telling me exactly what was going on.. Her cancer is in both lungs one breast & now a small sign in her hip.. Im told its a very aggresive cancer & her time is limited.. They stop her cemo this week, The hardest thing is she still thinks theres a cure out there & is hiding the truth from her daughter.. The truth is??? I just dont know how to deal with it all or if i can??? Im so scared I will fail them both in the long run.. Her friends say she may have weeks maybe months the dr's wouldn't be clear but the pallitive care team has spoken with them to be prepared to find her dead at any time basically.. Im planning a trip this week to find out how she is for myself but i know Im going to have to be the one to try & make her face reality, she thinks she will get into the drug trails in melbourne but I really cant see that happening, she also thinks she's going to be able to go to a horse show with her daughter in febuary & is promissing her this... This is all so screwed up.. Dose anyone have any advise on how to approach any of this...",

      "Content": "Thanks Brainman, Now you mention it, It does sound like Beaches,, I spoke with my friend today & told her I new the hole story, we had a good talk & I understanding her need for hope now.. as thats all she has.. The cancer started on the outside of the lung she had cemo & when finished they basicly told us it wasn't cancer??? A month or so later her nipple inverted & she was diagnosed with breast cancer,, Started her on the next lot of cemo, then half way threw they say its not working & they were stopping the treatment,, One lung is apparently like a spiderweb in the exrays with a small spot showing on the other lung.. My friends biggest argument its it's not in the lung I dont think there's much difference is there wheather its inside or outside of the lung..She claims the spot on the hip hasn't been confirmed as cancer, The Dr's aren't sure.. She was still holding hope that there is a cure for her I dont know if I did the right thing or not but I told her straight that there isn't just things to help the quality of life & sometimes giving a few extra months..I think she really listened this time but she said she still needs to go to Melbourne have all the scans & tests again just to be sure & I totally understand her need to do that now..
