    "Content": "Yes, it's possible that you could have IBC. It's also possible that you could have Paget's disease of the nipple, or a benign condition. You really need to have a breast surgeon do a biopsy or biopsies and determine what's wrong. I hope and pray it's something that is benign. However, IBC is highly aggressive and deadly, so you can't sit around and do nothing for 6 months (as is sometimes suggested). If possible, find a doctor who is familiar with IBC. There are now 5 or 6 IBC specific clinics in the US. If you are near one, that's where I'd go.",
