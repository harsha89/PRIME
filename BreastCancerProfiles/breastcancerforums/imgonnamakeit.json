      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I don't know what's going on with me. I went through 7 weeks of radiation at the end of last year and it was, for the most part, pretty easy. I had a few days where I felt pretty tired but that didn't last long at all. My problem is that here we are at the end of May and suddenly I'm feeling sooo exhausted. I am sleeping through the night but I wake up feeling sore everywhere, really tired and not myself. I've ALWAYS been a morning person. Up with the birds, tons of energy, can walk about 6 hours every Saturday, go to the gym about 4 times a week and now I can barely drag myself into the office and keep myself alert. Today I worked from home and I had to take a short nap. Even after that I'm still tired. I saw my family doctor yesterday and he thought the tiredness should be over soon. He mentioned that I had done so well during radiation that perhaps this is a delayed symptom. Has anyone else experienced this? It could also be that my husband (who had both hips replaced one year apart) is still on disability and I'm feeling the crunch financially as I'm the breadwinner. I guess I do feel depressed sometimes and even sometimes a bit upset about having to do all the financial stuff (which I dislike). I don't like this feeling AT ALL. I already tried taking Effexor (which is an anti-depressant) but that was for my hot flashes as the oncologist wouldn't let me go back on my bio-identical hormones during radiation treatment but, since the radiation ended and I had horrible side effects from Effexor (fatigue being one of them!), I've gone back to my bio-identical creams. In the past (and I had only just started one them before my 2 lumpectomies), they worked beautifully so my doctor doesn't think the hormones are causing any side effects. Hmmm....so it's either the delayed radiation effects or depression. I don't like the sound of the latter as I've always been a happy gal. Somehow I feel sad or ashamed at even thinking I might be depressed. Now that's a session for the psychiatrist I guess! So my wandering question through all that mess above that I've typed, is whether anyone else has had this delayed symptom of extreme tiredness 5 months afterwards? Thank you.",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, I need help in figuring out why I'm still tired and have insomnia. I finished 7 weeks of radiation for DCIS on 12/23/04. I've been taking Effexor XR for hot flashes (75 mg daily) and I've been having a terrible time sleeping through the night. I usually wake up between 0330 and 0430. During the day, I feel like I can nap but when I try, I never can get to sleep. I also have a terribly dry mouth all the time. I am VERY tempted to go back on my bio-identical hormones which I only took for 3 1/2 weeks before I was diagnosed with DCIS. I felt so normal during those 3 1/2 weeks - no hot flashes, night sweats, my memory was better and I slept wonderfully. I'm wondering if anyone else is taking Effexor XR and having the symptoms I describe? I can't imagine it's still the after effects of radiation. I just can't keep this up. I can't get back into my normal routine because of this tiredness. I'm feeling depressed about all this and here I am taking an anti-depressant (for hot flashes not depression!). I am most always a happy go lucky woman but these days I feel my strength waning. Any advice ladies (or gentlemen)? Thank you.",
