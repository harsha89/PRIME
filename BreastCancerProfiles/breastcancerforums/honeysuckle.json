      "Content": "She was diagnosed in May 2007, scheduled for surgery in mid July but this was cancelled after the CT scan showed that her cancer had spread to her bones. The oncologist said that it showed heavy concentration in her right hip, leg and spine. Yet they have only put her on a hormone blocker (can't remember the name) thus far. Her oncologist is on vacation in Damascus. Her nurse co-ordinator at the breast center is also on vacation. Mother thinks she's going to be okay on this medication but I don't think she realises how grave her situation is. I am dealing with two family members who have cancer - mother and sister! Not an easy place to be at the moment. Any advice about what I should do regarding my mother? I plan to make calls tomorrow to her general doctor to see what he thinks about leaving her until September to be treated.",

I can't remember the name of the drug mum is on (her cancer is estrogen/progesterone related), and so far she's doing fine on it. I am not looking forward to chemo with her because I've gone through that with my sister and it's not fun to watch them. Thanks for the responses. I've been telling mum that she needs to continue exercising (walking at least) but she's never been super active so that's not going to happen. Oh well.",

      "Content": "Well I am back to this board with not good news. My mother was diagnosed with state II breast cancer two years ago. She was not advised to have surgery but instead she was told that a hormone blocker medication would shrink and contain the tumour. Roll forward two years later, and she now has cancer in the lungs! They gave her 3-4 months to live She is now having chemo and they are hoping that this will give her more time. Has anyone gone through this and survived for any length of time? Should we pay more attention to her 3 months rather than think she will have 3-4 years? She is 76.",
