      "Content": "I need some information. I just recently found out my Mother has breast CA. She is hormone negative, but HER2 positive. It's been about 6 weeks since she had a mastectomy and 8/14 lymph nodes were positive. We were told that they had gotten everything. Now the PET/CT scan shows to nodes under her subclavicle area on the right side. They have started her on regiment of Herceptin and Taxatear (not sure of spelling). One treatment a week for 3 weeks, off a week, then one treatment a week for 3 weeks, off a week, and another 3 sessions, offe a week. Then she's to have another PET/CT scan. I'm interested in knowing the following: 1. Success in HERCEPTIN against the HER2/NEU. 2. Survial rate for HER2/NEU 3. Actual testimonies of people with HER2/NEU 4. Herceptin and hair loss. I am the primary care giver, and I have read and done research, but I would feel better talking to someon that has already been through this. I just feel so helpless and I want to give my Mom the best that I can give her or make availabe to her. Please help me....",

      "Content": "Thanks so much for your reply. I do appreciate it so very much. I know it's a big concern to her already, about losing her hair. We have gotten 2 wigs and serval hats, so we have the bases covered. I'm worried, because she seems to get depressed a lot. When you were going through treatments: 1) How long before you hair fell out? (she's on treatment 3) 2) How long before you white cell count dropped? 3) Did they limit you on where you could go? (They said to be carful of crowded places, because of germs) (She loves to go to BINGO) 4) How long before you drove? (It's been 8 weeks and she won't drive) 5) Did you feel trapped to your home? (she says she does, because of the treatments, that she can't go anywhere, because of germs) 6) How long after treatments before your hair started growning back? I appreciate you taking the time to talk to me. I pray God's blessings on you for your help. Barbara",
