      "Content": "Hi Jan L! I'm a new member as of today! Just saw your question. I've had both \"boobs\" removed since March, 2004. The latest surgery on November 11. I had tissue expanders put on both sides during my latest surgery. They are painful!!! It took me about 5 weeks before I could even sleep on my side! I thought something was wrong, but my doc said everything looked great! (Men have no clue! LOL) Got \"pumped up\" again today and it didn't hurt near as much! I think I might have had so much pain because my right one was put in right after my masectomy. My left breast was removed in March and so it didn't hurt so much! But it does get better after there is some healing! Good Luck! Let me know how you do! Polly",

      "Content": "Hey Jan! I had a masectomy in March and then chose to have the other breast removed in November because breast cancer was so prominent in my family history. My surgeon said I was being silly. Lo, and behold, there was a .7 cm tumor in it! Thank God I listened to my plastic surgeon. I was just going to have the breast cleaned out with nipple saved, but he recommended that the entire breast be removed so both would match during the reconstruction procedure. The latest tumor was also Her2 positive which is definitely not good. Another reason to be thankful. The tissue expanders were very painful to me at first (the first 4-5 weeks). I think because they were put under the chest muscles (which is best). But now 7 weeks later, I'm feeling really good. I'm up to about a B size and don't even have to wear a bra! It's great! I'm 53 years old, in good shape, 138 lbs. so I think I might stop soon at this size. Keep at it - it's worth it! Have a great day! I pray that 2005 will be better for all of us!!! Polly[/u]",
