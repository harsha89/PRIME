    "Content": "I'm sorry all my info is a little vague but I'm getting it 3rd hand. I'm just trying to get an idea of what to expect from someone who's gone thru it. My mother-in-law was recently (as in last week) diagnosed with breast cancer. On Wed she had a lumpectomy. They removed the cancerous lump and a few other spots of cancer cells. They determined it was stage I. She was told that in 3 weeks she'd be going to daily radiation treatments. I do not know the dosage or how long she's supposed to have it done or any other details than that at this point. I'm curious as to what the side effects are and how she'll be feeling afterwards. She watches our 2 young (under 5) children 3 days a week. Plus we were planning a weekend get away for their 50th anniversary in 4 weeks along with a party on their actual anniversary date in 8 weeks. I'm wondering if she'll feel up to going on the trip (it's about a 2 hour drive for a stay in a bed and breakfast, nothing strenuous) and the party is just 20-30 people at a local restaurant. If you don't mind sharing your stories, please explain how you were feeling after radiation treatment. Is it worse early on or does it worsen the longer you receive treatments? Thanks",
