What I feel inside is that during the time to reconstruction (in about one year - my surgeon said) I do not want to wear it as every time I put it on - it is like if I say \"I am ashamed of myself\" And still I cannot go for the courageous decision - what about others?

But today I started to go out without a bra and no fake devices either - feeling really good about it. But when I go to the fitness, for example, if my instrutor knew about the condition, he would treat me as \"sick\" and give me only very very easy exercises. So sometimes I still prefer the hiding",

      "Content": "Could you tell me just - what is dx with ILC I am from Sofia, Bulgaria and even as a translator from/into English I do not know these abbreviations. I think I am at the limit between stages IIB and IIIA, but it is IIB that my surgeon wrote in the diagnosis. Thanks a lot for the encouragement - the important think is not so much how bad the chemo is, but what will happen later - one year from now, for example. I wish you to have all things clear of further complications, too. The therapy - as I was informed - comes from USA and the laboratory where the vaccine is done is there. So I hope that there will be somebody acquainted to give some more information about it.",
