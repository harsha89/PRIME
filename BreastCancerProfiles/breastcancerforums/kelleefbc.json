    "Content": "Hi all, I am new to posting here. I am in the middle of my chemo. I am doing dose dense (every other week) with Neupogen for 7 days after the chemo dose. Finished 4AC, moved on to Taxol/Gemzar last week. My premeds were oral Decadrom 20mg evening before, oral Decadron 20 mg that morning, IV Benadryl 50mg plus IV Pepcid at 9:30 am. I had a reaction to the Taxol early on during the dose (wheezing, flushed red, hot, neck and back pain). The reaction cleared when the Taxol was stopped. They gave me more Benadryl and Decadron IV, then the Gemzar. They had started the IV slowly (25ml/hr). The tubing was primed with Normal Saline. The reaction occured just into the 2nd hour when the rate was increased to 30ml. I was told that the rate was as slow as they can go with the port I have. It seems the protocol at my clinic is to discontinue Taxol if there is a reaction so I would just get 3 more doses of Gemzar. Makes sense. But, a friend who worked at another large clinic near here said it is possible to try again to avert the allergic reaction to the Taxol. I am somewhat comfortable with not getting the Taxol because I am getting the Gemzar. But not entirely sure yet. I don't want to have another reaction, it was pretty darn uncomfortable, but I don't want to assume I can't complete the full treatment if that is the best prognosis. Has anyone out there had any experience with this Taxol reaction and trying again or not? thx. kellee",
