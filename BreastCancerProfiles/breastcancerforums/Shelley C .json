      "Content": "I just found something in my breast, I wouldn't say its a lump (like a pea or anything) just something. The breast has been very itchy for the last couple of months maybe. Not right on the nipple but to the side of the nipple. Also, I noticed a bit of swelling in my armpit. It is my intention to call my doctor first thing in the morning to investigate but I am just curious if these symptoms are typical for breast cancer. By the way I'm Scared To Death!!! Thanks for your help everyone",
