      "Content": "HI I am 48 (47 and perimenopausal when diagnosed in Jan 05) with ER+ Lobular Invasive Breast cancer, Stage 1. Small tumors in the breast, but spread to one lymph node. I had no chemo or radiation, but had a mastectomy. My onco thought that I would not benefit from chemo and that hormone therapy was the way to go. So, I went on the TEXT trial, which supresses my ovaries with a monthly triptorelin shot and then I take a daily exemestane pill, which is an aromatase inhibitor that I take instead of tamoxifen. I have been on the trial for 6 months and now have the option of stopping triptorelin and getting my ovaries out instead. I was all set to do this and then got to wondering what the postmenopausal ovary does (even the docs couldn't tell me beyond that it produces trace amts of testosterone). Noone seems sure of the longterm side effects of triptorelin either. The progression into menopause has been easy (minimal hotflashes, etc) except my hands are a mess. They are swollen and tingly and have a lot of symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. Does anyone else have these side effects? The docs don't seem to know if it is the triptorelin causing these symptoms or just the resultant lack of estrogen. Do you have an opinion on ovarian suppression using drugs (triptorelin) vs. surgical removal?",

      "Content": "HI Is there anyone out there on triptorelin? I am now in menopause thanks to triptorelin and while menopausal symptoms have been mild, I have a lot of tingling in my hands that is similar to carpal tunnel syndrome, and stiffness in my fingers. There is also a numbness at the tips of my fingers. Anyone else experience similar problems on this drug?",
