      "Content": "I just had a biopsy on a breast mass and lymph node last week and lidocaine was used to numb the area. That stung a bit and when he hit a nerve in the armpit - wow! Even with the lidocaine. I hope you doctor was only referring to general anesthesia. I recommend a local one for sure. Originally Posted by mary_athens_greece I am scheduled for a needle biopsy on Monday, to examine two cysts identified in my left breast yesterday, on mammogram and ultrasound. My OB said there is no need for anesthesia and that it is uncomfortable but only lasts for a short time. I don't actually trust his pain assessment as he is not the one taking the tests. I would appreciate info from any lady who has gone through this procedure. I am definitely having the biopsy, I just want to be prepared for what is in store and need to know if I must have someone there with me or can I just go in alone? I don't have much of a support system, so I will need to make extra arrangements if I need to be accompanied. Thanks for any input you can offer!",
