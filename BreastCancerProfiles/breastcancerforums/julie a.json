I have had fibro for a long time with flares here and there, nothing that stays like this. I used to be able to take Aleve and feel better. Nothing seems to touch this. I would love to hear from anyone who knows what might ease the pain some. Exercising helps, I am better moving than sitting, but get too tired on the move all the time. I feel like I have done everything they tell you to do as far as after care goes, diet, exercise, rest, but no one seems to be able to tell me how to get through this. I feel like I am getting depressed too. That might be from the tamoxifen.I am normally a very upbeat and positive person.I am 52. I had three tumors, one in the duct and two infiltrating. They think by taking the breast that they got it all, but used the chemo and Herceptin as reassurance.",

I started taking Arimedex in Jan. Went off of it in Mar. I have fibromyalgia and the joint pain was too severe. My Onc. put me on Tamoxifen about 3 wks. ago. I felt better when I was doing chemo! I have a lot of muscle and joint pain. I went back to work in March and am having much diffuculty. I clean an apartment complex, and by the time my day is done-so am I. I feel that my quality of life is not what it should be. My Onc. says it takes time for chemo to totally leave the body. Don't get me wrong I am greatful that I am doing as well as I a am and that I have survived this. Does anyone else still have so much fatique and muscle/joint pain? I feel like someone slammed me with a board, I am that tired! I am thinking that maybe I should find another line of work.",
