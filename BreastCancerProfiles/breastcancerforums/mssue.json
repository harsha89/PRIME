      "Content": "Hi Kristen, Thanks for asking,I'm sure she would appreciate being thought of. Well she had her 2nd treatment Tuesday,this week, and she's been nauseous(sp) every since . There are too many drugs out there for her to suffer through this, she needs to let the doctor know.She lost her hair last weekend,You know that's always traumatic .She's trying to keep her chin up-her counts have been such she did have her 2nd treatment ,I hope they continue to do so.She's lost a little more weight ,the fluid is all gone now which may be part of the loss.She's doing well though considering all of the challenges. I hope You are doing well-haven't seen You post in awhile.Thank You for remembering my Sister-God Bless You! Merry Christmas!!! (((HUGS)))",

      "Content": "I copied and pasted this email to share with all of You-I found it most interesting-different views of coping with the things in our life...Hope You Enjoy... Your scars are beautiful. They are the brushstrokes in the masterpiece that is your life. Ancient legend tells of the powerful Amazons, a race of one-breasted female warriors. These fierce fighting women, known for their skill as archers, underwent voluntary mastectomies so their breasts would not interfere with their aim. Their very survival depended upon the radical surgery. Legend also tells of the Scythian culture in which women were expected to fight alongside the men. A mastectomy of the right breast was performed on female infants to prevent weakening of the pectoral muscle on that side. This ensured the girls would be able to brandish a sword with power and skill. Scholars debate whether there is any truth behind these popular stories, but Ã?? true or not Ã?? the tales provide us with a thought-provoking way in which to reframe the way we see our scars. Instead of looking at the scars on our bodies as reminders of illness and weakness, we could look at them as evidence that illness and weakness were removed from our bodies, making us more powerful than we were before. We could take pride in our scars because they are proof of battles we have fought and won. They speak of our courage and resolve. They tell the stories of our lives. As we age, our faces and bodies naturally develop lines and wrinkles in addition to the scars that result from accidents and surgeries. Instead of fighting the lines and wrinkles with cosmetic surgeries and hiding our battle scars as if they are shameful or embarrassing, why not look at them as evidence of the rich collection of experiences that have shaped our characters over time and made us who we are today? Each of us is a miracle, and each of us is a masterpiece of the Creator. One-of-a-kind. No two alike. A singular work of art full of power and promise. Rejoice in all of your brushstrokes! Heavenly Father, help me to remember that I am Your creation and that everything You have created is perfect and beautiful. Amen -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roger and Kathy Cawthon The Cancer Crusade",

      "Content": "Hi Kristen, Actually her doctor suggested that we have our daughters tested for mutated genes,her daughter is 19 mine is 14.You see my Aunt(Mothers side)had breast cancer,Mom Ovarian,Sister Cervical,me Breast,now my sister again with ovarian.I assume I would have to go back to the onocology doctor for testing wouldn't I? I am glad that Your Sister's cancer has been caught early if that's what it is.I didn't know there was a her2nu website,You'll have to educate me.I am in menopause,I'm not really sure how it's classified,You know perimenopause or what, but I haven't had any spotting or anything since February 2005.They told me that the chemo I recieved would put me there. One thing that kind of concerns me is that when I had my yearly check-up(pap-smear) I had a different Doctor this year,my old one retired.My old one upon finding out about my Mother and all did a vaginal ultra sound to check my ovaries.It's kind of scary that they have such a hard time ,until it's already progressed to later stages,of detecting ovarian cancer.My new Doctor,even though I said something about it to him,didn't seemed concerned and did not do the test.This was in September 2005,now my sister is dealing with that exact thing.I think I might find a different OBGYN.I just finished reading an article on MSN that said Breast Cancer survivors are at a higher risk of developing another cancer elsewhere in the body caused from treatments-Bummer-I can't remember it all,You can go to www.msn.com it's there this morning(12/24/05). let me know You thoughts. Smile and have fun today-",

Sometimes I find it difficult to figure out if it is muscle ,nerve or bone pain.Sometimes the pain is not actually where the problem is- my pains like to travel LOL they stay on the fast track some days -then other days I'm fine.My PT made a point of letting me know that chemotherapy-no particular one-can cause peripheral nerve damage.I have trouble with my legs going numb,can't stand or walk for very long,they prescribed nuerontin about 1800 mg daily - I must admit it does seem to help prolonging the times I can stand or sit-I'm still in therapy though. Maybe You could talk to Your regular Doctor and maybe they can possibly refer You to physical therapy- aquatic therapy was great the water is very warm and soothing,and the exercises are so easy,I couldn't continue traveling to the center where the pool was(about a 50 mile round trip)but my local hospital has some wonderful Physical Therapist. It's just an idea -I know how it feels to get all the test and then they come back negative-this is great in it's self -but then You still don't know what the problem is-we just have to keep searching.My thoughts and prayers are with You-let us know what You find out.

Alot of people have introverted nipples and never have a problem,but if you have never had a check up maybe it is time,besides you are never to young to learn what to be aware of concerning your health.I am sending you my best wishes and prayers too! {hugs}",

I'm still having a hard time with several things like my Sister looks to have aged 15 years,I can't believe it,I know people in my family don't age well but that much change so suddenly???I felt terrible and I know it didn't make her feel any better when she finally got her room at the hospital almost every nurse that came in thought I was her daughter,there is only 7 years difference between us, I think word finally got around and that all stopped.She has been through soooo much, she hasn't had time to greive for her Husband yet.By the way 10 days before her surgery was due her husband of 28 years had a massive heart attack and died he was only 50. And to top it all off they look to be at a stand still with the clean up of Hurricane Katrina. I parked down at the beach and just cried--there are still people living in tents,some have fema trailers others don't -what few restuarants are open close at 2 or 3 in the afternoon because they don't have people to work.Alot of the trees that were left along the beach still look like they've been ravished with cotton and debri,all of the beautiful old homes that survived Camille back in the sixties are gone now.The beaches are still full of debri ,water and sand and can You believe they are still finding bodies. I am soooo glad to be back home(NC), but sad at lifes circumstances.Please remember to pray for all the people down there that everyone else seems to have forgotten. God Bless You All (((HUGS)))",

I'm new here-hope I'm doing this right .History-diagnost on Aug 29th 2003 found lump in right breast-after mamo suspicious calcifications they thought in left breast-right side was just a cyst.After needle biopsy found it to be cancer,infiltrating ductal carcinoma, early stage 1, 2 to 21/2 cm had mastectomy bilateral on the left side removed about 16 lymp nodes all negative her-2 neu+.Since mastecomy no radiation,with four rounds of a/c.Finished up in January of 2004.Have kept all follow-up appointments.Still have rib pain al the way across the front of the rib cage,sometimes my entire rib cage hurts so bad I can't lay down-they have done bone scans and a ct scan to no avail.This is I guess something I must live with I guess since there seems to be no evidence of anything showing up.Right now my main concern is my remaining breast.About two and a half weeks ago during an intimate moment with my husband I started having severe pain in my breast-since then I have really sharp pains -it's not just the nipple but about half way up my breast,it doesn't look any different I can't feel any lumps-But it's so sore I can't stand to touch it,now that is constant,the stabbing pains just come and go.Is this normal ,does it just go away?I've got alot of other issues to top this of ---I lost my job last month and I'm waiting for my Cobra to be finalized so that I have ins. again.My gynocologist retired in Dec.04-my family doctor had an accident and know I hear he may not be coming back to the office. I guess my basic question is this something that happens to everyone -can it wait-should I be concerned.Sorry to go on like this-hope this makes sense.If some one could shed some light on this I would really appreciate your help.Thanks for your time.

If I'm not mistaken for staging and grading it is 1 thru 4. It's really hard to say anything else without more information.

      "Content": "Genes Discovered That May Predict Breast Cancer Spread to Lungs -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finding could one day help doctors better tailor therapy for patients, study says By Kathleen Doheny, HealthDay Reporter Today's Health News WEDNESDAY, July 27 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have identified a set of genes that seems to predict if breast cancer will spread to the lungs and how serious the disease will be. The finding could eventually help doctors to predict whose disease will become aggressive and spread, and potentially help them to better target treatments. The lungs and the bones are frequent sites for cancer that spreads from the breast. And cancer that spreads from the breast to organs such as the lungs accounts for the majority of breast cancer-related deaths, research has shown. \"We are the first to identify a clinically relevant set of genes that can predict metastases [spread] of breast cancer to the lungs,\" said study co-author Gaorav Gupta, a graduate student and researcher at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. A report on the finding appears in the July 28 issue of Nature. The researchers began with a set of cancer cell lines from 82 human breast cancer tumors. \"We used a mouse model to mimic metastases,\" Gupta said. \"We take these cells and inject them into a special type of mouse that allows you to inject human cells into them. We allowed lung metastases to form. We took out the lung metastases and took the cells and asked, 'What is special about these cells that will allow them to create the metastases?' \" To answer the question, the researchers used a \"microarray\" technique that allowed them to look at 22,000 genes all at once. Then they identified the genes that created the cancer spread to the lungs, and then put the genes back into the original cells to verify they were responsible. Then they took another look at the human tumors. \"We asked, of these 82 tumors, which ones expressed our genes [identified as those responsible for the spread]. We found a subgroup that expressed the genes and these patients were much more likely to develop lung metastasis.\" Next, said Gupta, the research team hopes to repeat the findings in a larger group of patients, \"to be certain this isn't just something unique about the cohort we selected.\" If patients with these genes can be identified, the next avenue of research would be to figure out if there are specific drugs that could prevent the lung tumors from forming. Certain \"inhibitor\" drugs have already been shown to suppress the genes identified in the new study, Gupta said. William C. Phelps, scientific program director of the research department for the American Cancer Society, praised the new study, saying, \"Being able to identify a patient with a higher probability of developing metastasis would be of tremendous importance in terms of managing these patients.\" The severity and course of cancer, even the same type, can be very different from patient to patient, Phelps said. \"One of the decisions to struggle with is what [treatment] to give to which patients,\" he said. \"Obviously, if you know cells in a particular tumor will be more likely to spread to the lung or bone, you would treat these patients more aggressively.\" The identification of the gene pattern is a first step, he said. \"If we can identify those genes, the next step may be to target the genes for therapy to prevent the spread of the tumors.\"",

      "Content": "Hi Jill, It seems that it is a safety measure especially the altering of the 2 test.I'm glad You have a Doctor that is keeping a close check on You-alot of people aren't as forunate.We all know that early detection is key to staying on top of this disease and keeping it at bay.And yes anytime a person is diagnosed with cancer the chances of reoccurance are greater than in someone who has not been dx'd. I didn't realize until very recently 2 to 3 wks, that there is such a thing as Kidney cancer.My husband just passed a kidney stone and going through all the testing,xray,ct and such they found a mass in the same kidney the stone was in-mind You, he just passed a stone a year ago-there was no mass there 1 year ago.Anyway from what I've read for the size of the mass it would be considered a stage 2 (w/kidney it's staged between a 1-4) although it looks like it hasn't spread we won't know for sure until after the surgery this Friday,they will be removing his entire kidney.If it hasn't spread, with this kind of cancer there is no other treatments,no chemo or anything as long as it hasn't spread.So wow surgery can cure it although since he has had it now there is a chance he can have it again.I - we just keep praying to get through this and for his comfort -I hear it is a very painful surgery.Oh and by the way if he hadn't been passing this kidney stone they would not have found the mass-they found it accidentally-it would have been there growing,because like most cancers we aren't even aware they are there until they start producing symptoms which is usually in the later stages with poorer outcomes . Well You keep us posted , my thoughts and prayers are with You. :P I am feeling alot of different emotions this week,but for today -my birthday I'll take and keep praying. ((hugs))",

I just returned from getting a CT scan done , I was stuck 4 times before they were able to thread the cathider(sp) through. I had an MRI on Friday 2 sticks, blood work yesterday 3 sticks. My veins keep blowing or collapsing whatever You want to call it. Right now my whole arm is sore-there has to be something I can do to make it better. As bad as it hurt today, I felt sorry for the guy who did the CT scan, he kept apologizing for so many sticks ,it wasn't just him someone else was called in too. The same thing happened the last time I had this test done,same guy then too. I told him it was not his fault, but what could I do to rebuild my veins -the only thing he knew was to hydrate myself well before blood work is drawn-that still wouldn't help in this particular procedure. I have never had this problem before,then again I've never been stuck so much in my life as I have been the last 2 years. I thought that was the reason for having a port put in for treatment, to save my veins. Looking back at it now- the chemo still runs through the veins -so damage still happens. Does anyone have any suggestions, I would really appreciate your input. Thanks, Sue",

      "Content": "Hi, Thanks , I believe if I use all of the suggested methods there should be no problem with sticks. I'll find out the next time , when it's time. Since I last posted I've done a little research and I'm wondering if anyone else might have tried a supplement called Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins or for short OPC's? If so what were the results? From what I've read it's a grape seed extract or pine bark extract. The principal uses of this supplement are strengthening blood vessels,reducing inflammation,hemorrhoids ,edema.I know there is no magic pill but I'm already taking several different supplements that I know have been the reason my cholesterol and tryglicerides(sp) have came down. Because I take an antacid everyday ,as it gets rid of stomach acids, it also deprives my body of some of the B-vitamins it needs and so on.So the supplements have definitely been helping-I try to make sure I'm not taking anything that would counteract with anything else,I do research that before starting. With the OPC's I found that if You are taking blood thinners that it should only be taken under a Doctors supervision. If I can't find enough info. I will ask a pharmacist or Doctor about the effects of a supplement. I know that when I've asked the Doctor about different supplements ,in the past, they really were not very knowledgable about the effects nor the use of them. Something must be working for me though because the proof is in the results. I go back Tuesday for the results of my MRI and CT scan. I'm there with Ya Kristen-waiting. May we both have good results. Thanks everybody for your input I will use Your suggestions when preparing for my next trip to the Doctor. I am going to do more research-if anyone else has used this or knows about it ,the OPC's,let me know. God Bless You All! Sue",

      "Content": "Dear Becky, I sure hate hearing you have had to go through sooo much. If I remember correctly on the Herceptin it is given for 1 year.I didn't have it though,it was after my treatments were complete that they finished the study on Herceptin and found that in women with early stage BC it help reduce the risk of reoccurence,I don't know the percentage,but I'm sure it can be found on the internet. Anyways,I really wanted you to know that you are not the only one who feels that way,about them getting all of the cancer and you still having to take all of those treatments .My sister has been thru cancer 2x this last was stage 3 ovarian after what they call debulking surgery and getting all of the cancer she too is expected to have a years worth of chemo. She had 3 treatments before the surgery 3 more after now they want another year .I know she feels the same way you do.She's so exhausted too from all of it.My heart goes out to you but know that you are not alone.I check in pretty regularly I'll be lookin' for you and feel free to email me thru the site here.Please take good care of yourself,whatever you decide to do.

I posted it on the General Cancer Forum.I would like to find out what You all think if you have time,they call it Debunking Cancer Myths,I know I've actually thought of some of this myself. My Mother died from cancer along with lots of other relatives,but my Mother's cancer was found too late.They said it started in her ovaries and spread through out her abdomen,to other organs.She was only checked after I insisted that she go and get a knot checked out that came up on her upper abdomen,we really thought it was hernia,so did the Doctor.When they cut her open they found the cancer ,everywhere.You know people tend to run around like a chicken with their heads cut off when this kind of news hits.Everyone was saying that during surgerybeing opened up the cancer coming in contact w/air caused it to spread.Mind you this didn't come from the Doctor-I'm not really sure where it came from-it was debunked in that article though. That was thirteen years ago,my Mother died 3 wks before my Daughter was born.I've never questioned the coming into air contact subject,my knowledge about cancer its self was really not what I wished it would have been back then. Well maybe I shouldn't go in to deep-I really just would like to know what you think after you read the article.Your input would be greatly appreciated.Thanks! God Bless You!",

With the A/C it's the adriamicyn that makes your hair come out ,its red in color. Does she have a wig or scarves or hats? Even knowing it's going to happen ,doesn't really make it any easier for most anyway.Alot of people cut their hair really short when it first starts coming out ,for some they have woke up to most of their hair on the pillow -it's still difficult to deal with-but it goes with the territory,we're still living! I'm a little surprised they are already giving her something to boost her white cell count,though I know everyone is different, If I remember correctly,for myself , it was after my second treatment that they gave me Nuelasta(sp). I was given that twiced after 2nd and 3rd treatment. Tell her to listen to her body,when fatigued rest,try and eat more fresh veggies and fruit-and to drink alot of water especially the day of treatment and the next day too,that way she will flush out her system -those chemicals are not something you want lingering in your kindneys nor bladder. I'm so glad you are able to arrange your schedule . Your Mother is very lucky to have you.Don't forget to take care of yourself too! Care Givers get tired too.Stay strong and God Bless You!",

Good luck on your journey-I'd be interested to know how things go for you.Make sure You write down any questions you may have for your Doctor.My thoughts are with You! Best Wishes!",

      "Content": "Hi! Though it might well be something that doesn't happen very often (men w/BC) does not dismiss the fact that it needs prompt attention. I am on the opposite coast from You so I'm not much help with the availability of any surgeons in Your area. While it could possibly turn out to be nothing more than an infection , it could very well be more.Anyone who has dealt with cancer knows that it does not discriminate. With that being said if I were You I would get on the computer find a Hospital,maybe a training hospital if possible, but check out their staff for possible Doctors that specialize in BC and call them,let them know Your concerns and what is going on with You and about Your Mother too! The worst thing that can happen is that they don't have a sooner appt. right-but You will have peace of mind in know that You are covering all bases. I just went in to Genetic Counseling,if I test positive that means that there is a big chance that I passed that mutated gene on to my kids,boys and girls,even if they are never diagnosed with cancer the gene could still be passed on to their children ,my grandchildren. I'm not a Grandmother yet Te!HE! But that is still a concern of mine. Times like this are very taxing on our well being so try to stay as calm as possible, write down Your thoughts and any questions that You want to ask the Doctor and take someone with You, if for nothing else but support.But sometimes when someone else is there with You they might remember something the Doctor said that You may have missed. Let me know how things turn out,these sites are really helpful when You need support,understanding and for answers to questions,they helped me through many sleepless nights. I'll be praying that it's nothing,I'll be thinking about You over this Holiday weekend. I also wanted to mention that if incase it turns out to be the dreaded thing-as far as insurance and all there are also medical trials to check into. Try to enjoy the weekend-we are here if You need us. Hugs",

      "Content": "Hi Danielle, Glad to hear Your Mom is doing well, I hope it continues. I agree with Nancy , it affects everyone differently. With the A/C it's the adriamicyn that makes your hair come out ,its red in color. Does she have a wig or scarves or hats? Even knowing it's going to happen ,doesn't really make it any easier for most anyway.Alot of people cut their hair really short when it first starts coming out ,for some they have woke up to most of their hair on the pillow -it's still difficult to deal with-but it goes with the territory,we're still living! I'm a little surprised they are already giving her something to boost her white cell count,though I know everyone is different, If I remember correctly,for myself , it was after my second treatment that they gave me Nuelasta(sp). I was given that twiced after 2nd and 3rd treatment. Tell her to listen to her body,when fatigued rest,try and eat more fresh veggies and fruit-and to drink alot of water especially the day of treatment and the next day too,that way she will flush out her system -those chemicals are not something you want lingering in your kindneys nor bladder. I'm so glad you are able to arrange your schedule . Your Mother is very lucky to have you.Don't forget to take care of yourself too! Care Givers get tired too.Stay strong and God Bless You!",

      "Content": "Okay,since I haven't had a period since February of 2005 but had one a few days ago, lasting 6 days. Started out with spotting but extremely painful cramps,the cramps remained through out and the spotting turned to a light flow.Am I still in menopause? And as for the hot flashes...I have had them for years but awhile ago I started having a flash then getting a chill. Then a constant onslaught of extreme heat. I started looking for some releif, I found Black Cohosh. As far as the Black Cohosh is concerned, I did research and cross referenced it with other meds I'm taking but you know what,in thinking about it, the way ovarian cancer-along with other cancers run in my family my chances of reoccurance are pretty far up there.I think the biggest thing I was looking at was the fact that my BC hormone receptors were negative. So my cancer was not spurred along by hormones but by something else.The hot flashes I was having weren't flashes anymore, more like a ravenous forest fire burning out of control,they would start about 3 in the morning and last until 10 or 11 at night, seeming to get hotter as the days went by. This went on for several weeks,I tried to talk to all of my doctors,reg Doctor,Onocologist,Gynocologist,even told my Orthopedic-EVERYONE shrugged it off as if it were nothing and here I am getting to my breaking point-I had already asked all of them about the Black Cohosh,nobody seemed to care one way or the other or didn't know anything about it -then shrugged it off. It really did give me some releif for awhile, but since having a period I have slacked off and am maybe only taking one a day and actually skipping somedays. Now they are back to 'almost' regular flashes,2 or 3 spells a day.LOL - I can deal with that!!!I can't take the all day ones though,if they come back - I don't know what I'm going to do. What does everyone else do-please tell me I'm not the only one having them like this(the allday ones),please....",

      "Content": "Hi Honey, I am sorry to her of your Mother.Although mine (cancer)was caught earlier,I recieved Adriamycin and Cytoxan.I didn't get the Herceptin. It wasn't until I had finished everything that the FDA,Doctors or who ever realized or passed the use of Herceptin, in patients with earlydiagnoses & her2nu positive. My harmone receptors were negative also.As by reading my log at the bottom you see mine was caught alot earlier than your Mothers but that is not to say that they can't help her because soooo many studies and trials have been done to this date,that there is so much more hope out there. And yes , I think the main point of the Herceptin is to reduce the chances of reoccurence. They all have thier side effects ,I lost my hair too, even when You prepare yourself for that one it is or can be very emotional,as it begins to happen alot of people go on and shave it off or trim it real short so that it's not as devastating,but have a wig or scarves or hats ready in the event it does happen and the Doctors or Nurses will be able to tell you if this is a side effect of this medicine.Actually You can look it up yourself if you haven't already done so. I don't know if any of this helps. I noticed the date on your post I don't check in often enough I suppose.I am sorry it has taken this long for someone to get back to you.Usually the Ladies here(including myself) are right there,please forgive us. Being a care giver can be really tough,but your Mother is very fortunate to have your support and care while she goes through what I'm sure is the biggest challenge of her life.Loving Daughters,may we all be so lucky to have at least one.God Bless You and your Mom! {{{{BIG HUGS}}}}",

      "Content": "Hi Barbara, I am not sure if I can answer all of your questions but I'll try. 1 - You said she is on her 3rd treatment,it really depends on the combination of drugs they are using and everyone is different.My treatments were every three weeks.My hair started coming out around the time for my 2nd treatment. 2 & 3 - There is a thing called a Nadir (sp) period,usually around the second week after the treatment(really depends on the chemo recieved)the white blood counts can drop making you more subseptable to infection.If the counts to get too far out of range they may need to give her something like Neulasta to bring the counts up in order to continue treatments.I had the Neulasta twice it can cause alot of bone pain-but it is doable. 4 - I never stop driving(like I said though mine were every 3 wks) 5 - I never felt trapped - to me it was more like a safe haven- a good place to rest-and believe me -she'll need alot of that. I was told that during my Nadir period too stay away from crowds,but that if I had to go out use a face mask ,you know the paper ones or a scarf to cover the mouth and nose.Tell her to keep her hands wash ,that is how alot of germs are passed,going into market places and such really are full of germs ,it's better to be safe than sorry. If you get sick while going through treatments it can get serious fast because your immune system is down .Be cautious please ,and if food seems to have a metallic taste switch to plastic wear. 6 - My hair was slow to come back,it actually had little spurts of growth here and there through treatments,but it felt different.My scalp stayed tender for quite some time and it was hard to keep my head warm -it was winter time.You loose alot of heat out the top of your head ya know,I started sleeping in hats because I couldn't stand sleeping with the covers over my head LOL! Try to stay level headed,worrying doesn't really accomplish anything and only makes you feel worse.Start looking at the positive side of things to pull you up out of depression,not that there aren't going to be days that you want to cry,yell, be mad or sad and that's ok,we have to get it out of our systems,it's part of the baggage you get with the disease-so vent get rid of it-But on most days please focus on positives or things that make you happy - get out take a walk - visit a friend - go shopping- sometimes anything to get your mind away from the sickness.We have to nourish our bodies and our minds to get through this and that goes for care givers too! Sorry it ended up so long -sometimes I do go on.... Take care and God Bless You ! {{{HUGS}}}",

      "Content": "Hi, Well I have been diagnosed w/cancer,but most of us here have . Thought I'd give it a shot anyway. With a strong Family History of Cancer(different variations) I just went last week for Genetic counseling,they went ahead while I was there and drew blood for the test.The big question for me is if my insurance co will pay for the test,it's like $3000. for it .I'm sad to say most insurance companies will only pay half and I don't have that kind of money lying around,so I'm waiting on the phone to ring to find out that either it won't pay(in full) OR giving me the date that the testing is actually starting,it takes about a month.I have to say for the most part cancer is extremely expensive in its self.You lose time from work,co pays(if You are fortunate enough to have Ins.) out of pocket-deductibles and so on.Thats not to mention everything else this disease robs You of,Your health ,time w/family ,the pain and complications-it is a huge emotional roller coaster ride that no one wants to be on. Sorry to ramble,back to the subject at hand, I was told that if I tested positive I would be presented with different options. Some of those are having a comlete hysterectomy, possibly having the none diseased breast removed ,after hearing that my expression must have changed because theirs did and then they said and well we'll go over the rest if it comes back positive.I think the color must have left my face when they mention removing the other breast -that was something that just didn't enter my mind until they said it. It's alot to consider and probably the only way they would go ahead and do a hysterectomy,since I haven't had a period since Feb. of last year(due to chemo).I mean You can't just go in and say give me one Doc-Ya know. While right now I'm cancer free anything they do would be a preventative measure-and mainly due to these test results. Otherwise according to Family History my chances of dying from cancer are extremely high if I don't take preventative measures ,but then again we all have to go some how,I think when the Lord is ready to take me he will whether I think I'm ready or not ,You know. I'm glad You are cancer free and I hope You stay that way. I don't know if I've been any help ,but I've been waiting to see if someone could give You some advice or opinions on this matter-since none as of yet ,I did. Take care and keep us posted on Your testing-I'd be interested in knowing Your results. Hugs and Prayers",

And because I was scared I didn't take the treatments and it came back and took my life-I wouldn't have done all that was possible to make sure that I was here for my family .Life is short enough,it really makes you look at what's really important-and I'm not ready to give it up. It's probably not going to be easy,there are alot of unknowns,but it makes a world of difference when your family and friends are there for you-you may even find out who you're true friends really are,I know I did.But things are so much better these days than in the past.She needs to get lots of rest and a proper diet,lots of fresh untainted fruits and vegetables. Keep us posted,You all are in my prayers.",
