      "Content": "hello, 45 year old woman - hysterectomy in 2001 on 2mg of estrodial daily. 1 year ago at regular mammo was told there was a lump in right breast and thickening in left. Did a compression x-ray of area on left. said come back in 6 mos. At 6 mos was told they saw nothing. Last month had anotehr mammo and then had several compression pics taken and they sent me for a sonogram. guy doing the sonogram said he saw nothing. they said come back in 6 mos. this makes me very jumpy. THe place I have been going is a smallish, local hospital. Should I ask my doctor to send me to a larger facilty to get a second opinion? and if so, what do i look for in selecting another facilty for mamo and exam? Thanks",
