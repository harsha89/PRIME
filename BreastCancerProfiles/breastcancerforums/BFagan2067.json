      "Content": "Shelly, I had a MRM 5.5 years ago for stage III A BC. I was advised agains reconstruction at the time due to the fact that they knew that I would have to aggressive chemo and radiation (I had a lumpectomy first without clean margins) So I waited until after I was done with radiation on the advice of the surgeon. Well I decided last year to look into reconstruction and was going to have a tram done in June, I was sick on the day of the surgery thus it was cancelled. I then decided I would have it done around thanksgiving but in the meantime have decided not to do it for now... so... I just want to let you know that with one breast (a huge one at that...LOL) I still get along quite well with just the prosthesis. Now a bathing suit can be an issue for me as that I do have a large breast , however where you will be having bilateral mast. then you will be much better able to control the balance issue. There are some amazing mastectomy suits out there, amazing prothesis out there and bras, so that should make this whole thing easier to deal with. Also there are so many reconstruction options that you may find it worth it to wait and explore all those options before having to make a decision in such a short time... My best to you, prayers and thoughts going in your direction... we are here if you need any info! HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Mia, I took arimidex for 5 years... had bone pain initially, headaches and insomnia... took effexor to deal with hot flashes, low dose... this helped with the insomnia too. I finally got the approval for pemerin cream for the vaginal dryness... my onc would not prescribe that initially but researched it for a while before he felt that it was safe to use... some docs still do not prescribe that... I was still doing chemo when I started the tomoxifen and switched to the arimidex so i also had all of that side effects initially... near the end in the last 3 years it was a whole lot more tolerable.. I alway took it at night so many of the stuff happened at night..good luck to you! HUGS!",

      "Content": "Melissa, I was going to have reconstruction last year, 5+ years out of my mastectomy. I researched it all and even scheduled the surgery. I got bronchial asthma two days before the surgery and had to cancel it, I have decided in the mean time not to do the surgery. During this whole process I found a very helpful board, there is even a doc on there who does this type of surgery as well as the DIEP....be leary as that it some ways it is like a huge advertisement for his clinic in New Orleans... however they can give you lots of info... I dont know where you live, I live near pittsburgh, and emailed john hopkins and the surgeon there called me and we had a long discussion on delayed reconstruction... anyways.. here is the link to that board... hope this helps you with your decisions! Click here: Surgery / Reconstruction Board if ths link does not work email me just put the forum in the subject line... HUGS!",

      "Content": "Those people who pay full price are those who are uninsured or underinsured who make to much money according to the the drug companies, the governement... there are a whole lot of people who do not have insurance or do not have insurance that would cover certain meds.. the medications that insurance pay for are on what they call a drug formulary, if your drug is not on that formulary then the doc can prescribe another drug or if you want to go with the original drug then you pay for that out of pocket. for example I take welbutrin xl... my choice, I researched and felt that this was the best drug for me.. my pcp gave me a months prescription(that he got from the drug reps, lots of docs have drugs from drug reps that they give to patients all the time, a prime example is antinausea meds that alot of people without insurance could never afford, some are 100.00 a pill their oncs will give them the pills they need, if they have them.) Wellbutrin XL is not on my drug formulary so I could get another antidepressant but I wanted that so I pay out of pocket 165.00 a month, I am fortunate I can afford it. This is the only thing that I had to pay for, for a long time. Actually there is no reason why you should have to pay for your moms drugs... I know that in your heart it is the right thing to do but please explore other alternatives.. the drug companies make big money from cancer drugs, many in the medical profession refer to cancer as a cash cow... this really irks me as that we live in one of the wealthiest nations in the world, for many, and yet we do nothing to care for those who are underinsured, uninsured and uninsurable due to presexisting conditions, such as cancer.... burns my butt... find out what company makes the medicine in question, go to their website and see what has to be done to get your mom her meds... remember to keep a close eye for any legislation that is presented to deal with health care policies, write to your senator and reps and let them know all people need and deserve health care and not at the cost of the average citizen, like the current bill S1955.... but at the cost of big business like the insurance companies who make huge profits...OK, stepping down from the bleeding heart liberal podium...sorry that this is alot more then you asked about... again my best to your mom and your family. If you have any questions that you may have that you want to ask me personally, I have been through surgery, chemo, rads, tomoxifen, arimidex and am a seven year survivor... please feel free to email me at [email protected]... just put in the subject line.. from the breast cancer forum so that I dont delete...",

      "Content": "Hi, When I was diagnosed they did all these tests to prior to starting treatment. It was to not only get an overall picture to see if anything had spread but also importantly to get a base line of what is \"normal\" for you. So that if one was to have any pains anywhere or problems they could see if there were any changes that needed to be addressed. It is very nerve racking having the tests and the waiting but it is also wonderful to hear that there are no other problems. Good luck to both of your wives! HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Pastor Rich and Cathy, Big congrats on the new grandbaby! These huge miracles become even more awesome when paired with the journey that we undertake with this darn disease. When I was diagnosed I had hair that was below my waist. Each doctor that I saw would say I suggest that you get your hair cut before you start chemo. Well I got it cut 4 times before it fell out.. I did not have the nerve to get it cut short right off the bat Well it all fell out by the 21st day, by then it was short layers however it was very aggrevating as that it sheds and was getting all over the place. I never was on a board nor did I know anyone who had gone through any of this at the time, it was not until it had all either fallen out or I pulled it out, which I did spend one morning doing and putting it in a baggie (dont ask me what I was doing that for, cause I dont know....LOL) Well I finally did have a friend shave my head. You know when it is falling out because it starts to ache like when your hair is pulled back for a long time in a pony tail and you take it out. That was when it just came out with a little tug. The day that it started to ache I woke up and realized that it was comming out.. was driving my son (15 at the time) to school and told him that his music was driving me so crazy I could just pull my hair out, and tugged out a clump of it.. he was shocked, we laughed but he did ask me not to do that when his friend, who we drove to school, got in the car... It was going to happen anyways so I decided to make the best of a bad situation, had alot of laughs that day about it, even set up a friend when she called and asked what I was doing. I told her that I was pulling my hair out, she thought I was bored and asked me to go out with her, when she came and picked me up she realized that I was literally pulling my hair out... that was a good one. I hated my wigs, which the insurance company did not pay for, so only wore them a couple of times. You are blessed to have such wonderful women in your lives to help you with this... I am sure that you know that the people that are put into your lives and the prayers that are offered up by the many are so important. I hope that Cathy's treatment continue to go smoothly and that you will be able to take that trip that you have been offered. My thoughts and prayers are with you both and with your new grandbaby and his/her new mom and dad! HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Pastor Rich and Cathy, Big congrats on the new grandbaby! These huge miracles become even more awesome when paired with the journey that we undertake with this darn disease. When I was diagnosed I had hair that was below my waist. Each doctor that I saw would say I suggest that you get your hair cut before you start chemo. Well I got it cut 4 times before it fell out.. I did not have the nerve to get it cut short right off the bat Well it all fell out by the 21st day, by then it was short layers however it was very aggrevating as that it sheds and was getting all over the place. I never was on a board nor did I know anyone who had gone through any of this at the time, it was not until it had all either fallen out or I pulled it out, which I did spend one morning doing and putting it in a baggie (dont ask me what I was doing that for, cause I dont know....LOL) Well I finally did have a friend shave my head.

      "Content": "JM, I was not diagnosed under your circumstances... but I do want to say to you and other women on this forum that are newly diagnosed a few things that I have learned and seen over the past 5 years that I have been around different boards and different men and women who have traveled this road along my side... statistics are just numbers on papers or that come out of peoples mouths.. you are not a statistic! If we look at statistics we can look at them in one of two ways, is the glass half empty or is it half full? If we must look at statistics as the answer then who is to say you do not fall into the 50% of people who are surviving and thriving? How recent are those statistics? In the 6 years since my initial diagnosis there have been so many new treatment protocols and advancements made in regards to the treatment of this disease. Many in the medical profession now view this as a chronic disease as opposed to a terminal one even at stage IV. I know that when I was first diagnosed I was a statistics seeker and spent alot of time comparing my cancer with other's. I do admit that there are times like right now when I do have a few of my friend who were diagnosed at stages earlier then mine that are experiencing mets, that the paranoia sets in... but I have to keep reminding myself that that is their cancer not mine... we are all different in so many ways.. and our body's react to the treatments etc. differently. I was told by my surgeon to not be that upset as that I had a good chance of surviving for at least 5 years.. my oncologist told me that I should ignore that comment. There are no guarentees either way in life or in this battle but do not let anyone, including your doctors take away your hope, your dreams or sanity by believing you are a statistic. I was diagnosed 6 years ago this month at stage III and evidently I have proved my surgeons statistics to be wrong...so far... I have had many friends who have also outlived their statistics as are surviving as well... OK, stepping down off my pedestal now ... just wanted to let you know that your treatments and everything that you will experience in the future, though not easy is doable. Always have your hope and always plan for your future... needless to say there is always room for miracles in our lives as well... what can I say I am a BC survivor and a life long Red Sox fan as well Hang in there!

      "Content": "hi, I am sorry if I missed your name,could not find it...I read the post down below after I responded to the one above.. dont know if that makes any sense however, I agree with what nancy has said in her replys to you, though we both were dx. at stage IIIA our situations are so very different, her advice is wise. I also think that regardless of what you chose that you should consider having the sentinel node biopsy done by who ever does your surgery. Having that piece of information is very important to piece of mind. Your doc should be able to give you more information to help you with your decision making... you should also know that even if you have radiation you can still have reconstruction, you would be limited to the type of reconstruction that you would be eligible for based on the amount of damage done to the skin but there are all types of reconstructio that you can have, I was going to have reconstruction last year 6 years after my initial dx. there are alot of options. In regards to your choices at hand I am sorry that I can not provide you with alot of feedback... i had no choices I did chose to not have reconstruction based on my individual situation. My cancer was invasive ductal which, many times , does not usually present in the other breast, as opposed to Nancy's which was lobular and does present in the other breast at a much higher rate, which is why she had bilateral. Again individual choice. You are doing the right thing exploring all possibilities and deciding what is best for you. Just a couple of pointers, if you are not already doing so... when you go to the doc and discuss all of this bring another person along to take notes, a second set of ears, who can write down everything they hear.. we get so worried that sometimes we miss part of it ... keep an ongoing list of questions that you have, and no question is to minor.. read those questions right off your list. This is also the way that you will know that the doc is part of your team and lets them know that you want the answers and your concerns wont be just brushed over. You may already be doing this but many people do not and are left confused. Know that when you do make your decision, it will be the best for you, you are asking all the right questions and doing your research. Good luck and let us know.",

Thanksgiving took on a whole new meaning to me 6 years ago.. I was diagnosed just before thanksgiving. Through the years I have had so much to be Thankful for but in the last 6 years I have had the privledge of meeting and sharing with so many women and men of courage and strength who have inspired me and given me hope. Though some are no longer with us, many are, and all their inspiration and support will be with me always, and for this I am so thankful. For those just starting this journey know that you too will look back on this time and be thankful not that you have had to fight this awful disease but for all the wonderful people that this experience will bring into your life. I hope that this experience will bring out the best in those you love and those who love you and you will feel all of this on your journey. Thank you all for helping me along my journey as well! Have a safe and wonderful holiday! HUGS! Barbara",

My oncologist actually did consult with other docs from UPMC.. in Pittsburgh PA. As Leo stated they are a very knowledgable group of docs. I actually was officially diagnosed with crohns 4 years prior to my BC. and believe it or not the chemo that I recieved actually seemed to help my crohns.. I was taking asacol prior to chemo, and with taxol I also had to take the decadron in place of the NSAIDS for the taxol muscle and bone pain. After I finished the chemo my body began to have skin reactions to the tomoxifen and the asacol... so I was switched to arimidex and immurane. I have thankfully experienced remission with the immurane. My daughter however who was diagnosed at age 20.. has had an awful time, was steroid dependent at one point but has been taking remicade infusions for the past 2 years and it is like a miracle for her. If any of you are being unsuccessful with your meds then that may be something to look into.. she still has to take the immurane but is so much better now. Leo it looks like this has taken on a life of its own with the crohns... However Leo, looks like this is something that you may want to look into a bit, there must be others out there that will present with the same and you may be one step ahead when treating them. I know how difficult it is to have to deal with both the bc and the crohns and hope you all find that med combo that works for you! I know that living with crohns disease is a llifestyle in itself.

I will say however that your docs seem to be right on top of all of this for you.. which is a good thing, as worrisome and scary as that is. If they are concerned about a shadow that appears as a cyst then taking another look at that and possibly biopsy seems to be the thorough thing to do. I have an ultrasound done on my remaining breast all the time. This past year I had the ultrasound and they saw what they believed was a shadowy cyst like growth, you could feel it too. I had the sterotatic biopsy and it was a cyst. As scary as all this is , and waiting and not knowing fully is the pits, it is a good thing that they are not telling you to wait 6 months to watch it, like so many do... it is good that they are keeping on top of it and sounds like you are getting some good treatment in the meantime.. take a deep breath and best of luck with your results!

I can only say that the thing that worked best for me was a small dose of antidepressant... it made the world of difference in all these areas. The antidepressant that I took was Effexor. I just stopped them this past june. I stopped after 5.5 years. It was a low dose and I had to increase it over the years but still a low dose compared to that given for clinical depression. I also have many friends who take other antidepressants and feel that all of the symptoms associated with menopause have become much more tolerable. I never took hormones prior to my diagnosis thus could not tell you the difference in the efficiency of such. I would tell your oncologist that you are tempted to go back on the hormones and see if he can come up with an alternative treatment for you. Ask him about the antidepressants. Good luck and let us know what you decide to do... HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Pastor Rich, As Nancy ( Hi Nancy) has said that it is unusual for them not to test for er/pr and her2neu when they do the initial pathology... however I also note that you are not from the states, perhaps the process is different in canada. I know that women that I have knows from canada have had scans, testing etc on different time frames from me. You are talking about two different treatment delivery systems. I can also relate to the anxiety of the waiting... that is something that we all get accustomed to, not any less anxiety but used to the wait... hurry up and wait... but I can only say that from the time of my diagnosis and my intial chemo treatment was about 2 months... this was 6 years ago, next month. In most cases Ihave been told that cancer does not spread rapidly in two weeks and that in actuality it is around for many many years before it starts to be able to be seen or screened in many. I hope that this would help a little... though I am not a doctor and you would probably feel better hearing this from Dr. Leo. Actually when I was first diagnosed they actually did test for both these things however there were women that were diagnosed 6 months prior to me that had to have their docs go back and have theirs tested, especially the her2neu, In PA where I am from they keep pieces of your tumors or lesions for many many years in order to retest if something comes up... according to the docs around here. So even in six years we have made some progress in what is going on around us... I Wish the best for you and your wife in this journey, and will keep you in my prayers and thoughts...This journey, though not an easy one, it is doable and as Nancy says there is life after this part of your journey, I would also add that there is a whole lot of life even when you are dealing with all of this it just refocuses your priorities.... a whole lot of living and life! Just Hang in there! HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Annie, My nueropathy started with my taxol. It was initially a numbing of my fingers and toes...much like they were falling asleep, those pins and needles... eventually it was just in the very tips and then moved upward. It was difficult to hold things because my fingers seemed to be unable to hold them and I could not feel them. The numbness eventually disappated as time went on... many months after for me... but the numbness was replaced with a throbbing pain, much like if your fingers and toes were frozen from the cold that pain that you feel when you they start to warm up. I thought that the numbness was bad but this pain was worse. Eventually I could hardly walk due to the awful pain in my feet. I saw couple of nuerologists, orthepedic guys and even a podiatrist, who gave me a shot of cortisone in each foot.. which worked for a while but the pain was worse when that was wearing off. I also was taking arimidex which could have also added to this pain... as that bone pain is a side effect of arimidex. I was also diagnosed with arthritis in the small bones of my feet.. have no idea what may have caused this the nueropathy, the arimidex, chemopause, old age (I was only 47 at the time) or chrons disease which effects bones and joints as well... so that is what my experience with nueropathy has been... all gone now... good luck to you!

      "Content": "Hey all, I also have had crohns and breast cancer. Hip and back problems that coincided with my tomoxifen and arimidex use, a bit better since off of this. Testing showed osteopenia, which I just started taking actenol for, which I have delayed due to the fear of a flare with crohns disease. My chrons has been in remission since my breast cancer treatment, the chemo seems to have helped greatly and now I am on a maintenance dose of imurane. I did stop taking the imurane for a short while but my last colonoscopy showed some active disease so back on the imurane. My crohns have never been serious enough that I had to be on steroids and never on remicade. But I will add that my daughter who is 29 is on remicade and has had many many flare ups with her crohns. she also was on prednisone for a long time before remicade. With this said, she also has had hip/back pain for a few years now which all studies show are related to her crohns disease, both our GI's have attributed skeletal problems, especially the hip and back to the crohns and the meds. Her GI is with the university of chicago and was one of the docs who was in on the original study/trials with remicade The remicade does control her hip/back pain as well as her crohns. I will have to have her discuss with him as to the added risk of breast cancer, and any long term followup on the studies. If I remember correctly there are quite a few women on this board that also have crohns disease, but I do not believe that many of them were on remicade.that was actually a discussion many of us had originally on this board. Interesting..... good luck to all!",

I had breakthrough bleeding with the tomoxifen, and had a D&C. I then was switched to arimidex and still had some bleeding and had another D&C... I was concerned and thus the d& also provides with a biopsy as well.... I had one cervical biopsy and would never have one again, it was way to painful for me. I also have fibroids too... so I always have ultrasounds every year to keep up with those and to determine any uterine thickening. I would be interested in what your doc has to say.. as that the tomoxifen cuts down the estsrogen in the ovaries the arimidex cuts it down in the adrenal gland... having your cycle return if you have been diagnosed as estrogen positive is not a good thing as that is what fed your cancer.. I am sure that they will figure this all out for you! HUGS!",

However I hate IV's and maintain it by having it flushed every month. I hope that she has hers flushed monthly too. Insurance should cover the cost of her prothesis and they should also pay for mastectomy bras as well... I can get mine replaced every one or two years. however, I have one prosthesis that I have used for years now.. it is called a boosom buddy, the most comfortable that I have ever found and it was also the least expensive, I actually bought it myself. at any rate... they also have them in the TLC catalog at reasonable prices as well. She should however make an appointment with a person who will fit her for the prosthesis and tell her exactly what size she needs... they will also help with the insurance papers depending on the insurance that she has. Any other questions please post them so that we can help her to find one that is not leaking. If you have any specific questions please feel free to email me at [email protected] just make sure that you put the cancer forum in the subject line so that I will know to open it..

      "Content": "Hi All, While we are on the subject of good books. Many of you know that this is such a life altering experience and that many of us suffer from what we call \"canceritis\" you know when you big toe starts to hurt and the first thing that you think of is, can this come back in my toe? Well hopefully you are not all like me I know that there are alot of us out here, LOL.. anyways, an excellent book that I read that helps put that \"waiting for the other shoe to drop \" feeling a little more at ease is a book called \"Dancing in Limbo: making sense of life after cancer\" I do not recall the authors names and have given out my last copy. But it is a great book and I have used it for gifts for some of my friends who have gone through this too. I have also used that Dr. Love book as gifts for others and suggested it to many... my breast bible when I was first diagnosed. Another good book is Living beyond breast cancer.. by Dr. Weiss. She also has a web site which you can get on her mailing list and get great information. She is outside of the philadelphia area and I had a friend who was her patient. She a a great advocate for breast cancer. I think that I will pick up that breast cancer for dummies book on your recommendation... thanks! HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Lisa, you are right in that different types of chemo cause different side effects, hair loss being one. I of course am not an oncologist but having been around this journey for 7 years there are some things that I have been able to pick up. Based on your age and the stats that you have provided I would think that your onc is going to go with a pretty aggressive attitude, which is a benefit for you.... however he/she will probably use a combo of the most common chemos that you see in our siggy lines... A/C ( andriamycin/Cytoxin), the taxenes (taxol or taxetere). you did not note your her2neu status if that is positive herceptin. The A/C and the taxenes both do cause hair loss. I know that this all sounds very scary I know that it scared me, but know that you will get through this and that you will be amazed as to how strong you will come out of this. I know that the hair thing bothered me initially. When I was first diagnosed I had hair down to my waist. I remembered how mad I was that I had to give that up, more people commented or complimented me on my hair then they did my boob So no I do not think that you are vain in asking. From the time of my surgery until the time that I lost my hair I had it cut about 5 times, shorter and shorter each time. When it started to fall out I then shaved my head. I had two wigs, which I hated and only wore a few times. I had different colored bandanas and scarfs which I wore. Many women feel better with a wig but I have always been a little bit over the edge If the doc does tell you that you are going to loose your hair then you should go and get a wig before hand as that sometimes they have to be ordered, dont wait till the last min. I would not go out and get it cut right away, wait and listen to what the doc tells you. That cold cap thing has been around for a long time and I know of no one that it has worked for. maybe someone here, but no one that I know of. Also chemo makes your hair lack body, very dry and dull.. you will notice that if you are on one of these chemos... well I think that answers your questions for now, you will have so many more as time goes on. I hope for you the best my thoughts and prayers are with you! Hang in there! HUGS!",

      "Content": "Hey all... 7 years ago this february is when I had my first chemo treatment. It took 21 days for my hair to fall out... and you can tell when it is going to fall out because your head starts to ache. It feels like you slept on your hair the wrong way or like when you keep it in a pony tail for a long time and then let it out. Also some women do not realize that all your hair falls out... thats right all of it.... When I did the a/c I did not loose my eyelashes, I did lose them with the taxol... My hair started to fuzz a little when I did the rads, but fell right out again with the taxol, it also started to grow back in at the very end of the taxol. I did not want curly hair and prayed that it would not grow in curly, got my wish it grew i straight... thankfully that was not my only prayers answered Only wore my wigs a few times... they actually name them one was Raquel and the other one was dark brown chocolate Linda...Right from the start we had alot of good laughs over the whole hair thing... ya it really sucks to lose it, but we have no control over that if we want to fight this thing... so the only thing that you can control and change is your attitude about it... I found the easiest way to get through all of this was with as much humor and laughter that I could....and that is what worked for me and my family. My 13 year old son cut off his ponytail and shaved his head when I lost my hair... my husband who also has a long ponytail (we are old hippies...lol) offered to cut his ponytail too, which I insisted he did not I felt someone in the family should at least maintain some hair...so you get through it the best you can.... we all do.... and it does grow back and grows back relatively fast in perfect layers....my best to all! Hang in there! HUGS!",

      "Content": "Annie, My nueropathy started with my taxol. It was initially a numbing of my fingers and toes...much like they were falling asleep, those pins and needles... eventually it was just in the very tips and then moved upward. It was difficult to hold things because my fingers seemed to be unable to hold them and I could not feel them. The numbness eventually disappated as time went on... many months after for me... but the numbness was replaced with a throbbing pain, much like if your fingers and toes were frozen from the cold that pain that you feel when you they start to warm up. I thought that the numbness was bad but this pain was worse. Eventually I could hardly walk due to the awful pain in my feet. I saw couple of nuerologists, orthepedic guys and even a podiatrist, who gave me a shot of cortisone in each foot.. which worked for a while but the pain was worse when that was wearing off. I also was taking arimidex which could have also added to this pain... as that bone pain is a side effect of arimidex. I was also diagnosed with arthritis in the small bones of my feet.. have no idea what may have caused this the nueropathy, the arimidex, chemopause, old age (I was only 47 at the time) or chrons disease which effects bones and joints as well... so that is what my experience with nueropathy has been... all gone now... good luck to you! Keep us posted as to what you find out. HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Hi, I did not have a lumpectomy... well I did but ended up with a mastectomy... The reactions to the radiation that you are describing were according to my friend who had rads after lumpectomy, are things that she experienced up until the enlarging of the breast, hers actually shrunk in the long run. However, I would encourage you to follow Dr. Leo's advice and make that appointment. I know how you feel about running back to the doctor about these things.. sometimes I start to feel like a hypochondriac... however, it is your body and anything that makes us feel uneasy after the experiences that we have had need to be addressed. If the doctor still does not feel as though it is an issue, know that it is an issue to you and seek that second opinion. All to often there are some doctors that give us the attitude that we should feel grateful that we are here to complain and have concerns and they minimize the way that we feel... however, in the long run, we have been through it all and we deserve to have our concerns addressed. If you feel as though your doctor is not giving you the answers and the attention that you need then perhaps you should start to look for another doctor who is willing to be part of your team and not minimize your concerns.... good luck and let us know what you find out.

      "Content": "Bekah, Medicare should pay to have her port removed. I can't really tell you about the flushing stuff as that my onc and onc nurses have always gone with the once a month flush. Which I follow all the time. I also have crohns disease and due to my staging with the breast cancer and various other problems I use my port all the time for different tests... just used it monday for a cat scan of my abdomin and pelvis area. I will also use it on friday for my much dreaded colonoscopy. I aLso believe that the medicare will also pay for a prosthesis... so you need to encourage your mother in law to contact a place that fits prosthesis, usually a medical supply place, or even a mastectomy boutiique.. my daughter lives in chicago and she tells me that the department stores there also have mastectomy shops , but none the less she needs to be fitted and also needs to find out what the medicare will cover for her prosthesis and mastecomy bras. Feel free to email me and maybe I can help you out.. [email protected] just make sure that you put the forum in your subject line so that I will open it. Leo, you do mean that you have to be admitted and put on IV antibiotics to have it pulled should you have an infection right? not just to have it removed right? I will also add that I love my port and always treat it kindly Best of luck to your mother in law.. and I hope she appreciates how much you care for her and how wonderful you are to be researching all of this for her!

I had breakthrough bleeding with the tomoxifen, and had a D&C. I then was switched to arimidex and still had some bleeding and had another D&C... I was concerned and thus the d& also provides with a biopsy as well.... I had one cervical biopsy and would never have one again, it was way to painful for me. I also have fibroids too... so I always have ultrasounds every year to keep up with those and to determine any uterine thickening. I would be interested in what your doc has to say.. as that the tomoxifen cuts down the estsrogen in the ovaries the arimidex cuts it down in the adrenal gland... having your cycle return if you have been diagnosed as estrogen positive is not a good thing as that is what fed your cancer.. I am sure that they will figure this all out for you! HUGS!",

      "Content": "Ladies, it does take a few weeks to get used to the port. I have had mine now for 6 years. and sometime it is uncomfortable if i sleep on it the wrong way etc. However the port is a godsend especially if you dislike IV's as much as I do. I also have crohns disease and use my port for testing in lots of areas. If you take good care of your port it will be of a great help for a long time. Make sure that you get it flushed when you are not using it and make sure that you only use nurses that can get it accessed easily. Last tip... EMLA cream... put this on about one hour befrore they access it, then put saran wrap, that new stick one is perfect! Do this and there is no pain what so ever even when they access it... good luck with your port and your chemo, this will make this whole process so much easier! HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "Pastor Rich, Another stage III person responding here. I am sure that what the doc meant was since she was er postive then a hormonal will be part of the treatment to deal with the estrogen production issue... I do not think that meant that they did not intend to do chemo as well, only that she would be given a hormonal drug also. In her case depending on whether or not she is premenopausal or post either tomoxifen, arimdex or femera. As far as the chemo goes I had andryamicin/ Cytoxin (A/C), then radiation then Taxol. As that it has spread to the lymph nodes they will most likely hit it with aggressive chemo, which they refer to as systemic chemo. The taxol or taxetere is approved and recommended here for node positive women, I understand that you are not in the states but friend that I have had in canada also have had taxol being node positive. I had a mastectomy but still had to have the radiation as that they needed to zap the lymph nodes, mine were positive too. So I assume, which is usually a big mistake on my part , that the doc only meant that the hormonal will be a part of the whole picture. Again, hang in there, it seems like I say this alot to you and your wife, this seems to be taking a while to get everything in place for her. Let us know what the oncologist finally says to her, and we will be here to help in anyway that we can, even if it is hold your hand...I know that it is hard not to freak out with the stage thing, I did, but here I sit six years later and going strong and NED (no evidence of disease).

      "Content": "Bekah, Medicare should pay to have her port removed. I can't really tell you about the flushing stuff as that my onc and onc nurses have always gone with the once a month flush. Which I follow all the time. I also have crohns disease and due to my staging with the breast cancer and various other problems I use my port all the time for different tests... just used it monday for a cat scan of my abdomin and pelvis area. I will also use it on friday for my much dreaded colonoscopy. I aLso believe that the medicare will also pay for a prosthesis... so you need to encourage your mother in law to contact a place that fits prosthesis, usually a medical supply place, or even a mastectomy boutiique.. my daughter lives in chicago and she tells me that the department stores there also have mastectomy shops , but none the less she needs to be fitted and also needs to find out what the medicare will cover for her prosthesis and mastecomy bras. Feel free to email me and maybe I can help you out.. [email protected] just make sure that you put the forum in your subject line so that I will open it. Leo, you do mean that you have to be admitted and put on IV antibiotics to have it pulled should you have an infection right? not just to have it removed right? I will also add that I love my port and always treat it kindly Best of luck to your mother in law.. and I hope she appreciates how much you care for her and how wonderful you are to be researching all of this for her!

      "Content": "Bekah, If your mil has had her port for four years then the answer is that she can have that removed at any time. I personally have had my port now for over 5 years. However I hate IV's and maintain it by having it flushed every month. I hope that she has hers flushed monthly too. Insurance should cover the cost of her prothesis and they should also pay for mastectomy bras as well... I can get mine replaced every one or two years. however, I have one prosthesis that I have used for years now.. it is called a boosom buddy, the most comfortable that I have ever found and it was also the least expensive, I actually bought it myself. at any rate... they also have them in the TLC catalog at reasonable prices as well. She should however make an appointment with a person who will fit her for the prosthesis and tell her exactly what size she needs... they will also help with the insurance papers depending on the insurance that she has. Any other questions please post them so that we can help her to find one that is not leaking. If you have any specific questions please feel free to email me at [email protected] just make sure that you put the cancer forum in the subject line so that I will know to open it..

      "Content": "Maria, I can not answer in regards to tomoxifen being less effective with Her2neu... Not being a doctor I can only give you general info about what I know... that is the tomoxifen attacks the er/pr part of the cancer by cutting down as much estrogen as it can through the ovaries, which based on your status the er/pr has been feeding the cancer. The Her2neu is a different part of the whole scenario... the her2neu is a protein (I believe) that also contributes. The tomoxifen, or arimidex (if you are postmenopausal) will take care of the er/pr part. If they want to attack the her2neu then they will use herceptin which attacks that part. I dont think that the tomoxifen is any less useful in this, it is just that there are two issues to deal with. They can also shut off the estrogen with other stuff like lupron. The difference between the tomoxifen and the arimidex, as I understand it is that they work on different systems.. the tomoxifen working in the ovaries and the arimidex working in the adrenals...thus tomoxifen for premenopausal women and the arimidex in post menopausal women. I know that all of this is very overwhelming but hold on to your hope and talk to your doc about what he feels will work best . I am sure that Dr. Leo will get back to you on this as soon as he can!

      "Content": "Hey all... 7 years ago this february is when I had my first chemo treatment. It took 21 days for my hair to fall out... and you can tell when it is going to fall out because your head starts to ache. It feels like you slept on your hair the wrong way or like when you keep it in a pony tail for a long time and then let it out. Also some women do not realize that all your hair falls out... thats right all of it.... When I did the a/c I did not loose my eyelashes, I did lose them with the taxol... My hair started to fuzz a little when I did the rads, but fell right out again with the taxol, it also started to grow back in at the very end of the taxol. I did not want curly hair and prayed that it would not grow in curly, got my wish it grew i straight... thankfully that was not my only prayers answered Only wore my wigs a few times... they actually name them one was Raquel and the other one was dark brown chocolate Linda...Right from the start we had alot of good laughs over the whole hair thing... ya it really sucks to lose it, but we have no control over that if we want to fight this thing... so the only thing that you can control and change is your attitude about it... I found the easiest way to get through all of this was with as much humor and laughter that I could....and that is what worked for me and my family. My 13 year old son cut off his ponytail and shaved his head when I lost my hair... my husband who also has a long ponytail (we are old hippies...lol) offered to cut his ponytail too, which I insisted he did not I felt someone in the family should at least maintain some hair...so you get through it the best you can.... we all do.... and it does grow back and grows back relatively fast in perfect layers....my best to all!

I lost it in february.. so it was a year (almost) another interesting thing is that I did not loose my eyebrows and eyelashes until the taxol. I hated my wigs, only wore them 3-4 times wore great colorful scarfs. I have a lot of great stories about my hair loss that really took the edge off of the whole experience for me and for those around me.

I had to try to numerous meds.. finally settled with kytril and ativan, during the infusion and on a steady schedule after that. However that kytril was only used for four days and then took torrecan and ativan for a few days more. I had really bad nausea. Some of the info that I can give you is this. Make sure that you take the meds even if you do not think that you will need them. Marion is right, you need to stay on top of the nausea before it starts it is so much easier to control if you can avoid it in the first place. I also drank lots and lots of water, hydration helps with it too. As far as food goes.. I ate alot of \"comfort foods\", lived on grilled cheese and mac. and cheese..I also found that If I sucked on hard candy, especially life savers tropical fruit flavored it helped to keep the yuckies away, as well as chewing bazooka bubblegum, what can I say a kid at heart other then that advice the only other thing that I can say is hang in there... my prayers and thoughts are with you!

      "Content": "Gail, I too was premenopausal when I started chemo.. also started tomoxifen prior to chemo... but after I was done with chemo I was tested to be post menopausal. I also switched from the tomoxifen to the arimidex. I switched due to a skin reaction to tomoxifen, and this was after the testing showed that I was post menopausal. I was 45 at time of initial dx, and had my last period right after my first a/c chemo. If you were premenopausal when you started chemo, as I was, then the chemo put me into menopause. This has been my experience... thus I relied on the fsh test to dictate whether or not I was post menopausal. Best of luck to you in your further exploration of this. HUGS! Barbara",

      "Content": "I am so sorry that you are going through this, I know only to well how bad this can be once it starts really hard to stop. I had to try to numerous meds.. finally settled with kytril and ativan, during the infusion and on a steady schedule after that. However that kytril was only used for four days and then took torrecan and ativan for a few days more. I had really bad nausea. Some of the info that I can give you is this. Make sure that you take the meds even if you do not think that you will need them. Marion is right, you need to stay on top of the nausea before it starts it is so much easier to control if you can avoid it in the first place. I also drank lots and lots of water, hydration helps with it too. As far as food goes.. I ate alot of \"comfort foods\", lived on grilled cheese and mac. and cheese..I also found that If I sucked on hard candy, especially life savers tropical fruit flavored it helped to keep the yuckies away, as well as chewing bazooka bubblegum, what can I say a kid at heart other then that advice the only other thing that I can say is hang in there... my prayers and thoughts are with you!

      "Content": "Pat sorry to hear about your dilemma. I too was dx at a stage IIIA, in 1998. I had A/C, Taxol, rads, tomoxifen and arimidex. I also have an autoimmune disease, crohns disease. So I am aware of the challenges that dealing with a combination of issues. It was never suggested to me that I not have radiation, however they did blame the serious radiation burning that I had on my crohns, which they told me after the fact that is sometimes one of the side effects of radiation with an autoimmune disease (Skin Reaction). The burns did heal but they were pretty serious at the time. Now based on what your rad oncologist says in regard to radiation with your lupus. I suggest that you get a second opinion. However based on your rib cage configuration and your lupus I am sure that any decision that you will have to make is not an easy one. You have done alot so far. I should also tell you that I had an allergic skin reaction to the tomoxifen, which took them a while to figure out the cause of the reaction. I then switched to arimidex and had no problems. Just finished the 5 years on the arimidex. My best to you, hang in there and let us know what you decide to do. Hugs! Barbara",

      "Content": "Well here is my two cents worth ... First off where you are so young chances are that your breasts are so dense that the mammo may not be the best tool to use in diagnosing any problems. Also, many times docs seem to minimize the problems that younger women may have related to breast conditions due to their age. I am not telling you any of this to scare you but feel that women need to learn from an early age to be their own advocates when it comes to health care. I unfortunately learned this in my early 20's, not from breast cancer but from other medical situations. Though your doc may feel that it is a benign tumor, it is very important that you seek a follow up on this. First off did he use the word tumor or did he use the word cyst? These are two different things and cysts can be identified through ultrasounds. secondly, if he/she did use the word tumor then my feeling is that unless that doc has magical fingers to go along with their magical thinking then they can not really tell if it is benign or not... thus you need to ask for a simple needle biopsy or some biopsy to be on the safe side. I have a 28 year old daughter and would certainly enocurage her to followup any type of diagnosis of this type with a biopsy, better safe then sorry. I am not trying to scare you cause in reality most lumps or areas of suspicion that are biopsied are in reality benign. However you must leave no stone unturned. You also need to feel comfortable with your doctors diagnosis and should be able to communicate your fears with your doctor, who should always be part of your team. As far as the hair goes, there are many reasons why people begin to experience hair losss, stress is one of the reasons that come to my mind immediately, where as I do not think that hair loss is an indicator of cancer... though that is the image that many have, but that is due to the chemotherapy drugs that we have to take, not to the cancer itself... so in my opinion get in touch with your doctor again and discuss how anxious you are about his/her diagnosis and seek a biopsy or find another doctor for a second opinion... best to you, let us know what happens!

      "Content": "Racheal, Another IIIA here. My doc does not believe in tumor markers as that he does not feel that the anxiety surrounding them and does not believe in treating in regards to them as that there are so many things that can affect the results. There are so many different school of thought among the docs in regards to this. I have had many scans tests etc through the years. Right after diagnosis prior to treatment had bone scan ct sans and mri to establish base. I have had ct, mri's bone scan and bone density tests throughout the years as both yearly check up and if I have any lingering pains. I have ultrasound of ovaries yearly, mammo yearly along with chest xrays and also as that i have crohns disease i have to have colonoscopies every couple of years. Yearly testing with out any symptomolgy seems to be pretty run of the mill with stage III...I do know that my doc jumps right on top of anything that is unusual and keeps a close watch on me. I know that I feel like a hypochondriac some times but I am lucky enough to have an onc and onc nurses that totally understand my canceritis, and always work with me to alleviate the anxiety and explore my aches and pains. Good luck to you! I know when you are just done with active treatment you feel like you are asea and no longer activily fighting this, you have geard yourself up for battle to get through treatment and you really never feel that your over the major war... and you are always waiting for the other shoe to drop.. you do come to to terms with this eventually it takes a while. I read a book right after my treatment called \"Dancing in Limbo, Making sense of life after cancer\" a great book I would suggest anyone who has just completed treatment to read it.... best of luck to you!",

I had a PET Scan last year which was clean... this week had a CT/PET which they said would be more accurate and less false positives etc. Well they called this morning and now they want an MRI to follow up. I got a copy of the report and it reads... Mild hypermetabolic activity at the L4-5 level on the left side. This appear to be within the the facet joint. The degree of activity present would be unusual for degenerative changes, however degenerative change is the only CT finding evident. Then it goes on to recommend an MRI as that a metastatic lesion may be evident on it. My question is... other then of course how worried I should be???? ... does the PET scan only show activity related to cancer? I have read alot and it seems that is the only thing that it does show. The report says that this shows on the CT image, with a maximum SUV of 4.5, average 2.0 (is this the PET numbers or related to the CT) well I have web sites that help you to understand wording of reports for other tests etc, but I have not found one for PET. Of course now I am wondering if the \"other shoe is about to drop\" so Any information or feedback you could give me would be appreciated.. HUGS!",

I had had many ultra sound guided fine needle biopsies, the first of which resulted in my initial diagnosis of breast cancer. That stereotactic was very painful, they do manage to mark the spot though, so they do not have to keep going to the same place, if they do not have to. One of the advantages however is that if they do find something and have to go and remove or rebiopsy then they have marked the spot so they do not have to do a needle localization which was the most painful part of my lumpectomy... which I had prior to my mastectoy. They told me that would not hurt either but they were very very wrong, as they were to other women i know that had to have it done. I know of many women who have been told that neither process would be that painful, however we are all different. I hope that you do not need another biopsy and all is B-9! Barbara",

      "Content": "sorry to hear about your dx. One of my closest friends was dx. with dcis two years ago. She also had a lumpectomy along with radiation and now is on tomoxifen. This is also an example of how protocol has changed in regards to treatment. When I was dx. almost 7 years ago, the common treatment for DIS was mastectomy. No radiation just the mastectomy. When my friend was dx. she researched this alot as that her mom died of breast cancer when we were seniors in high school (34 yrs ago) and her sister died at age 32 from ovarian cancer. She is very hypervigilent based on her life experiences, as is her docs. Of course there are no easy ways to make decisions about any of this but sharing experiences all help in making choices. I also know that making the decisions we feel very rushed because I know that my first instinct was get this the heck out of me... I was diagnosed at the beginning of november and did not have my lumpectomy until dec. 17th, when my surgeon could not get clean margins I was told that I did need to have a mastectomy which i did not have till jan. 7th. I was assured by the surgeon, and my oncologist that the time delay would not make a difference. If I was going to have reconstruction then my mastectomy would have actually been at the end of january in order to get the plastic surgeon in the operating room at the same time. So I tell you this so that you do not rush into any decisions as that you feel comfortable with your decision. Ask to be put on the cancellation list, see if the rad. onc, whenyou go for your consultation, can get you a sooner apt. Now that wire localization... ask for your premeds for your surgery before they do it ( I did not get mine till after) ask for extra novcaine as well let them know that you have a very low threshold for pain (no time to be so brave, no need). They will put your breast in a mammo machine with lots and lots of pressure, I am sure that your radiologist will be better at it then mine was, he was a dunderhead. I have learned so much from all this journey and one of the things that I learned early on was that there is no use to be in pain speak up and let them know ahead of time that you want extra everything. Good luck to you, and let us know how things work out for you.... sorry this is so long.. I talk this much in real life too...LOL... hang in there!",

I had had many ultra sound guided fine needle biopsies, the first of which resulted in my initial diagnosis of breast cancer. That stereotactic was very painful, they do manage to mark the spot though, so they do not have to keep going to the same place, if they do not have to. One of the advantages however is that if they do find something and have to go and remove or rebiopsy then they have marked the spot so they do not have to do a needle localization which was the most painful part of my lumpectomy... which I had prior to my mastectoy. They told me that would not hurt either but they were very very wrong, as they were to other women i know that had to have it done. I know of many women who have been told that neither process would be that painful, however we are all different. I hope that you do not need another biopsy and all is B-9! Barbara",

      "Content": "sorry to hear about your dx. One of my closest friends was dx. with dcis two years ago. She also had a lumpectomy along with radiation and now is on tomoxifen. This is also an example of how protocol has changed in regards to treatment. When I was dx. almost 7 years ago, the common treatment for DIS was mastectomy. No radiation just the mastectomy. When my friend was dx. she researched this alot as that her mom died of breast cancer when we were seniors in high school (34 yrs ago) and her sister died at age 32 from ovarian cancer. She is very hypervigilent based on her life experiences, as is her docs. Of course there are no easy ways to make decisions about any of this but sharing experiences all help in making choices. I also know that making the decisions we feel very rushed because I know that my first instinct was get this the heck out of me... I was diagnosed at the beginning of november and did not have my lumpectomy until dec. 17th, when my surgeon could not get clean margins I was told that I did need to have a mastectomy which i did not have till jan. 7th. I was assured by the surgeon, and my oncologist that the time delay would not make a difference. If I was going to have reconstruction then my mastectomy would have actually been at the end of january in order to get the plastic surgeon in the operating room at the same time. So I tell you this so that you do not rush into any decisions as that you feel comfortable with your decision. Ask to be put on the cancellation list, see if the rad. onc, whenyou go for your consultation, can get you a sooner apt. Now that wire localization... ask for your premeds for your surgery before they do it ( I did not get mine till after) ask for extra novcaine as well let them know that you have a very low threshold for pain (no time to be so brave, no need). They will put your breast in a mammo machine with lots and lots of pressure, I am sure that your radiologist will be better at it then mine was, he was a dunderhead. I have learned so much from all this journey and one of the things that I learned early on was that there is no use to be in pain speak up and let them know ahead of time that you want extra everything. Good luck to you, and let us know how things work out for you.... sorry this is so long.. I talk this much in real life too...LOL... hang in there!",

      "Content": "PC Charms, I have a friend who also had breast cancer show up in her lymph nodes and it was of undetermined origin. Now Dr. Leo can tell you alot more about this then I can, however, I believe that each type of cancer shows up differently to a pathologist. Thus they can tell if breast cancer has spread to another place... ex. bc mets to the lung as opposed to a new primary cancer of the lung... I may be wrong but this is how I understand it. My friend who they dx. with bc in the lymph nodes never has found her primary tumor etc. but she did undergo chemo for her bc and has done very well and has been NED (No Evidence of Disease) for many years now. I know that this probably does not help to ease your anxiety but I did want to share this with you. You certainly have had the gammet of testing and if all is clear then that is a good thing. Hopefully the chemo will zapped any cancer that they could have found had they not found the bc that they did in the lymph nodes. If they do find the primary bc such as a lump or lesion initially they remove it but if it has spread to the lymph nodes they do systemic chemo in order to get the chemo to all parts of your body to kill any stray cancer cells. So it sounds as if they are going to take care of that with the chemo. I am sure that Dr. Leo will get back to you about this as soon as he sees it... but I know that the anxiety and uncertainy is the pits and wanted to share as much as I could now... best of luck to you... this chemo though unpleasant is doable... Hang in there! HUGS! Barbara",

It may seem to you that all the womens messages that you read here seem to have it together or that we know so much but be assured that we all have been where you are.. including the shock, anger, depression and total confusion. I never found a support board until I was two weeks away from finishing my chemo.. It was my family and my very few friends that had to pull me through. I like you had moved (from NH to PA) a year and a half before my diagnosis. You have been given good advice about Susan Love's book, getting copies of all your reports, and bringing someone with you to appt. with every single question written down in a list that you go through one by one. I still do that even almost 6 years out. If there is a breast cancer or any kind of cancer support group in your area it is good to attend that as that person to person support is great. I have been through lumpectomy, mastectomy, chemo, radiation, more chemo, tomoxifen and arimidex. I will tell you that it is not easy but it is all doable. You are going to find out that you are much stronger then you ever thought you were. There are times that you dont think that you can do another thing and you will be at the lowest point physically and emotionally but you will find that you can do it and will be empowered in a way that will be amazing. We all seem like we have it together only because we have fought this battle and have learned as we have gone along. The great part of this forum is that we have Leo walking this path with us now and to have a medical professional giving us input is an awesome thing. Your going to get through this, we will help with any questions that you might have and you will be giving out your advice and support to another newbie in no time. Feel free to email me at any time [email protected], just put in subject line, from BC forum...best of luck to you, take a deep breath and hang in there! HUGS! Barbara",

If she needs chemo and rads then the travel will mean something, especially radiation as that is a daily trip...Have you explored any of the hospitals, surgeons, oncologists in your area? You should not really feel that they are trying to sell you anything. You need a doc who your mom can work with, who answers all her questions and who is skilled at what they do.. get a second opinion if you feel the least bit uncomfortable about anything.

I also switched from the tomoxifen to the arimidex. I switched due to a skin reaction to tomoxifen, and this was after the testing showed that I was post menopausal. I was 45 at time of initial dx, and had my last period right after my first a/c chemo. If you were premenopausal when you started chemo, as I was, then the chemo put me into menopause.

I have learned so much from all this journey and one of the things that I learned early on was that there is no use to be in pain speak up and let them know ahead of time that you want extra everything. Good luck to you, and let us know how things work out for you.... sorry this is so long.. I talk this much in real life too...LOL... hang in there!",

      "Content": "I had the same experience with a stereotactic biopsy as well. This after two valiums as well. I had had many ultra sound guided fine needle biopsies, the first of which resulted in my initial diagnosis of breast cancer. That stereotactic was very painful, they do manage to mark the spot though, so they do not have to keep going to the same place, if they do not have to. One of the advantages however is that if they do find something and have to go and remove or rebiopsy then they have marked the spot so they do not have to do a needle localization which was the most painful part of my lumpectomy... which I had prior to my mastectoy. They told me that would not hurt either but they were very very wrong, as they were to other women i know that had to have it done. I know of many women who have been told that neither process would be that painful, however we are all different. I hope that you do not need another biopsy and all is B-9! Barbara",

      "Content": "sorry to hear about your dx. One of my closest friends was dx. with dcis two years ago. She also had a lumpectomy along with radiation and now is on tomoxifen. This is also an example of how protocol has changed in regards to treatment. When I was dx. almost 7 years ago, the common treatment for DIS was mastectomy. No radiation just the mastectomy. When my friend was dx. she researched this alot as that her mom died of breast cancer when we were seniors in high school (34 yrs ago) and her sister died at age 32 from ovarian cancer. She is very hypervigilent based on her life experiences, as is her docs. Of course there are no easy ways to make decisions about any of this but sharing experiences all help in making choices. I also know that making the decisions we feel very rushed because I know that my first instinct was get this the heck out of me... I was diagnosed at the beginning of november and did not have my lumpectomy until dec. 17th, when my surgeon could not get clean margins I was told that I did need to have a mastectomy which i did not have till jan. 7th. I was assured by the surgeon, and my oncologist that the time delay would not make a difference. If I was going to have reconstruction then my mastectomy would have actually been at the end of january in order to get the plastic surgeon in the operating room at the same time. So I tell you this so that you do not rush into any decisions as that you feel comfortable with your decision. Ask to be put on the cancellation list, see if the rad. onc, whenyou go for your consultation, can get you a sooner apt. Now that wire localization... ask for your premeds for your surgery before they do it ( I did not get mine till after) ask for extra novcaine as well let them know that you have a very low threshold for pain (no time to be so brave, no need).

I was advised agains reconstruction at the time due to the fact that they knew that I would have to aggressive chemo and radiation (I had a lumpectomy first without clean margins) So I waited until after I was done with radiation on the advice of the surgeon....Now based on what your rad oncologist says in regard to radiation with your lupus. I suggest that you get a second opinion....I was advised agains reconstruction at the time due to the fact that they knew that I would have to aggressive chemo and radiation (I had a lumpectomy first without clean margins) So I waited until after I was done with radiation on the advice of the surgeon. Well I decided last year to look into reconstruction and was going to have a tram done in June, I was sick on the day of the surgery thus it was cancelled....",
