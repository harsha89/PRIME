    "Content": "Scientists from Melbourne, Australia recently discovered compounds currently being researched to treat leukemia may also be effective in treating the most common form of breast cancer. Researchers found a group of anti-cancer compounds known as BH3-mimetics are effective for treating estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) forms of breast cancers when used with tamoxifen, a drug currently used to treat breast cancer. Breast cancer is comprised of roughly 70 percent ER-positive types.",
