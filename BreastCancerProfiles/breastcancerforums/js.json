    "Content": "Hi Odigoblu, I'm so sorry you've had this diagnosis, especially at such a young age. I was 49 when I was diagnosed and now I'm 57, almost 58, so you see there is hope. My soon to be daughter-in-law is from Brazil, so she speaks Portuguese. If you would like, I could have her translate the information you were given, just let me know and I will contact her. If I can be of help, let me know. JS",
