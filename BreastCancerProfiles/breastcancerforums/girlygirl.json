      "Content": "I am not a superstitious person. I don't believe in signs or anything like that. However, about six months ago one of my nipples became \"normal\" after being inverted my whole life. No big deal, but a \"change\". Yesterday I had a mammogram and they found several areas of denseness in my left breast. Yes, that one. * My grandmother died from breast cancer at age 55 after double mastectomies. * My mother had a mastectomy and chemotherapy at age 39. She is now 56 and doing well. * I am 41 and have been having mammograms since I was 30. * When I was 25 I had a biopsy done on a lump and it was benign. (same breast) I don't know exactly what my question is except maybe what happens next? My doctor is supposed to read my mammogram pictures and compare them to last years and call me within the week. (I can tell you that last year showed no such things. I loved that doctor and she was very thorough.) What will he base his decision on? What is he looking for and what will he do next? As you can guess, I am a bit nervous. I am living in a foreign country and not sure how I feel about that, health care wise. I am afraid of getting substandard health care.",

      "Content": "I am not sure if I can help you. I am new to the forum but I am not new to how learning of breast cancer can affect women. Any difficult news that a woman receives is sometimes almost more than they can process or take in. It can be simply too difficult to interact with others in a meaningful way. Perhaps, she is withdrawing unto herself to better process this news. Maybe you could be there for her without trying to fix/help/analyze/ or anything like that. What she may need here in the beginning is simply your presence. Just sit there and hold her hand. Listen for clues. She will tell you what her needs are. They may be simple things. Listen out for them. I am so sorry that you have to go through this especially so new in your relationship. Best of luck to you.",
