      "Content": "My mother early 2013 have a surgery to remove 1 of her breast. But after surgery. One of a big tumor disappear. After that mum went chemo, radiation and Medicine to remove rest of cells. And during remission went follow up check and scan. This year February. Mum start complain about back pain. At first we believe it might be due to arthritis... gradually the pain spread around TOP to Low back.. During the doctor visit. Mum went for xray. Saw possible tumor in 3 area. Then did a ct mr scan soon. Lung met with thoracic lumbar t4 to t9 tumor and cell which might cause compression to spine. And also adrenal gland tumor. Currently mum at hospital after doing lung biopsy. To determine what lung cell she have. To start treatment for lung and gland. Currently do radiation for her back. What we worry. 1. Paralysis and dementia. 2. Her cancer. I feel there nothing I could do to treat my Mother. Back when she was treating her breast cancer. It weren\u0092t like now as breast cancer stages were recovering. But that disappear tumor from breast seem to return and grow in lung as well as spread to adrenal gland and back lumbar bone. My mum now show signs of memory loss. Doc suspect it might be dementia. My mum have been a good housewife. Never step out into work politics Nor have she spoke bad of anyone. What had she done to suffer like this. There are bad peoples outside but they didn\u0092t have such cancer. I also saw my aunt die from blood cancer last year. A good person too. I\u0092m sorry. Could it be some sins I committed that God decide to punish my mum to teach me a lesson.",
