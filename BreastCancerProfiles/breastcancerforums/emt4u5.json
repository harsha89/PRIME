So I guess there is an underlying reason for my fatigue. Thank you all for your support, and if the written report shows otherwise, I will update you. Thanks for everything, good luck all!!!",

      "Content": "Hello All, I am a 22yo female and I do monthy SBE on myself regularly. About 3 weeks or so ago I found something resembling a lump, about the size of a pencil eraser below and to the left of my aereolar on my left breast. I am a bad patient, so I have been putting off going to the doctors. But a few days ago a found a second lump in close approximation to the first. I have also been quite lethargic lately, sleeping about 12 or so hours at night and then quite often taking an afternoon nap for 2-3 hours because I was so tired (and had done nothing to cause it). This is not normal for me, and I have also started exercising. When I exercise I usually dont need as much sleep because I dont feel as tired all the time. Oh, I also have an extensive family Hx of cancer, my dad=prostate, 1uncle= colon cancer, 1 uncle= brain cancer, 1 cousin=breast cancer, grandmother=leukemia, grandfather=prostate cancer. I know there is a very good chance is could be cancer, especailly since my dad had prostate cancer (which could have been caused by a mutation in the BRCA 1& or 2 gene) and it could have been passed down to me which has been shown to cause breast cancer. I am going to try to make an appointment tomorrow but I wondering what you all think and if the lethargy could be part of it.... Thanks,",
