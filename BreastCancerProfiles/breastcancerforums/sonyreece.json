      "Content": "I just got diagnosed. I've searched all over the net, but I can't find an answer. It's a silly question, but I still cry over how traumatic getting a catheter was 6 years ago and having my breasts exposed these past weeks has been horrifying. Does anyone know if I could wear like erm \"tittie covers\" those little circle things that cover your nipples or maybe tape? I'm scared to ask my doctor, because it seems so stupid, but I know it'd make me feel a million times better if I could cover them. Thanks, to whomever, if whomever, replies.",
