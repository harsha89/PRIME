      "Content": "Hi all, I am new here and was just looking for people that know what I am going through. I was diagnosed with originally with stage 2 breast cancer (triple negative) After more extensive testing they have bumped me to a stage 3. To think that 6 months ago I thought that the worst news would be them telling me I was diabetic or something. Anyway, I have a great team of doctors at Johns Hopkins and at Yale who are working together to get me through this. I have agreed to do a clinical trial so that maybe someone far down this rocky road will be helped. The chemo is 14 weekly treatments, surgery, chemo for 21 biweekly treatments then 6 weeks of daily radiation. If there are no delays I should be done with all of it by 12/09. It seems like forever but it should boost my chances so I won't complain (I don't think I will anyway) I start treatments either this friday or next and I am eager to get it started so it can end. I have been to several appts every week getting to know my team and them to know me and of course more tests but I feel like nothing is happening. I know that this is all important for my overall wellbeing...the tests, the meetings and all of it, I just feel like it has been 8 months and it has only been one. Did anyone else feel like that? I am very hopeful as I know that my team specializes in this and my friends and family have been very good but I am scared as hell too! I just don't know exactly what to expect...side effects, reactions, costs, ongoing support, all of it. Any replies would be great! My heart goes out to all of you who are on this board because you wouldn't be here if this wasn't something that has had an impact on your life personally. Thanks for letting me vent Shag",

      "Content": "Maryanne, I am so sorry to hear that you have to have another biopsy but I have to agree at this point that it is better to be safe than sorry...even though it is scary as hell. I will pray for you! I think the waiting is what is getting to me. Wait to find out if it's possitive. Wait to get tests done, wait to get results... Now I am waiting to get started on treatments which is leaving me feeling uneasy and anxious and out of control since it isn't up to me. This is probably why I don't sleep much anymore. I want to start so it can end, so I can feel like I am doing something about it. I was complaning about not feeling like I was doing anything and my sister told me that getting everything in order was like a coach putting together his team. You can't win the superbowl if you just throw people on the team, you have to interview and test them to see if they are going to be able to take you all the way. When you finally get them all together they will kick ass! I thought that it was a good way to look at it, it really does make sense. So now my team is assembled and practice is starting. I am so scared! I don't know what to expect and that freaks me out. I will be thinking of you and hoping that all goes well. Please let me know. Hugs to you!!!! Shag",

      "Content": "Hi, I finally started treatments today and it will just be the standard 8 rounds of chemo, surgery then radiation. I won't qualify for the clinical trial because it is a lilttle more advanced than they want for it. Oh well! At least now I feel like I am doing something about this. I'm not feeling any side effects like nausea yet and I don't know when that is going to happen so I am just going to hope that it doesn't especially since they gave me a full arsenal of stuff to ward it off. I have become one of those people that picks up batches of perscriptions at a time...I hate taking pills too so this will be new to me also. It was just over one month since I found out but it felt like it had been forever. Stage IIIC Breast Cancer - Diagnosed 5-16-08 Treatment date started TODAY 6-20-08!!!",
