      "Content": "This is just a personal opinion; I'm not a doctor; I'm answering because no-one else has. Once breast cancer has metastasized, it is not curable. It can be managed though, so lucky people can live for many years with reasonable quality of life with mets (like me). I don't know if your mother is on any of the hormone treatments, for instance. Also, mets can sometimes be \"killed\" by radiotherapy or radio-frequency ablation. The 'alternative route' is NOT a substitute for conventional medicine. There is NO evidence to show that most, probably any \"alternative\" treatments work by themselves. \"Beyond stages\" is menaingless really; Stage IV (there is no V) just means metastatic, and that, for breast cancer, can be far from death. If she's lost a lot of weight, it could be that the para above is pretty irrelevant because the disease is very widespread and advanced. Or it could be that she's not eating properly because she's depressed? In terms of what you should do, I feel helpless to advise, not knowing her or you. All I know is what I would do, which is gently to confront her and tell her that you want to share her pain. She may not be talking about it to protect herself from reality as much as to protect you? Also, you should think about what you need just as much as what she needs; it seems likely that she is going to die of this disease eventually, and you are the one who will be left to make sense of it in your life. Perhpas you could try to explain that to her? Best of luck.",

      "Content": "I'm being treated for metastatic breast cancer in the UK, until recently at the Royal Marsden which you may know is the top cancer centre in this country and one of the top world-wide. I don't think it's that likely that there is any very successful drug licensed in the US but not in the Netherlands. I don't know much about the Netherlands' drug regime, but certainly there is nothing non-experimental (ie mainstream) in the US which is not being done in the UK. Apart from that I can only mention things from my own experience that you could follow up. Firstly, I have had radio-frequency ablation of a liver metastasis. This is a much less invasive alternative to liver resection (surgery); a needle is inserted through a very small incision, guided by CT, and the tip heated to kill the tumour, all under general anesthetic. It is normally only done for peeople who have single or anyway few liver mets and perhaps those are growing quite fast, and no other disease currently causing serious symptoms. Anyhow, it only takes a short while to recover (perhaps a week? mainly from the general anaesthetic, as long as the patinet is in reasonably good condition. The other point is, are you sure chemotherapy is really being saved up just for the last few months? There are a number of other chemo regimes which could be tried and which might produce more than \"a few months\" gain, but it is sensible not to use them until the patient has symptoms which affect their lifestyle (and perhaps life). There is nothing to be gained from doing chemo whilst one is still feeling reasonably well. Several of the drugs mentioned by Cindy are chemotherapy drugs; I would be very surprised if, for instance, the taxanes (Taxol and Taxotere) are not routinely used in the Netherlands). I am in the middle of 6 cycles of weekly Taxol (paclitaxel) at the moment; I was NOT given it (by the Marsden) until I developed kidney complications from a pelvic mass (and subsequently was found also to have a pancreatic met). It isn't (so far) too onerous, unlike the epirubicin/cisplatin/capecitabine I had a few years ago - but it isn't as good as not having chemo at all! BTW, if you wanted a second opinion, the Royal Marsden (in London) is a lot closer than the US and (IMHO) would be just as good.",

      "Content": "Hi Tina, I hope this is soon enough after your last post to be useful. I see Muutsmom has given you lots of good responses, but maybe assuming a bit more knowledge about cancer than you have so far. Sorry in advance if the quick summary below is too elementary. There are several different sorts of breast cancer, which start in different structures in your breast. Invasive ductal carcinoma (as per your path report) is the most common, I think. Grading is a way of further subdividing the sort of cancer from its pathological characteristics to predict how aggressive it is (how fast it will grow and spread). That's what the \"Nottingham Grade\" is; III is more aggressive. This being so, haveing surgery sooner rather than later is good, but I rather doubt that a week makes much difference and your surgeon should have said so if it did. Breast cancer (any sort) spreads to the rest of the body via the lymphatic system. Therefore, when women have surgical removal of a breast tumour, they also often have some lymph nodes from the armpit of the affected side removed so they can be biopsied to see if the cancer has spread to them. The \"stage\" of the cancer is calculated from the size of the original tumour, whether any lymph nodes are affected, and whether there is any evidence of spread elsewhere in the body. So you won't know the stage of your cancer until you know about the lymph nodes post-surgery. If the lymph nodes are clear, there is a chance that you can be completely cured by surgery (quite probably with back-up radiotherapy and/or chemo as well). If the cancer has spread, it can't ever be completely cured with our current state of medical knowledge, but it can be slowed up and knocked back for a long time (in my case for 11 years so far) and new treatments are coming on-line all the time. Treatment post-surgery will depend on stage, and also the results of the ER/PR and HER-2 studies referred to in the path report. ER/PR refers to whether your cancer needs estrogen or progsterone to survive and grow - if it does (ie is ER+/PR+) there are all sorts of hormonal therapies available in addition to radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Best of luck and let me know if any more info would be useful. I'm not s doctor, just a longterm breast cancer patient.",

      "Content": "I just looked at the CTCA website and it looks a bit slick to me too....the thing that would concern me is that as well as scientific medical treatment, they appear to provide complementary therapies (mmmm, maybe) but also completely quack \"treatments\" like homeopathy. You would want to make sure that they weren't going to try to sell you this stuff all the time. Just my opinion from reading their website, I have no personal experience with them. BFagan is definitely right that you want to choose somewhere which minimises your travel. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are tiring enough without a long journey - as BFagan says, it would be daily for radiotherapy.",

      "Content": "My guess is that your various doctors are advising aggressive treatment because the original tumour was grade III (ie aggressive itself). I would definitely agree with Muttsmom's advice to focus on the cancer, not a reconstruction. The swollen lymph node is indicative of spread even if it's not definite without a biopsy. Is there a reason you are worried that radiotherapy would have an effect on your partner's heart? AFAIK these days, linear accelerators (ie radiotherapy machines) are much more accurate, and also I see that it is her right breast that is affected (the other side from the heart). What does the radiologist say about this? I think Muttsmom is right that the cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma, not DCIS. Best of luck with whatever you go with.",
