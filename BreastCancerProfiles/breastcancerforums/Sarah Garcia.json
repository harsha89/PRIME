      "Content": "Being diagnosed with breast cancer can be a life changing thing and also seem like the end of the road for anyone because that is how i felt. What i have realized from the support I've been getting from family and friends is that either i fight it and live or i give up and die. My kids are my main inspiration and they give me the fighting spirit i have gained over the months. Although my life has taken a dramatic change,the prayers i receive from church help strengthen my faith everyday.My motto now is fight and live! I hope you'll make it yours too If anyone has an inspirational story of someone or even yourself of how you've taken control and not given up,please feel free to post it as it may help lift mine and other peoples spirits.
