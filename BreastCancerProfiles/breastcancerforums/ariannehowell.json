    "Content": "I can't watch the video? It says the video is private. Anyway, I don't want to see anyone with a breast cancer again. My auntie who lives by the next door have a cancer or did have since we think it's cured. Her kids are too young to understand what happened to their mother (she only have 1 breast now and when she shave her head bald). I can see in my aunt and uncle's face how hard it is to act happy in front of their kids as if they don't have a problem (mostly financial). I'll always ask my mother if she also checks herself once in a while to know if she had one.",
