      "Content": "Hi, She's a little older than you, in her 50's, but I'm not exactly positive of the actual age...I actually haven't asked her what her plans are in terms of what she plans on doing after. It's been kind of a whirlwind...find out about it and a few days later in surgery. She still seems really tired, but I guess it was surgery she just went through. Aside from the emotional shock, were you spending a lot of time sleeping?",

      "Content": "Hi everyone, My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer last week and had a masectomy within the week. She's back home now... The first day she was home from the hospital (they released her the next day) she seemed to have energy, not tired or sleepy, was walking around. She basically seemed fine. Now, a few days later, she seems to be a lot more tired and fatigued...I would have though you'd be tired the day you get back, but gradually get your strength back, but it seems to be the opposite. Is this normal after a surgery? She's starting to cough a little too... I'm concerned, but don't want to freak out and get her concerned too.",
