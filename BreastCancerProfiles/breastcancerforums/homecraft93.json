      "Content": "Hi Rachel, Thank you ever so much for your help and what you say does make sense. I will get in contact with my surgeon's office today and request a copy of the results. I was not offered any other treatment because my surgeon did not think it would benefit me. What has me somewhat upset is when I went to pick up my mammogram films, they included all my films back to 2003. That lump was there but I did not get information until June of 2005. Wonder if something could of been done then when it was not growing? Maybe it wasn't even cancer at that time. It makes me wonder why I was making yearly visits if they were not going to do something about it. I will not be returning to that breast center. Thank you for your help, it is truly appreciated.

      "Content": "Hi, I am new here and have a question about how some of you found out all the information about your tumors. I do not know if mine is estrogen positive or even the size. My surgeon said it was small and she was even surprised that the biposy came back positive. She did the lumpectomy and it came back with clear margins. She did not remove any lymph nodes so I do not know anything about that information. Here is my question, I go to see the radiation oncologist on Tuesday and I do not know what information I have to share with her. Will my radiation oncologist get the information from my surgeon or is it something I need to get? Since my surgeon did not seem too worried about the tumor. I half heartly have the feeling that I should not be worried either but that is not the case. I do not understand why I need to have radiation if the tumor had clean margins and no lymph nodes were removed? My surgeon told me that all lumpectomies get radiation if positive, it is just a insurance measure. She also told me that she has another patient who has the same thing I have and her cancer came back and now she has to remove her breast because you cannot operate on a radiated breast. My big concern is that I have lots of microcalcifications and if one of them should turn then I will lose my entire breast. The radiation did not work for her other patient. This does not make me want to have radiation. I have the feeling that I am darned it is do and darned if I don't. I am sure all of you have had that feeling about this disease. I would appreciate you opinions. BTW, I am 53, menopausal and off HRT for one year. Thank you, Dona",

Result--Benign fatty breast tissue. No tumor seen. I can see that my surgeon really did not have much to report to me, because there is not any information on my report that would suggest estrogen fed or any of the other information that so many of you ladies have received. I have to look at that as a positive. I guess my only concern is, I have all of these califications peppered throughout both of my breast and while they are trying to kill off what cancer that may have been left in the one section with radiation, they are killing off the entire breast for future breast saving surgery. I am not able to have the short session of radiation because my skin is too thin. My surgeon tried to build up the surgical site but the skin kept tearing. As far as the nodes go, she felt it was not an invasive cancer due to the films and the biposy. I have been removed from HRT a year ago and have lost 45 lbs. I am exercising everyday and living the South Beach way of eating. From what you see with my pathology report do you still recommend visiting a oncologist? There are ladies here that have much more to be worried about than myself and I feel somewhat stupid asking such questions. When I should just probably have the radiation and move on with my life. As far as the old breast center goes, I would probably be wasting my time, money and emotional well being even getting into that business. I only wish I had been told so I could of made choices two years ago. I just would of liked to have known. I could not feel my lump either before the HRT or after. When I picked up the films, of course I had to look at them myself and it took me by surprise when I saw 2003 and the spot was circled. Also, all the other microcalifications that showed up looks like I had been hit with buck shot. As far as the cancer goes. Well my grandmother and my aunt both died from cancer. Being it was go long ago they were never diagnosed until it was too late, therefore knowing where it started was never discovered. So my history is not something that any of my doctors could use. Thank you for telling me about the pathology report, that has made me feel better knowing there isn't anything earth shaddering on there. I will take it with me tomorrow to visit the radiation oncologist. I will report her recommendation to you when I get back. I have a lot of homework to do tonight before I get there tomorrow morning. I have about every book from the library. Have a nice day! Thanks again, Dona",

      "Content": "Hi Leeby, I am no way an expert on this topic but I did have mastits once and it sounds very similar to your symptoms, see below. It would not hurt to find a breast surgeon who can do a biposy to see what you have going on in there. I would highly recommend a surgeon who only operates on breast. Please let us know what you discover. Talk Soon, Dona mastitis (măstī´tĭs) , inflammation of the breast. Mastitis most commonly occurs in nursing mothers between the first and third weeks after childbirth, usually of the first child. It is an infection that results when bacteria enter through cracked nipples; the organisms may already be in the body and attack breast tissue weakened by injury. The breast becomes swollen and painful and a high fever may be present. Mastitis is usually easily treated with antibiotics. In severe cases, when an abscess forms within the breast, the suckling baby must be weaned completely. Chronic cystic mastitis is a common, noninfectious but often painful condition in women between 30 and 50 years old, in which cystic nodules develop in the breasts, giving them a lumpy appearance. It sometimes results from a hormonal imbalance. Biopsy may be necessary to distinguish the condition from breast cancer. Another type of mastitis may occur during puberty, and another is associated with other infectious diseases, e.g., mumps and tuberculosis.",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new here and have a question about how some of you found out all the information about your tumors. I do not know if mine is estrogen positive or even the size. My surgeon said it was small and she was even surprised that the biposy came back positive. She did the lumpectomy and it came back with clear margins. She did not remove any lymph nodes so I do not know anything about that information. Here is my question, I go to see the radiation oncologist on Tuesday and I do not know what information I have to share with her. Will my radiation oncologist get the information from my surgeon or is it something I need to get? Since my surgeon did not seem too worried about the tumor. I half heartly have the feeling that I should not be worried either but that is not the case. I do not understand why I need to have radiation if the tumor had clean margins and no lymph nodes were removed? My surgeon told me that all lumpectomies get radiation if positive, it is just a insurance measure. She also told me that she has another patient who has the same thing I have and her cancer came back and now she has to remove her breast because you cannot operate on a radiated breast. My big concern is that I have lots of microcalcifications and if one of them should turn then I will lose my entire breast. The radiation did not work for her other patient. This does not make me want to have radiation. I have the feeling that I am darned it is do and darned if I don't. I am sure all of you have had that feeling about this disease. I would appreciate you opinions. BTW, I am 53, menopausal and off HRT for one year. Thank you, Dona",

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I got back from the radiation oncologist today and she was most helpful. She explained my mammogram films from 2003-2005. Being on HRT during the 2003 and 2004 then off in 2005 showed the differences that is all. I should not of jumped to conclusions. The radiation oncologist is going to get the other part of my report about if it was estrogen fed. It said available upon request. She is going to see if I need to be taking tamoxifn (?). Since I am menopausal and stopped HRT a year ago, I don't think my tumor was estrogen fed. I could of been part of a study since my cancer was so small but I did not want to be concentrating on this for years to come. I had a biposy first and my surgeon took 15 samples of the tumor. Out of the 15 samples 2 were positive. The lumpectomy <1mm is what was left over after the biposy. I asked if that was even enough to consider radiation and of course she told me that one cell is enough to consider radiation. I go for a mammogram tomorrow morning to see if there is any DCIS left in that area. I bet that is going to feel good. On the 23rd I go for a similiation and a CAT scan. I think I will go to the Decorative Artist Convention in Columbus, Ohio on the 18th and put all of this on the back burner. The 23rd will be here before I know it and then I will deal with all of this. I want to thank you ever so much for your help, it is truly appreciated.

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I just had my pathology report faxed to me. I do not see anything other than Left Breast Cancer. This is a little long but I will type it out and let you see. Pre-Operative Left Breast Cancer Post-Operative Same Specimen (s) Recived A. Left Breast Lump B. Superior Margin C. Medial Margin D. Inferior Margin E. Lateral Margin Gross Description A. Received in formalin labeled \"Left Breast Lump\" is an irregularly shaped fragment of fibroadipose tissue and breast tissue which measure 4.5x3.5x3 cm. Traversing the breast tissue is a metallic needle. The external surface is irregular and the specimen is not oriented. The external surface is inked. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an area of induration and firmness along the cut surface which measures 2.1X2 cm along the cut surface. Representative sections of this induration along with surronding breast tissue are submitted in eight cassettes. A. Result--Residual microscopic focus (<1mm) of ductal carcinoma in-situ, solid type with intermediate nuclear grade, adjacent to a previous bioposy site. Negative for invasive carcinoma. B. Recieved in formalin labled \"superior margin\" is a single fragment of firm breast tissue which measures 1.5X0.5x0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in a single cassette labeled B1. B. Result--Benign breast tissue with stromal fibrosis. No tumor seen. C. Received in formalin labeled \"medial margin\" is a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue shich meassures 1.5x1.5x0.5 cm. The specimen is bisceted and submitted entirley in a single cassette labeled C1. C. Result--Benign breast tissue with fibrocystic changes and stromal fibrosis. No tumor seen. D. Received in formalin labeled \"inferior margin\" in a fragment of fibroadipose tissue and breast tissue which measures 2.2x1.8x0.5 cm. the specimen is bisected and submitted in two cassettes labeled D1-D2. D. Result--Benign breast tissue with stromal fibrosis. No tumor seen. E. Received in formalin labeled \"lateral margin\" is a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue and breast tissue which measures 1x0.5x0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1. E. Result--Benign fatty breast tissue. No tumor seen. I can see that my surgeon really did not have much to report to me, because there is not any information on my report that would suggest estrogen fed or any of the other information that so many of you ladies have received. I have to look at that as a positive. I guess my only concern is, I have all of these califications peppered throughout both of my breast and while they are trying to kill off what cancer that may have been left in the one section with radiation, they are killing off the entire breast for future breast saving surgery. I am not able to have the short session of radiation because my skin is too thin. My surgeon tried to build up the surgical site but the skin kept tearing. As far as the nodes go, she felt it was not an invasive cancer due to the films and the biposy. I have been removed from HRT a year ago and have lost 45 lbs. I am exercising everyday and living the South Beach way of eating. From what you see with my pathology report do you still recommend visiting a oncologist? There are ladies here that have much more to be worried about than myself and I feel somewhat stupid asking such questions. When I should just probably have the radiation and move on with my life. As far as the old breast center goes, I would probably be wasting my time, money and emotional well being even getting into that business. I only wish I had been told so I could of made choices two years ago. I just would of liked to have known. I could not feel my lump either before the HRT or after. When I picked up the films, of course I had to look at them myself and it took me by surprise when I saw 2003 and the spot was circled. Also, all the other microcalifications that showed up looks like I had been hit with buck shot. As far as the cancer goes. Well my grandmother and my aunt both died from cancer. Being it was go long ago they were never diagnosed until it was too late, therefore knowing where it started was never discovered. So my history is not something that any of my doctors could use. Thank you for telling me about the pathology report, that has made me feel better knowing there isn't anything earth shaddering on there. I will take it with me tomorrow to visit the radiation oncologist. I will report her recommendation to you when I get back. I have a lot of homework to do tonight before I get there tomorrow morning. I have about every book from the library. Have a nice day! Thanks again, Dona",

If I had to drive 45 miles each way I would not be a happy camper. I live across the river from Cincinnati and there is a hospital almost on every corner. What part of Indiana are you located?

I did stop taking it for a few years a couple of times but without the hormones, I was a mad woman. I ended up with the osteoporosis because I did not take the medicine. So in the long run I cannot blame the HRT for this because it did help with so many other things. My radiation oncologist is having the tumor tested to check the for the estrogen receptors. If it comes back positive, I have mixed emotions about taking the Tamoxifen but if it will keep the cancer from coming back then so be it. I will see her again on the 16th when they do the similation and the CAT scan. Since they discovered more DCIS are they going to be able to do another lumpectomy since you had the mammosite? This is the part I am not happy about. If my DCIS comes back then I will have to have the breast removed, since the whole breast has been radiated. There are so many women on here who have been through 100 times more than myself and I am going to stop worrying about all the What Ifs. I wish you the best of luck with this new procedure.

I was not offered any other treatment because my surgeon did not think it would benefit me. What has me somewhat upset is when I went to pick up my mammogram films, they included all my films back to 2003. That lump was there but I did not get information until June of 2005. Wonder if something could of been done then when it was not growing? Maybe it wasn't even cancer at that time. It makes me wonder why I was making yearly visits if they were not going to do something about it. I will not be returning to that breast center. Thank you for your help, it is truly appreciated.

I was not offered any other treatment because my surgeon did not think it would benefit me. What has me somewhat upset is when I went to pick up my mammogram films, they included all my films back to 2003. That lump was there but I did not get information until June of 2005. Wonder if something could of been done then when it was not growing? Maybe it wasn't even cancer at that time. It makes me wonder why I was making yearly visits if they were not going to do something about it. I will not be returning to that breast center. Thank you for your help, it is truly appreciated.

      "Content": "Hi Rachel, I just had my pathology report faxed to me. I do not see anything other than Left Breast Cancer. This is a little long but I will type it out and let you see. Pre-Operative Left Breast Cancer Post-Operative Same Specimen (s) Recived A. Left Breast Lump B. Superior Margin C. Medial Margin D. Inferior Margin E. Lateral Margin Gross Description A. Received in formalin labeled \"Left Breast Lump\" is an irregularly shaped fragment of fibroadipose tissue and breast tissue which measure 4.5x3.5x3 cm. Traversing the breast tissue is a metallic needle. The external surface is irregular and the specimen is not oriented. The external surface is inked. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an area of induration and firmness along the cut surface which measures 2.1X2 cm along the cut surface. Representative sections of this induration along with surronding breast tissue are submitted in eight cassettes. A. Result--Residual microscopic focus (<1mm) of ductal carcinoma in-situ, solid type with intermediate nuclear grade, adjacent to a previous bioposy site. Negative for invasive carcinoma. B. Recieved in formalin labled \"superior margin\" is a single fragment of firm breast tissue which measures 1.5X0.5x0.3 cm. The specimen is bisected and submitted entirely in a single cassette labeled B1. B. Result--Benign breast tissue with stromal fibrosis. No tumor seen. C. Received in formalin labeled \"medial margin\" is a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue shich meassures 1.5x1.5x0.5 cm. The specimen is bisceted and submitted entirley in a single cassette labeled C1. C. Result--Benign breast tissue with fibrocystic changes and stromal fibrosis. No tumor seen. D. Received in formalin labeled \"inferior margin\" in a fragment of fibroadipose tissue and breast tissue which measures 2.2x1.8x0.5 cm. the specimen is bisected and submitted in two cassettes labeled D1-D2. D. Result--Benign breast tissue with stromal fibrosis. No tumor seen. E. Received in formalin labeled \"lateral margin\" is a single fragment of fibroadipose tissue and breast tissue which measures 1x0.5x0.4 cm. The specimen is entirely submitted in cassette E1. E. Result--Benign fatty breast tissue. No tumor seen. I can see that my surgeon really did not have much to report to me, because there is not any information on my report that would suggest estrogen fed or any of the other information that so many of you ladies have received. I have to look at that as a positive. I guess my only concern is, I have all of these califications peppered throughout both of my breast and while they are trying to kill off what cancer that may have been left in the one section with radiation, they are killing off the entire breast for future breast saving surgery. I am not able to have the short session of radiation because my skin is too thin. My surgeon tried to build up the surgical site but the skin kept tearing. As far as the nodes go, she felt it was not an invasive cancer due to the films and the biposy. I have been removed from HRT a year ago and have lost 45 lbs. I am exercising everyday and living the South Beach way of eating. From what you see with my pathology report do you still recommend visiting a oncologist? There are ladies here that have much more to be worried about than myself and I feel somewhat stupid asking such questions. When I should just probably have the radiation and move on with my life. As far as the old breast center goes, I would probably be wasting my time, money and emotional well being even getting into that business. I only wish I had been told so I could of made choices two years ago. I just would of liked to have known. I could not feel my lump either before the HRT or after. When I picked up the films, of course I had to look at them myself and it took me by surprise when I saw 2003 and the spot was circled. Also, all the other microcalifications that showed up looks like I had been hit with buck shot. As far as the cancer goes. Well my grandmother and my aunt both died from cancer. Being it was go long ago they were never diagnosed until it was too late, therefore knowing where it started was never discovered. So my history is not something that any of my doctors could use. Thank you for telling me about the pathology report, that has made me feel better knowing there isn't anything earth shaddering on there. I will take it with me tomorrow to visit the radiation oncologist. I will report her recommendation to you when I get back. I have a lot of homework to do tonight before I get there tomorrow morning. I have about every book from the library. Have a nice day! Thanks again, Dona",

If I had to drive 45 miles each way I would not be a happy camper. I live across the river from Cincinnati and there is a hospital almost on every corner. What part of Indiana are you located? I am about 20 minutes from Lawrenceburg, Indiana. I had been on HRT almost all my life since I had premature ovarian failure as a young girl. I did stop taking it for a few years a couple of times but without the hormones, I was a mad woman. I ended up with the osteoporosis because I did not take the medicine. So in the long run I cannot blame the HRT for this because it did help with so many other things. My radiation oncologist is having the tumor tested to check the for the estrogen receptors. If it comes back positive, I have mixed emotions about taking the Tamoxifen but if it will keep the cancer from coming back then so be it. I will see her again on the 16th when they do the similation and the CAT scan. Since they discovered more DCIS are they going to be able to do another lumpectomy since you had the mammosite? This is the part I am not happy about. If my DCIS comes back then I will have to have the breast removed, since the whole breast has been radiated. There are so many women on here who have been through 100 times more than myself and I am going to stop worrying about all the What Ifs. I wish you the best of luck with this new procedure. I will most certainly keep you in my prayers for a benign diagnosis. Let me know how everything turns out please. Sincerely, Dona",

      "Content": "Hi, I am new here and have a question about how some of you found out all the information about your tumors. I do not know if mine is estrogen positive or even the size. My surgeon said it was small and she was even surprised that the biposy came back positive. She did the lumpectomy and it came back with clear margins. She did not remove any lymph nodes so I do not know anything about that information. Here is my question, I go to see the radiation oncologist on Tuesday and I do not know what information I have to share with her. Will my radiation oncologist get the information from my surgeon or is it something I need to get? Since my surgeon did not seem too worried about the tumor. I half heartly have the feeling that I should not be worried either but that is not the case. I do not understand why I need to have radiation if the tumor had clean margins and no lymph nodes were removed? My surgeon told me that all lumpectomies get radiation if positive, it is just a insurance measure. She also told me that she has another patient who has the same thing I have and her cancer came back and now she has to remove her breast because you cannot operate on a radiated breast. My big concern is that I have lots of microcalcifications and if one of them should turn then I will lose my entire breast. The radiation did not work for her other patient. This does not make me want to have radiation. I have the feeling that I am darned it is do and darned if I don't. I am sure all of you have had that feeling about this disease. I would appreciate you opinions. BTW, I am 53, menopausal and off HRT for one year. Thank you, Dona",

      "Sample": "I guess my only concern is, I have all of these califications peppered throughout both of my breast and while they are trying to kill off what cancer that may have been left in the one section with radiation, they are killing off the entire breast for future breast saving surgery. I am not able to have the short session of radiation because my skin is too thin....I am not able to have the short session of radiation because my skin is too thin. My surgeon tried to build up the surgical site but the skin kept tearing....I asked if that was even enough to consider radiation and of course she told me that one cell is enough to consider radiation. I go for a mammogram tomorrow morning to see if there is any DCIS left in that area....So in the long run I cannot blame the HRT for this because it did help with so many other things. My radiation oncologist is having the tumor tested to check the for the estrogen receptors....",
