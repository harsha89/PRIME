    "Content": "Hi my name is Chaim,and I just found out that my little brother might have breast cancer. He is only 15 years old!! He said he went to the clinic and they wouldnt see him or take it seriously till its the size of a walnut. Its already grown 5 times the size it originally was. Our family doesnt have insurance or money. I am very worried cause our mom just passed from breast cancer partly because we couldnt afford proper health care! What can we do for him!! Please help!",
