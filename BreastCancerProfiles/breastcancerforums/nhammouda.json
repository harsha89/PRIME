    "Content": "Dear All, My other is 67 years old. 10 months ago she had a breast cancer surgery, chemo, radiation, and then started taking FEMARA. Now, she has vaginal bleeding and the tests show signs of changes in the cells. Her gyno says she will probably develop endometrial cancer in a few months and wants to remove her uterus. I have the following questions please: 1-Is this an indication that the cancer will spread later on to other organs of her body? Is she dying in other words? 2-The hormonal treatment FEMARA has little risks of developing endometrial cancer, but after 3 months of taking it she already has signs of starting on this path. Shall she stop it?? 3-Will she need to take it still after removing the uterus? Would appreciate your answers please, i really tried searching the net, but i can't find anything that talks about having both breast and endometrial cancers and the survival rate of women having both? Thanks a lot. Nehal",
