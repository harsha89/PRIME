      "Content": "Age 65. Menopaused. Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. Grade 2 FNAC done My mother just had a biopsy done and the results came yesterday. The doctors recommended further tests and surgery. However we are not keen in doing the surgery in Bangladesh and are planning to take her to India and we are in the process of applying for medical visa. now, we are torn between choosing treatment center. kolkata is closer to us and will be better for follow up treatments. But most people we know are referring Chennai. Can i get your good thoughts between kolkata and chennai treatments? We were planning to take appointment from Apollo kolkata or Chennai. Does anyone have any experience over there that they can share? Thanks for your thougths",
