    "Content": "Hi, I'm new to this site, and need help with a question. I was dx in Nov. 04 with Ductal Invasive BC in left br., choose to have Bi-lateral on Dec. 28th. 3 tumers largest, 1.8cm, total was 7cm. 8 out of 17 noes positive. Histologic grade, 3/3, I'm ++-. Started chemo, 6 TAC treatments, two weeks ago. My question is about the nodes. What does fixed or matted mean when speaking of axillary nodes? Also, movable axillary nodes. Also, it seems it broke out of the lymph nodes and was found in the skin, would this be matastic BC of the skin? Thank you for you time and help. Rhonda, age 45",
