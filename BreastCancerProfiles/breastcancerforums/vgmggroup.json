    "Content": "hello everyone, I was recently diagnosed with Stage 1A multifocal invasive cancer with no lymphovascular invasion. Estrogen receptor positive Progestrone receptor positive HER 2 negative Oncotype score @ 20 In consultation with 2 different Oncologists, we have received 2 different treatment options. One suggested CFM @ 8 sessions with 2 week intervals. The other suggested TC @ 4 sessions with 3 week interval. We are totally confused as to what we should do... Please share your experiences if anyone has faced a similar dilemma Thank",
