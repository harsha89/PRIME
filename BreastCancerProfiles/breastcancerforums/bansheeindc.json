    "Content": "I am glad I found this board. I am asking these questions for my mother who, unfortunately doesn't feel she has these answers from her surgeon. She had a bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction using expanders. We are wondering how long recovery takes? When does the swelling generally go down? She is 4 weeks out of surgery but feels really tight at night. She is afraid she will always feel uncomfortable. Can anyone share their experiences? Thanks so much in advance. Jane",
