    "Content": "I had Stage I, ER+ breast cancer in April, 2010. I had a lumpectomy, chemo and radiation and am cancer free as far as I know. In reading my surgical report prior to my oncology visit this week, I was wondering if I should be tested for inflammation. My doc said they wouldn't know what to do with the test results if it came back high and didn't know if the inflammation was only at the site of the tumor. Here's the wording on the pathology report: - Invasive ductal carcinoma, with focal ductal carcinoma-in-situ (WHO classification), with multifocal moderate chronic inflammation (surgical margins uninvolved). Does anyone know if I should be concerned with body wide inflammation?",
