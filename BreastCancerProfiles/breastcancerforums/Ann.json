I see you are on a lot of different pills for different things. I don't take anything right now because I am so afraid of the potential side effects from drugs that have not been on the market long enough to know what bad effect they may have. I heard on the news all the time about new things coming out about drugs we all thought we good. It seems to be about the money.. these drug companies a rich, rich, rich. It also bothered me that chemo studies are often funded by drug companies which further scares me with regard to trusting the results. We will all just hang in there and keep trying. Keep me posted on your status. Blessings of continued bc free results. Ann",

I forgot to add I will be taking Tamoxifen for 2-3 years ,then switch to a Aromatase Inhibitor for the balance of 5 years .Still learning as I go . I have full use of the arm now that my mastectomy affected . Doc was amazed as it has only been a month since my surgery. As soon as the weather gets nice up here in the Yukon will be walking more ,until then I do what I can . I am glad to read your wife has responded well to her treatment.

I won't be going for reconstruction as that is more surgery and not all of those turn out right and besides I am not a vain person. I am just as much a woman with one breast as I was with two breasts. My chemotherapy will be the use of Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide (big words for a IV cocktail) . I have a prescriptions for nausea and bowel problems. I should be starting chemotherapy in about ten days . My husband and I are getting things ready in our home to make things go smoother. I'll be in touch as my chemotherapy progresses ,,hugs Ann",

      "Content": "Welcome home Shelly ! I had to take sleeping pills for a couple of weeks, and then stopped so I wouldn't get dependent on them. You need your rest during the night so see what your doctor suggests. I am not a big pill taker, but since I got bc I have had to take a fews things to help me through the journey. I am so glad you don't have much pain. The surgery has now done 75% of the work by removing the tumor and lymph glands. I hope they wait on chemo until after Christmas too. I can't imagine that a few days will make that much difference and it seems like you will need to heal and get your strength back. Before you fall asleep at night do deep breathing a mediate for about 5 minutes. This helps me relax and my sleep is much better. Love, Hollis",
