    "Content": "Hi Im am new here and very scared. I am 46 and have IDC stage2a grade3 with 1 node of 8 positive. ER/PR+ HER2-. Last week I had my lumpectomy and that went ok. What I am really scared of is the grade and how that will present itself later on. I have not received my CTscan results yet. My chemo will start on June 9th A/C 4 treatments every 2 weeks then Taxol for 12 weeks, Rads then anti hormone. Is 12 weeks standard care Should I be this worried? I am trying to be positive but it is really hard. Any advice will help. Love and healing to everybody out there Thanks Lisa",
