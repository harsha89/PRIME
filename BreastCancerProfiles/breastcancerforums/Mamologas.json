    "Content": "Originally Posted by nettieB Does anyone else have the symptoms I have had...just looking for a little insight....one breast noticeably bigger, whole arm pit area swollen ( I guess I should say it's more like a thickening more than swollen) night sweats , slight pain in upper back around shoulder blade ,unexplained weight loss ( but I think that is done now) lump that was picked up on mammogram that I couldn't feel back in April but can now, started out as a little pea size but has gotten about the size of a bean. Like I said just looking for a little insight as I have been dealing with this since April and have gotten no answers as of yet and I have a 2nd opinion Dr' s apt on July 11th.... Hey, my name is Mamologas. My advice for you - you have to visit doctor and do mammography...and it's necessary to do immediately. Private clinics can take you quickly.",
