      "Content": "Hello ladies. My name is Brittany and I'm from Florida. I do not have breast cancer, but my aunt does. I pray for you all. I joined this forum today because I was doing my exam and found a lump in my breast. I'm making an appointment to see the doctor tomorrow morning. Please keep me in your thoughts. I'm only 19 years old, so this is very scary for me. Thank you all so much, and I look forward to hearing all of your stories.",
