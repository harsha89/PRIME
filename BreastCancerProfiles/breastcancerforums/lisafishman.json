      "Content": "Thanks so much for talking with me. I was so happy after my uterus cancer it seemed so simply and it was all gone I went to a top doctor. So strangely something said to me I better go for a mammography because maybe estrogen caused the uterus cancer most likely so maybe it caused me to have breast cancer as well. Not that I take any kind of estrogen just hormonal I mean. So I went after not going for seven years because I am very bad with tests I hate waiting for results. I needed two biopsies in my right breast he said they are microcalifications probably stage o. It turned out only one area was cancer stage 1 so now I have to go to a breast surgeon going on Saturday. Wow how can this happen one after another. Part of me says maybe I am luckily everything is being caught early considering I haven't gone in a long time. I dont know what it means stage 1 invasive",
