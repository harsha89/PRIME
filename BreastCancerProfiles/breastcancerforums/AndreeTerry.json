      "Content": "I was diagnosed and treated for breast cancer in 2004 and have been on arimidex for almost two years. The wrist pain I have on the same right side is severe and interferes with my ability to work and perform daily tasks. My middle finger is also stiff and the pad of the thumb is sore. I am not sure it is from the arimidex as I have been reading about auxilliary web sydrome- this is a condition in which you have scar tissue form on the nerves in the area of your surgery and/or node dissection. The pain appears in your hand/wrist/forearm. Massage to break up the scar tissue is suppsed to help but acupuncture is contraindicated due to the risk of lymphedema. I hope this pain is from arimidex and will be gone when I stop the med in three years...but I am afraid it may be the web syndrome and in fact be permanent. Is anyone else familiar with this condition? My surgeon retired so I am unable to see him about this. AndreeTerry",
