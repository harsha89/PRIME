    "Content": "I have just been advised to have a biopsy for BIRADS 4 cluster microcalcification. Why is it that some sites (namely johns hopkins) say the chances of cancer in this case is 20% and other sites say 25-50%. It is very confusing as one puts the risk quite low and the other quite high. Also 25-50% is such a wide range - why is this? Thanks",
