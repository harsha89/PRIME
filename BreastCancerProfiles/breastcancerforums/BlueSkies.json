      "Content": "Hi.. Not too sure if the medication that you require is included, but it's definitely worth a check. Last week I went to Long's Drug to purchase Tamoxifen for my wife. I was initially quoted $105.00 for a 30-day supply, but when it came time to pay, I noticed a sign saying that a discount is given to AAA members, and so I presented my AAA card expecting maybe a $5.00 to $10.00 discount. Imagine my surprise when the total amount was reduced to $46.00! That was a 60% discount!! We too do not have insurance.",

      "Content": "Hi. I'm hoping that someone can help me with some questions that have been bothering me. My wife was diagnosed with Stage 3A breast cancer in December 2005. Lumpectomy was performed the same month, followed by chemotherapy, 4 x dose dense A/C and 4 X dose dense Taxol. She is currently undergoing radiation treatment which is being performed 5 X weekly, total of 6 weeks. She is also on Tamoxifen. My question involves follow up tests after both chemotherapy and radiation are done. I have repeatedly asked her oncologist about this and he has always replied that she only has to be physically checked every 3 months. I have read and heard that other women have had ct scans and checks done on the number of cancer cells remaining. I don't feel right that only physical checks will be done, as I feel that that would only detect a lump when the tumor has grown. And besides, how do you detect a tumor in the liver or lungs this way? Also, there is no yardstick against which to measure the effectiveness of the chemotherapy. I would very much appreciate any advice and/or opinion regarding this matter. It has me worrying day and night.",

      "Content": "Vee Smith, thanks very much for your reply. My wife's oncologist and radiologist pretty much said the same thing. I would really like to get on with our lives as it was before cancer, but it seems that life has changed forever. Nevertheless, your post, together with speaking to my wife's radiologist earlier today have made me better realise that we have to move on, and not let cancer control us.",

      "Content": "Hello Wandergo. My wife was diagnosed December of 2005 with breast cancer at the age of 38 and underwent lumpectomy the same month. The surgery revealed 7 of 15 positive lymph nodes but CT scans showed no metastases, that being stage 3A. I too was very, very scared then, and still am even today. I think about our future all the time, and it is almost always my waking thought everyday. But I do my best not to show her how afraid I am. We are now finished with dose dense chemotherapy ac+t every 2 weeks same as yours, which ended May 4. Her radiation therapy is scheduled to begin June 8, but the doctor had her start on hormone therapy Tamoxifen a week after chemo. I know that it is very difficult to remain positive, but always think that it could be worse. The fact that the doctor has recommended an aggressive chemo regimen for you is in itself a sign that there is an excellent chance that you will surmount this obstacle. So that should be something to be thankful for. Keep yourself physically healthy and strong to be able to finish the chemotheraphy. Stay positive, be strong. You may have cancer, but cancer does not have you.",
