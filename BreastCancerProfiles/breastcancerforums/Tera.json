      "Content": "Sue, no you are not alone. Believe me, there are alot of people who have difficulty coping with the loss of a loved one. It is normal and everyone is different. Everyone grieves at a different pace. I'm an emotional person so I cry alot. I think that is what helps me cope with things. But the big cry....hmmm, sometimes it is something else that precipitates the big cry. Mine hit me when I got into a small argument with my husband over something. He was trying to convince me of something and I got so frustrated at him I started crying and then boom....it hit me. I hadn't cried like that since my divorce from my ex-husband. some don't have the big cry. Fro them, the tears are cathartic. Flashbacks are normal too but they will lessen in time and and time goes on, you will have more good memories and less bad ones. Please, don't consider yourself abnormal for not having had the big cry yet or for the flashbacks. Sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to. Do you have a trsuted clergyperson/layperson, family member, good friend, etc. to lend a shoulder? You can see a grief counselor. If your mom used Hospice, they have trained professionals and the family can take advantage of that for free for some time after the death. If you need help dealing with it, by all means, get some help so you can move forward. I know ti is hard, believe me, I know. But you CAN get through it. Sometimes we get so caught up being strong for other people, we forget to be strong or to be there for ourselves. Take care of yourself. The best way to take car of your kids and husband is to take care of yourself first.",
