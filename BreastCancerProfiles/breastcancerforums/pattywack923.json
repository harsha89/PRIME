      "Content": "Originally Posted by Kermica Hi Pat and welcome to the place no one wants to be but many come to value. This site is exclusively for people like you and I, people who have or have had cancer, their caregivers and family members so, again, welcome. There are a lot of caring and supportive people here and I am sure that some may be able to provide you with insights or ideas that may prove useful as you rebuild your life after cancer. That is what many of us are forced to do by this beast, isn't it - literally rebuild our lives, which have been changed forever by our illness and by our experiences fighting it. You are also right when you say that it can take eveery resource we have to fight it and that is not fair. We have many Forums on this site. Three that I thnk may help you are the Breast Cancer, the Coping and Support and, perhaps, the Financial Question Forum. Take the time to take a look, introduce yourself if you choose and contribute where you can. You will be helping yourself and everyone on this Board by doing so...good luck. Good health, kermica Thank you so much.....Hope everything goes well for you",

      "Content": "Hello, my name is Pat i am a brest cancer survivor two years now had a left masectamy 33 radiation treament and a year of chemo. we never know what life is gonna throw or way but we as humans deal with and move on. Yes I am a survivor and proud to say such but....when all is said and done and all treament are complete and thousands and thousands of dollars tucked away in someone elses pocket the survivor is so deep in dept depression and pain that there seems to be no end insight. The only answers you get is well your a survivor ok thank God for that....but in the meanwhile I have lost everything I have worked for in my life house job dignity and the power to be able to live my life as it was before, My body hurts daily my mind is humm I don't know I guess it got washed away in the chemo I do not want pitty I just want answers I think if a doctors is going to stand behind the treaments you are receiving they should also stand behind the long term issue that we deal with after the fact. My experiance has been ok go to your general practice doctor and let them take care of those problems why? thats my question.....I think more research needs to go into the problems that we endure for years to come....Thanks for letting me vent... I would also like to take this opputunity to thank all that took care of me during my treatment. pat",
