      "Content": "The first line of defense against breast cancer is undoubtedly self examination. It is important to regularly examine your breasts so that you get a feel for their normal shape and appearance. This will then allow you to notice anything out of the ordinary that little bit quicker. What to look for Specific things to look for when conducting a self examination include: \u2022 A change in the color, shape or texture of the nipple, \u2022 Dimpling of the skin around the breast tissue, \u2022 New lumps, either just below the skin or deep within the breast tissue, \u2022 Lumps within the armpit area. These signs need to be reported to your doctor as soon as possible so that a definite diagnosis can be made. in summary There are 3 main stages in the diagnosis of breast cancer: 1. Self examination that reveals some form of abnormality within the tissues of the breast, 2. Mammogram or ultrasound scan followed by a biopsy of any lumps that are present, 3. Further tests that will reveal the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread to other areas of the body. As you can see it is up to you to start the diagnosis process and this is why it is vital that you examine your breasts regularly and thoroughly.",

      "Content": "reast cancer information are always being investigated and interpreted in the hope that one of the new methods are generating a improvement. Using the reports of a decade ago to those nowadays it seems apparant that breast cancer analysts make points and that success rates are generally increasing. {link deleted per forum policy} There are certainly numerous reports relating to breast cancer currently available but below you\u2019ll get the most surprising ones available. \u2022 Breast cancer is now the most prevalent form of cancer in the world. \u2022 It is also the second leading root cause of cancer related deaths inside the women number, coming in directly behind lung cancer. Information show that close to 465,000 females die each year from breast cancer. \u2022 It is predicted that over the next two years i.e. 2011 and 2012, around three million fresh new members of breast cancer will be recognized around the world (the true information won\u2019t be available for many years though). It's also considered that approximately 2.5 million of these cases will be in females. \u2022 The above statistic shows that 1 in every 4 females identified as having cancer are in fact determined with breast cancer. \u2022 On an international scale, one in every ten cancers who are discovered turn out to be breast cancer, or have breast cancer as being the prime spot of progress. \u2022 Even with all of the gloomy statistics on top of, 89% of people diagnosed with breast cancer remain alive five years right after the initial identification, and this number continues to grow. The information so far mentioned are based on worldwide numbers. The next data however focuses on the residents of America. \u2022 If every woman in the US lived to 70+ years, 1 in eight would be diagnosed with breast cancer at some stage in their life. Mainly because not everyone lives earlier 70 years of age however the probability falls to around one in every fifteen females. \u2022 The threat of breast cancer growing increases drastically with age. So for example, a 25 year old woman has a 1 in two thousand chance of being identified as having the disease whereas a sixty five year old woman has a 1 in 26 chance. \u2022 Nearly 80% of breast cancer conditions occur in women older than fifty. \u2022 There is a 3% chance that breast cancer may cause the death of any individual American citizen. This may not look like a likely consequence but it is two times that of most other types of cancer. \u2022 Less than 1% of brand new breast cancer cases are diagnosed in men. This means that less than two thousand new cases are estimated for this year i.e. 2011 (again the exact numbers will need many years to come out). \u2022 Of the 465,000 females that pass away of breast cancer each year, almost 40,000 of these are American. As you have seen the statistics go on and on however the good news is that the incidence of breast cancer on a worldwide range is decreasing by around 2% each year. Those that are identified are living longer and seeing more cures as well, and so all the signs are optimistic for a major breakthrough in the world of breast cancer.",

      "Content": "[LEFT]An unusual technique often used to treat sports injuries is now helping breast cancer survivors as well. It involves the use of specialized metal tools to dig deep into the muscle in search of scar tissue. \"A lot of times with breast cancer patients, where their surgery's been, they get a lot of scar tissue,\" says physical therapist Carrie Cameron as she works to loosen the hardened tissue around the chest and shoulder area of a breast cancer survivor. To help her break up the scar tissue, she uses a set of medieval looking tools we first reported on last year. They're part of a system known as the Graston Technique, and therapists say the metal tools vibrate as they travel over hardened tissue. Julie Wong runs PROactive Physical Therapy in San Francisco. Her clinic is increasingly using the Graston Technique and other deep tissue massage techniques to treat women who have undergone mastectomies. The issue is often encapsulation -- a side effect caused by the body's reaction to implants placed in the breast area after cancer surgery. \"So if this is a foreign object, you get scar tissue formed around the implant, you get encapsulation. The implant is going to look more bulbous like this. But the implant is not moving, so at this point we need to manually work on breaking up the scar tissue by manually moving the implant,\" she says. Other types of breast cancer surgery, such as the removal of lymphs, can also produce scar tissue that limits mobility. \"And by breaking up those fibers you can actually improve mobility, decrease pain and increase range of motion,\" says Dr. Shelley Hwang, chief of breast surgery at the UCSF Buck Breast Care Center. Therapies such as the Graston Technique can be painful, and it may also take a number of sessions to produce results. But therapists say the treatments can produce a significant improvement in quality of life for breast cancer survivors. \"As we release scar tissue, it allows them to be able to stand up better with better posture, move their arm better and decrease their pain,\" Cameron said. Side effects can include bruising and insurance coverage isn't 100 percent, though the procedure is often covered as part of post-surgical rehabilitation {Image deleted.
