      "Content": "Thank you all for your relpies. I beleive the radiologist wasn't concerned as the findings werent solid and therefore classified as \"a cluster of cysts\". I was only aware of one lump. As for the itching.. it continues but isn't as bad... it really seems to be bearable then come back as furious as ever. As for the lymph node in my armpit ..I dont have a clue I tried finding it after I had the ultrasound...armpits just seem lumpy to me Take care, Mother Bear",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm concerned about a few symptoms.... Before I start ...I'm 33 and I found a lump in my breast, had an ultrasound and mammo which found a cluster of cysts. The radiologist felt that a biopopsy was not required. It also showed a moderate swelling of the lymph nodes in my armpit approx 2.8 cm long and 8mm diameter which appeared to be non vascular hilum. That was two weeks ago...and no further action would be taken. Since then I have been driven crazy with itching. So I went back to my doctor... I asked if these could be related and she asked my why and went on the say... no. It looks like an allergic reaction. So I guess my question is should I be worried or not? The itching is all over my body from time to time but one area on my lower arm is driving me crazy it usally is the same place. Plaes any advice would be wonderful, Mother bear.",

      "Content": "I have been living with the itching ever since I first wrote this post. I beleived the two different doctors when they said I was fine and not to worry. Since then I have continued to itch on my forarm and now my neck, the axilla lymph nodes have not changed. I was told it was caused by my now failing thyriod, but medicatition is not helping. I seen a new GP last week as I feel so tired and unwell. He has refered me to a breast surgeon, and I have an appiontment in three weeks. He mentioned thicking and some indentation of my nipple. He also believes I have had a breast infection for the past eight years as my breast milk never stopped and over the years has became an infection. It 's now green and again I first spoke to a doctor about this six months after I stopped breast feeding. The doctor said don't worry some womens milk just doesnt stop. It isn't a continually flow and only expresses during some months of self breast exams. I now feel completely stupid for believing the doctors that it was fine and for not noticing any indentation. To be honest I still can't see it. He doesn't want to start treating the infection until he knows what it is exactly. As my immune system is not able to contain the infection anymore. Hence the worsening rash, and the underactive thyriod ect. Really needed to vent, Thank all for allowing me too Plaes take care",
