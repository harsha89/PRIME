      "Content": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the 'accepted' method for categorizing someone as pre or post menopausal. The reason I'm asking is because some cancer treatment is based on that status and I got different responses from two different doctors. Before starting my chemo this year I was 50 and still having some periods but they were spread out, not a regular monthly thing anymore as I presume I was heading toward menopause. When I initially met with my oncologist he said he would do some blood work to determine my menopausal status and from that he said I was post menopausal and that after treatments I would go on Arimidex (vs Tamoxifen). Thereafter I spoke with another doctor to get a seond opinion on some things and that doctor said if I had had a period in the recent past I was still pre-menopausal and did not give any merit to any blood work to determine the menopausal status. That doctor said I should go on Tamoxifen after treatment rather than Arimidex. I'd appreciate any comments on this differing assessment and how I should really be categorized, pre or post? Thanks",

      "Content": "Hi, As I mentioned previously, after completing chemo my oncologist put me on tamoxifen which I have been taking for over a month now. Since starting the tamoxifen, I have become quite self conscious and embarrassed because I have grown a lot of facial hair. I did not ever recall anyone mentioning facial hair as a tamoxifen side effect but I was digging around for information on what might be causing it and came across the following side effect listed for tamoxifen at one of the breast cancer care web sites: A small number of women notice an increase in downy facial hair or changes to their singing voice I know that I should just be happy to be alive but this side effect is driving me crazy and doing nothing to boost my already depleted self image or confidence as a woman. Has anyone else experienced this problem and does anyone know of any possible remedies? I guess there are some hair removal treatments but I don't know anything about them or how safe they are. Suggestions anyone? Feeling like I'm turning into a werewolf... gail",

      "Content": "I still have some confusion that maybe you can clarify. It is my understanding that Arimidex is only for post menopausal women. 1) Why is that and what happens if it's take by someone who is pre- or peri- menopausal? 2) Given the status of my period as previously described would you say I should consider myself post menopausal and therefore a candidate for Arimidex? or only if I was to be tested now and find elevated FSH 3) I didn't have any further periods once I started the chemo so does that mean I should start out on Tamoxifen and then could switch to Arimidex once I have gone a year without a period? It is great that you are able to make this forum available!",
