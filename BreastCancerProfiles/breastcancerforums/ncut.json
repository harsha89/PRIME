    "Content": "Hi, I also have a friend who has metaplastic breast cancer. She had several chemo drug treatments but none have worked. She is currently in a clinical trial at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston under the care of Dr. Eric Winer. He is the Director of Breast Oncology. They are testing a drug (Cetuximab) which effects EGFR. No news to report at this point but we are hopeful that this works.",
