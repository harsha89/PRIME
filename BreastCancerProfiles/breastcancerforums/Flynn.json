I am very afraid of getting a breats cancer and though I am very young so far but still I visit doctor regurarly just to make sure that everything is ok becaue my grandmother had a breats cancer and I have been taking contraceptive pills for 5 years now and I am not planning to have a kids. So that is why I am so worried. My question is how often do you think I should see a doctor and have an echoscopy just to be sure that even if something is wrong it is not too late?
