    "Content": "I'm posting with my girlfriend's account, but I experienced the same thing when I was younger. First off, you should get it checked by your doctor just to be safe... a visit isn't going to harm anyone. That said, I wouldn't be too nervous about it. I had exactly the same thing under both of my nipples. They are most likely harmless cysts. My mom is a nurse practitioner and she had told me that they are common in guys going through puberty. A friend of mine actually had one so big that you could see it under his shirt. Mine went away and I didn't even realize it. I won't worry about it at all, especially since it's right under the nipple. That's exactly where I know of them occuring. But once again, go get it checked out just to be safe. You're always better safe than sorry.",
