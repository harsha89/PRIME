      "Content": "Thank you so much for your reply. Both of my older brothers are doctors, so I think my specialist is being extra cautious. There was no lump found in the left breast only a suspicious density and assymetry when compared with the other breast. I had been noticing breast pain for about 6-8 months. It was always in the 5 days before my period and always finished when my period started. My brothers had reassured me that this sounded like cyclic breast pain, but my family doctor wanted it investigated as the pain is only ever in the left breast. He refered me for a mammogram on both breasts and ultrasound on the left breast. I was shocked when they told me that I needed to go straight back to my family doctor. The doctor who did the ultrasound told me that although the ultrasound was clear, the mammogram warranted further investigation. My specialist told me that the left breast was smaller than the right and this could account for the assymetry. He also did a thorough physical exam and couldn't feel anything that he felt was sinister. However, he did want the slides reviewed by a radiographer he trusts, so that is why he got a 2nd opinion. I also have a prolactinoma which affects my prolactin and everyone was unsure of how this affects the breast tissue on mammograms. I will definitely be keeping an eye on things. I think I will get a yearly mammogram from now on, but it will be interesting to see what the specialist has to say in 2 months time. Once again, thank you for your reply. Kind Regards, Linda",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 40 years old and recently had a positive mammogram (left breast only), but a completely clear ultrasound. After seeing the specialist and being physically examined, he felt that there was nothing sinister going on, but wanted my slides reviewed by a 2nd radiographer. After a 4 week wait, he rang me to say that the 2nd radiographer concurred with his opinion and felt I was OK. However he wants to see me in 2 months time. I initially had the mammogram done due to severe pain in the left breast in the few days prior to my period (occuring for about the last 6 months). It always cleared up when my period started. However my concern lies in the fact that only the left breast was ever painful and that was the breast that showed up on the mammogram. The right breast is never painful and was clear on the mammogram. I had assymetrical breasts, but the specialist says that my left breast is smaller than the right which can explain the assymetry. Any opinions? I know this sounds like classic cyclic breast pain, but am interested in other people's experiences. I was not referred for biopsy or futher testing. Thank you in advance, Linda",
