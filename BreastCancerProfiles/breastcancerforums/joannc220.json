      "Content": "I have a problem with well wishers telling me of the experience a family member or friend had with Breast Cancer. I'm telling them that I am going thru Chemo to lessen my chances of reoccurance and they are tell me \"thats what they told my sister, but her's came back and she died the second time\". I wish only people with good news would come to my desk and sit and talk to me with encouraging news not gloom and doom. Is there someone out there that can give me good news. I had Ductal Cancer Stage IIA. Had Surgery (only off work 12 days) had mammosite Radiation 10 treatments in 5 Days. Just completed #3 or 4 treatments. Will be done the day after thanksgiving and I personally am looking forward to starting to get back: my taste, my hair, not the weight ( I lost 25 lbs) maybe I can keep it off, and my self esteem. I have worked thru the whole thing (part time sometimes) but I don't want to let this get me down. I work with about 600 people, my bosses have been great, they let me work from home when I am feeling to bad to get up and get my wig on and get dressed. Since I was dignos on July 31. I have had test after test, surgery (2 if you count the mammosite) 10 treatments of Radiation and 3 treatments of Cheom. Am I kidding myself when I think I am doing great and will survive this?",

      "Content": "Thank so much for your information. You have done a lot of research haven't you. I have done a little but your information is the most helpful so far. Thanks so much. I have my final Chemo treatment tomorrow, I am looking forward to it ending, but I am not looking forward to the side effects. Every one has been different so far. But I can look forward to it being the last one. I should be on the up swing by Christmas and the New Year. Thanks again",
