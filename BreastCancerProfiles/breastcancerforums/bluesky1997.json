    "Content": "Hi all, In doing a breast exam this morning, I found a pretty hard lump under my left breast. The strange thing about it is that it almost looks like a bug bite but I know that is not what it is. I can see the bump but I can also feel the bump under my skin. (Is this making sense at all?) I've been searching online most of the day and I cannot find anything about finding a lump under the breast. Everything I've come across talks about what to do if you find a lump under your armpit or in your breast. I am planning on calling my doctor in the morning but I would just like to know if this is anything I should be worried about, or could it just possibly be something else. Has anyone been able to see a lump that was cancerous, or are they always internal? I know no one can diagnosis my symptoms here but I need something to calm my fears a bit. Thanks so much in advance, I greatly appreciate any feedback!",
