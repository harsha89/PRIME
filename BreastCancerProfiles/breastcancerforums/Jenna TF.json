    "Content": "Hi, I'm new here. My mom has been battling S4, HER2+ for more than 4 years. Upon diagnosis she had 75% liver compromised and several spots in her bones(too numerous to mention). She had surgery a year later to remove the breast tumor. She was having CT and bone scans every 3 months, mamos every 6. Now she is down to CT/Bone every 6 and mamos every 6. Last scan in Feb, NO evidence of disease in vital organs and bones are stable, mamo last month... perfect. She was having problems keeping steady while beginning to walk. She thought it was equilibrium problem or allergies(which were problems in the past). Someone she knows told her about a relative who died of cancer and had the same symptoms. Everyone told my mom(nurses, Physician's assitant, etc) not to worry. She requested a brain MRI and she DOES have a lession on her cerebellum causing the walking problems. She had NO headaches, no other neurological problems she just knew something was wrong. ladies, if you just don't feel right get checked out. You may be affraid to find out it is something but DO something before it's too late. My mom is having 3 cyberknife treatments. They say this has been here a while, possibly when it initially spread. what ticks me off is no one thought it necessary to do a baseline brain MRI 4 years ago or even do 1 a year, knowing it went to 2 of the four organs BC spreads to. Odds were good it WOULD go to the brain. Despite the doctors explanation for why an MRI was not needed, I am still upset.",
