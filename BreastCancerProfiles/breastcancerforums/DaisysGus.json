      "Content": "I am hoping someone can help me understand. I had a fibroadenoma removed from my right breast 3 years ago. Everything was fine. I now have lumps in both breasts and I am in constant pain. Even my nipples hurt! They have done core needle biopsies and mammos every 6 months, but the part that worries me most is the fact the lumps keep growing, and they found microcalcifications. I go back in June for another round of mammos and biopsies. Should I consider having a masectomy to relieve the problems? My family has a strong history of cervical, lung, and other cancers. Any advice would be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Latest update... My young son (12) didn't give me the message back in June that the specialist called and wanted to see me. I now go on Monday. From what she would tell me on the phone, it's cancer. She advised me to bring my husband with me, so we can go over the results. That's not a good sign. I don't know if I can deal with this right now, with my mom dying of lung cancer and has limited time. I don't want her to find out about my health, but it will be really hard to hide since I am her primary caregiver. I don't even know how to tell my husband.....all he thinks is the mammos are just routine checkups. He panics at the first sign of illness!! I have decided only \"Happy Thoughts\" from here on in, I will beat this one way or another!",

The report stated 3 small clusters of microcalcifications. I know that is a preceedor for cancer, and with the family history of all cancers, I am worried. I just wish they would do an MRI and get to the bottom of this. I am just so frustrated. I have enough to deal with for my mom who is now dying from lung cancer. I don't want her to spend her last days or months worrying about me and my health. I guess I will have to wait until my next mammo in June, and hopefully I can convince them to do something else.",

      "Content": "Hello all, Just a quick update. Had another mammo on the 10th. For some reason they only did the left side. I asked why, and was told they will do the right next time. After the mammo was done, they sent me to ultrasound. Now I have to wait til next week to find out the results. Usually the doctor tells me right then that it's just fibroadenomas, but this time they told me to wait for a call from my specialist. I still don't understand why they didn't do both breasts. The right side is the side with the microcalcifications that have brought me the most concern. I'm so tired of having mammos every 3 months! My breasts are constantly sore and it hurts to wear a bra. I do not have large ones, but it feels like they are huge when they are in pain. Has anyone else only had one side done at a time? If so, what was the reason? Keeping the faith, Daisy",

      "Content": "I have been getting regular mammos for the past 3 years....and have had 3 biopsies done. My latest mammo report stated extensive increase in microcalcification. What are the chances this will turn to cancer? The doctor I was seeing has just been suspended for doing unnecessary masectomies on at least 2 patients, and I am really concerned with my health. I have a strong family history of cervical, lung and other cancers. I was never comfortable with this doctor, and she almost misread my reports from day 1. I made her call the lab for the correct information, since she thought it said cancer and fibroadenomas, but thankfully my family doctor had copies and he had already told me it wasn't cancer. I just need to know what the chances are it will turn to cancer and a possible timeline to watch. Thanks",
