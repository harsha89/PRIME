    "Content": "A little history on me: Diagnosed at 19 with ovarian cancer. Was able to \"cure\" it via surgical removal of ovary, tube and lymphnodes. Now I am 27, and have several things going on that led to genetic testing. While I was receiving catscans and such to ensure the ovarian stuff hadn't recurred - we came across a small (8mm) spot in my lung. We are on the \"wait and see\" list with that but I was referred for genetic testing due to my own history of ovarian - and the STRONG history of breast cancer, and other various cancers in the family. I tested yesterday - and now begin the 2-4 wk wait. After being told that if I have the mutation, my breast cancer risk will become 87% I feel....like I have been given a practical guarentee. Husband and I have been talking about the ideas of radical hysterectomy and mastectomy. And I guess Im just wondering with the ladies on here - if you had the genetic testing....how did you handle your results. Did you take the extra monitoring, - did you opt for surgery. How did you feel about the mutation itself and did you feel better after having mastectomy? I know you can't tell me what to do - and we are leaning more towards radical mastectomy and reconstruction (insurance is required, as I understand it, to allow for this). But, not to sound vain - Im scared of being...androgenous. I mean - the thought of having no uterus, no ovaries and no breasts!? Part of me want's to scream, \"Why don't you just sew my vagina shut while you're at it!?!\" Thanks for any insight. Im hopeful not to have the gene - but I imagine...that there is a VERY high chance I will. I wont make decision fully until we know - but Im a control freak who needs to feel like I am doing SOMETHING proactive during the wait, even if it's just information gathering.",
