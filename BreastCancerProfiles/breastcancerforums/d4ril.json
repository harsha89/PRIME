      "Content": "The best defense against breast cancer thus far is early detection: The earlier it's detected, the easier it is to treat. Help protect yourself by having a regular breast exam. These guidelines follow the recommendations of the American Cancer Society. 1. Get a mammogram done annually if you are over 40 years of age. 2. Have a clinical breast examination (CBE) done annually by a health care professional if you are over 40 years of age - preferably around the time that you receive your mammogram. 3. Have a CBE done once every three years if you are 20 to 39 years of age. 4. Conduct a breast self-exam monthly if you are over 20 years of age. 5. Cut down on cigarettes - researchers have estimated that nearly 50 percent of women are sensitive to the carcinogens in tobacco, which means an increased risk of developing breast cancer. 6. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables: They contain antioxidant vitamins and other nutrients that can help in cancer prevention. 7. Eat foods high in phytoestrogen, a chemical found in soy products, flaxseed and whole grains. 8. Reduce alcohol intake, which has been statistically linked to an increase in the risk of breast cancer. 9. Exercise regularly and maintain a normal body weight",
