    "Content": "The Breast- we are taught to cover them (although times are changing, though I am from an older generation), value them, keep them up to par. When something goes wrong, we are so ashamed. We want our breasts to look perfect and be up to par at all times. When something goes wrong it becomes almost like an embarrassment. I speak of experience. I am breaking the ice. Was scared of Paget's Disease of the breast and possible DCIS. I still wonder about low-grade DCIS and want to have a biopsy done again because to my intelligence, low-grade DCIS takes years to progress (many factors involved). I am breaking the ice. Had biopsies performed. Now fluid comes out of one breast \"outlet\". About two months ago I woke up to find a once painful \"outlet\" to have excreted a mucous-like leakage right onto the bra in a dark green color. Was told it was a sebaceous gland before this almost a year ago. Had the biopsies done. Had the abnormal mammogram, ultrasound, and then MRI with contrast. Came out clear. Less than a year later I had the above come out onto the bra, yes the good ole bra. I hate that. I'm just going to have to be that annoying and persistent patient that demands removal of specific parts of the breast. While in the shower, I have to apply pressure to have the impacted fluid drain out because it is painful until drained (or else I will wake up to a bra full of greenish-white drainage). I know how dangerous DCIS is if left untreated and how it can develop into the lobules. If anyone is embarrassed, I just thought I would break the ice and start a trend. This is a serious disease. I wish push up bras would be taken off of the shelves because they are so unhealthy to the breast, in my opinion. Anyone out there with doubts on the results of a breast exam performed, be that persistent and annoying patient because you may be the one to save your own life one day. Get multiple opinions. Go to different doctors. Insist on having further examination procedures. Many women not have the specific procedures done that they need because in my experience, the insurance coverage was the determination factor. I said I don't care about the price and want the MRI. I own my presence, not the fact of whether or not the insurance will cover it. Breast MRI cost over $2700 dollars. And I will go back to the Breast Surgeon and have some parts removed by choice because the parts just give me problems. I will have them checked, you know why? I am in charge of my life and I am that annoying and persistent patient. I believe that it is the annoyance and persistence that makes me survive. I hope I have broken some ice here. We walk around with these breasts, why not be able to feel comfortable speaking about them and taking charge of their existence. The factor of whether or not insurance covers procedures do not own the breasts of women, the women own the breasts. Men can have breasts too and even if they have no cup size, they can still consider themselves to have a breast. Breast cancer does not discriminate against gender. Peace to all.",
