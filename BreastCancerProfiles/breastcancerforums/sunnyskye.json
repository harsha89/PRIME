      "Content": "Good morning everyone. I found out on Weds nite that I have a reoccurrence of breast cancer. I'll put my statistics below. The cancer is in a lymph node in my arm pit. It is 1.8 x 1.3 x 1.8 (my node is). My original treatment did not include chemo and looking back on it I'm thinking if I had that possibly I would still be a survivor and not going thru the whole ordeal again. I see the surgeon Tues and the med onc on 5/18th. I've had 3 biopsies since my original dx on scar tissue .... they cannot seem to tell what is scar tissue and what may possibly be a reoccurrence. Everytime you have a biopsy it creates more scar tissue so it is a vicious circle. In my gut I feel that there must be cancer cells in the breast still and yesterday the testing showed that there is \"something, a small spot\" in the same breast but they are not sure if it is a reoccurrence or scar tissue (once again, 4th time). I don't think I'd get a reoccurrence in a lymph node if it was not in the breast first. So here is what I'm thinking......I've been thinking about having the breast removed and reconstructed. I just am so tired of the biopsies and worry and now the cancer is back despite all of that. I'd like any info that anyone could give me on recouperation from breast removal and rebuilding, what kind of rebuilding would be best, i'm considering diep flap and, how long would i have to be off work. Also, any info on chemo, can i work? when do you feel the worst? what should i expect in terms of tiredness? i've got lots of questions and am painfully seeking answers. the surgeon has not recommended breast removal (yet). however, i'm so darn tired of this devil named cancer and the worry it causes that i feel i'm prepared to do anything to get my sanity back again. thanks so much you guys. i don't know what i would do without having people in the same boat to talk to. your new friend, diana Dx 8/02 invasive ductal carcinoma and dcis, 9 mm her2neu 3+, hormone negative lumpectomy, resection, 42 rads age 45 at dx, 48 now",

      "Content": "hi everyone. here's my story about scar tissue. i was dx 8/02 invasive ductal carcinoam and dcis, 9mm tumor, her2neu 3+, elston grade 3, hormone negative. had lumpectomy, resection and 42 rads, NO chemo. at the 6 month checkup there was a very large lump of junk at the incision site. it showed in mammo, in sono....it was biopsied and came back as scar tissue. at 12 month checkup same deal....i had 3 biopsies on that lump of junk in a two year period when i decided enuff is enuff and asked to have it removed. it was removed 8/04. one week later my breast swelled up to the size of a canteloupe and i went to the emergency room and was admitted for 3 days to the hospital. i had a breast seroma and they withdrew 120 cc's of fluid from the breast. two weeks ago, i found a lump in my arm pit. went to doc, had a biopsy and weds nite was told i had recurrent cancer in the lymph node in my arm pit. today i went to the hospital to have scans done. i am thankful, it has not metastisized to any other organ or to the bone everything was clear. EXCEPT the breast (same one) shows a small area that they now say they don't know if it is also a reoccurrence of the cancer OR more scar tissue. i see the surgeon on tues and expect to be operated on within the week ... have chemo appointment with med onc 5/18th. i feel that ANY lump of junk in a breast cancer patient should be removed just in the event there is the slightest chance that a biopsy misses the exact location that a cancer cell may be lingering. i honestly feel that my lump of junk had such a cell although I am only going on my gut instincts. otherwise, why would i suddenly get a reoccurrence in a lymph node under my arm? by the way, they did a sentinol node biopsy and every node they took out 3 yrs ago was negative. So I am telling you guys don't take those lumps of junk lightly. And I don't mean to scare anyone but we need to be in control of our destiny and if your gut tells you something is not right or, if you do not want to walk around with it in there, have it removed, have it biopsied, don't delay and do not wait 6 months.",
