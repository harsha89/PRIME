My Oncologist suggested surgery and when I seemed reluctant he said he would try direct radiation for six weeks. I am not sure that I have made the right decision, I opted for the radiation instead of the surgery. Can anyone tell me which would be the best option. Thel",

      "Content": "Hi, I originally had breast cancer which has now spread to the liver. I had chemotherapy which shrunk the tumour slightly. It showed no growth for almost a year and it started to grow again. I have just completed a course of radiation and due to go for another CT scan in order to see the results. The oncologist actually wanted me to consider surgery because there was only on tumour, but I was reluctant and opted for the radiation. Could someone perhaps give me some advice or guidance in this regard",
