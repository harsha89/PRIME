      "Content": "I am scheduled for a needle biopsy on Monday, to examine two cysts identified in my left breast yesterday, on mammogram and ultrasound. My OB said there is no need for anesthesia and that it is uncomfortable but only lasts for a short time. I don't actually trust his pain assessment as he is not the one taking the tests. I would appreciate info from any lady who has gone through this procedure. I am definitely having the biopsy, I just want to be prepared for what is in store and need to know if I must have someone there with me or can I just go in alone? I don't have much of a support system, so I will need to make extra arrangements if I need to be accompanied. Thanks for any input you can offer!",

I haven't been there so I cannot offer any real input but I understand it is a difficult choice to make. Still, since you do not have distant mets that would make things harder, surgery and then radiation and chemo, might deal with the problem and let you have a good life for many many years. Hair will grow back, so I wouldn't focus on that so much. Having your breast removed is a totally different thing and I can realize how that feels like a mutilation and a violation of your body, but if you have to choose between a breast and life... in my eyes life is more valuable than a breast. You and only you can make this decision, no one is in a position to make this decision for you. It's your body and your life and your peace of mind, so it's up to you to decide what's best for you! No matter what your decision is, we are here for you to help you through the next steps, whatever these may be. Big big hugs, Mary",

I think you might consider getting a second opinion from a different physician, who will see your ultrasound report, feel the lump and suggest further tests if needed. Even it is benign (it sounds that's what your current doctor thinks), it is causing you pain, so there must be something they can do about it. Good luck! Mary",

My dad had chemo and radiation for his colon cancer 17 years ago and had absolutely no side effects and was cancer free for 17 years! For the lung cancer he is currently battling against, he has had various types of chemo, only one of which was bad for him and discontinued. You don't know how your body will react to treatment, it may be easier than what you are now thinking about.

      "Content": "Hey Patti, I am so happy to hear from you. I am glad you are feeling better, I guess that after the hard process of making a decision, things start to seem a bit clearer... I too think that you have made a good decision and as Jody said, if it doesn't work or if you change your mind for whatever reason, you can always quit. I wish you the best of luck; I will be here for you every step of the way! (((Hugs))) Mary",
