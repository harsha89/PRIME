My OB said there is no need for anesthesia and that it is uncomfortable but only lasts for a short time. I don't actually trust his pain assessment as he is not the one taking the tests. I would appreciate info from any lady who has gone through this procedure. I am definitely having the biopsy, I just want to be prepared for what is in store and need to know if I must have someone there with me or can I just go in alone? I don't have much of a support system, so I will need to make extra arrangements if I need to be accompanied. Thanks for any input you can offer!",

Before my biopsy I was freaking out afraid of the pain and everything, so if it's any comfort to you, the needle biopsy I had was no big deal and it only took like 10 minutes all together. I can tell you it's much harder waiting on the pathology report than the actual procedure itself. Do you know if they have scheduled you for a needle biopsy or a core biopsy? Hope everything goes well, I will be praying for a comfortable procedure and good biopsy results for you! Mary",

I hope your results come back negative, still I think that your physician is right, even if it is benign, he wants it taken out and I can't see any harm in this other than the fact that you will have to undergo yet another procedure. It is common practice though, at least in my part of the world, to take out anything that might cause trouble in the future, even if it's not cancer. Even if this proves to be cancer, let's try and focus on the bright side that you would have caught it early and your physicians will plan the best treatment path for you.

I think you might consider getting a second opinion from a different physician, who will see your ultrasound report, feel the lump and suggest further tests if needed.

For the lung cancer he is currently battling against, he has had various types of chemo, only one of which was bad for him and discontinued.

I haven't been there so I cannot offer any real input but I understand it is a difficult choice to make. Still, since you do not have distant mets that would make things harder, surgery and then radiation and chemo, might deal with the problem and let you have a good life for many many years. Hair will grow back, so I wouldn't focus on that so much. Having your breast removed is a totally different thing and I can realize how that feels like a mutilation and a violation of your body, but if you have to choose between a breast and life... in my eyes life is more valuable than a breast. You and only you can make this decision, no one is in a position to make this decision for you. It's your body and your life and your peace of mind, so it's up to you to decide what's best for you!
