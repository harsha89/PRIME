    "Content": "My friend has been fighting breast cancer for quite some time now; combination therapy did not work for her and her cancer is now reaching an advanced state. Doctors have suggested she try the drug Abraxane, but she is hesitant to start another type of treatment because she doesn't want to deal with adverse side effects at this point. If anyone on this forum has taken Abraxane, what has your experience been like? Thanks.",
