      "Content": "I just wanted to say thanx to all, your comments and experiences mentioned were really helpful, as it always feels good to receive good wishes and kindness from others. I talked to my doc, however i see he's not going to help. He did say it was a \"Tumor\", and again that it was nothing to worry about. However, I agree with what you guys say that without a biopsy there is nothing for sure, so im going to see a private doc about this; I'll let you know, the results And thanx again!! Jarawi",

      "Content": "Since august i've suffering from telogen effluvium (hair loss) because of this i've had several blood tests and a mammogram and sonogram of the breast and pelvis. according to the results i have a benign tumor in my left breast. I've haven't had any further testing and i don't know whether to trust my doctor when he tells me not to worry about it. Im psyched already from my sudden hair loss, thanks to God, its gradually stopping, but this experience has me realize how fragil we are. I have a friend who was told by a dermatologist that the white patches on her skin were allergies, but now a year later, she has been diagnosed with skin cancer in the first stage. Im 22 years old , no history of cancer in my family, i eat healthy, exercise regularly. Can anybody tell me according to their experience , what can i do? Also, is there any difference bt a tumor and a lump? Thanx to all ;-* Jarawi (Karina)",
