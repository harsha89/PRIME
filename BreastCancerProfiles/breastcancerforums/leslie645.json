    "Content": "Hi My mom was diagnosed with BC 2 years agp and they put her on effexor for hot flashes. But she still gets hot flashes and she also has been having extreme depressions days. She wants to go off the effexor cuz she thinks its making her \"crazy\". happy one day extremely sad or sensitive the next. Is this a normal reaction too menopause/effexor? I would be interest to see if this affects other women this way as well.",
