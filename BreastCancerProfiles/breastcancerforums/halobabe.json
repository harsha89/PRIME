      "Content": "hi all, my friend is going through chemotherapy at the moment (she has just had her 2nd one yesterday) she seemed not so bad after the first one but she had a very very sore mouth. i have read somewhere on here (i think) that if the doctors know you have this problem there is an anti tablet you can take before (like the anti sickness one). please does anyone know of this. also could you tell me if each time you have chemo it gets worse or are the symtoms pretty much the same after each session. i appreciate all you time and thoughts. thankyou x",
