      "Content": "I had gastro bi-pass surgury in Feb. and now in Aug. atypical cancer in right breast. 5 wks. till surgery, that seems so long. Stage 1 and they couldnt feel it went to lymth. If they can;t feel it is it usually not in lymth nodes? Didnt see anything on ultra sound too. Will need they tell me chemo and radiation. Wondering if anyone else has had this surgury and how they did on chemo. Very hard to find anyone who has had both.",
