    "Content": "Hi all! I don't actually have breast cancer, but I did have a mole removed from my right lateral breast that came back with melanoma and thus I had 3 axillary lymph nodes removed for testing (path came back negative for mets thankfully). I thought I would post this question here since there are many many more people here who have had axillary lymph nodes removed than in the melanoma forum. I am currently 2 weeks post op. I have a seroma under my lymph node incision (right armpit). It is about half the size of an egg and feels about as hard as one. It was VERY tender so I went to my oncology surgeon to have it looked at/drained. After the drainage, some pressure was relieved and while the seroma has returned to its original half-egg size, it is no longer tender. They said I didn't need to come back and have it drained unless it gets too painful again or shows signs of infection. They said eventually it will absorb/go away. SO now I have a new problem- I keep having these burning sensations in my forearm-on the flat side- but I only feel it when I try to straighten my arm all the way-it even goes a little above my elbow on the inside of my arm. When I relax my arm by slightly bending it or bending it all the way- the pain goes away. I've never had experience with this before, but it feels to me like it is a nerve pain. I emailed my dr about it and she said it is just post op stuff and if it hasn't improved in a week to let them know. everything I try to google about it just talks about numbness,tingling, or loss of sensation in the area- I don't have any of that...just the sharp burn when I try to straighten my arm all the way. Have any of you experienced this? Do you think my seroma is pressing on a nerve? Could it be crazy soreness from just using my arm less? a muscle spasm? any ideas?!!",
