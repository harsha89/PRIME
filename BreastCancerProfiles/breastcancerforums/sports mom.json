    "Content": "Hello Roberta I am 41 and pre menopausal!! I was diagnosed on March 3, 2005. I felt a lump, had a US and Mammogram that came back clear. My surgeon had me get a Fine Needle Aspiration that showed spme abnormal cells but probably Fibroadenoma. I had a Lumpectomy done and was diagnosed with Cancer. My Sentinal node was positve but all other nodes OK. I had to do 4 treatments of Adriamycin and Cytoxin (just finished). In 2 weeks I will start Taxotere, weekly for 12 weeks and then radiation for 6 weeks. I have done OK with the Chemo. I did get a sick after the first 2 treatments. I felt was very fatigued and nauseated and missed afew days of work. I got a different anti nasuea medication for the last 2 treatments and did not miss any work for after that. I have been married for almost 21 years. My children are 17 and 19. My family has been great. I there are any questions I can help you with please let me know.
