      "Content": "I know how scared and worried you are. I had an elective double mastectomy in July 2009. Then an additional 6 surgeries due to every complication imaginable. My last surgery in April 2011. I feel wonderful and the girls are far from perfect but I earned them. The most important thing is I'm here and healthy. If you need to chat please do. I pop into this site occassionally. You can find me now in the pancretic site. It's ironic. We did everything we could so I wouldn't develop cancer and the entire time hubby had it. Now that sucks.",

      "Content": "I haven't been here in a very long time. I wanted you to know that I am healthy. I had 7 different surgeries and numerous hospital stays. But there is light at the end of the long tunnel. My husband has been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer about 2 weeks ago. So I'm hanging out on their page. But I am always here for you my sisters. If I can help anyone in anyway. Look for me there.",
