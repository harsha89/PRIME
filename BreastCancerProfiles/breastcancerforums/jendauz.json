    "Content": "I have a lump that is probably close to 3 cm across at 9o'clock on my right breast. I have had a mamogram that was negative and a negative ultrasound. My primary care physician called this fibrosystic tissue (having only palpated the lump) and the radiologist called it \"a ridge of dense breast tissue--nothing of concern\". I have had a persistant discharge (greenish brown) for over four months as well (expressed, not spontanious). I am 34 years old and have a lot of extended family breast cancer, but none in my immediate family. I am not totally convinced by the explanations I received. Should I insisted on a biopsy? Do I get a second opinion?",
