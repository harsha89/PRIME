      "Content": "Hi there, my mum has been diagnosed with secondary cancer - she had breast cancer eight years ago and then was on tamoxifan for five years. It is two years since she has come off and has been monitored regularly. Last year her tumor markers went up but she was told there was no cancer. Then in May the markers went up again and they were suspicious about something on her liver. Anyway eventually today she has been put on hormone treatment. the lesion in her liver is 1.6cm and it is also in some bones. The doctor still remained optimistic that the hormone treatment should contain it. Has anyone else experience of this and is he been ruthful by being optimistic. Please don't send any sympathetic replies if you don' t have any information. Sorry for being rude but I assume you are all feeling for me, my mum and the situation but I just feel like answers at the moment. Thanks",
