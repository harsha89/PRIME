      "Content": "Hi Mary: Just saw your message and the replies--I finished 4 ac/4 taxol--dose dense end of October--no radiation; left side mastecomy. Two nights ago I woke up with extreme bone pain, almost burning, mostly in my arms and legs. Today, my forearms are slightly sore. Also, when I woke up I was freezing--couldn't get warm for several hours. I am on tamoxifin--don't see anything about this being a less common side effect. Does anyone have any sites they can refer me to? I'll be calling my oncologist after this weekend holiday--but am suspecting it's nothing (I pray) I read something about the burning can be the hormone deprived cells in the bones being destroyed, but am hoping/thinking/praying that after all my chemo and on tamoxifin--I shouldn't have any more cancer cells left in my body. Does anyone else have any similiar circumstances. Thanks.

I was pre-menopausal before chemo--now in chemically induced menopause; my hot flashes were really minimal, and I have been doing great on the tamoxifin until the other night. I also exercise several times a week. I've changed jobs, and probably under a lot more stress right now. Have you seen anything about stress making these symptoms worse?
