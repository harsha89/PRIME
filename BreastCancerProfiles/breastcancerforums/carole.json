      "Content": "Mary; hi thanks for the reply--I HAVE NOT found anything anywhere that says taking tamoxifin causes bone pain--where did you see this? I was pre-menopausal before chemo--now in chemically induced menopause; my hot flashes were really minimal, and I have been doing great on the tamoxifin until the other night. I also exercise several times a week. I've changed jobs, and probably under a lot more stress right now. Have you seen anything about stress making these symptoms worse? I'd love to hear from you at my email address if you'd care to correspond outside of this forum as well. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Hi Mary: Just saw your message and the replies--I finished 4 ac/4 taxol--dose dense end of October--no radiation; left side mastecomy. Two nights ago I woke up with extreme bone pain, almost burning, mostly in my arms and legs. Today, my forearms are slightly sore. Also, when I woke up I was freezing--couldn't get warm for several hours. I am on tamoxifin--don't see anything about this being a less common side effect. Does anyone have any sites they can refer me to? I'll be calling my oncologist after this weekend holiday--but am suspecting it's nothing (I pray) I read something about the burning can be the hormone deprived cells in the bones being destroyed, but am hoping/thinking/praying that after all my chemo and on tamoxifin--I shouldn't have any more cancer cells left in my body. Does anyone else have any similiar circumstances. Thanks. Carole, age 45 at diagnosis - Apr 04 Invasive ductal carcinoma Stage II a 1.6cm tumor; mastecomy May 04 T1N2M0//er+ pr+ Her2- 4AC + 4Taxol dose dense (completed Oct04) 33 Rads plus boost (to be completed Sept 05)",
