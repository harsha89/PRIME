    "Content": "Hello AHope; The only other item I might add for you is to find a local breast cancer support group, or to utilize any support services from the Cancer society where you are. To feel down at times is perfectly normal, and you should acknowledge those feelings, don't feel guilty for feeling blue. We all get a little depressed or down feeling throughout this whole journey, heck, I still get those moments every now and then. Throughout my treatment, and waiting between treatments if I felt myself getting blue, I would try to remember that I was fortunate to at least not be living in a 3rd world country where there wouldn't be any chance of medical treatment. I was grateful that I found my lump, and that treatment and survival rates have come so far. It's a hard path to be walking right now, but you will fins many \"sisters\" that will hold your hand along the way. Hugsss Barb www.breastsisters.com",
