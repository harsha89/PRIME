    "Content": "Hi Ladies, my name is Sheila Matechuk, and I own a company called Goddess Hair Extensions in San Francisco. I don't want to come across as an ad, but I can't think of a better way to let you know about something I have come up with for my many breast cancer clients. I do hair extensions for a living, and unfortunately, I haven't been able to help my clients whose hair hasn't grown back enough to look good in hair extensions, but hate the wig and want out of it ASAP, so a client of mine who is a survivor and I came up with an integration method that involves beautiful hair that looks like your own, no glue, shaving or damage, and stays put through showering, sleeping-everything until your hair grows back. This has to be professionally applied, and we are in California, but if someone really wants this, I am happy to talk to you! you can read more about it here, or email or call me... www.goddessextensions.com/replace.html or [emailÂ protected] or 650-361-8225",
