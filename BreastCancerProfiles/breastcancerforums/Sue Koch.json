      "Content": "Breast Reconstruction Out of Network Provider What is this ? Cancer Forums Forum Index -> Financial issues Advertise on this site Your Ad Here Author Sue Koch New User Joined: 13 Mar 2005 Posts: 4 Posted: Mon Dec 11, 2006 7:12 pm Post subject: Breast Reconstruction Out of Network Provider -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Hello All, Last April, I attempted to obtain permission to have a surgeon that performs Bilateral Breast Reconstruction using the S-Gap procedure. (taking tissue from the buttocks when there is not enough abdominal tissue) perform the Bilateral on me. There are only a few surgeons in the U.S. that perform the S-Gap procedure(one side done at a time requiring two operations) and even less that do the bilateral S-Gap where both are reconstructed at the same time. The procedure is not considered experimental and my Insurance will approve having an in-network surgeon do the Unilateral S-Gap procedure which means two major surgeries, two anesthesia's, two hospital stays, two recuperations, etc. I cannot believe that an Insurance co. would not see the benefit of doing the Bilateral S-Gap. It is more cost efficient by the way. The surgeon I would like to do the surgery pioneered the Procedure 10 years ago and has performed hundreds. The surgeon I went to \"[in-network) at Johns Hopkins had only performed ten unilateral S-Gaps in the last seven years. My Insurance would approve this. I appealed , even appearing in person and was still turned down as they said there were others in network I could see. No, they do not perform the Bilateral. How can they justify me being a \"guinea pig\" by having the surgery performed by a Dr. who has only performed a few and also requires two surgeries, etc.? Has anyone encountered the same problem and successfully had the Insurance Co. cover the surgery? Also, this Dr. will work with the Insurance Co. as far as providing a compromise. He refuses to become an \"in-network\" provider because of Insurance Co.s preventing women from being able to have this procedure done. I do not want to have to visit the few Dr's on the list, up and down the East Coast. I live in VA. I teach school and don't have the time to drive all over creation, meeting with their doctors. By the way, the Dr. at Johns Hopkins had a lousy bed-side manner. Did not want me asking questions, just leave everything to him. I took copious notes and presented the info. The review Booard understood why I did not want to have him do the procedure. However, because I haven't checked with other Dr's., no deal. Does anyone have any advice? I would be most appreciative of any help or suggestions. Thanks so much. Sue in VA",

      "Content": "I am 49 yrs. old, was diagnosed 3/2001 with DCIS, rt breast, ER positive, stage 0. Had a lumpectomyand radiation treatment and was put on tamoxifen. Only took tamoxifen for 5 months as I had terrible hot flashes. I was then diagnosed with LCIS, left breast, 4/04, stage 0. As I had many calcifications, I decided to go with a bilateral mastectomy so that all could be removed. My question is what follow-up care should I have. My surgeon said I didn't need to return for 1 year and did not recommend a CAT scan or anything else to look at the chest wall. I am very uncomfortable with this and am wondering what standard practice is in my case. Thanks for any help you can give. Sue in VA",

      "Content": "Hi Lenora, As my calcs were scattered within the breast, there was no way to biopsy every one of them. My surgeon said they looked like the biopsied group that were malignant. (I had a core-needle biopsy-LCIS.) My surgeon said she could watch me closely and I could wait or go the mastectomy route. After thinking through the situation, I was uncomfortable with the \"watch and wait\" approach. I was and am unwilling to take any chances so there I went. I really felt I had no choice. It was a very difficult decision and I cried off and on for awhile but I am glad I had the mastectomy. I needed to know I had done everything possible to keep the cancer from returning. I also looked at reconstruction and consulted with a plastic surgeon. I did choose not to go that route though and I am glad about that, too. If you need anything, please holler. My surgery was this past July and I did great and am doing wonderfully. Bounced back very quick. Let me know if I can help. In the end, you have to do what is best for you. Big Hugs, Sue in Va",

      "Content": "Hello All, Thanks to everyone for their input. I so appreciate the posts as I now feel I have some direction. Actually, since my surgery was not done in our local hospital, I decided to have my surgeon follow me. (UVA) She wrote the tamoxifen prescriptions and had me do digital mammograms every 6 mos. I would then see her the same day for a report on my mammo. followed with a manual exam of my breasts. After my initial DCIS diagnosis, I did see the local oncologist for recommendations regarding treatments. I also had radiation done locally as well. Having said that, I will now make an app't with the local oncologist and have him follow me. I would like to have bloodwork done yearly and further investigate having a CT scan, MRI, or whatever yearly as well, possibly for five or more years. Interestingly enough, because I have a family history of heart disease, my family Dr. sent me for a CT scan of my heart and also included having the axillary nodes looked at as well as chest wall since I voiced the above concerns to him. He said we would just take a look at both heart/arteries and chest wall. Will let you know what happens with that and what can be seen as this might be something some of you might want to persue. Thanks again for relieving some of my stress. Will post again soon and, of course, will continue to read the posts! May good health follow all of you. What a great site. Take Care. Sue in VA",
