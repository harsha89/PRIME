      "Content": "Hi Tammy, While you are waiting for the doctor to respond, I will share my experience with you. My mom had postmenopausal breast cancer and she did take HRT for thirty years, due to an early-age hysterectomy for cervical cancer. I know (for sure) that two of my aunts also had postmenopausal breast cancer. I talked to my medical oncologist about this and he said there was not need to do a genetic test because these women were postmenopausal. HOWWEVER.......I talked to Sue at the www.facingourrisk.org site and she said that this is not necesssarily true. Although it does pose a lower risk, there still is a risk. She said the best person to advise you as to whether a genetic test should be done would be a genetic counselor. She said they will give you the facts and not \"push\" for you to have the test done. It's a good site you and/or your daughter might want to visit. Also, I think it's sad a doctor would say that to your daughter. Honestly, some of the doctors out there scare me. Good luck and good thoughts to you and your daughter. Margie",

      "Content": "Hi, So nice that your mom has a doctor she really likes and trusts. He sounds great! I did the adriamycin/cytoxin every 3 weeks. They didn't offer does dense at my hospital when I had it. It wasn't bad at all. I took the anti-nausea drugs kytril and compazine. They have newer ones (emend and aloxi) that work even better, I hear. Make sure she drinks LOTS of water (at least 2 quarts a day is recommended) the day before she starts chemo, during chemo and the first few days after. The chemo goes in and does its thing and then you want to flush it out asap. She should have a chemo nurse explain all this to her, too. Water, water and more water is so important. They also told me to gets lots of extra protein. They recommended those Boosts or Carnation Instant Breakfasts -- something similar to that. I had at least one daily. Your mom has an 80 percent chance of it NOT coming back after treatment. Those numbers are pretty good! Prayers and hugs to you both, Margie",

I'll share with you what mine said: \"Only minimal postsurgical changes at the lumpectomy site of the right breast are noted, but no specific or significant changes on either side from preoperative exam of 7/02/2003 are evident that are disgnostic for interval malignancy. Incidental note is made of some increased density in the right breast secondary to the radiation changes. (Benign - 2) \" I spoke with my rad onc at my follow-up in January and voiced my concern about the ridge/lumpy thingie in the area. He said it felt like scar tissue and changes from radiation, that this is expected. BUT...if you are concerned you should definitely press for more testing. I couldn't get a referral for more testing but was told to just watch for changes for the next 6 months. So far, it doesn't feel like there are any changes. Yearly mammo is in 9 weeks, so we'll see. Good luck, Marion. I really hope this resolves to your satisfaction. Hugs, Margie",

Most lumps (80 percent) are benign but there is no way of knowing what it is unless you get a mammogram and an ultrasound and a clinical breast exam. Plus, you have your age working in your favor. BUT young women can and do get breast cancer. Not saying that is what you have (could be a cyst or a fibroadenoma) but you need to find out. You also need peace of mind. Most women who get breast cancer do not have a history of it in their family. Any lump, thickening or other change in the breast HAS to be checked out. Hugs to you.

      "Content": "Hi Karen, Hoping you're feeling a little better by talking to others. Here is a great site for women who are concerned there MAY be a genetic link for BC in their family. It's also for women who think there MAY be a genetic predisposition. www.facingourrisk.org The woman who started it was dx at age 31 and frequently posts at www.breastcancer.org under the \"high risk\" thread. Here is some info. about it: Here is a little about the site: FORCE is a nonprofit organization for women who are at high risk of getting these cancers due to their family history and genetic status, and for members of families in which a BRCA mutation may be present. Our web site can be a helpful resource for anyone who knows she is at risk, who wonders whether she might be at risk, or who cares about the issues and concerns that we face. Good luck and let us know how it goes! Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi, Well, I just have to jump in here and say that if a woman is on some kind of hormonal manipulation that a doctor should never say \"there is nothing to worry about.\" JMHO My mom took HRT for many years and got breast cancer. I never took HRT but got it anyway. I was never overweight, (always a little under) had a healthy diet and did not drink alcoholic beverages. BUT...I DID take birth control pills. Of course, when I started taking them, I was told they were very safe and there was nothing to worry about. I hear from other women that lots of younger girls are being prescribed birth control pills to help with their cycles, etc. It just makes me shudder. I'm not saying that if you take birth control pills or fertility drugs that you will get breast cancer because not everyone does. I just think that women have to be more cautious and seriously consider these risks. Also, another thing that \"irked\" me. When I was first dx, I kept getting \"grilled\" about past hormonal manipulations. \"Did you ever take birth control pills? HRT? Anything else?\" All of a sudden it WAS a big deal. I'm just saying it's wise to be very careful in this area. It all depends on if the benefits outweigh the risks. I just think women should be carefully informed of all the risks. What is not seen as a risk today can be a risk tomorrow. Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi Sue, Welcome to our boards! It's very normal to be haunted by the \"black cloud\" hanging overheard. However, we have to find a way of dealing with that nasty cloud and not letting it overtake/interfere with our lives -- can't let the cancer win. Yes, I am \"pollyanna\" and some folks don't like this. However, what is the alternative -- negative and miserable? I find the best way to handle the fears is to come to support boards because people at the boards understand how you feel. Others who have not gone through it (esp. those close to us) sometimes feel that it's over when the treatments are over. I tell myself that I feel good so the cancer IS probably gone. Also, we have to remind ourselves that most women who are diagnosed and treated will never have a recurrence. I like to think I am one of those women. Here is a good support group for younger women: www.youngsurvival.org Many women belong to more than one support group -- you get different things from different groups. Does that make sense? LOL Anyhow, we hope you will continue to post here, but please visit that site, too. Younger women have very different concerns and issues when confronted with BC. Take care, good luck and sending hugs, Margie",

I'm not sure but I think I've heard ladies say that it is a slower process (to lose your hair) on dose dense. As Nancy said, I'm sure it's working, especially if you are having nausea and fatigue. I had lots of nausea on A/C. More than one night I had \"the bucket\" next to the bed at night. I thought I might not make it to the bathroom, but lucky me...I did make it to the bathroom. Tell your doctor and maybe he'll suggest a different anti-nausea drug. Good luck. We are all here pulling for you if you need us. Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, Now that your surgery is over you can continue to KICK CANCER BUTT. You've already did a very large part by having the surgery. And remember that positive nodes do not guarantee that you will have a recurrence down the road. Many women with positive nodes go on to do very well. Here is a helpful chemo site: www.chemocare.com You'll find a lot of good tips, including eating healthy during chemo. This is what worked for me: Drink lots of water the day before, during and after. During treatments I always drank from my water bottle. I kept refilling it during the chemo treatment. The chemo enters your body and does its job of killing cancer cells and then you want to get it out of your body asap. That's what my chemo nurse told me. The best way to do this is to drink lots of water! Also, if you received A/C you want to eliminate it from your body quickly. My chemo nurse told me to get up in the middle of the night the first night to make sure I emptied my bladder. A/C can be nasty sitting in your bladder. In fact, it's a good idea to drink lots of water during the entire chemo experience. I had one of those nutritional drinks (Boost) every day to get extra protein.

      "Content": "Hi Shelly, Now that your surgery is over you can continue to KICK CANCER BUTT. You've already did a very large part by having the surgery. And remember that positive nodes do not guarantee that you will have a recurrence down the road. Many women with positive nodes go on to do very well. Here is a helpful chemo site: www.chemocare.com You'll find a lot of good tips, including eating healthy during chemo. This is what worked for me: Drink lots of water the day before, during and after. During treatments I always drank from my water bottle. I kept refilling it during the chemo treatment. The chemo enters your body and does its job of killing cancer cells and then you want to get it out of your body asap. That's what my chemo nurse told me. The best way to do this is to drink lots of water! Also, if you received A/C you want to eliminate it from your body quickly. My chemo nurse told me to get up in the middle of the night the first night to make sure I emptied my bladder. A/C can be nasty sitting in your bladder. In fact, it's a good idea to drink lots of water during the entire chemo experience. I had one of those nutritional drinks (Boost) every day to get extra protein. This was also suggested by my chemo nurse. Eat whatever appeals to you. For me, it was rotisserie chicken and Nesquick cocoa. LOL My sweet DH was always running out to pick up the rotisserie chickens! Smaller meals work best for most folks. There were some foods I developed an aversion to and I just avoided them.

He said there were various changes in the breast from the surgery, radiation and chemo. Personally, I don't understand how chemo could change it. Anyway, he claimed he could \"tell\" it was just scar tissue. I expressed my concern telling him that when various doctors felt the original lump they assured me it felt like fibrous tissue and were, obviously, wrong. The radiation oncologist said I should watch for changes and if there are any changes to call him. I'm just sharing this so you won't drive yourself nuts with worry. I understand how scary it can be. BUT....you should definitely have it checked out asap. You can't be too cautious as far as I'm concerned. And if you feel you want a biopsy, push for one. It's your body. Take care and hugs, Margie",

I also felt I could live with a good comfort level regarding that because I did not have a huge tumor. Also, I was told that the long-term survival rate for lump vs. mast were the same. I was told there was a slightly higher chance of local recurrence (in the breast) with the lumpectomy. They advised I have chemo (4 A/C) because the tumor was larger than 1 centimeter and they felt it had been there for \"a while.\" I had never had a mammogram to use as a baseline. I'm glad I had the chemo because when I think of that tumor sitting there for years....... Well, we all have to do what we feel comfortable with -- what we can live with. Hopefully, none of us will ever have to walk this path again. Hugs, Margie",

After the first time, I had them run it a little slower because I got a killer headache for 24 hours from it. Everything else building up to it took a long time. First, they took the blood to see if the counts were acceptable. Then, wait for that result. Then, onc. looks at the result. Then, see onc. for 5-minute check. Then I had a bunch of pills I had to take before the infusion. Then I had to wait 30 minutes after taking them. Very often, they were way behind and did not take me on time to start out. So.....my point is that everything else actually took a lot longer than the infusion. You're gonna do fine! Good luck and hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi Jane, Here is some information on the birads: The American College of Radiology (ACR) has established the Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS?) to guide the breast cancer diagnostic routine. Radiologists sometimes refer to each BI-RADS? category as a \"level.\" BI-RADS? Assessment Categories Category 0 Need Additional Imaging Evaluation Category 1 Negative Category 2 Benign Finding Category 3 Probably Benign Finding ? Short Interval Follow-Up Suggested Category 4 Suspicious Abnormality ? Biopsy Should Be Considered Category 5 Highly Suggestive of Malignancy ? Appropriate Action Should Be Taken Category 0 is a temporary category that means additional imaging is needed before assigning a permanent BI-RADS? assessment category. Most category 0 findings are shown to be benign after the additional imaging is completed. The BI-RADS? categories or levels are used to standardize interpretation of mammograms among radiologists. They are useful for statistical analysis of mammography practice and BI-RADS? results are compiled on a nationwide basis in the U.S. to help refine mammography procedures everywhere. Hope this helps, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi, This is my guess based on what I've read. The larger the lump, the worse the prognosis is. VERY large lumps reduce the survival stats. I believe I once read that a 1 centimeter lump has about a billion cells. I would think that the more cells there are in a lump that the chances increase that some cells could break loose from the lump and travel elsewhere in the body. Also, a slow-growing tumor may have been there for a long time. I think it is also based on studies that have been carried out. It used to be that chemo was recommended for the larger tumors and not the smaller ones, but the standard has changed because they've learned from these studies that there can be metasases with small tumors, too. I read that they prefer to \"over treat\" people rather than \"under treat\" because they aren't completely sure who needs chemo and are afraid they might miss some people who might be helped by it. As a result, lots more people are getting chemo. Personally, I feel good about using all available \"tools\" out there as an insurance policy against the cancer recurring. I'm sure Dr. Leo will elaborate. Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Here is some info: What is estradiol? ? Estradiol (a form of estrogen) is a female sex hormone necessary for many processes in the body. Estradiol vaginal products release estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin of the vaginal wall. ? Estradiol topical is used to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as dryness, burning, and itching of the vaginal area and urgency or irritation with urination. ? Estradiol may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. Who should not use estradiol? ? Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you have · a circulation, bleeding, or blood-clotting disorder; · undiagnosed, abnormal vaginal bleeding; or · any type of breast, uterine, or hormone-dependent cancer. ? Using estradiol may be dangerous in some cases if you have any of the conditions listed above. ? Before using estradiol, tell your doctor if you have · high blood pressure, angina, or heart disease; · high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood; · liver disease; · kidney disease; · asthma; · epilepsy; · migraines; · diabetes; · depression; · gallbladder disease; · uterine fibroids; · had a hysterectomy (uterus removed); · a narrow, short, or prolapsed vagina; · vaginal irritation; or · a vaginal infection. ? You may not be able to use estradiol, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you have any of the conditions listed above. ? Treatment with estradiol long-term may increase the risk of stroke. Because of this risk, you should contact your doctor or healthcare provider to discuss your individual risks and benefits before taking estradiol long-term. You should also talk to your doctor or healthcare provider on a regular basis (for example, every 3-6 months) about whether you should continue this treatment. ? Estradiol is in the FDA pregnancy category X. This means that estradiol will cause birth defects in an unborn baby. Do not use estradiol if you are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy. ?

      "Content": "Hi, I also have a slow-growing tumor and I have wondered about this. I had my first mammogram after I discovered my lump, so they have no baseline to compare. As a result, I don't know how long the lump was there. But they did advise chemo because of the size of the tumor and probably because it might have been sitting around for a long time. I would guess that in that regard it would be a \"detriment.\" I am also guessing that if I ever had a recurrence it might be easier to treat it and keep two steps ahead of the tumor growth. I would think a very fast-growing tumor would be harder to treat. Of course, this is just my guess. It does irk me, though, when people keep saying aggressive vs. non-agressive tumor. To me, they are ALL aggressive if they are cancer because it's the same result if it travels to the lungs, liver or brain. It just might take longer? I wish you and your wife the best. Margie Any thoughts on this, Dr. Leo?",

      "Content": "Here is some info: What is estradiol? ? Estradiol (a form of estrogen) is a female sex hormone necessary for many processes in the body. Estradiol vaginal products release estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin of the vaginal wall. ? Estradiol topical is used to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as dryness, burning, and itching of the vaginal area and urgency or irritation with urination. ? Estradiol may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. Who should not use estradiol? ? Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you have · a circulation, bleeding, or blood-clotting disorder; · undiagnosed, abnormal vaginal bleeding; or · any type of breast, uterine, or hormone-dependent cancer. ? Using estradiol may be dangerous in some cases if you have any of the conditions listed above. ? Before using estradiol, tell your doctor if you have · high blood pressure, angina, or heart disease; · high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood; · liver disease; · kidney disease; · asthma; · epilepsy; · migraines; · diabetes; · depression; · gallbladder disease; · uterine fibroids; · had a hysterectomy (uterus removed); · a narrow, short, or prolapsed vagina; · vaginal irritation; or · a vaginal infection. ? You may not be able to use estradiol, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you have any of the conditions listed above. ? Treatment with estradiol long-term may increase the risk of stroke. Because of this risk, you should contact your doctor or healthcare provider to discuss your individual risks and benefits before taking estradiol long-term. You should also talk to your doctor or healthcare provider on a regular basis (for example, every 3-6 months) about whether you should continue this treatment. ? Estradiol is in the FDA pregnancy category X. This means that estradiol will cause birth defects in an unborn baby. Do not use estradiol if you are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy. ? Estradiol may decrease milk flow and have other effects on milk composition. Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.",

      "Content": "Here is some more info: ESTRING® Pharmacia & Upjohn Estradiol Estrogen Action And Clinical Pharmacology: Estring is a slightly opaque ring with a whitish core containing a drug reservoir of 2 mg estradiol. Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to form the ring. When placed in the vagina, Estring releases estradiol, approximately 7.5 µg/24 hours, in a consistent stable manner over 90 days. Estring has the following dimensions: outer diameter 55 mm; cross-sectional diameter 9 mm; core diameter 2 mm. One Estring should be inserted into the upper third of the vaginal vault, to be worn continuously for 3 months. At menopause the ovaries cease to secrete estradiol (E2), leading to symptoms of estrogen deficiency such as sweating, hot flushes and sleep disturbance. A couple of years after the actual menopause, increasing numbers of women also report symptoms of urogenital estrogen deficiency such as vaginal dryness, genital pruritus, dyspareunia, dysuria and urinary urgency. These latter symptoms respond well to vaginal estrogen replacement therapy. ~ I have heard ladies on some of the boards being prescibed this by their doctors. Their doctors said that very little is absorbed. However, some of the doctors said they advised against it.",

A GOOD doctor will WELCOME a second opinion. I think it's wise if you stick with the cancer center. I hear they have excellent reputations. Regarding the FNA - I had that done after I found the lump in my breast. It came back negative but the surgeon said we still had to take the lump out, \"just to be sure.\" It's a good thing. I had the excisional biopsy done and they found it to be cancer. My surgeon said that the FNA can have a high false negative rate. Sometimes the needle only gets a tiny specimen and the test is not accurate. Good luck and prayers to you. I feel for you and hope that all turns out well.

      "Content": "Hi, This is my guess based on what I've read. The larger the lump, the worse the prognosis is. VERY large lumps reduce the survival stats. I believe I once read that a 1 centimeter lump has about a billion cells. I would think that the more cells there are in a lump that the chances increase that some cells could break loose from the lump and travel elsewhere in the body. Also, a slow-growing tumor may have been there for a long time. I think it is also based on studies that have been carried out. It used to be that chemo was recommended for the larger tumors and not the smaller ones, but the standard has changed because they've learned from these studies that there can be metasases with small tumors, too. I read that they prefer to \"over treat\" people rather than \"under treat\" because they aren't completely sure who needs chemo and are afraid they might miss some people who might be helped by it. As a result, lots more people are getting chemo. Personally, I feel good about using all available \"tools\" out there as an insurance policy against the cancer recurring. I'm sure Dr. Leo will elaborate. Hugs, Margie",

That MAY be true....I don't know. However, some people just want to know as early as possible because maybe they want to make some changes in their life. I think it has a lot to do with money. I also think it's sad that some women with mets have had to \"fudge\" symptoms in order to get a scan to find out if they have brain mets.

I have heard some other ladies (that received 4 cycles) say that it took months after they competed their treatments for the neuropathy to stop. Another one of those BC things where patience must prevail. Also, when I was considering a clinical trial with a Taxol arm, I read that chances of permanent neuropathy were very low. So sorry you have to endure this, though. Two more treatments and you are done with this chemo stuff, FOREVER! Sending healing hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Danielle ~ If I remember correctly, your mom's tumor was 6mm? That's why I was surprised to learn her doc is recommending chemo. BUT....as I previously said, whether or not chemo is recommended is contingent on many factors -- lymph node or vasular invasion, size of tumor, hormone receptor status, her2neu status, grade of the tumor, type of breast cancer and the general health of the person. Also, other factors such as age and menopausal status are considered. The doctor looks at the pathology report and bases much of his decision on that. You really need to ask her doctor all these questions. I have seen MANY ladies have a mastectomy and still do chemo. So, yes, it happens quite a bit. Good luck and hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi Maria, I'm so sorry your sister has been dx with breast cancer, but it sounds like it is early stage. You didn't say whether it's invasive nor non-invasive. Of course, it's preferable to have non-invasive but early-stage invasive has an excellent prognosis. What can you do to help her? Well, you're already helping her quite a bit just by going to be with her. You can accompany her on any appointments she may have before and after her surgery. Just being there for her (emotionally and/or physically) is a wonderful, caring thing and she's lucky to have a thoughtful sister. One of the best things you can do for her is to let her talk about her feelings as much as she needs to and be a good listener. Sometimes during treatment we repeat things (over and over) because we just have to verbally \"get it all out\" because it is such a powerful experience. I compare the powerful emotional impact to giving birth. After giving birth, you want to talk about the experience with others. The only difference is that giving birth is a happy experience whereas being diagnosed with breast cancer is, obviously, a sad and negative experience. Another thing you can do (if she uses a computer) is give her the website link and she could log on when she feels up to it. It's really valuable to be able to share her feelings with others and receive support from women who have been there/done that. Plus, if she has any questions she can receive excellent information from others. Please keep us posted. You and your sister are in my thoughts and prayers. Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Here is some info: What is estradiol? ? Estradiol (a form of estrogen) is a female sex hormone necessary for many processes in the body. Estradiol vaginal products release estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin of the vaginal wall. ? Estradiol topical is used to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as dryness, burning, and itching of the vaginal area and urgency or irritation with urination. ? Estradiol may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. Who should not use estradiol? ? Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you have · a circulation, bleeding, or blood-clotting disorder; · undiagnosed, abnormal vaginal bleeding; or · any type of breast, uterine, or hormone-dependent cancer. ? Using estradiol may be dangerous in some cases if you have any of the conditions listed above. ? Before using estradiol, tell your doctor if you have · high blood pressure, angina, or heart disease; · high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood; · liver disease; · kidney disease; · asthma; · epilepsy; · migraines; · diabetes; · depression; · gallbladder disease; · uterine fibroids; · had a hysterectomy (uterus removed); · a narrow, short, or prolapsed vagina; · vaginal irritation; or · a vaginal infection. ? You may not be able to use estradiol, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you have any of the conditions listed above. ? Treatment with estradiol long-term may increase the risk of stroke. Because of this risk, you should contact your doctor or healthcare provider to discuss your individual risks and benefits before taking estradiol long-term. You should also talk to your doctor or healthcare provider on a regular basis (for example, every 3-6 months) about whether you should continue this treatment. ? Estradiol is in the FDA pregnancy category X. This means that estradiol will cause birth defects in an unborn baby. Do not use estradiol if you are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy. ? Estradiol may decrease milk flow and have other effects on milk composition. Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.",

I was diagnosed with invasive ductal and the only tests ordered for me were blood work, chest x-ray and bone scan. If yours if non-invasive I don't know it they would order a bone scan. Maybe Dr. Leo could answer that for you. Sorry you have BC, but that's really good news that it's found early, small and contained. An excellent book: \"Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book\" If you don't want to buy it, the library should have a copy. She answers just about every question you could think of. Good luck and take care.

My rad onc did \"peek\" at the breast once a week just to make sure all was well. Does yours see you once a week? He should definitely have a look. When I went for my initial consultation after I was diagnosed, the rad onc did tell me that larger-breasted women seem to have a more difficult time with the rads. This was one of the few times in my life I was happy to be small-breasted! LOL He did say this was speaking in general terms. Wishing you well and sending hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi, I always thought the chemobrain theory was related to how much chemo you did, that the longer you were on chemo the more likely you were to have chemobrain. For example, people with mets taking chemo for one or two years seem more likely to experience it. I'm just guessing. For myself, I only had 4 A/C and I don't see any after-effects at all at this point in my life. I finished chemo thirteen months ago. How can one get chemobrain when they say that the chemo doesn't cross the blood/brain barrrier? Is that true? Isn't that why they can't treat brain mets with chemo, but treat it with radiation? The whole thing is a mystery to me. Leo, HELP! LOL Anyway, I do feel that chemotherapy and its risks are DOWNPLAYED. I remember I sat in a little cubicle and the chemo nurse went over all the risks with me in a very short time. He also showed me some written data on chemotheralpy and its risks and more than once he said it was \"overkill.\" Before I knew what hit me, I was signing papers. Interesting to see what Leo says regarding the chemobrain theory. Margie",

Tamoxifen, twice daily - I've been so lucky...the only side effect I've had is hot flashes and they've diminished quite a bit. 70 mg. Fosamax, once a week. I started on Actonel a year before I was dx with BC. My PCP did this as a preventive measure. I had no side effects. Then, I received a letter from my insurance company stating they would no longer compensate me for that drug. Their alternative was Fosamax, so I switched. Again...very lucky...no side effects at all. And I've known women who have had serious gastrointestinal side effects. 750 mg. Glucosamine, daily 600 mg. Chondroitin, daily 10 mg. Ambien, at bedtime. When I was dx I was prescribed Ativan at bedtime (low-dose .5 mg.) and stayed on that for a while. Then my PCP had me try Trazadone (100 mg.) I had to stop taking it because it caused extreme dry mouth. The good thing about that was the fact that it's non-addictive. And now, the Ambien doesn't seem to be working. This has been my biggest problem.....trying to get a good nights sleep. Anyone else have trouble sleeping? Thanks for sharing. Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi Ann, I think it's a good idea for you to see a medical ongologist. Your surgeon's office should be able to set this up for you. Bring a list of questions with you. It's also a good idea to bring a person you trust with you to the appointment as it provides an extra set of ears. There is a LOT of information to assimilate. I was diagnosed with invasive ductal and the only tests ordered for me were blood work, chest x-ray and bone scan. If yours if non-invasive I don't know it they would order a bone scan. Maybe Dr. Leo could answer that for you. Sorry you have BC, but that's really good news that it's found early, small and contained. An excellent book: \"Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book\" If you don't want to buy it, the library should have a copy. She answers just about every question you could think of. Good luck and take care.

      "Content": "Danielle, To answer your question -- my tumor was 1.1 centimeters. It sounds small to others, but when I found it, it felt very big to me. Also, I have small breasts. This is what I was told: The general rule is that they start leaning toward recommending chemo when the tumor is invasive and 1 centimeter or larger. But, as I said before, others factors also influence this decision. Some of these factors are whether the her2neu is positive, whether the tumor is estrogen negative or estrogen positive, the grade of the tumor and other factors. Also, whether there are any positive lymph nodes will come into play. BUT....there is a good chance your mom won't need the chemo, given the smaller size of the tumor. Only time will tell. And if she should need chemo, we can help. Many of the ladies here have done chemo. An excellent book is \"Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book.\" It answers any and all questions about breasts and breast cancer. You should be able to check it out of the library if you don't want to purchase it. Sending hugs, Margie",

I am now taking Tamoxifen because my tumor was hormone receptor positive. Your mom will discover more of this information as she moves along in treatment. Of course, you can come here anytime and we can try and give you some answers and lots of support and hugs. Keep us posted. Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Dear Sharon, Welcome to the boards, although I'm sorry you have BC. It's a total shocker. I finished treatments for invasive ductal eight months ago and I'm doing GREAT now! I have every reason to believe that I will live to be a little old lady of 85 and die from something other than BC! Sharon, after your surgery you will get a copy of your patholgy report. Your treatments will be based on what is in that report regarding your malignancy. Once a \"plan of action\" is drawn up, I, and others on the board who have been there/done that can help you get through those treatments, whatever they may be. I did chemo and rads. They were MUCH easier than I imagined. Please keep us posted when you get more information. Take care of yourself, too. Hugs, Margie",

As one who was recently treated for breast cancer and is also having difficulty getting good care from the local hometown hospital, I can certainly understand your frustration. I agree that the possible side-effects of treatment are downplayed. At least this is true where I received my treatment. My radiation oncologist actually said \"There are no risks to this treatment.\" ????? I visited the link you provided about you and your wife's story. I am sure that I have read your story in the newspaper at one time. It sounded so familiar. Could this be true? I was so touched by the story and remember reading a portion of it to my husband. I applaud all you are doing in this arena. Take care, Margie",

The weekend before my last rads week, my family and I took the very early morning train to Boston (3 hours) to meet my sister and her husband. I was fine all day...a very long day. We took the 10:00 p.m. train home. I got on the train -- next thing I remember was hubby waking me....that we were home. I had gotten on that train and I was out like a light soon after. And I'm the type who NEVER sleeps on trains and planes. So....I wasn't overly tired, but a bit more tired than I expected. Cathy should be fine. I think the trip will be good for her. If she's tired, let her doze in the car while you drive. Have a great trip, Margie",

I can still go a couple months and have only a tiny bit of underarm hair. Before BC I had to shave here once a week in spite of being light-haired. I have heard ladies on other boards speak of similar experiences. I have also been on Tamoxifen for 13 months. I still have to shave my legs much less often, too. THE GOOD NEWS: My head hair is still growing, full and healthy. I just keep thanking my lucky stars the underarm hair loss didn't happen to my head hair! If I'm going to lose hair, I'd rather lose it under the arms. LOL Hugs and here's to healthy hair, Margie",

      "Content": "Madge ~ Here is something I got from www.imaginis.com which is an excellent site: FDA Approves MammoSite Internal Radiation Therapy as New Breast Cancer Treatment Option (dateline June 24, 2002) Format for Printing The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the MammoSite system to deliver internal beam radiation to breast cancer patients after the surgical removel of a breast lump (lumpectomy). Internal beam radiation, or brachytherapy, significantly reduces the amount of time required with standard external beam radiation and may cause fewer side effects. While the new treatment has not been found to be more effective than traditional radiation therapy, the FDA approval provides breast cancer patients with another, more convenient option and could reduce the number of women who have their entire breasts removed with mastectomy. Internal beam radiation involves using radioactive \"seeds\" (called Iridium-192) to destroy remaining breast cancer cells after lumpectomy. With the MammoSite Radiation Therapy System, the physician inserts a special balloon catheter into the breast cavity (the cavity, or space in the breast, is created after tissue is removed during the lumpectomy). A hollow catheter is attached to the balloon, and during radiation therapy, the physician feeds a small radioactive seed through the catheter and into the balloon. The seed delivers radiation to the surrounding breast tissue Internal beam radiation may also used in other areas of the body, including the mouth, cervix, and prostate. Because a lumpectomy involves removing only a breast lump and surrounding margin of normal breast tissue instead of the entire breast, it is possible that some cancer cells will not be removed during the surgery. Therefore, radiation therapy is necessary after lumpectomy to ensure that any remaining cancer cells are destroyed. Standard external beam radiation therapy has proven to be effective at preventing a recurrence of cancer after a mastectomy; however, the treatment can be inconvenient for women because it must be administered over a six to seven week period. With internal beam radiation therapy, treatment time is reduced to five days. Since internal beam radiation involves exposing less breast tissue to radiation, fewer skin reactions (such as redness, rashes, or irritations) occur with the new treatment. Patients also tend to experience less irritation of healthy breast tissues. According to Proxima Therapeutics Inc., the maker of the Mammosite system, internal beam radiation may also be associated with less toxic effects, compared to standard external beam radiation therapy. \"While there are positive outcomes associated with lumpectomy followed by radiation treatment, 50 percent of eligible women with early stage breast cancer still opt for a mastectomy,\" said Dr. Robert Kuske, Principal Investigator of the MammoSite clinical trials, as quoted in a Proxima Therapeutics news release. \"MammoSite could make it easier for more women to consider the choice of lumpectomy and provides physicians with an important new tool for the practice of breast conservation therapy.\" Despite the FDA approval, internal beam radiation therapy has not been proven to be more effective at destroying cancer cells or preventing a cancer recurrence than standard external beam radiation. Further clinical trials will likely compare the two treatments more closely. However, for women with small breast cancers, internal beam radiation is a new option that women can now discuss with their physicians. The new treatment may also attract those breast cancer patients who refuse to undergo standard radiation therapy. Hopes this helps! Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "Hi Kristen, This seems to be a problem and a worry among lots of women after being treated for BC. I finished my treatments 8 months ago (IDC) and I have not had any tests, not even blood drawn. The last time they drew blood was 3 weeks after I finished chemo (last Dec.) so we are coming up on a year. They always say the same things - that if you don't have symptoms there is no need or that mets found early do not make a difference in survival stats. But, honestly, I wish they would try and understand where we are coming from. It's easy for them to say this and that because I don't think they truly understand the anxiety. I realize some do not want any tests. However, if a woman wants these tests on a yearly basis and it will comfort her I think they should be given. I would feel better with a yearly bone scan and blood work but they won't budge. If I were her2neu positive, I would insist on some testing because the recurrence rate is a bit higher. But that's just me. Good luck. I hope everything works out for you! Hugs, Margie",

      "Content": "HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, Tammy! Lauri is so right. I feel a special bond with other women who have had breast cancer. When I went to visit my sis for Thanksgiving in Connecticut, we took the train to New York City. On the train just a couple seats away from me, there was a woman who had a scarf on (it looked like she was bald under it). At one point she removed part of her scarf to scratch her head and she was bald. Then I noticed she had the breast cancer pink pin on. A man sitting with her also wore one of the pink pins. He looked like her dad. I just wanted to go over and give her a big hug and talk to her but I was too shy. Some people would like that and others would not. Later, I regretted that I did not go over to her! Next time that happens I will take a chance. Celebrate your anniversary. I had my one-year since dx in August. This is such a special time.
