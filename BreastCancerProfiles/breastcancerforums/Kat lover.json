    "Content": "I am in a real quandary and very upset and torn. I had a mastectomy January 2014. I had prior DCIS in 2006 and had 3 lumpectomies til they got clear margins. I had a lesion on my breast removed by a dermatologist (was there for a different problem and this was a by the way this rubs my bra) and was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer by the lab that did the pathology. Went back to prior breast surgeon and after more testing 3D mammo and ultrasound had the mastectomy. Pathology on the breast showed NO breast cancer. Oncologist sent original specimen to numerous labs which did not agree and I have diagnosis of 3 different types of cancer with each lab disagreeing with the others. Have made and cancelled 3 different appointments for skin expanders surgery. Am scheduled for next week. PS said I have extensive damage from radiation done for 2006 cancer and this may not work. If it fails she wants to do the muscle from the back surgery, I am thinking of cancelling again. I HATE the way I look, BUT am having trouble facing the idea of pain, expense (my insurance will cover most of it) and am 72 years old. My husband is fine either way. 2 years ago I lost 72 lbs and am upset that I looked good and now have a missing boob. Please give me feed back. Kat Lover",
