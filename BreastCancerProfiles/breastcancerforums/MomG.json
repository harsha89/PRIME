Never once did I relate it to the meds. So good to know that it's not all in my mind...I mentioned it to the dr. but he just said, I needed to continue the arm exercises they gave me to do after the surgery to strengthen the arm & muscles...So now I've got something to go on & ask him when I go back. So sorry that others are having this problem also...but it's helpful to share these things, that's why I am thankful I found this forum...I don't post much, just read, but I never had to have any chemo or radiation, so it's for sure my wrist pain it's not related to that.

      "Content": "Hey Nancy, I talked to my onc. & he tried several different ones, but I still had severe side effects, same as with Arimidex...Joint pain, blurred vision, food wouldn't go down so threw it up, bowels wouldn't move, burning & itching when I had to void, so ended up in hospital to have test done on kidneys. My onc. decided that I couldn't tolorate the estegron blocker meds & he stated that my chances of getting cancer again without the meds was less than 15%...so I told him I would take my chances rather than stay on five meds for the side effects. I was like you, my fingers locked up & had places hurt that I didn't know I had...I had to wear a brace on my right wrist it hurt so bad....I will surely keep the Actonel in mind if I have to go back on anything....I am on 60MG Evista for bone strength...I don't have osteroposis either...just a preventive. I see you have diabetes also. I too am border line now as of Nov. 2006",

I just started taking the Arimidex in March after my surgery in January, so seems I had a fast reaction to it according to what I have read compaired to others. I am sure going to call my oncologist & ask him about this, because my next appointment isn't till August 1st. & I sure don't want to wait that long to get some relief. Yes, it is good to know we aren't crazy & alone in this...I had my surgery Up State Ithaca NY where my daughter lives & the oncologist there was more thorough in explaining things to me than the one I have here in Va.

I am also having problems with food digesting & swelling right after I eat, so am taking zantac for that & lasix for the swelling. My dr. thinks all these side effects are coming from the Armidex because my body isn't getting enough estragon, so now I am going to discuss this with the onc. about coming off the Armidex & see if I can find a \"normal\" again...I am so tired of just as soon as I eat, it either comes back up or I start bloting up & feel like the new years blimp. I was only on one medicine till I started taking the Armidex, & now I am taking 5 different meds for all the side effects. I had rather take my chances of the cancer coming back than to have to take so many meds for side effects & then they cause more side effects & on & on....I started taking water exercises at the gym & it has helped me in getting some strength back in my right arm & eased some of the muscle pain. Just hope we all can get some relief soon & these doctors start listening to us. Hang in there everyone, together we can make it...",

Medicare paid for it all...I also have this tank top that came with two fiber filled stuff that can be washed also...I use those when I take the arobic classes....You can get the prostesis just for swiming, but Medicare won't pay for any swim ware.

Dr tried me on another one but it did the same thing....Everyone's body is different, so I suggest you discuss it with your Onc. & see what he says about trying other meds. Some people can tolorate one thing, when others can't. My onc. thoght it best I come off all the meds, as I couldn't tolorate them and since I'm not at high risk , I am much better now...Keep us posted as how you are doing & what your onc. tells you.",

I would question that dr for more details of what he plans to do, & always take someone with you to help you remember what was said, believe me, you won't remember all that you are told. Make notes also of what to ask. I wouldn't worry about this till I got the results back from the biopsy, cause you can't make a decision until you know what it is. Good luck & my prayers are with you. [/b]",

I talked to my family Dr & also the oncoligist & they both agreed that my chances of getting cancer again without the Arimidex was less than 15%...so I came off the med. I am not suggesting you do that, because everyone is different. I didn't have to take chemo. I would talk in depth with the oncoligist about more explation of why the cyst show up now.

When I went back a week after the surgery the top layer of skin started dying & was all black. & the smell was over whelming My surgon was very dissapointed & shocked it did this, so each week she has been removing a layer of the dead skin & it's healing fine but is leaving a deep hole in the chest wall, which she says I will proballly need a skin graft to fill it in now after it all heals. In 2 days it will be a month since the surgery & I thought I'd be almost healed by now. Has anyone else experenced anything like this & am I expecting to much from my body to soon?",

No I didn't get any kind of infection..my dr. said it was from a lack of blood flow getting into the top layer of skin that caused it to die & this might happen one in a thousand, course I had to be that one....lol..No I don't need any other kind of treatment..just have to take calcuim & a multiple vitamin for now. This was the reason I chose a Mastectomy, so I wouldn't have to take all the radiation or cemo & then take a chance on it coming back later...10 years ago I was diagnosed with cancer but then I requested a second opinion of the biopsy & it was cancer free. So I think this time, even though it was in the first stage & very small, I made the right choice of getting rid of it all so in another 10 years or so I won't have to face this again.",
