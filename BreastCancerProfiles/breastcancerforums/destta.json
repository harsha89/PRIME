    "Content": "Hi, I was recently diagnosed with stage 2 estrogen positive breast cancer. The lump is 4 in size. They found a very small spot in the node that they removed. They set me up for chemo treatments of 4x's A/C drugs followed by 4x's T drugs. To shrink the size before removal. However, I have done one treatment and went through the total melt down for 8 days, (currently on day 9). My question is what can I expect if I decide to stop these chemo treatments and persue a more natural cure? I would like some information about this before I talk to my doctor or before I make a final decision. I would appreciate any information about this, but I would really like to hear from someone else who made this decision also. Thanks for your help! Sincerely, Destta",
