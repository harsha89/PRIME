It had been hiding behind the tissue and mimiked the feel of the tissue as well, until last January, when a slightly inverted nipple (normal for me) became more so. Even then the mass did not show up on mammogram even CAD enhanced. It did show up clearly on ultrasound and breast MRI. I hope by now you have had this problem explored further. Ruthiema",

      "Content": "- Age 60 - time since diagnosis 6 months - menopausal at diagnosis - Specific type of cancer invasive ductal carcinoma grade 2 Ductal carsinoma in Situ solid type intermediate grade - Treatments: mastectomy followed by Arimidex I am both estrogen and Her2 positive. Is this common? I was under the impression that Her2 positive (I am 7.2 amplified on the FISH test} usually means estrogen -. I am between 71 and 100% positive for estrogen. Progesterone is between 1 and 11%. I am also T2N0, grade 2 out of 3. I am puzzled by my oncologist's reaction to my Her2 status, which we just found out last week, three months after the mastectomy. He is quite insistent on the Arimidex in case those estrogen loving little beasties have some how managed to travel from my parafin inbeded, carefully preserved right breast into my blood stream, but sees no reason to treat the Her2 aspect of the little beasties. Soooo if those cells somehow got past the nodes without our knowledge wouldn't the fact they are Her2+ make them more aggressive and shouldn't I be treated for both? Just thinking out loud. Would appreciate any and all comments. Thanks. Ruth",

      "Content": "My onc immediately suggested AC cheno, I declined. He then told me that given the size of the tumor 2.4 cm chemo would be appropriate. (I am stage 2 node negative) Again I declined. He then used the adjuvent shared decision making model and given my stats chemo ewould give me a 10 year disease free survial rate of only 2% where as the aromatase inhibitors raised that to 17%. I decided to go with the aromatase inhibitor. My Her2 was not done at the time of mastectomy. Wouldn't you know I had it at the only hospital in the area that doesn't do it routenely. I finally had my surgeon request it in May. By IHC it was a weak positive so I insisted my onc have a FISH done. He was not happy about it. Now I know I am definitely Her2 positive but he is not recommending a change in treatment so am going for a second opinion. I am not willing to throw everything at it, only that which might be helpful and it has to be more than a 2% helpful. Thanks for your input. I have joined the forum you suggested. Ruth",
