      "Content": "Hello. I am a 36 yr old female. On Sept 7 I had my first mammogram. The next day I got a call that I needed to come back for more testing. So on Friday I had another mammogram and an ultrasound on my left breast. The radiologist said there is a solid mass and it needs a biopsy. She said she ruled out a cyst and a fibroadenoma. It showed up on the ultrasound as a black spot with a \"tale\" coming off of it. She also said there was another small spot. I want to know if cancer shows up on the ultrasound as a black spot. I have a meeting with a surgeon on Monday, and then they will schedule an ultrasound guided biopsy. I am freaking out! Is it most likely this is nothing? Any help would be great, not matter how scary this is. Longest weekend of my life!!!!!! Thanks!!",
