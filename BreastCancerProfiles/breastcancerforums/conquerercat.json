    "Content": "Hi TT; I'm new to this site, but not breast cancer. I \"conquered\". I am curious about a couple of things. 1. Do you live in a large city? 2. Is your doctor an OB GYN or regular MD? 3. Did your doctor send you for a mammogram? 4. Do you have breast cancer in your family on your mother's side? First thing you need to do is go get a mammogram, but be sure you tell them your are pregnant so they can take precautions. Second, tell the radiologist about the lump you are feeling and that it is sore. They can determine whether this is a lymphnode swelling. Keep in mind, sometimes we get infections and our lymphnodes are like a filtering system which will swell, maybe because of the infection, but then get better after we rid ourselves of the infection. But, if this has came back a couple of times, I would definitely put up a red flag and get a mammo. I know you are only 24 and the National Breast Cancer Foundation suggests annual mammo's at 40 and above, but this is becoming an unrealistic age, since many women are now being diagnosed with breast cancer as young as 15. Don't take any chances. And don't worry about the baby. Doctor's can do some amazing things now for the protection of you and the baby. I also don't understand why your doctor would refer you to an internal medical doctor. Your complaining of breast pain, which could be skin stretching since you are pregnant, but under arm pain..... Also, make sure you go to a Diagnostic Radiologist for the mammogram. As for the leg pain, be sure to discuss this with them also, normally with breast cancer the legs are not affected, but it could be something else. Is this in the muscle or the bone? Hope this helps. Keep me informed. Conquerer Cat",
