    "Content": "I'm am currently on xeloda as a single agent for metatastic BC, I refused to combine treatments, because of side effects. Xeloda isn't that bad, you don't lose your hair. But in high dose's I've found the side effects to be aweful. Lower doses its not too bad. I'm currently on 3000mg a day for 14 days. At 4000mg I had terrible stomach problems and severely red and swollen hands and feet. I'm currently on my 4th round, don't know if its working. Some people have little or no side effects from this. I guess the name of the game is to add more time to our survival. they gave me 50% of 2 years how about you?",
