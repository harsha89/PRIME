I remember slightly that you lost both your parents to cancer and your sister was diagnosed? I also see you are a current member with the prostate forum. My heart goes out to you. How much can one person stand? As you know, our members are extremely knowledgeable and supportive. However, with that said, our Breast Cancer forum is not very busy. There are several other forums specific to Breast Cancer which may help in answering your questions and/or concerns. There may be some that can chime in here but I thought it respectful as a long-standing member, you receive a response to your newly created thread. Keep strong even when you feel you have nothing left. Lisa",

      "Content": "Indylou I am sorry to hear of your friends situation. My husbands Aunt recently passed away from this same specific cancer. She had several go arounds with the disease over the course of several years. At each point, the medical team was successful but with metastatic disease, it can return at any time. Right before her passing, she choose Hospice as there was very little they could do for her. They recommended radiation but informed her it was not curative. Being 84 and losing her husband earlier this year, she made the choice best for herself. Once in hospice, the decline was swift. They made sure she was comfortable and painfree. There sometimes is a fine line between palliative and hospice and can be confusing. I copied and pasted the following for you: Hospice care is reserved for terminally ill patients when treatment is no longer curative during the last 6 months of life, assuming the disease takes its normal course. Palliative care can be employed while the patient is continuing active treatment through different phases of their life limiting condition. I thank you for all you do here and know your friend is comforted in having someone like you during this most sad time. Lisa",

I am not sure how old your dear Mum is but I tend to think perhaps the doctors overseeing her care should be performing a brain MRI to rule out brain mets. If brain mets exist, this could account for the dementia type symptoms occurring. At this point, there are still some unanswered questions so please do update when you know more and we then can do our best to answer any questions you have. Lisa",

While we can not even begin to guess the cause, allow the doctors to do their job and hopefully can establish the cause of your dear Mum's latest developments. As we are not doctors, so put some faith in them that they are doing everything they can to stabilize your Mum and once that is accomplished, more answers regarding possible treatment answers with be offered.

At this time, perhaps keep a notebook and write down any changes in her mental capacity as well as physical. Keep a list of meds handy and update them as needed. If you keep everything organized, it helps to present questions at doctor appointments. Now, since it is confirmed it is not lung cancer, i will move your thread to our Breast Cancer forum as trearment can greatly vary from one type of cancer to another. Lisa",

Members generally will respond when available and online as this forum operates different than a chat forum. However, even though I have no knowledge regarding Breast Cancer or suspicion of such cancer, a biopsy is the definitive test to either confirm or rule out cancer. Unfortunately, this specific sub forum, Breast Cancer, is not very active. I am not sure why but my guess is there are a lot of online forums specific to Breast Cancer.

My suggestion, contact your medical facility and see if they offer any kind of dupport groups.

Your best course of action at the moment is to sit down with your Mom's oncologist and discuss this findings in terms that you can understand. Based on what the doctors says and explains, ask what treatment options are available or any clinical trials that are ongoing in which she is eligible for.

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of your health worry and I fully understand how scary this waiting for results can be. I do feel your medical doctor was careless in suggesting to you that it is most likely cancer. Until a pathology reports proves otherwise, it is not cancer. This is a rule many of us live by on the forum and many that come to \"worried\" forum, find that once results are in, it is something far less sinister than a cancer diagnosis. Until now, try as hard as you can, engage yourself in things that occupy your time and mind or do things you enjoy. It will help to keep those wandering thoughts away. Fingers crossed you will find you will never have to visit a cancer forum. Please keep us posted and if you can not settle your nerves even just a little, contact your physician and ask how they can help you manage the anxiety until the results are in. Keep us posted.

When it comes to the lumpectomy, since she is comfortable with her current surgeon, combined with the fact he/she is working in conjunction with Erlanger, then it should be of no reason for concern after all, as you said, it is her body and decision. Since there is some family history, then yes, genetic testing probably should be strongly considered. I would have an open discussion with your own doctor about the process. For some reason, probably because there are many forums dedicated to Breast Cancer specifically, this forum tends to not be very active so you may or may not receive responses. Regardless, do check back for possible responses and let us know how it works out with your sisters appointment next week. Lisa",

We are a science based, proven methods formatted forum and do not engage in conversation related to so called \"healers\" using what we consider quackery. In an attempt to at least answer some of your questions, no, blood tests can not determine is the cancer or tumors have shrunk. Only imaging and can provide those answers. Will her bones weaken, the answer is sadly yes if the tumors are encasing themselves within the bones. Does fasting work?, no it does not. Now, as you have written, your Mom has no desire to return to the hospital and is comfortable with this supposed \"miracle healer\". While you may not agree with her decision, it is her decision to make. It must be hard for you so the only thing you can do is to be there for her. Good luck to you and your Mom.",
