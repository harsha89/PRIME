    "Content": "Hello I'm new to this forum. My name is Thanash. About 2 months ago my mother was diagnosed with cancer which according to the docs turned out to be stage 2B. She had surgery and it was succesful , she did not have masectomy as the area was not really infected. She had the lump removed ( a 3cm one ) and 6 lymphnodes which where slightly infected. The biopsy was good news and the doctor reassured us that everything will turn out fine. He said the cancer is not metastatic nor aggresive ( HER2 was negative ) She had first round of chemo which went really well. We are 15 days after chemo and the WBCs are back to normal. The oncologist asked for some blood tests before we move on to the second one and here is my issue. The exams are good according to the microbiologist but I noticed that the GGT and the ALP were increased. ALP is 141 IU/L when normal is between 30-125 and GGT is 40 U/I when normal is between 7-30. After some reasearch I did I saw that both of these are used in metastastic cancer. When both are increased bone cancer is out of the question and a metastasis to the liver is more likely. I've also read that medication can be a factor in the increase of ALP and GGT and also smoking ( my mother was a heavy smoker but has now quit). She had MRI done and the liver was clean. So my question is if anyone else has experienced this and if it's normal considering she finished the medication like 2 days ago. I'm really worried and we are seeing the doctor on Friday so anything would gladly help.",
