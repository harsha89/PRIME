    "Content": "Hi, I'm new on this board. I was introduced to this board due to the efforts of Nancy. I had ductal carcinoma in situ in 1994. Just had lumpectomy. I had it again in 2002 and had a biospsy/lumpectomy and another re-excision to get clean margins. I had six weeks of radiation and went right from my treatment to work for 8 hours everyday. Like Nancy said you are tired but I didn't really notice until I sat down in the evening and would fall asleep in my chair. Unless there is some unforseen reason you should be able to have your \"dream vacation\". Just be sure to take good care of yourself. Eat well and get enough sleep.",
