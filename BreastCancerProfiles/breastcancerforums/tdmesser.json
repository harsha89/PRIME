I don't know if those stats are overall for DCIS or the more aggressive type of DCIS that I have. I don't want a mastectomy, but then again I don't want to have lumpectomy w/ radiation and then have it recur and have it invasive and have to have a mastectomy w/o reconstruction (because I had the radiation) and need chemo too. Anyone else struggling over decision? Anyone else who had similar diagnosis and have gone through this? Thanks.",

      "Content": "47yo premenopausal w/ no lump but w/ 1 area of calcifications on routine mammogram. Path report from stereotactic biopsy: Ductal Carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade with comedo necrosis (Grade III) w/ focal microinvasion ER3+/PR 3+ HER2/NEU 1+ Trying to decide between lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy w/ reconstruction. and whether to do sentinel node biopsy. or wait to see what surgery shows. Concerns: Don't really want to do mast so was planning on doing lump w/ rad because told survival rates same. But then heard if recurs then would have to do mast but then reconstruction very difficult. And read high nuclear grade w/ comedo necrosis most likely to recur. Also read that 50% of recurrance are invasive, which I guess would then mean I would need chemo in addition to Mast. Don't know what HER2/NEU stands for but read that HER2/NEU positive is bad, but since I'm only 1+ positive how bad is that? Dr. said could do sentinel node biopsy and he probably would recommend it because of microinvasion. Said if all nodes clear then have peace of mind, but could find just a few cells and then there is no data on what that really means but would then probably have to have chemo, which may be over kill but maybe not. I know that I am \"lucky\" because it was caught early, but having so many choices and not knowing what to do makes my head hurt so bad I want to cry. Dr. said they is no right or wrong answer, except to do nothing, which of course unacceptable. Any thoughts or info would be so appreciated. Thanks",

      "Content": "You are blessed and I am happy for you. My biopsy report was not so good. But I guess I am lucky because it is DCIS w/ Microinvasion. Planning on a lumpectomy next week and they did leave a pin in to mark, but Dr. said have to go in for them to put in a wire right before i go for lumpectomy- Is that the needle localization you are talking about? I sure hope not - Now I am worried that that will hurt too. Still considering a mastectomy so I won't have to go through this again, unless it's my other breast. Wanted to talk to a plastic surgeon before had surgery just to know my options. @ were recommended. One doesn't take my insurance -and it's BCBS PPO, the other said they could get me in in DECEMBER. I explained that I had cancer, and needed a consultation before I had my surgery and certainly couldn't wait that long. the reply \"Well that's the soonest we have\" Also trying to get into radiology oncoloist sooner. Currently earliest they can get me in is next Tuesday, but the Surgeon wanted to surgery next Wednesday, so that won't work since the whole point of talking to radiology oncologist is to get better idea of my chance of recurrence given my specific path report, so I can make better decidion between lumpectomy and mastectomy. Anyone else out there who's having difficulty deciding on course of treatment?",

      "Content": "You are blessed and I am happy for you. My biopsy report was not so good. But I guess I am lucky because it is DCIS w/ Microinvasion. Planning on a lumpectomy next week and they did leave a pin in to mark, but Dr. said have to go in for them to put in a wire right before i go for lumpectomy- Is that the needle localization you are talking about? I sure hope not - Now I am worried that that will hurt too. Still considering a mastectomy so I won't have to go through this again, unless it's my other breast. Wanted to talk to a plastic surgeon before had surgery just to know my options. @ were recommended. One doesn't take my insurance -and it's BCBS PPO, the other said they could get me in in DECEMBER. I explained that I had cancer, and needed a consultation before I had my surgery and certainly couldn't wait that long. the reply \"Well that's the soonest we have\" Also trying to get into radiology oncoloist sooner. Currently earliest they can get me in is next Tuesday, but the Surgeon wanted to surgery next Wednesday, so that won't work since the whole point of talking to radiology oncologist is to get better idea of my chance of recurrence given my specific path report, so I can make better decidion between lumpectomy and mastectomy.

      "Content": "FYI- I had similar experience. Surgeon kept giving more lidocaine injections, then tried different type of anesthetic, but still very painful. i started crying - couldn't help myself, but tried so hard not to because not suppose to move. Dr. said thought because I had such dense breast tissue that anesthetic couldn't get to deep tissues. I have to have surgery in next 1-2 weeks, but am sure they put me totally under- still trying to decide between lumpectomy and mastectomy. But if I had to have another stereotactic biopsy I don't think I could do it unless they gave me some stronger anesthetic.",
