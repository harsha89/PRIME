      "Content": "I have DCIS high grade w/ comedonecrosis & microinvasion. I hear I am lucky because DCIS isn't life threatening, but then 15% recur and of those 1/2 are invasive. I don't know if those stats are overall for DCIS or the more aggressive type of DCIS that I have. I don't want a mastectomy, but then again I don't want to have lumpectomy w/ radiation and then have it recur and have it invasive and have to have a mastectomy w/o reconstruction (because I had the radiation) and need chemo too. Anyone else struggling over decision? Anyone else who had similar diagnosis and have gone through this? Thanks.",

      "Content": "47yo premenopausal w/ no lump but w/ 1 area of calcifications on routine mammogram. Path report from stereotactic biopsy: Ductal Carcinoma in situ, high nuclear grade with comedo necrosis (Grade III) w/ focal microinvasion ER3+/PR 3+ HER2/NEU 1+ Trying to decide between lumpectomy w/ radiation or mastectomy w/ reconstruction. and whether to do sentinel node biopsy. or wait to see what surgery shows. Concerns: Don't really want to do mast so was planning on doing lump w/ rad because told survival rates same. But then heard if recurs then would have to do mast but then reconstruction very difficult. And read high nuclear grade w/ comedo necrosis most likely to recur. Also read that 50% of recurrance are invasive, which I guess would then mean I would need chemo in addition to Mast. Don't know what HER2/NEU stands for but read that HER2/NEU positive is bad, but since I'm only 1+ positive how bad is that? Dr. said could do sentinel node biopsy and he probably would recommend it because of microinvasion. Said if all nodes clear then have peace of mind, but could find just a few cells and then there is no data on what that really means but would then probably have to have chemo, which may be over kill but maybe not. I know that I am \"lucky\" because it was caught early, but having so many choices and not knowing what to do makes my head hurt so bad I want to cry. Dr. said they is no right or wrong answer, except to do nothing, which of course unacceptable. Any thoughts or info would be so appreciated. Thanks",
