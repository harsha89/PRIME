    "Content": "My friend is a 4th year TNBC patient with liver mets and currently lives in China. She has used various chemo regimens over the years and now there is no response anymore. She will get experimental PD-L1 therapies with Keytruda (pembrolizumab) or Opdivo (nivolumab). However, her doctors there have very little experience with these drugs, especially when used to treat breast cancer. Have you participated in related clinical trials and can share some of your experiences? Thanks a lot!",
