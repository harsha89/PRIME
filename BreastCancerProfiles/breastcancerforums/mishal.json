      "Content": "hi there my age is 24 and about 2 or 3 three years back i had tumor in my left breast near to nipple i got it checked but the doctor said it was only a minor infection and gave me antibiotic and the tumor vanished after few days but now for many weeks in fact months i am having pain in my left side specially when i bend down it increased and sometimes i feel like it is moving from breast to armpit.few days ago i had severe pain in my left armpit that i couldn't move my arm for seconds but it did not last for long. i do not feel any lump, but i am scared because my maternal grandmother died of breast cancer and paternal grandmother died of lung cancer. so should i get checked again?",
