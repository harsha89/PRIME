      "Content": "Hi teena ((((hugs)))) I have watched a good friend go though this. It started with a small lump....it came back worse. We had talked about a bilateral mastectomy and she chose the lumpectomy. Doing it over again...she says she would have had them both removed as soon as the cancer reared its ugly head. I am \"high risk\" and being watched. I am totally with you on the bilateral mastectomy. Its something i have thought long and hard about....and I too would want them both gone. vent all you want.... its good for you Hang in there hun...... and good luck next week!!!!",

      "Content": "The first thing i asked the oncologist when they were going to start my friend on Folfox was if the were going to add a steroid into the mix. He said they wanted to see how he was going to do first..... He had every side effect at the top of the evil scale of badness..... it was horrible. They added in the Dexamethasone and the light shown and the angles sang..... he did much better after that. Sadly...i just picked them up and he needs to start on them again. Hang in there and I hope you wife starts to feel a bit better....",
