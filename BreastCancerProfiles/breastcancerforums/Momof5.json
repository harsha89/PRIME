      "Content": "Hi Roxanne, I was just diagnosed in Sept. 04 after finding the lump myself. I know how you feel right now. It is very scary. The only way I got through those first few weeks is by having 4 very close friends who have all had breast cancer surround me with their love and support. So, even though we are not there with you in person, we can share with you what happen to us and maybe that will help you in some way. Of course, every case is different. This is what happened to me......once I found the lump, I went for a mammogram and ultrasound. The lump didn't show up on the mammogram but it did show up on the ultrasound. I went to see the surgeon who offered me either a lumpectomy or a needle biopsy. I chose the lumpectomy. I was given a shot of \"happy juice\" instead of going \"under\". I was sent on my way after the surgeon told me that it just looked liked fibrosis and not to worry. Boy was he wrong. A few days later I was summoned to the surgeons office to hear the news. He told me that I needed another lumpectomy since my margins were not clear and at the same time he would take some lymph nodes out. He said that I would need radiation and possibly chemo if the nodes were involved. Anyway, I went home and two days later I decided that I was not going to take any chances. I am a Mom of 5 young kids. I went back to see the surgeon and told him that I wanted a mastectomy. Three days later I had a mastectomy and 19 lymph nodes removed. I went to see the oncologist and because all my lymph nodes were clear and the BC was in the early stages and the fact that I had the mastectomy, I did not require any chemo or radiation. I was put on tamoxifen. Hang in there Roxanne. Take some deep breaths and try to relax. The waiting is the worst part. Take care of yourself.",

      "Content": "First of all..............HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!!!!! I certainly was looking forward to saying goodbye to 2004.....wasn't a good one for me! Hopefully 2005 will bring all of us happiness and health. Thanks to Lauri and Nancy for the warm welcome to this forum. Great to hear from Polly! I was hoping that someone on this forum had their reconstruction with tissue expanders. I did not have to have radiation so hopefully this procedure will work for me. I am 43 years old and was diagnosed in Sept. 2004. I had MRM on the left side on Sept. 30th. 19 lymph nodes were all clear. Then by choice, I had a simple mastectomy on the right side on Dec. 16 and bilateral tissue expanders during the same surgery. It has been two weeks and I am not really in any pain but just really tired. I guess having two major surgeries so close together really took a lot out of me. I go for my first fill on Wednesday. I will let you know how that goes. Have yourselves a great day! Jan",

My tumor size was 1 cm and all 19 lymph nodes were clear. I was offered a second lumpectomy followed by radiation but I chose mastectomy instead. Since I had the breast removed and with my lymph nodes being clear, my oncologist said that no radiation or chemo was required. I have been on tamoxifen for 2 months and so far so good with no side effects at all (said with my fingers crossed). I feel truly blessed. Hugs from, Jan",

      "Content": "First of all..............HAPPY NEW YEAR TO ALL!!!!! I certainly was looking forward to saying goodbye to 2004.....wasn't a good one for me! Hopefully 2005 will bring all of us happiness and health. Thanks to Lauri and Nancy for the warm welcome to this forum. Great to hear from Polly! I was hoping that someone on this forum had their reconstruction with tissue expanders. I did not have to have radiation so hopefully this procedure will work for me. I am 43 years old and was diagnosed in Sept. 2004. I had MRM on the left side on Sept. 30th. 19 lymph nodes were all clear. Then by choice, I had a simple mastectomy on the right side on Dec. 16 and bilateral tissue expanders during the same surgery. It has been two weeks and I am not really in any pain but just really tired. I guess having two major surgeries so close together really took a lot out of me. I go for my first fill on Wednesday. I will let you know how that goes. Have yourselves a great day! Jan",

      "Content": "Hi Polly.....Thank goodness you made the decision to remove your \"other\" breast. I am still waiting for the pathology report from my second mastecomy. I will be shocked if anything shows up there. When I told my plastic surgeon that I wanted the other breast off, he agreed with me. He said if I was having reconstruction I might as well go for the \"matching twins\". He also said that peace of mind is very important. I have two friends both in their 40's that have had this disease twice now. I just felt like I need to get on with my life and not worry about it coming back. My tissue expanders were put under the muscle. The muscle on the side that already had the mastecomy was the only place that really hurt. But now, at 2 1/2 weeks, I can now sleep on my side which is so great. I go for my first fill on Wednesday. How many fills have you had so far to reach a \"B\"? Hi Rachel......thanks for your positive post. It is great to hear from someone who didn't have a hard time through the fills. I am actually looking forward to having my first fill on Wednesday. Have you had your expanders removed and replaced with implants? What about the nipple reconstruction...did you have that done yet? Have a nice evening everyone!",
