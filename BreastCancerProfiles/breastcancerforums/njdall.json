      "Content": "I am so sorry to hear about your diagnosis. I'm am in the situation you were in before you got your news. Yesterday I had biopsy in two places on the same breast. Of course the report didn't come today so I'm hoping to hear tomorrow if it is cancer or not. The waiting is driving me nuts even though I can put it out of my head a good part of the time I can't totally. Please let us know how you are doing.",
