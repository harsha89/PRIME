    "Content": "Hi, I've just joined this because I need to speak to people that have /been there.. I just had a look at my husbands hospital letter and as far as I knew everything was ok, as ok as t can be when you've been diagnosed with cancer. He was diagnosed last year with follicular variant of papillary cancer and he had a total thyroidectomy.It was stage one and they said he would be ok and it didn't spread and that this was one of the types off cancer that often does not reoccur. I try to be positive but doctors are so vague and hospital appontments are months and months apart. Apparently its is avariant of papillary cancer and on the letter it says vascular invasion. What does that mean? What can we expect next? Does that mean it's not stage one ar that there is another cancer somwhere else that the scan did not pick up? Not sure if the scan only followed the radioiodine or it scanned for any cancerous cells not necessary related to thyroid. When someone is diagnosed with cancer, do doctors look for any other signs in the rest of the body. Many questions but don't know who to ask...",
