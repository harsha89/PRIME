    "Content": "I'm hoping someone can relate to what's going on with me. I had reconstructive surgery after a left mastectomy. The problem is with the left mastopexy (breast lift to match the new rebuilt breast). Two days after surgery I was back in the Doc's office with a hematoma next to the incision under the nipple area. She broke it open and gave me an ointment to cover the area. I also was told to clean the area and let air get to it. It is an unsightly mess. It looks like 3 - 4 layers of skin is missing. It has been 3 weeks and although it's slightly smaller, it's still open and oozes fluid. I will see the surgeon in another week to get more info. My question is, how long does something like this take to heal??? It's very gross to me and upsetting. Has anyone experienced anything similar? Any input is welcome and I'm grateful.",
