    "Content": "Hi, My mother-in-law has metastatic breast cancer that has moved to her brain. A few months ago she had 10 sessions of whole brain radiation and has been very fatigued and nauseous ever since. It does seem to be getting worse to where she can't hold any food down now. Is this a normal side effect? Especially so many months out now? She doesn't want to go back to see her doctor. Any insight is hugely appreciated.",
