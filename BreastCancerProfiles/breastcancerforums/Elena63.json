    "Content": "I'm living in Belarus and have some troubles with finding good doctor. Tykerb isn't used in our country at all and I can't find information: does Tykerb is used for Her2+(one plus, not 2 or 3) breast cancer at all? I'm asking, because other schemes aren't help in my country and I'm trying to help for myself due to limited budget... Please help! Thanks",
