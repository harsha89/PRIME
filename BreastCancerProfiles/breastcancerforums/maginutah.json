Hospital first night was sleepless, not from surgery pain, but from IV site pain. Glad to have that IV out and to be out of hospital. My hubby is great nurse, an ortho OR nurse, and has been doing the drain thing for me, etc. Any tips on recovery?",

Now that the season is changing, I actually foresee myself wearing a scarf/hat more than a wig. However, there will be family pictures at a wedding, and I don't want to be remembered as the sick person with the bald head wearing a scarf. I just don't feel like I'm going to be a wig person.

Seems like a good thing to have done, as I will be having 17 infusions over a year, but it does scare me, as does anything that involves incisions and sutures, but then I don't like needles either, and this should be better than trying to find a small vein in my solo arm 17 times, right?",
