    "Content": "I am a 41yr old single mom that is supposed to start chemotherapy in a few days, but am very unsure if I want to go through with it. I\u0092m terrified and can\u0092t seem to wrap my head around why I would want to walk into the hospital feeling great, and knowing that they are going to poison me and I won\u0092t ever feel the way I do now again. Would love to hear someone else that\u0092s been through chemo tell me it\u0092s worth the risks.",
