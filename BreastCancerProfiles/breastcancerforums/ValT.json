She still considered a stage 2 and I found out it is Ductile Cancer (thank you, Nancy). Still haven't heard about the hormone test or HR2 test (?). I am going out to Chicago for her surgery on Wed. next week and staying with her for a week. She's in and out same day and opted for the lumpectomy. Mom seems positive but the emotions have started coming. We're all being as positive as we can. Nancy - again, thank you so much for all of your help and information. I have really felt more informed and have been able to ask some questions that needed asking. I couldn't have done it with you! ValT",

      "Content": "I just got back from IL and had ups and downs. Mom's surgery last Wednesday went well and she recovered quickly with little pain. We had to wait until Monday for the results: ER/PR+ HER2+ 1/10 lymph nodes (the one lymph node had a tumor developing?) Stage II - 3 cm Margins were clear but very, very close so may need a second surgery (leaving it up to the Oncologist - may need to put in a port at the same time) She said she has the most aggressive type of tumor - dr. called it a 3? Because it is an \"aggressive\" tumor and she is HER2+, the dr. said Mom will definitely need chemo and will be put on a medication for a year with radiation to follow. I asked if it could have spread to other organs and she said that was possible but that is why she has chemo. The dr. also said that the Oncologist may ask for scans of other areas if concerned... She sees the Oncologist on Friday. I left her with some questions to ask, but suggestions are welcome. It was really hard to leave, but we found her a wonderful cancer support group and Mom's friends, neighbors and co-workers have been very supportive. Any suggestions for what she might need during Chemo? As always, thank you for \"listening\". You are all in my prayers. ValT",

      "Content": "just got a call from my mom. She met with her surgeon today and it seems that she is now categorized as a stage III - the MRI shows the cancer has gone three cm and she is Her2+, although I still don't understand what it means but she mentioned she will have to be put on a special medication(?). She asked if this \"positive\" is good or bad and the surgeon said it is a positive as it can easily be treated\u0085doesn't sound like much of an answer. She is still going with a lumpectomy and honestly it makes me nervous but she's a grown woman and can make her own decisions. Her surgeon told her that she may need to go in for a second surgery in just days of the first; I guess if she doesn't get clear margins. I leave in two days to meet her at the hospital and take her home for recovery. I'm hoping to get better information when I can get in there for myself.",

      "Content": "My mom (59, pre-menopause) was just diagnosed with Stage II BC w/ lymph nodes involved after finding a lump during a self-exam (about a 2 cm). She was very good about getting mammograms, but it was missed \u0096 I'm seeing now that is not uncommon. She is going to have a MRI to see if the cancer has spread this week. Her surgeon is telling her that she can do a lumpectomy and a full mastectomy is not necessary \u0096 she said survival rates are basically the same. This doctor also said she would have no problem with the use of her right side right after surgery, will leave the hospital the same day as the surgery, will need 16-18 weeks of Chemo, and another 6 weeks of radiation. I'm feeling like the info doesn't add up, but have not been through this myself. I am going to a seminar tonight about BC treatment options \u0096 I want to be as informed as possible. I live across the country (I'm in CA and Mom and the rest of the family are in IL) and the whole family is looking to me to make sure she is getting the best care. I've asked my mom to get a second opinion but she doesn't feel it is necessary. I am coming in for a week post-surgery to help out as I was told this is when she would need me most \u0096 is this right? Can anyone give me suggestions as to what kind of care, food, etc. she will need during this time? Any information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",

After reading the posts here, I realize I have more information I need to get in order to completely understand her situation. She has not had any surgery, only an ultrasound and biopsy of both the tumor and lymph nodes. The doctor told her at the biopsy procedure she was 99% sure it was cancer, which surprised me. We got the confirmation a few days later. This is when the doctor told her the other info about the MRI (scheduled for 8/4), surgery (scheduled for 8/12), and the chemo and radiation to come later. I know she is taking hormones for menopausal symptoms and has been told to stop, but I don't know if that makes her hormone positive. I will definately more questions so I can be more prepared for tonight's seminar on treatment. Again, thank you so very much",
