    "Content": "Hi So sorry this delayed your chemo. Can I ask a couple of questions? How long post op were you when the wound opened? and did they do a wound swab? Lastly do you have a breast care nurse? How large is your wound now? I am a practice nurse in the UK and we often see similar, and my main comments would be - why are you being left to pack your own wound and secondly twice a day? Unless active infection we dont change daily, as a wound takes 24hrs to recover back to a optimum healing environment after a dressing is done. So again, has a swab been done post antibiotics to see if any residual infection left? Wound packing is quite specialist and we dont let a health care assistant do it, as we feel that the wound needs to be accurately assessed at each dressing and appropriate packing material and amount put in, is used in conjunction with a secondary dressing. Packing too tightly can delay healing. I am sorry that I really have just really left you with more questions, but hopefully it should give to ammunition to go back to your surgeon. Hope all goes well and let me know what the outcome is Shelly",
