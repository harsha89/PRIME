    "Content": "My mother-in-law is eighty-five and had breast cancer about twenty years ago. She recently disclosed that she has cancer in her other breast (undiagnosed) but hadn't told her children and wasn't going to do any thing about it. The upshot is that now two months later she has a lump in her throat which has finally sent her to a doctor. He took a biopsy and and the results will be back Christmas Eve wrote \"probable CA\". Is this a normal length of time for a biopsy? I have talked with the family about advanced directives and hospice care. What else can I do? They are in the south and I live in New York.",
