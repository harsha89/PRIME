    "Content": "Hi, I am 78 and had a modified radical masectomy of left breast 4 years ago. I also have COPD, coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, a recent heart inmplant and am on numerous meds. I would do the masectomy again today in a heartbeat. I am sending you a private message with more info re: my case and reasons for my decision. Only you can decide what is right for you. Excellent Drs. are of prime importance and if you or your daughter have doubts, consider a second opinion and second Drs. viewpoint and recommendation about the surgery. I think there are many of us older women with cancer but wonder how many post here? I just found this site after learning recently I may have a metastes to my hip. All good wishes and many blessings. ritanl4",
