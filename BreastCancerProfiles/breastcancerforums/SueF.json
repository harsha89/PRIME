      "Content": "Dear Friends, I cannot stress enough the importance of talking with a genetics expert prior to deciding for or against genetic testing. Cancer genetics is an area of medicine which is rapidly evolving--and it's difficult for nonexperts--every physicians and oncologists to stay up-to-date on the informaiton. I strongly encourage anyone concerned about hereditary cancer or considering genetic testing to make an appointment with a genetic counselor. You can find a genetic counselor through the National Society of Genetic Counselors at http://www.nsgc.org even if you have decided not to have genetic testing, a genetic counselor can make sure that you can get the best follow-up care. And FORCE is an organization devoted to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer--feel free to peruse our resource guide and message boards. Most of the women at our site have had genetic counseling and/or testing and are happy to share their experiences. Hope this helps. Warm regards, Sue",

Cancer in both breasts *could* be a sign of an hereditary cancer syndrome. You might want to request a referral to a genetic counselor. You can find one through the National Society of Genetic Counselors at: http://www.nsgc.org I'm so sorry that you are dealing with this. I'm 8 years out from my diagnosis. I have a BRCA2 mutation it turns out. Feel free to e-mail me at: [email protected] Warm regards, Sue",

FORCE: Facing Our Risk of Cancer is a national nonprofit organization devoted to individuals and families affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.

At FORCE we always recommend that women who are concerned about their hereditary risk see an expert in cancer genetics--that is a genetic counselor.
