      "Content": "I'm mid-way through my chemo treatments and seriously interested in going to a Mexican clinic after treatment for detoxification and immune strengthening. I spoke with the wife of a man with a terminal cancer who went to Sanoviv http://www.sanoviv.com/ for quality of life improvement and it really did help him and they were very happy. I'm wondering if anyone here has had any experience with any of these clinics and results either way. Yes, I'm big on wholistic treatments and currently use a ton of supplements, Chinese herbs and acupuncture, all approved by my oncologist. Thanks! Mindy",

Yes, I am working with Barbara - she's amazing! I'm actually leaving for Hawaii for two weeks on May 14th, so can't do that walk. I've never heard of Y-ME, so thanks for the information. I'll probably do the Komen Race for the Cure in October. I didn't do it last year, same month as my surgery, just couldn't bring myself to do it - but I did do it the previous two years. Mindy",

Wasn't enough for me.... the BC came back with a vengance after 2 years and I'm now just about done with chemotherapy (thank god!) and getting ready for radiation. I still work with the same awesome naturopath that I did from the start, but now it is primarily for supplement regimens. http://www.bouldernatural.com/ I also work with a fabulous acupuncturist/Chinese herbalist who does a ton of work with BC patients. My plan is to go to Sanoviv when all is said and done to detoxify and strengthen my immune system. Thank you for your support! Mindy",
