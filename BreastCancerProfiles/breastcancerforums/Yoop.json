      "Content": "\"Bump\" Wow, I posted this almost a month ago and no replies. . . . I'm really surprised as I thought the issue of bone metastasis happens frequently enough with BCa that others would provide some level of input. Is there anyone out here that can provide me with any level of information or experience? Did I word either the title or my first post incorrectly?",

      "Content": "Hi, looking for some help understanding what's going on with my Mom. 74 Y/O in phenomenal health, Dx'd with BCa in June 2012 at age 73; single mastectomy went very well, but 2 weeks later bone mets found in follow-up CT scan. Currently on Tamoxifen 20 mg. / day and a once a month injection of Xgeva. She recently ended up in ER requiring two blood transfusions due to anemia - hemoglobin count down to 6.? Can anyone out here provide me with more information on the whole bone mets / anemia issue? How serious is this? Or, is it just something that comes with the territory and can be managed? Could the anemia also be caused by the hormone / meds she is taking? Thanks so much in advance.",

      "Content": "O.K., my Mom just went in for another (her 2nd) blood transfusion. Is there no one out here that has any experience with this? Is there a relationship between BCa bone mets and anemia - hemoglobin count? Of course we are talking to her medical staff, but I'm really hoping for some input from anyone that has experienced this - PLEASE.........",
