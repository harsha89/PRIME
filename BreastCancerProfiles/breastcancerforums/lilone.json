      "Content": "I guess so basically this \"floating gene\" is something that cant be taken care of? thats sad. Shes so young. I dont understand though because shes already had the breast cancer and treatment for it, did it move to the cevix, then gallbladder spleen? this is been in a years time. Does that length of chemo sound ridiculous? or between you and I are they just \"doing what they can?\". I read where its nothing they can do in the link up there. Should they have given her option of no treatment do you guys think shes to that point? Shes a live wire believe me, she has so much to live for. In your opinion and I understand its opinion only, does anyone thing she will live a longer life with the chemo? I think she may die. I wont say that to her, but you guys I can. What can I do to help her? Thanks.",

      "Content": "my friends shes 27. she had breast cancer and had the mastect. chemo rad all that. it was also in her cervix she had hysterectomy. it came back spleen and gallbladder her test say the tumors were a stage 3. BUT they also say she has a mutation of the BRCA2 gene and that she has a \"floating gene\" in her and that it could \"land\" anywhere. OMG. They want to do 4-6 monthes of chemo only on her, 3 times a week. Shes very tiny shes weighing in at 102.6. shes lost her hair, her taste, but she tries very hard to eat. can someone explain this BRCA2? and this \"floating gene\" and is the prescribed treatment plan for her, does it sound right???? How can she stand such a long chemo treatment? (no radiation) they say they want to do the chemo for the floating gene. I'm understanding the prognosis for this type thing is poor???? Is my friend going to die? Will she be able to do this chemo plan? What can we expect? what can we do for her? OMG SOMEONE PLEASE ANSWER ME!!! thanks kristie",
