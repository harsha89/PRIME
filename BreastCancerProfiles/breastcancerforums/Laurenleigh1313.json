    "Content": "Hello all. My mom got breast cancer about 12 years ago, which she fought with chemo, radiation, and a masectomy and went into remission. The cancer came back 2 years ago with a vengeance. It metastasized in her lungs, bone, and spine. The chemo and radiation did not help this time around, and the cancer slowly spread. Two weeks ago, they changed her to a different chemo, and when doing the routine testing before deciding on which type, they found a lesion on her liver. The doctor told her this chemo would get rid of the lesion and she shouldn't worry. A week later, less than a week after the first treatment, she was in the hospital having 3 liters of fluid drained. (She also lost all her hair from this one treatment which she had managed to hold on to with the last chemo she was on.) 2 days ago, my father called me from the hospital to tell me they had just drained 5.5 liters more, and fitted her with a catheter so it could continuously drain. The doctor told them there is nothing they can do at this point and they would stop treatment and start hospice. The doctor told them she has 1-3 months. The next day, yesterday, hospice came to set everything up. It went from hopeful to hopeless in the course of minutes. I suppose she is not receiving treatment any longer, and the cancer is all over, that is why the time frame is so short. I see people that get ascites and recover from it, or at least live months to years. But that isn't the case here. What is it that makes them decide her type is so much more advanced than people who live for years with ascites? Should she get a second opinion? She is very sick, but does not seem like someone who is going to die in 1-3 months. Is she going to go downhill very quickly since stopping the chemo? Any help or honest insight would make me feel better. I feel so helpless and uninformed. My mom is 57, too young. I don't know the names of her cancer type or medication because she is very reluctant to discuss any of it with us. She even went to appointments alone without my dad up until a few months ago.",
