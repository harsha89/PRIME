      "Content": "I posted the above question on another forum, and I received the following reply. Does anyone here have any further thoughts about AC+T vs. CMF? \"You are correct that the clinical trials evaluating \"AC+T\" (Adriamycin and Cytoxan followed by Taxol) and \"TAC\" (Taxotere, Adriamycin and Cytoxan) are too recent to report 10 year results. In addition, neither of these regimens have been directly compared to \"CMF\" (cytoxan, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) but rather to other regimens that have been compared to CMF. It is, therefore, impossible to make direct comparisons of these regimens at 10 years. On the other hand, it is possible to estimate risk-reduction at 10 years using various statistical models and, indirectly, can get a sense of the approximate anticipated benefit of each of the regimens based on their performance at an earlier time period. The comparisons you have seen are likely using models to predict recurrence risk at 10 years based on the characteristics of the cancer and the relative benefit of the chemotherapy regimens as observed in clinical trials.\" Francis",

The first one offered CMF as an option and said that CMF was a very acceptable atlernative for my wife (2.7 cm; one node positive; ER/PR positive; grade 2 tumor; non-agggressive). The other onco was definitely more for AC+T, but said that CMF was reasonable, and she even said that hormone therapy alone was also reasonable. These oncos are very qualified and have a lot of experience in working with breast cancer. Its hard to know what to do, since the statistics do not directly compare CMF and AC+T. We will meet with the first onco soon to go over this again. We still have lots of questions. Thanks Muttsmom.",

      "Content": "My wife is 51 yrs. old. She was diagnosed on May 23, 2005 as having invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast. Combined Bloom-Richardson Grade of I-II. Estrogen and progesterone negative. HER-2-NEU positive. MRI showed size of tumor as least 3.4 cm. Tumor within 1 cm of prepectoral fascia. Blood work normal. Bone scan shows no sign of spread. CT PET scan to be done this week. We have seen two surgeons, one of which staged this as Stage IIa; the other would not offer an opinion on that yet. We've seen two oncologists, both of whom have suggested neoadjuvant chemo: one doctor suggested this primarily for breast conservation; the other seemingly more for treatment value (allows one to see if chemo is working etc.). After neoadjuvant chemo, it would be either lumpectomy and radiation or mastectomy. That is what I know as of now. Questions: 1. What other tests should we do at this time? 2. Is not doing chemo an option? 3. What benefit do we get from chemo as opposed to mastectomy w/o chemo? The statistics are hard to pin down. What recurrence or survival benefit does she get by having chemo for this type of cancer? 4. How quickly should we move to surgery or chemo? 5. Can a mastectomy be safely done given the 1 cm distance from the prepectoral fascia? Does this argue for neoadjuvant treatment to shrinh the tumopr before surgery? 5. Anything else I should be thinking about? Thanks very much. Francis",

The CMF choice also seemed to make sense for my wife since she is ER/PR positive, HER2-NUE negative, low Bloom-Richardson grade etc. Most of the systemic treatment benefit apparently actually comes from the hormonal therapy she will do after the chemo. Opinions can differ and all cases are somewhat unique, however, and I can understand why someone would go with AC+T or another type of treatment based on their doctor's recommendations. Best of luck to one and all who go through this. Your website is fantastic! Francis",

      "Content": "My wife had her mastectomy recently. Turns out it was a Grade 2 and 2.7 cm tumor; one positive node; ER/PR positive; HER 2 negative; all other tests negative (bone scan; PET CT). Other pathology looks good The onco feels that chemo is necessary, but that we can choose between AC+T or CMF+Aromatase inhibitors (no sure which one). We will probably choose CMF+Aromatase inhibitors due to the relatively lesser side effects. Two questions: 1. Does it make sense to use CMF+Aromatase inhibitors rather than AC+T? 2. Can we avoid the CMF and just use hormonal therapy by (e.g.) surgically removing the ovaries? Is this a sensible option? Thanks, Francis",
