    "Content": "Hi Cindy, If you dont mind me asking, where do you purchase maitake mushrooms, melatonin, and cat's claw? And what dosages are you taking them at. There are many sites on the internet and im worried that i would be caught in the wrong hands. I also wanted to know what do you use naturally to promote COX2 inhibitors, anti-angiogenisis, anti-tumor proliferation, anti-inflammation. My mother was diagnosed with Cancer, im trying to find out as much as i can to help her. Thankyou, Tony Originally Posted by Cindy Hi momof5. I take numerous herbs and supplements. I have all negative receptors and, therefore, after chemo and rads, there was no other treatment for me. I had a bad, aggressive cancer, so I am doing whatever I can to help myself. Docs thought I would have reccurred by now, but so far... so good, thank you God. This is just PART of what I take. I am almost too ashamed to list everything, it is so much. I pay attention to things that are natural, for the most part, COX2 inhibitors, anti-angiogenisis, anti-tumor proliferation, anti-inflammation, etc. There is a strong suspected connection between body inflammation and cancer. Inflammation is a natural response to tissue disruptions, in the body. It is when inflammation starts firing out of control that problems are caused. I seem to be getting carried away, here. I could go on and on. Some of the stuff I take: curcumin, maitake mushrooms, astralgous, cat's claw, nettle, IP6 (with inositol hexaphosphate), green tea caps, ginger caps, oregano, parsley, cayenne pepper, rosemary, L-theanne, milk thistle, vit D, calcium, ibuprophen or demethicin 2-3 times, per week, B12, sea kelp, chelated boron, CLA, aloe vera, selenium (together with vit E), CQ10, melatonin, raw garlic (chop, let sit 15 min and swallow, with water. I do it at night and by morning, there is no odor), acetly L-cysteine, grapeseed extract, etc. I also eat red grapes, with seeds and eat the seeds. Also, I incorporate plenty of omega 3's into my diet. I very rarely eat meat, due to the anachodric acid it has, which fuels cancer. I love meat, but I mainly eat fish and veggies, with a little cheese (which also contains AA). Cancer loves glucose and at one time I was doing so well to keep glucose out of my diet (body also makes its own), but I fell off the \"eating well\" wagon and got out of control. I have regained my composure and have been good for 2 weeks. I also eat raw broccoli, red cabbage, tomatoes, brussel sprouts, etc. I just got an electric sprouter for Christmas and will begin sprouting lots of good stuff. I could go on and on, but I think I written too much. Take care of you. Cindy",
