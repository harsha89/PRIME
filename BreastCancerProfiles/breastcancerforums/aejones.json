      "Content": "thanks paul. yeah, at this stage in my mom's cancer, she is VERY skeptical and generally unwilling to look into conventional medicine. my dad underwent chemo, as well as her brother, and i think this is why she doesn't want to do it. she has told me that even if she were to do it all over, even if she dies soon, she would not get a masectomy. i think she is too weak to undergo this kind of treatmeant now anyways, and she hates most of the doctors we've spoken with, but i will try to get in touch with someone who uses both methods, it's just hard because we live in a small town with not many options. hopefully she'll be able to move with me to california soon, and she will have more options there. thanks again",

      "Content": "So, my mom (53) has had breast cancer for awhile now. I am 21 years old and of course she's trying to protect me like her little girl, her only child. I moved away to go to college 3 years ago, when I didn't think the breast cancer was that bad, she never really discussed it with me and I don't even think I knew she had it for a few years. Well now, it is \"beyond stages\" as she says. She still doesn't tell me anything. My cousin just told me that it metastesized to her liver a few months ago, and I don't know what to do. We had a conversation about her telling me the truth about things when I found out a doctor had told her she had 3-6 months to live (6 months last November, so she's past her \"deadline\" thankfully). She said she would tell me everything, but she hasn't. In some ways, I feel I have a right to know. She came to live with me for a month after this whole deadline thing, and she didn't mention anything, not even that it was getting worse. So I could have been hundreds of miles away, and my last immediate family member could have died (my father passed away from colon cancer when I was eight). She lost a lot of wieght since October, she now weighs under 100 lbs, (at 5'2''). Basically, I just need some advice. I've moved home to help her out, maybe sell the house so she doesn't have to worry about it so she can come live with me and I can continue with my education, or move with her sister in Mexico. I don't know if I should confront her about the cancer spreading or not, because maybe she has her own reasons for keeping it from me. However, even if she's only keeping it from me not to worry me, that is exactly what it is doing, and I can't get it out of my mind that my mother may die soon, and I'll have no idea when to expect it. After cancer spreads is it still 'heal-able'? She's taking the alternative route. She's in pain every night, and a once strong optimistic woman that I knew has become somewhat frail and depressed. I know I am helping, just by being here, but I feel helpless and alone. Any help would be great. Thanks.",
