    "Content": "Hi, I saw this and thought I would reply. marijuana is effective for boosting your appetite. I am a marijuana smoker. If she has never smoked it before And you try it. Only have her take 2-3 hits off of it. The reason I say this is if your body isn't used to thc less is more. The first time you smoke will be stronger than any other time. If you smoke on a regular basis your body \"increases \" the amount you need To get high. If you are still unsure check webmd and mayoclinic for further Information. Hope this helps",
