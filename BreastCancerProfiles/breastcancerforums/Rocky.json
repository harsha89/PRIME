      "Content": "I am concerned about my wife. She is 33. After 2 biopsies (4 and 5 tissue samples were taken) she has been diagnosed with a breast cancer (most likely stage 1 or 2). This happened around the end of June 2005. She is refusing any conventional treatment and relying ONLY on ALTERNATIVE herbal treatments combined with strict fruit diet. A lot of what the ?herb guys? say seem to have a good reasoning but I really would like to personally talk to at least 6 people who have undergone purely alternative treatment and successfully gotten rid of cancer to feel comfortable with what my wife is about to do. Are you out there? Do you know anyone that claims treating breast cancer without surgery and radiation or chemotherapy? THANK YOU",
