      "Content": "as I've read at [link deleted by admin] it tells that MRI can effectively detects breast cancer. How's about that? is that an ordinary MRI test or \"another thing\" of MRI?? I'd like to ask about the symptoms of someone who's gonna get breast cancer beside the benign, since she (my fiancee) is already have it.. I am very concern about her complaining about her pain at all over her body, especially at her chest, mostly the left one. sometimes it felt burning, she said. And I can see her face getting skinny around her eyes and cheeks... is that a symptoms??? does anyone have that experiences before?? I've reassure her to take a surgery, and she finally agreed with me.. but the problem is, she will take that after we've married (about next year). Meanwhile we just wait and see... but I'm afraid that's too late for taking an action regarding to her complains... but the other side of us tells us that it'll be okay, and there's nothing to worried about.. like the Radiologist told us to married as soon as possible, and having baby, because when she feeding a baby, the structure of her breast will improve and possibly the benign will disappear... hopefully... is that true? sorry if I wrote too much about my feeling... thanks for the replies. May God always bless you all...",

      "Content": "Hi, I need an information about mammograph, since in here (Indonesia) mammograph can only be taken after 30years old. is that true?? actually the problems goes to my fiancee... and I don't want to be late to take an action before it's too late... at January 2008 My Fiancee (24) was complaining about her pain at her waist and below the left breast. then I told her to check her breast and she found a lump at her left breast about 3cm upside the left nipple.. at Feb 2008 she went to doctor and the doctor suggest her to take an USG Mammae test and the result is she had a tumor / benign about 3x2cm, not just one but another 2 benign were also found at her right breast smaller than the left one. Shortly, the doctor said nothing to worried about since it just a benign / moderate tumor, and he'll see about it after 3 month later. assuming that there was nothing to worried about, then my fiancee decided to stop taking the test after 3month.. but after the 4th month she felt that pain again, so I insisted her to taking Mammograph to make sure whether is it fine tumor or it can be a Breast Cancer. then, we went to another hospital to take mammograph. BUT, the doctor said that they can't do the mammograph for her because of ages problem and said that mammograph is just for 30's or above. and I asked \"Why??\" as I know that in Japan many teenager do mammograph... and she explained that because below 30's the breast cells were still growing and the result of the mammograph will be blurred by it... IS THAT TRUE??? and then she suggest to take another USG Mammae test well, since I've already paid for the test, then we go through for it though.. and the result was a growing benign (about 2 - 3mm) at right breast and another is smaller (about 1-2mm) at left side. and the doctor confirmed that it just only a benign, there was nothing to worried about, it cannot to be cured unless it removed with surgery.. my question is, what should I do? convince her to take a surgery which she's very very afraid of??? or do a mammograph instead of surgery??? can a mammograph be obtained for her ages??? thanks for the helps!! God bless you all",
