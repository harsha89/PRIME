      "Content": "Here is a copy of an email I received from the Susan G Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. It is asking you to contact your congressmen and senators to get more funding for training of oncology nurses because there is going to be a shortage of these wonderful people. Anyway, the article is included below and here is the link to send your congressmen and senators a letter. http://komenpolicy.org/campaign/nurs...xiu554z55n65k? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oncology nursing is tough job that touches lives of breast cancer patients and their families in a profound way. I would know - I am an oncology nurse myself. I am also a volunteer for the Sacramento Valley Affiliate of the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, and I recently traveled to Washington, DC to talk to my Congressmen about the shortage of oncology nurses. Now I need your help. Right now, our nation is facing a dire shortage of qualified nurses, and these shortfalls are felt by patients as well as nurses and doctors. To make matters worse, our nursing schools do not have adequate faculty members to train the next generation of nurses. In honor of Oncology Nursing Month, please join me and write your members of Congress about this critical issue today! I have cared for hundreds of brave women and men, administering chemotherapy and helping them through its depleting and distressing side effects, relieving the pain, educating my patients and their families, helping survivors through the next phase of their lives, and providing end-of-life care to those who will not survive. It is hard to describe just how vital of a role an oncology nurse plays in delivering quality care. Just ask anyone who has faced this tough battle. We cannot wait - please take action today! The nursing shortage we are facing will only be solved by educating and training talented and compassionate people. That is why the Nurse Reinvestment Act includes a scholarship program for nursing students, grants to nursing schools, student loan support, and public service announcements to encourage more men and women to enter the nursing profession. Thank you in advance for your support! Mary Pare, Oncology Nurse P.S. Please forward this message to your friends and family!",

      "Content": "I am scheduled to have surgery on Dec 9. I am going to have a MRM on the right side and a simple mastectomy on the left. I have chosen to go ahead with the simple mastectomy on the left. There was a \"suspicious area\" and they were going to do a lumpectomy and then possibly have to come back and do more surgery if they found something...so I decided to go ahead and have the simple mastectomy done. Now my questions have to do with reconstruction. I have heard from a couple of people that had bad experiences but I want to hear the other side as well. I am only 40 years old and I live in Florida so that means being in swimsuits a lot. So I'm really considering this. My husband says it makes no difference to him as long as I'm ok. My surgeon recommended that I wait til after the initial surgery has healed and any radiation (if needed) has been done. So give me all pros and cons so I can make an informed decision. Thanks, Shelly",

      "Content": "Danielle, Sounds like your mom is getting good advice. I'm going through Chemo now and while it's not fun, it is doable. One suggestion Ihave is if they give her an option to get a port....get one!! It makes chemo so much easier....it goes a bit faster and they don't have to hunt for a vein. In my case, they couldn't use my right arm which is where my \"good\" veins are so the port was a saving grace. Another thign...if your mom has nausea after the treatments, call the doc....there are lots of meds out there and different things work for different people so they may have to try a couple of meds to get the right one. About the hair...I bought 2 wigs but have hardly ever worn them. I like the hats better. I have ordered hats and scarves from headcovers.com and they are good quality. They have wigs as well. Target and Dilliars are also a good source of hats. I started out with hats that covered more of my head but now, most of the time I just fgo out in a baseball cap. Your mom's oncologist should have info about where to get wigs locally....just ask.",

I did go ahead and opt to have both breasts removed, they had told me that I would need a MRM on the right. I am so glad that I went ahead and had both removed. I would imagine that they will have you do some sort of chemo since the cancer is in your lymph node. Also, you may have to do radiation and I was told to wait 6 months after finishing radiation to do reconstruction. Keep in touch andlet me know how you are doing. Shelly",

      "Content": "Hi, Your mom's diagnosis sounds a lot like mine. I had 3+ of 14 nodes removed and I was staged at 2A. I'm doing chemo right now. Just finished the adriamyacin and cytoxion portion. I had it every 2 weeks with a Neulasta shot the next day to boost my white blood cell count. I had the \"dose dense\" method because I'm young and \"healthy.\" Everything went fine. The first treatment I had problems with nausea but they adjusted my meds and the next 3 treatments were much better. Just make sure to call the doc if she has problems with nausea. They have lots of meds and some work better than others. I start on Taxol and radiation next. Radiation for 7 weeks and Taxol for a total of 12 weeks. Then Tamoxifan for 5 years or have my ovaries removed... Your mom will have days she feels good and will probably have days she feels bad. My motto is \"tolerate the bad days and enjoy the good ones.\" I'm beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel in my case and every time I go for a treatment....the light gets a bit closer and brighter. Good luck to your mom. Hopefully this time will pass by quickly and then it will all be a memory. She's lucky she has you in her corner. Blessings to you...",

My mom also had BC about 9 years ago and she lived there and had her surgery there. I did go for a consult there when I learned about my cancer. The doc I saw was wonderful!! But he was not on my insurance so he sent me down to Moffitt Cancer Center which is where I ended up. Good luck with selling the house and I'm praying for both you and your mother.

I think the treatment is similar regardless of staging although those at earlier stages may not undergo chemo and radiation. I know of people who are stage 3 and 4 who are years out from diagnosis...just as I know people who were stage 1, got treatment, then later had reoccurances and are now stage 4. Don't think because you are stage 3 that you are automatically worse off than anyone else. Also, some people will say that you are worse off with node involvement. I don't think people should make generalities. If anything, I think that stage 3 and 4 people and those with node involvement generally opt for more aggressive treatments. Each case is different.

      "Content": "OK...I've been going rounds about this topic as well. Here is what my surgeon and my onc. told me..... They both said that just because I have BC that doesn't mean that I have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene. There are more genes that can contribute to one's risk factor...these are just the ones that have been identified and can be tested for. And if I test negative, and my daughters and my sister test negative...that does not mean they won't get BC. And a positive test does not mean that they will get BC, it just increases their risk. They are already at increased risk simply because I had BC and at an early age (40) and also because my mom had BC at 52 (pre-menopausal). If I were to be tested and did have the gene I would want to consider whether to have my ovaries removed becasue this gene is also related to ovarian cancer. One more thing...this gene is more prevalent in women of eastern European descent....my onc. basically told me this test would be no good for certain ethnic groups. I'm not sure of where my ancestors came from, so that didn't really help me too much. I still haven't made a decision about it yet. Hope this makes sense....it's 3:10am and I can't sleep due to anxiety ( I think ) about my chemo tomorrow. It will be my 3rd AC treatment...only one more to go!!!",

      "Content": "Kristen, I've been awake all night so if I don't make sense please excuse me... My onco. told me about another lab called Myriad. Here's their website info -- http://www.myriadtests.com/provider/contacta.htm She said they would send out a test kit for you to take to your dr. and have the blood drawn and send back. They will also work with insurance companies to get approval. I'm considering getting the testing done because my mother had breast cancer at 52 (before menopause) and she has several cousins that have had it as well. Then I got it at age 40. I have a younger sister and 2 daughters (11 and 18 ). The 18 year old has already been to the gyn and he told her that she would need to begin getting mammos at age 25 and that she needed to be diligent about the yearly check-ups. I really don't know what more she could do if she found out she had the gene. Like you, if my test came back positive, I wouldn't hesitate about having my ovaries removed...but I'm older and have already had my children. It scares me to think of my daughters having to make that decision. And that brings up another dilemma... I know several people who have tested positive and have elected to go ahead with a bilateral mast even though there were no signs of BC. I'm sure this decreases their risk, but by how much??? I guess that's a question for the docs. Well, I'm running on empty and I have to go and get ready for my appt...maybe I'll be able to sleep right through my chemo...",

      "Content": "I'll just add my 2 cents... I did the Ac portion and am doing the Taxol now. The AC made me really sick the first treatment but they changed my nausea meds and the following times were much better. I had 4 treatments, 2 weeks apart, with a Neulasta shot the day after each treatment. I did feel really rundown for about 4-5 days beginning the 2nd day after treatment....so, I was a couch potato for a few days. Also, some foods that I really liked tasted horrible to me...ie. chocolate and beef. I did well with bland foods...potatoes and jello were staples for me during that time. My hair started falling out after 2 weeks. It's not so bad...much easier to get ready to go somewhere. My white counts never dropped. I am now doing the Taxol...I'm having 1 treatment a week for 6 weeks and 3 more every other week. I'm also having 34 rads. I have had 3 Taxol so far and I have not noticed any side effects to speak of. I do get rosy cheeks and a red nose for a couple of days...but I've not had any problems with nausea, fatigue or numbness in my hands and feet. I'ts not terribly fun but it is very \"doable.\" Just tell your mom to take it easy when she feels bad and let others wait on her. Also, call the doctor if she has nausea...they have other meds they can try. Try to look for positives....every time I went for an AC treatment, I dreaded it big time...but I just kept telling myself that I'm one closer to being done. Good luck!!",

      "Content": "MaryBeth, Hi. I had a similar experience...sort of...I had 3+ lymph nodes on the right side and I thought all was clear on the left. Then My onco told me that they had done a 2nd test on the sentinal nodes on the left and that a microscopic tumor was found...but nothing showed up anywhere in the left breast. Today, when I went in for my 4th and final AC treatment, I questioned him about it again....as far as if I needed any other treatment other than what I was doing....AC (4 rounds - dose dense) , then Taxol and radiation....and he said no. Anyway, I don't know if this helps you or not, I just thought I'd share my experience. The chemo is doable just make sure to ask for different meds if nausea is a problem. I suffered through 2 days the first round before I called my doctor and I should have called right away. They adjusted my nausea meds and thins have been going much smoother since.",

I had bilateral mastectomies as well. I asked what percentage radition would improve my odds against getting a recurrance....I forgot the exact number he gave me but it was enough that I decided to go ahead with it. BTW...I just finished up about a week and a hlaf ago. It wasn't too bad...the bi=ggest problem for me was having to be there every day...it was about a 2 hour drive...I ended up staying nearby but it was hard being away from my family for 6 weeks (during the week).

I had 3+ / 14 lymph nodes. The largest of which was 4 cm. But the doctor said he'd rather see fewer large nodes than many small nodes. One of the nodes had microscopic extracapsulary extension so that means radiation after chemo. Anyway, now that the surgery part is over, I'm beginning to think about the chemo part. And I'm dreading it big time!! I'm due to start in mid-Jan. Does anyone have any tips on making it easier?? I am mentally prepared for losing my hair...at least I think I am. I plan on getting it cut really short after my treatments begin. I have read so much on how this affects everyone and I hope I'm ready for that part. I especially am worried about the nausea part. Someone told me to bring a cooler with me and drink as much as I could while receiving the chemo to stay hydrated. Any other tips would be appreciated. Merry Christmas!! Shelly",

But they have many wonderful anti-nausea meds and they just need to find what works for your wife. For me, Decadron and Kytril worked like a charm. I had AC first and the biggest problem I had, other than the initial nausea, was fatigue. It usually started on day 2 after chemo and lasted a few days. I could function normally, it just took all my energy to do so. Other than that, food tasted funny. So far...with Taxol, I've had no problem at all. I know that all this is hard on you and I commend you for standing behind your wife. You will be the one that sees how bad she feels. Just be there....when she needs to cry, be there...when she needs to yell and curse, be there...when she needs a hug, be there. She will need you more than you realize.

      "Content": "Hello everyone, Well my surgery is overwith and the path report came back. They found the primary tumor in the axillary tail behind the lymph nodes, it was 1 cm. I had 3+ / 14 lymph nodes. The largest of which was 4 cm. But the doctor said he'd rather see fewer large nodes than many small nodes. One of the nodes had microscopic extracapsulary extension so that means radiation after chemo. Anyway, now that the surgery part is over, I'm beginning to think about the chemo part. And I'm dreading it big time!! I'm due to start in mid-Jan. Does anyone have any tips on making it easier?? I am mentally prepared for losing my hair...at least I think I am. I plan on getting it cut really short after my treatments begin. I have read so much on how this affects everyone and I hope I'm ready for that part. I especially am worried about the nausea part. Someone told me to bring a cooler with me and drink as much as I could while receiving the chemo to stay hydrated. Any other tips would be appreciated. Merry Christmas!! Shelly",

I called in for my appointment today and they gave me a 3:45 appointment and I was thinking that there would not be enough time for everything.

      "Content": "Loretta, I was diagnosed in November 04 and I know what you are going through. It's miserable knowing that there is cancer in your body. All I wanted to do was to get treatment started. Once you start, you feel like you regain some of the control because at least you are doing something. It's very normal to be scared. And every time you have a pain, you wonder if it's the cancer and it's moved. That will get a bit better. They will do all kinds of tests...bone scans, PET scans, MRIs and CTs...after a few tests that come back ok you will not worry so much. I did have family history. My mom had BC 9 years ago and is doing great. Nancy has a point...you should consider a mastectomy with your history. The surgeon really didn't give me the option of a lumpectomy because I already had node involvement, but immediately I asked about a simple mastectomy on the other side. The surgeon said he thought that was reasonable considering my age (40) and history. I decided to go ahead with it...I had no trouble at all making the decision, but it's something every woman has to decide for herself. I am going to do reconstruction when I finish all the chemo and radiation. My mom just had a mast. on one side and she has about a week's worth of worry every time she goes for a mammogram. She told me if she had it to do over she would go ahead with a bilateral mast....and she's even considering having the other one done now. Nancy....congrats on being NED!!! Sorry I didn't say something sooner. This is my \"good week\" and I've been out enjoying the beautiful weather and haven't spent a whole lot of time on my PC. I know you have been worried about it and I hope your mind is eased now. Enjoy the races!!",

I did the AC dose dense with the Neulasta and now I am doing Taxol and am getting the once a week dose because I'm also doing radiation and it is so much easier than AC!! My doctor has mentioned changing it to every 2 weeks after my rads are done, but this has been so easy, I'm hesitant to change it. I will be at dose 7 of the 12 of the Taxol when I finish radiation. It is my understanding that they double the dose every 2 weeks as opposed to every week so I'm not sure that it really matters. My doc was going to change it to make my travel time less...I have to drive about 2 hours to get there.",

      "Content": "Hi, Sorry you have to be here but this is a good place and has many great people who are willing to share their experiences with you. You can do this!!! You are already nearly finished with the AC part and to me that was the worst!! What is next? Do you have to do radiation? I did Taxol next with 34 rads at the same time. And let me tell you, I live 2 hours away from where I take treatments so when radiation started (it was every day) I stayed there during the week rather than driving 4 hours each day. And let me tell you, that was difficult!! It was especially hard on my 12 yo daughter. I missed almost all of her softball games and several school functions. Thank goodness I have family here that helped pick up the slack. I am very proud to tell you that I completed my chemo yesterday and I can't quit grinning!!! I am so proud of myself and you will get to this point too. It's not fun and it's not something we would have chosen to do but sometimes you just have to do what it takes and this is one of those times. You will emerge a much stronger person. Good Luck with it and one day soon you will be grinning too as you finish your chemo. Some things I've learned during all of this... --If you don't feel like doing anything, then just be a couch potato and don't feel guilty about it -- When you do feel ok, get up and do what you normally would do. -- If you need something, ask for it. There are people around us who want to help but don't know what to do...so it helps you out and also helps them to feel like they are helping you -- Keep your outlook positive, but don't feel guilty if you have a pity party now and then...you have earned it. By the way, a good website to learn about chemo drugs is www.chemocare.com",

ANd if you are still not comfortable, get a 2nd opinion. That's what I did and I'm so glad that I did. I actually ended up having the surgery the first surgeon recommended but with a different doctor. It does take some time but it's well worth it. I had my surgery about 1 month and 9 days after DX but that was partly due to the holidays. And I'm so glad I got that 2nd opinion...I found that I felt much more comfortable after the 2nd opinion and was much more comfortable with the 2nd doctor. I have never 2nd guessed or regretted my surgery and I feel that I got the best care available.",

      "Content": "I was just wondering...some people tend to have a great attitude where their health is concerned and they tend to look for the positive things....and others, well let's just say they tend to dwell on the negatives. I'm not talking about anyone here in this forum...this is mainly coming from people in my family who have other health problems. I'm just wondering if there have ever been any studies done on people's attitude towards being ill and their outcome. I have 2 cousins...sisters....both were struck with illnesses. The older was was diagnosed with MS at age 34. She just basically threw up her hands and said, OK...I'm done. She went on disability and has blamed everything on her illness ever since. Thing is, she's fine, she can do everthing that I can do. The other sister was stuck with an airborne virus (Can't remember the name of it...something myolitis) that affected 18 inches of her spine and basically paralyzed her. She was told by the neurologist that she would never walk again. She said...Oh no...I've got to, I've got 4 small boys....and she changed doctors. It took her a while but she is now walking, driving, etc. all to the amazement of all of her doctors. She does have to use a cane sometimes and she had to learn to drive with hand controls, but she's doing great. I just wonder if her attitude about the whole thing brought her through it and if she would have had the same result if she'd had her sister's attitiude. I try to keep a good attitiude about everything. When people ask me if I've been sick, I always say yes but I have my good days and I enjoy those tremendously. I always try to look for something good in every situation. Someone on another post referred to themself as \"polyanna\" but I think that's a great way to be. Beats the heck out of dwelling on the bad stuff!! Something just got me to thinking about all this...",

You are already nearly finished with the AC part and to me that was the worst!! What is next? Do you have to do radiation? I did Taxol next with 34 rads at the same time. And let me tell you, I live 2 hours away from where I take treatments so when radiation started (it was every day) I stayed there during the week rather than driving 4 hours each day. And let me tell you, that was difficult!! It was especially hard on my 12 yo daughter. I missed almost all of her softball games and several school functions. Thank goodness I have family here that helped pick up the slack. I am very proud to tell you that I completed my chemo yesterday and I can't quit grinning!!! I am so proud of myself and you will get to this point too. It's not fun and it's not something we would have chosen to do but sometimes you just have to do what it takes and this is one of those times. You will emerge a much stronger person. Good Luck with it and one day soon you will be grinning too as you finish your chemo. Some things I've learned during all of this... --If you don't feel like doing anything, then just be a couch potato and don't feel guilty about it -- When you do feel ok, get up and do what you normally would do. -- If you need something, ask for it. There are people around us who want to help but don't know what to do...so it helps you out and also helps them to feel like they are helping you -- Keep your outlook positive, but don't feel guilty if you have a pity party now and then...you have earned it. By the way, a good website to learn about chemo drugs is www.chemocare.com",

What I was saying was not that positive attitude was the only way to be....Lord knows, I have myself a pity party every now and then....but I do think that it's more beneficial, at least to me, to look for the good things rather than the bad. And some people really get bogged down in the negatives. I'm more of a positive person by nature and some people are just more negative by nature....nothing wrong with that, just the way they are. Believe me, I do sometimes feel sorry for myself, but I get over it in a bit and go on. I'm not saying being positive will cure it but it sure makes it easier to deal with.",

So far..this is it...as far as test results CT of the chest looks ok CT of the abdomen is not in yet Bonescan shows a spot on my left hip which could be anything from osteoporosis to arthritis to some sort of injury. They cautioned me not to get too excited about that til I hear more. I have had some pain there when riding in the car for long distances, etc but the nurse said usually cancer is more chronic. consistent, worse pain....and mine comes and goes.

Now here's my question....and I know I'm sounding paranoid here....my upper right arm has been bothering me. At first I thought it was a muscle problem now I'm not sure. When my doctor scheduled me for a bone scan, it really started to bother me. I'm wondering if it's all psychological. Now I'm freaked out thinking the cancer has spread to my bones. In my head, I know I'm overreacting but I just can't help it. ANyone ever have this problem?",

      "Content": "I was just wondering...some people tend to have a great attitude where their health is concerned and they tend to look for the positive things....and others, well let's just say they tend to dwell on the negatives. I'm not talking about anyone here in this forum...this is mainly coming from people in my family who have other health problems. I'm just wondering if there have ever been any studies done on people's attitude towards being ill and their outcome. I have 2 cousins...sisters....both were struck with illnesses. The older was was diagnosed with MS at age 34. She just basically threw up her hands and said, OK...I'm done. She went on disability and has blamed everything on her illness ever since. Thing is, she's fine, she can do everthing that I can do. The other sister was stuck with an airborne virus (Can't remember the name of it...something myolitis) that affected 18 inches of her spine and basically paralyzed her. She was told by the neurologist that she would never walk again. She said...Oh no...I've got to, I've got 4 small boys....and she changed doctors. It took her a while but she is now walking, driving, etc. all to the amazement of all of her doctors. She does have to use a cane sometimes and she had to learn to drive with hand controls, but she's doing great. I just wonder if her attitude about the whole thing brought her through it and if she would have had the same result if she'd had her sister's attitiude. I try to keep a good attitiude about everything. When people ask me if I've been sick, I always say yes but I have my good days and I enjoy those tremendously. I always try to look for something good in every situation. Someone on another post referred to themself as \"polyanna\" but I think that's a great way to be. Beats the heck out of dwelling on the bad stuff!! Something just got me to thinking about all this...",

What I was saying was not that positive attitude was the only way to be....Lord knows, I have myself a pity party every now and then....but I do think that it's more beneficial, at least to me, to look for the good things rather than the bad. And some people really get bogged down in the negatives. I'm more of a positive person by nature and some people are just more negative by nature....nothing wrong with that, just the way they are. Believe me, I do sometimes feel sorry for myself, but I get over it in a bit and go on. I'm not saying being positive will cure it but it sure makes it easier to deal with.",

      "Content": "Just came from my 2nd chemo treatment. I also saw my oncologist and he brought up something that I'd not heard before and my brain was apparently on vacation so I didn't think to ask about it. Here's the deal...I had MRM on the right and a simple mast with SN on the left. I was told that nothing showed up on the left side either in the breast or the SN. Today, my doctor said that there was another test run after the biopsy....said he wasn't sure why because it's not commonly done....anyway he said there was \"staining\" which indicated there were cancer cells there. He did say that they were not able to be seen with a microscope or they would have been picked up in the biopsy. So my question is...will the chemo take care of these cells or is there something else I should be doing? Should radiation be considered for this side as well? What exactly does this mean to me? I'm going to dig out my path report and find out exactly what he is talking about...if I can figure the stupid thing out. Thanks for any info you can give me.",

      "Content": "Rachelle, My mom had breast cancer as did many of her cousins...and my grandmother on my dad's side. I was diagnosed at age 40 with BC and have been going through treatment for the last several months. I have also been advised to get the genetic testing done...mainly for my daughters, one is 18 and the other is 12. The doctor told my 18 y/o to get a baseline mammogram done at age 25 then get one each year after that. He also told her to do the self exams each month and if she ever felt something was wrong, get i t checked out. So my advice to you...be diligent about monthly self exams. And get regular mammograms. I found my lump myself and it was a lymph node under my arm. Nothing ever showed up in the mammograms, ultrasounds or the MRI. In fact, they didn't find the primary cancer til they did the pathology after surgery. If you ever feel something is not quite right...get it checked out. As far as the genetic testing...that's your decision to make. I haven't made a decision yet...but I'm considering how it would affect my daughters and my sister...they all already are at increased risk and are taking the steps needed. So I'm not sure about it. Good luck!! Good Luck and try not to worry until you have something to worry about.",

Be proactive...talk to people, do research, find out everything you can and then set yourself up with a positive attitude an keep positive people around you for support. As for the notebook....That has been a lifesaver for me. I actually have 2...a larger one at home and a smaller one that I carry in my purse. Info to keep in your notebook... -meds you are taking -all of you doctors info - list of questions for your doc....add to it as you think of quetions - list of all appointments, tests, etc and numbers to call for results, etc. - friends phone numbers and emails... - in the larger one at home keep all test results and info. Emailing everyone to keep them up to date has also been a great help to me. It makes me sit down after appts and such and organize my thoughts and feelings. I tend not to hold back so my friends probably know al ot more than they want to....but everyone appreciates being kept up to date. Keep up your spirit and go do something nice for yourself to tke your mind off things for a while....do some shopping or treat yourelf to a manicure. People, even people you don't know will end up being a great help to you....talk about how you are feeling...people will come out of the woodwork to offer support. Thanks for thinking of me on Monday....I'll let you know how things go. Take care and God Bless!! Shelly",

Everyone else has done a great job of answering your questions so I'm not going to repeat everything. Just wanted to let you know this, if you do lose your hair, you will feel every draft in a room and ceiling fans will drive you nuts unless you have som ething on your head. I bought a wig but only wore it once, I felt much more comfortable wearing a baseball cap...just do what feels right for you. And, about gettin g your hair cut before it starts coming out....I had long hair before and I hated the hair in the drain on a normal day, I couldn't imagine more of it...it would be hard for me to see. So I got a hort haircut and the day my hair started coming out (2 weeks to the day after my first AC treatment) my husband buzzed it off. It ws hard seeing those short stubby hairs everywhere...I can't imagine it if all of that hair had been long!! All of that being said...It's just hair. I know it's hard to imagine now but you will get though it. Just think...no shaving your legs, no drying and styling your hair. I could get out of bed and be ready to head out the door in about 20 minutes. And when it comes back in, it's sooo soft, you'll love it!! Good luck!!",

I've only had 1 surgery and I'm tired especially at the end of the day so I know what you mean about being tired. Just out of curiousity...didi you have to do any chemo? I'm due to begin that in about 2 weeks. Happy New Year!! Wishing everyone a great 2005!",

      "Content": "Hey everyone. It's been awhile since I've posted...hope everything has been well with all of you. I thought I was on the downhill slide of this thing. I had started reconstruction and everthing was going great. Then headahes started. I'm giving you the short version because the long one would bore you to tears...Anyway...after a quick exchange of expanders for implants so an MRI could be done - Thanks to my wonderful docs working me in so quick!! - They found that I have 3 brain lesions. I am currently at Moffitt undergoing all the regular tests to see if spread elsewhere. Had the bonescan and CT chest/abdomen yesterday...should get results later today...hopefully no other spread has occurred. Anyway, scheduled to have surgery Monday to remove the first 2 of the brain lesions which are on the front right side...then another surgery a couple of days later to remove the 3rd on which is on the back left. Then whole brain radiation. No chemo unless spread elsewhere is detected. Just wanted to ask that you keep me in your prayers for good results today. Thanks!!",

I am 40 years old and have a wonderful husband and 3 children (Katie is 18, Ryan is 16 and Jessica is 11) I was diagnosed on November 1 2004 from a biopsy of a lymph node under my arm. They were unable to pinpoint anything else to biopsy so as of now, I don't know exactly which type of breast cancer that I have. I do know that it is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive. I had surgery on December 9th...MRM on the right and simple mastectomy on the left. The MRM on the right was what the surgeon recommended and the simple on the left was my choice. I'm doing well...just wish I could get a good night's sleep. I go back for the post op follow up on Monday the 20th so hopefully I'll know more then. I will update as soon as I know something else.

But don't take everything you find on the internet as fact...ask questions...keep a notebook to take with you to the doc and write questions down as they occur to you because you will forget them otherwise....take someone with you to your appointments...2 sets of ears are always better than 1.

      "Content": "Hello everyone, I just needed to sit down and write everything out so that I can deal with it. Hope you guys don't mind. I'm going in the morning for another biopsy. I'm not sure why they are doing another one because they are already sure that I have cancer and I'm having surgery next week. MRM on the right and a simple mastectomy on the left. Anyway, the answer I'm getting is that the biopsy was done on the lymph node and they want to find the primary site. They have pretty good idea where the primary is. Anyway, I figured they could do all that at the surgery but I think that's just because I don't like needles and I'm trying to make it easier on me. My surgery is scheduled for next Thursday, the 9th. And the closer that day gets, the more nervous I'm becoming. I know this may be a silly question, but when you wake up from mastectomy surgery, do you miss them?? I know that I'm doing the right thing and I know that I will deal with it, but I'm just wondering. I also have a bunch of questions about chemo. I'm hoping they will wait til after Christmas for that. How long after surgery do they typically begin chemo? I'm already getting worried about losing my hair. I know that's a small thing in the big scheme of things but still.... Anyway....trying to take one thing at a time.... Shelly",

I cannot remember the exact figures but the radiation oncologist gave me a percentage cahance of recurrance both with and without radiation. There was enough of a difference to make me not question whether to have radiation. If I were you, I would get an opinion from another radiation oncologist. It would always cause me to wonder if I didn't. Good luck!!",

I normally sleep on my side or my stomach and that just isn't possible right now. I did ok in the hospital but the bed was shaped kind of like a recliner. Last night was my first night at home and I really had trouble sleeping. I'm thinking the flat bed was the problem. My husband is moving a recliner in tonight in case I need it. Does anyone have any other suggestions? I'm really not having too much trouble with pain...just that stinging sensation every now and then. I don't like taking pain meds but I'm thinking I might take them at night so I can hopefully sleep. Anyway, I'm doing really well. Didn't even shed a tear after surgery. I was worried about how I would feel afterwards, but all I felt was relief. My husband was wonderful and my kids are handling everything well. I have to go back on the 20th for a post op check and to see an oncologist. I'm hoping they will wait til after Christmas for chemo. I can't imagine them starting it that soon after surgery. Hope everyone has a Merry Christmas!!! Shelly",

Will I need anything special at home after the surgery? I had my biopsy today. They were originally planning to biopsy both sides but they were unable to find anything on the right other than the lymph node that had already been biopsied, so they just did the left. When I asked about that, they said that the primary tumor may possibly be hidden behing my lymph node in the axilla tail (I think that is what they called it). The lymph node is swollen so big that they cannot see what is behind it. Anyway, because of that lymph node, they are 99% sure there is cancer in the right breast. Surgery is scheduled for next Thursday. I'm just ready to get it overwith. Shelly",

My onco said if there was anyone in my family that had ever had ovarian cancer, I should strongly consider this option. I am not good at remembering to take meds every day and I don't really want to have to do that, plus the side effects of the meds. Anyway, I'm still weighing my options.",
