    "Content": "With permission from the moderators I am now able to post my site. I urge you all who are being offered this drug in any form to insist on getting tested for several genetic mutations that can prevent you from metabolizing the drug. The results are beyond life threatening and very torturous. You may visit my site to see what the test looks like and are welcome to add comments. You should also try to spread the message out and report any adverse reactions to the FDA. I feel it should be mandatory to get tested before you get treated since there is now a test for this and a very cheap one. www.fu-fda.com",
