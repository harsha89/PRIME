      "Content": "Hi There, I've found tamoxifen to have very minor side effects. I've been on it for 7 weeks and initially had a lot of hot flushes which eased gradually (and significantly after I changed brands). I'm documenting my experience here: http://pinkandapple.wordpress.com/ I wish you all the best with your journey, and hope your body deals with tamoxifen easily. It didn't take me long to get used to it. PA",
