      "Content": "Originally Posted by brainman kkc, I am very sorry about your health concerns. I totally agree with Vee... especially since this mass appeared so rapidly. Tumors take time to grow. But until you get the biopsy results back, you will not know for sure what it is. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Thank you, brainman and Vee Smith. I get the biopsy results back today. When I checked this morning, the cyst (or whatever it was) was not nearly so big, so it must've been an infection (I'm on 1000 mg of antibiotics a day). Only, now I've got red welts all over my chest and upper back. Maybe they're an allergic reaction to the antibiotics. I took documentary photos for the doctor...lately, the only self-portraits I've been taking seem to involve rashes and lumps. What a glamorous life I lead. Oh well. (I first took a photo of the breast lump in my hotel room in GuangZhou and then ordered room service -- after the boy delivered my meal, I realized I'd left the camera on with my boob on full display...right where he put the food. At least it wasn't a close-up.) Anyway, thanks again very much for your replies.",

      "Content": "Hi, I'm 39 and pre-menopausal. This morning I had a mammogram, ultrasound and five core biopsies. This was due to a large mass that appeared overnight a week ago on the outer, bottom half of my right breast. About the time it appeared, my pelvic lymph nodes also seemed to go crazy -- I felt like there was a belt under my skin. After less than a day, that swelling receded, but not the breast lump. The breast lump was originally accompanied by a painful, burning sensation, but after three or four days, the pain disappeared, except for an intermittent, sharp pain crossing from my underarm to the top of my right breast. The skin was and still is red above the lump. My right axillary lymph node has also been enlarged for about five months. Since early May, my right side has also hurt in the manner of a muscle ache, though I don't recall doing anything that would have caused this. The doctor said the mammograms and ultrasound indicate that the large lump (and another that they found) are benign cysts -- the big one seems definitely to be water-filled. He said they were only doing the core biopsies to be sure. He also said my right axillary lymph node looked normal, albeit enlarged. I asked him if it were normal to have lymph nodes swell up with a benign cyst (as my pelvic nodes did). He said not really. (I was also very sick to my stomach a few days before the lump appeared, and my face swelled up and got blotchy. This disappeared in about a day.) I am wondering if all my symptoms are unrelated and harmless. I've had nausea off and on for the past six or eight months, but then, I also moved to England about a year ago, so maybe it's stress. I also occasionally now get little clusters of red dots on my skin. But, that could be allergies. I do tend to get skin rashes with many products. I should get the results from the core biopsies on Friday. Has anyone had any experience where their lumps looked benign in the scans, but they still had cancer? Also, if the core biopsies turn out good, should I just relax and forget about this? Thanks very much. KC P.S. My mom had breast cancer and died of non-hodgkins lymphoma. Her sister died of ovarian cancer.",
