      "Content": "I've been dx with Stage IIIA Invasive Ductal Carcinoma. I've been through 4 rounds of DD AC and 4 rounds of Taxol. On July 2 I had a double mastectomy. In a few weeks I'll begin six weeks of radiation. At the time of the mastectomy, the surgeon removed a large section of tissue that should have included additional lymph nodes, but none could be found. He said the radiologist checked thoroughly and assumed none could be seen because they were covered with scar tissue from the sentinel node biopsy in February 2008. He said it's highly unlikely that I didn't have nodes in that area, but he didn't feel it warranted additional surgery and didn't feel it would change my prognosis. Has anyone else experienced a situation like this? Does that mean I don't have anymore lymph nodes on that side? Also, my pathology report reads that extensive angiolymphatic invasion is present and perineural invasion is present. Does anyone know for sure what that means?",

      "Content": "Thank you for replying. I must admit I had a very hard weekend. Seems like all of my pathology points to bad stuff. The report even mentions there was an adjacent DCIS tumor next to the IDC when it was removed. I feel like if this had gone much further, I wouldn't be here. I can't help but wonder now if there are other tumors developing. I try not to be afraid, but I am. Is there any kind of test a doctor can do to see if there are anymore lymph nodes on that side?",
