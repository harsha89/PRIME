      "Content": "Rick, The grape and watermelon, from what I have read are good. Especially the grape or grape seed extract. My understanding is that they should be red grapes or red grape juice. They contain resveratrol, which helps enhance the P53 gene activity. The P53 gene is what the body uses as a defense in the body to cause apoptotic death of cancer cells. The P53 gene first tries to repair mutated cells. If this is unsucessful, it causes to bad cell to die. If the P53 gene itself becomes mutated (which is often the case in some types of cancer), it allows the cancer cells to grow. The resveratrol in the grapes enhances the P53 gene's activity. This is an example of an alternative or nutritional agent actually working and knowing why it works. Melatonin, selenium, and PSK also enhance the P53 gene. In the field of conventional medicine, some of the the most successful drugs in the most recent trials work by actually injecting P53 genes into the tumor using a virus as a vehicle. MD Anderson has a lady in one trial that has survived over 5 years with stage IV NSCLC on one of these drugs. Cauliflower, broccoli, and onion are normally considered good in a cancer diet. Maybe the diet she is on has been found to work better without anything else. I don't know. The watermelon contains lycopene which is supposed to help fight cancer. The thing that I think you may find most interesting and encouraging is that the research that I have done on these foods and minerals has mostly been done on the PubMed/NIH site or at least confirmed there. This is the same place that doctors get reports on conventional medical trials etc. There are many things that are known to improve the state of a cancer patient. In many cases the mechanism by which they work is scientifically known. Often what is not known is how they will work together. The possibilities are that they will: 1) work in an additive fashion 2) work in a synergistic fashion where the effect is greater that the sum 3) Interfere with one another For example, it is known that grapes and PSK are both good, but what if you take both? I don't know who knows. It would take an expensive trial of every combination to find out. The companies selling Tarceva pills for $100 a piece can afford to find out things in big trials. People selling grape seed exract pills for less than a dollar a piece cannot afford to find out. That's why I don't know if the cauliflower will help or hinder her present diet. The same is true of conventional treatments and agents working with one another or alternative agents. After my own experience, I can understand your Wife's refusal to take chemo or radiation therapy. The side effects can be horrible, even deadly, and they can make you sick. They can also cause problems to appear in years. The surgical option is less clear to me. It is easy to understand why somebody would not want to be cut on and disfigured. It is also possible that the surgery will be unsucessful or have complications. But at least in conventional medicine, surgical treatment of cancer has the best cure rate. It is usually reserved for stage I or II disease. If your wife's cancer progresses, the surgical option will be lost. Please forgive me for rambling on, but after what happened to my wife using conventional medicine, I would like to do anything I can to spare others of this ordeal if I can. On the other hand, if someone has been helped by conventional medicine, I am happy for them. In our case, the conventional treatments were foisted on my wife when there was no hope of cure without telling us. If there is a chance of cure, then at least there is a risk/benefit ratio to weigh.

With all of the cautions on radiation overdose from too frequent mammograms out there, I am amazed that no one specifies where or what the specific danger is. There are so many warnings with no explanation of what bad things can happen. Why? Since there is no physical shield to the rear of the human breast, what is to keep the radiation from going into the thorax? Have any actual studies been done? If so, where are the results? As far as I am concerned, this is very serious business that deserves much more attention, and a reasonable explanation to the public from the medical profession. Mike",

I don't undersatnd what anyone's own doctor would know about a general case as compared to the medical community as a whole. What I am getting at is the fact that each mammograph machine puts out a particular radiation patern. This pattern may be influenced by the technican's setup, the internal and external adjustments and calibration of the machine as well as dosage/time settings. Most explanations of my question (when they can be found) readily state that one risk is that of getting breast cancer. Since there is little (if any) information available to the public on the radiation pattern(s) involved, it begs the question, for example, can this procedure wind up exposing the lungs since they are in very close proximity to the breast. Likewise for the stomach, esophegus, gall bladder, thymus, or pancreas. Mike",
