      "Content": "Many thanks for all your replies which have really helped me and made me feel less paranoid. I have more or less made up my mind to have a mastectomy on the other side and your comments have made it even firmer. I have a consultation with my Plastic Surgeons on 20 December when I will find out my ongologist's comments to them about a second mastectomy, which could be very revealing, and then I will make my final decision. Last chemo tomorrow then start of mega get fit programme as want to go skiing 2 - 3 times next year (to make up for no skiing this year) starting February when radiotheraphy should have finished. Currently praying for a really cold winter and plenty of snow in the French Alps! Once again many thanks for comments and support. Fan",

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with cancer in Feb 04 and had a LWE 2 weeks later. When I went back for my results, I was told that I had to have a mastectomy, chemo and radiotheraphy because I had Grade 3 multi-focal invasive ductal cancer and although they had removed the tumor (3.2cm) they didn't think they had got all the cancer. There was also lymph node involvement. After discussions with Plastic Surgeon, it was decided to do mastectomy, lymph node clearance and reconstruction (tram flap) at the same time. I had initial operation on 2 Apr, another on 3 Apr and then on 17 Apr reconstruction was removed due to infection. I spend a total of 30 days in hospital because I also managed to pick up MRSA! The pathology report from mastectomy was a surprise as it showed I had extensive widespread invasive lobular cancer (one 2cm tumor, a couple at 1.?, and another four or so at 0.?mm - I can't remember exactly how many or size) which nobody knew was there! It also showed that some lymph nodes had been infected and one had grown a tumor - although I don't understand the differance and would appreciate any info about this. Next week I am having my last cycle of chemo, taking December off from treatments and having radiotheraphy in January. I have talked to my ongologist about having a mastectomy on the other side as lobular cancer tends to come on both sides and I have multiple cysts on that side. He advised me that I could still get primary cancer on that side and made no comment when I asked if it would reduce the risks. I got the distinct impression that it was felt that there was a good chance that I would be back with more cancer. I have been positive and have not let cancer rule my life although it sometimes feels as though I live at the hospital and have worked the whole way through and taken the minimum time off work. I am still working a little from home although technically on sick leave as I have been admitted to hospital 3 times recently and spent most of October in hospital. Now I'm in a quandary about whether or not to have a mastectomy on the other side and medically it seems that the jury is still out. Has anyone faced a similar problem?",
