      "Content": "So a member in my family (47 F) came back from surgery (Getting fluid out of her stomach) and hasn't been the same since. She is super skinny, her stomach however is huge, and she is always dazed, sleeping constantly, not eating and not exercising. I want to feed her lots of homemade healthy vegetable and fruit juice and help her exercise but I have two problems that I hope someone can help me about: 1) Is it okay to feed her lots of juice (she won't touch hard foods) even though she has excess fluid in her stomach? 2) I'm afraid if I take her outside in the winter she will pass out or something, what can I do to help her exercise and gain some muscle? Please, please help, thank you",

Right now the best thing I can do is feed her as much as I can because she is looking like she's going into the anorexic phase, but she has a swollen belly because of fluids and she also pukes, do you still think it's a good idea to try and fill her up with calories?",

She is super skinny, her stomach however is huge, and she is always dazed, sleeping constantly, not eating and not exercising. I want to feed her lots of homemade healthy vegetable and fruit juice and help her exercise but I have two problems that I hope someone can help me about: 1) Is it okay to feed her lots of juice (she won't touch hard foods) even though she has excess fluid in her stomach? 2) I'm afraid if I take her outside in the winter she will pass out or something, what can I do to help her exercise and gain some muscle?

She is super skinny, her stomach however is huge, and she is always dazed, sleeping constantly, not eating and not exercising. I want to feed her lots of homemade healthy vegetable and fruit juice and help her exercise but I have two problems that I hope someone can help me about: 1) Is it okay to feed her lots of juice (she won't touch hard foods) even though she has excess fluid in her stomach? 2) I'm afraid if I take her outside in the winter she will pass out or something, what can I do to help her exercise and gain some muscle? Please, please help, thank you",
