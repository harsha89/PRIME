      "Content": "hello all Ive had an eventfull week and I'm confused by so many things. My family has a cancer history that makes me wonder if my grandparents lived in some type of toxic waste dump. Anyway, 3 of my paternal aunts had breast cancer but my sisters seem to universally be assured by there docs that we are not at an increased risk because it was paternal. Well my sister had bc last year and I was diagnosed this week. Considering that we now have a 30% cancer occurrance does anyone know of a good site where I could enlighten my sisters? Ok I know worring about this is a distraction but right now i need a distraction",
