      "Content": "I totally understand how your sister feels. There are many of us who feel this way and many of us are happy to be a bit overweight as that DOES give us a buffer if relapse occurs. I am 10 kilos overweight. If I try to lose some I also stop as weight loss to me also equates to wondering if it is the cancer. It may seem silly to some but those who have not been through it can never truly understand. She does not see it as a problem so it isn't. Of course there are many problems associated with obesity though and she should be guided by her doc. I do understand how you want to help in any way as you love her. My advice is to back off and to drop trying to make her do what YOU feel is best for her. It may turn into resentment too. Five years...fantastic!",

      "Content": "Hello. I am sorry to hear about your diagnosis. It is very common (and human) to feel that any abnormality like a cough or pain means that it has something to do with the cancer. Most often it is just a cough or a pain. Hang in there, mention it to your Doc too as it is worrying you. We do know how you feel. You are not being a hypochondriac. Even when people are in remission we can feel that things that happen means it has returned too and most times we find that it hasn't. Good luck with your treatment and my best wishes to you.",

I also can only imagine what thoughts are running through your head as to how you would feel. I have \"daughter\" who is not biologically mine. She calls me Mum number two. She is your age. If she used me as a sounding board, if she was faced with your situation I would tell her that her breasts don't make her the woman that she is. That it was so much more important that she could be around for many many years. That I could empathise but not understand what she is feeling as I have not been through it but I loved her and her husband and children love her for who she is. I hope that someone will be along who is /has undergone what what you are facing. I want to welcome you to our forum and mention that our coping and support board is a wonderful safe place to vent, cry, let feelings out and with our different time frames as we are a multinational forum there is usually someone around.",

Remember this is your cancer, your breasts and your life and whilst taking in all opinions medical or how your mother or others feel you really have to make the decision that is best for you and not to question yourself based on what others may think.You have seen 2 Oncologists who advise the same thing. It is YOU who has to deal with the decision you make and hopefully have no regrets either way on what treatment you decide on. My personal feeling is, that if I was confronted with this and had to make a choice then I think I would be going the same route as you and have the double for my own peace of mind.

Excellent that you didn't have unnecessary chemo treatments and then had to switch. You aren't left to rot even though you may feel like that at the moment and no one can blame you for feeling like that either. They are doing their best to find out exactly what is wrong and what the best treatment path will be. Please keep us updated. This board is not one of the busiest here so don't forget our coping and support board is here for you to use as well, should you wish time. In the meantime, hang in there.

      "Content": "Hello and welcome to the forum but I am sorry you had to find us. I have no experience with her type of cancer. Unfortunately there are no crystal balls. No one, not even the Doctors can adequately predict time lines as everyone's cancer journey is different. Her Doctor may be able to answer the question if the timing has changed from if to when though and hopefully this will help you with your decision. I feel your pain with the distance factor. My mother was in a different state and 1500kms away. She, like your mum had great people around her and my sister next door. My sister kept me well in the loop. Mum's Doctors said that she would recover from the radiation side effects that had her in hospital. My sister reckoned otherwise and I flew up there and had 5 days with her before she passed. If your relationship is good with your father and Aunt then I would be getting updates from them as they are so close to the everyday care.",

Excellent that you didn't have unnecessary chemo treatments and then had to switch. You aren't left to rot even though you may feel like that at the moment and no one can blame you for feeling like that either. They are doing their best to find out exactly what is wrong and what the best treatment path will be. Please keep us updated.

      "Content": "Hi Mindy. Welcome to the forums but I am sorry that you have the need to find us. None of us here can answer your questions either. Only your oncologist can give any advice on that. I hope someone comes along who has experience of this but what you have to keep in mind is that everyone reacts differently to drugs etc. I don't have your kind of cancer so I can be of no help. Wouldn't it be wonderful if our Doctors and we had a crystal ball, eh? It is so frightening just not knowing or not being able to get straight answers but sometimes there are none and we have to wait and see.",

      "Content": "Hello. Welcome to our little corner of the world. It is great to have support when we need it but we can not demand it. During my chemo I purposely sent my hubby off fishing for a few days as I felt he needed to forget cancer existed and he could just relax without worrying about me. I guess we all handle it differently but at the moment you are not sure if you are having chemo or not and are fighting about the wedding. Would you be fighting about the wedding if no cancer is involved as well as you say you do not get on with his family? Are you invited and would you go? Getting his measurements sounds like he is a member of the bridal party. He was there for you through the mastectomy so you would assume he would be there for you doing chemo as well. Being there does not mean every minute of every day. The carer also needs to look after themselves, have time for themselves, do some activities that they enjoy so that they can indeed care for us when we need it.",

      "Content": "Hi there. I am so sorry you are going through all this. It is such a horrendous time not knowing as tests are done and a diagnosis, if any, is made. All the what ifs just run amuck in our heads. We can all empathise with that one. You are doing the right thing getting the tests to see what is wrong. Comparing symptoms though is pretty useless as so many are also symptoms of other things much less serious than cancer. Googling symptoms too can just make us freak out more. The time to research is after you have been given a firm diagnosis. Google well then, sticking to reputable medical sites so you can become informed as much as possible. Write down any questions you may have and take them to any appointments you have. That way nothing will be missed. In my opinion, if nothing much turns up on the mammogram I would ask for a CT scan which should then hopefully put your fears to rest. Good luck and best wishes.",

Ditto a PubMed search for diindolemethane and breast cancer. So So lal Technologies has a point, right? Wrong. If you examine the PubMed searches, what you will find is that virtually all of the studies that come up are preclinical. They\u2019re either cell culture studies in which investigators put the extract on cells and measured various markers of apoptosis or cell growth and found indications that these compounds inhibit the growth of breast cancer cell lines, or they are animal studies. There are a handful of human studies, but they are pretty much all biomarker studies like this one, which is a biomarker study that looked at surrogate markers for breast cancer risk over the short term and do not show that taking these compounds long term as a supplement actually measurably decreases the risk of breast cancer in normal, otherwise healthy women.",

I believe it is a cell that just mutates for some reason. Some people who exercise, lead vegetarian and vegan, macro dieting lives also get cancer. To me what matters is going forward. I do promise it gets easier once your focus turns to treatment and hopefully ridding yourself of this horrible disease. I, personally have no knowledge of this cancer and I hope someone will be along who does. Our coping and support forum is busier too than this part and it could be of help to post there for support. Only you can make the best decision for you. As a woman who has not faced what you are facing but who knows it could possibly happen, I too would be inclined to have both removed after I had found out all I needed to about it. To me, my life is much more important than pieces of tissue. My best wishes to you.",

      "Content": "hello. I am so sorry you are having these worries. Can't get seen till next year? Can you phone around to get seen sooner? I have no idea where RI is or what your medical system is like. Maybe someone will be able to suggest something to you. Be aware that lymph nodes rise to do their job which is fighting inflammation and infection. If the nodes are in the same region this would indicate that this could be the cause. I hope you can get to see a Doc sooner. Meanwhile, this may help with your worry. Good luck and please keep us updated. Causes of Lymphandenopathy. Although the finding of lymphadenopathy sometimes raises fears about serious illness, it is, in patients seen in primary care settings, usually a result of benign infectious causes. Most patients can be diagnosed on the basis of a careful history and physical examination. Localized adenopathy should prompt a search for an adjacent precipitating lesion and an examination of other nodal areas to rule out generalized lymphadenopathy. In general, lymph nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter are considered to be abnormal. Supraclavicular nodes are the most worrisome for malignancy. A three- to four-week period of observation is prudent in patients with localized nodes and a benign clinical picture. Generalized adenopathy should always prompt further clinical investigation. When a node biopsy is indicated, excisional biopsy of the most abnormal node will best enable the pathologist to determine a diagnosis. The cause of lymphadenopathy is often obvious: for example, the child who presents with a sore throat, tender cervical nodes and a positive rapid strep test, or the patient who presents with an infection of the hand and axillary lymphadenopathy. In other cases, the diagnosis is less clear. Lymphadenopathy may be the only clinical finding or one of several nonspecific findings, and the discovery of swollen lymph nodes will often raise the specter of serious illness such as lymphoma, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or metastatic cancer. The physician's task is to efficiently differentiate the few patients with serious illness from the many with self-limited disease. This article reviews the evaluation of patients with a central clinical finding of lymphadenopathy, emphasizing the identification of patients with serious illness. Definition The body has approximately 600 lymph nodes, but only those in the submandibular, axillary or inguinal regions may normally be palpable in healthy people.1 Lymphadenopathy refers to nodes that are abnormal in either size, consistency or number. There are various classifications of lymphadenopathy, but a simple and clinically useful system is to classify lymphadenopathy as \u201cgeneralized\u201d if lymph nodes are enlarged in two or more noncontiguous areas or \u201clocalized\u201d if only one area is involved. Distinguishing between localized and generalized lymphadenopathy is important in formulating a differential diagnosis. In primary care patients with unexplained lymphadenopathy, approximately three fourths of patients will present with localized lymphadenopathy and one fourth with generalized lymphadenopathy (Figure 1).2,3 ......and more follows. http://www.aafp.org/afp/1998/1015/p1313.html",

Seeing the doc who would have had the results from your surgical biopsy would be the best. If this is not possible I would let your new doctor know so they can contact him/her for the results, maybe asking for this to happen before you have the appointment so you will know if anything was found a year ago. Write down your timeline of symptoms that you have, along with any questions you have so nothing is missed in the consultation. Good luck and best wishes.

      "Content": "Hyperthermia is a promising way to improve cancer treatment, but it is largely an experimental technique at this time. It requires special equipment, and a doctor and treatment team who are skilled in using it. Because of that, it\u0092s offered in only a few cancer treatment centers in the US and Europe. Many clinical trials of hyperthermia are being done to better understand and improve this technique. For instance, the use of nanoparticles and the induction heating of magnetic materials that are implanted into tumors are some new types of hyperthermia that are under study. And researchers continue to look at how hyperthermia is best used along with other cancer treatments to improve outcomes. Studies are also looking at ways to reach deeper organs and other sites that cannot be treated with hyperthermia at this time. Current studies are looking at how it might work to treat many types of cancer, including the following: Bladder Breast Cervical Endometrial Head and neck Esophagus Kidney Liver Lung Leukemias Melanoma Neuroblastoma Ovarian Pancreas Prostate Sarcomas (soft tissue cancers) Thyroid For more information about clinical trials of hyperthermia, contact the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237) or visit the NCI website at www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials. http://www.cancer.org/treatment/trea...s/hyperthermia",

At this time I have a nodule on my thyroid. Ultrasound suspected that it is benign but my doc just wants to scan an possibly biopsy to rule out possible malignancy. I like the diligence with that. You also have to realise that someone with similar ultrasound findings may have indeed proved to be cancer where another will not be shown to be. This may help you with terminology. http://www.mondofacto.com/dictionary/ My reading of your report and I am not a doc, says there is something there but no idea what it could be with the US results. \"1.1x0.6x0.8cm. It has no diagnostic characteristics and its aetiology is uncertain.\" This waiting for results and more tests is very hard. We have all had to do it. Not fun.",

This forum is multi National and I hope that if someone is reading these forums who is in the same position they may post too so they won't feel so alone either. We have hundreds reading here daily. My Husband had a lump in his breast but it was benign. There isn't a lot of talking going on about males and breast cancer but it happens a lot more often than we think it does. We have a busy coping and support board should you wish to post in there too which has a great supportive crew. My best wishes to you and your parents.",

You will still need to be staged before a treatment path can be made. Hang in there. This is the worst time.

      "Content": "http://www.quackwatch.com/01Quackery...urzynski1.html I am so very very sorry that your hopes were dashed so much. So many alternative cancer treatments are designed to part people who are desperate for any hope from their money. Stanislaw Burzynski and \"Antineoplastons\" Saul Green, Ph.D. Unlike most \"alternative medicine\" practitioners, Stanislaw R. Burzynski has published profusely. The sheer volume of his publications impresses patients, but unless they understand what they are reading, they cannot judge its validity. To a scientist, Burzynski's literature contains clear evidence that his data do not support his claims. Burzynski's Background and Credentials Burzynski attended the Medical Academy in Lubin, Poland, where he received an M.D. degree in 1967 and an D.Msc. degree in 1968. He did not undergo specialty training in cancer or complete any other residency program. His bibliography does not mention clinical cancer research, urine, or antineoplastons during this period. In 1970, Burzynski came to the United States and worked in the department of anesthesiology at Baylor University, Houston, for three years, isolating peptides from rat brains. (Peptides are low-molecular-weight compounds composed of amino acids bonded in a certain way.) He got a license to practice medicine in 1973 and, with others, received a three-year grant to study the effect of urinary peptides on the growth of cancer cells in tissue culture. The grant was not renewed. In 1976, with no preclinical or clinical cancer research experience, Burzynski announced a theory for the cure of cancer based on his assumption that spontaneous regression occurs because natural anticancer peptides, which he named antineoplastons, \"normalize\" cancer cells. Since urine contains lots of peptides, he concluded that there he would find antineoplastons. Less than one year later and based only on these assumptions, Burzynski used an extract from human urine (\"antineoplaston A\") to treat 21 cancer patients at a clinic he opened. His shingle read, \"Stanislaw R. Burzynski, M.D., Ph.D.\" Burzynski's claim to a Ph.D. is questionable. When I investigated, I found: An official from the Ministry of Health in Warsaw informed me that when Burzynski was in school, medical schools did not give a Ph.D. [1]. Faculty members from at the Medical Academy at Lubin informed me that Burzynski received his D.Msc. in 1968 after completing a one-year laboratory project and passing an exam [2] and that he had done no independent research while in medical school [3]. In 1973, when Burzinski applied for a federal grant to study \"antineoplaston peptides from urine,\" he identified himself as \"Stanislaw Burzynski, M.D, D.Msc.\" [4] Analysis of Antineoplaston Biochemistry Tracing the biochemistry involved in Burzynski's synthesis of antineoplastons shows that the substances are without value for cancer treatment. By 1985, Burzynski said he was using eight antineoplastons to treat cancer patients. The first five, which were fractions from human urine, he called A-1 through A-5. From A-2 he made A-10, which was insoluble 3-N-phenylacetylamino piperidine 2,6-dione. He said A-10 was the anticancer peptide common to all his urine fractions. He then treated A-10 with alkali, which yielded a soluble product he named AS-2.5. Further treatment of AS-2.5 with alkali yielded a product he called AS-2.1. Burzynski is currently treating patients with what he calls \"AS-2.1\" and \"A-10.\" In reality, AS-2.1 is phenylacetic acid (PA), a potentially toxic substance produced during normal metabolism. PA is detoxified in the liver to phenylacetyl glutamine (PAG), which is excreted in the urine. When urine is heated after adding acid, the PAG loses water and becomes 3-N-phenylacetylamino piperidine 2,6-dione (PAPD), which is insoluble. Normally there is no PAPD in human urine. What Burzynski calls \"A-10\" is really PAPD treated with alkali to make it soluble. But doing this doesnot create a soluble form of A-10. It simply reinserts water into the molecule and regenerates the PAG (Burzynski's AS-2.5). Further treatment of this with alkali breaks it down into a mixture of PA and PAG. Thus Burzynski's \"AS-2.1\" is nothing but a mixture of the naturally occurring substances PA and PAG. Burzyski claims that A-10 acts by fitting into indentations in DNA. But PAG is too big a molecule to do this, and Burzynski himself has reported that PAG is ineffective against cancer [5,6]. PA may not be safe. In 1919, it was shown that PA can be toxic when ingested by normal individuals. It can also reach toxic levels in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU); and in a pregnant woman, it can cause the child in utero to suffer brain damage. Burzynski has never demonstrated that A-2.1 (PA) or \"soluble A-10\" (PA and PAG) are effective against cancer or that tumor cells from patients treated with these antineoplastons have been \"normalized.\" Tests of antineoplastons at the National Cancer Institute have never been positive. The drug company Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals could not duplicate Burzynski's claims for AS-2.1 and A-10. The Japanese National Cancer Institute has reported that antineoplastons did not work in their studies. No Burzynski coauthors have endorsed his use of antineoplastons in cancer patients. These facts indicate to me that Burzynski's claims that his \"antineoplastons\" are effective against cancer are not credible. For Additional Information Office of Technology Assessment Report (1990) Limits Placed on Burzynski's Cancer Treatment (1998 news release) The Antineoplastin Anomaly (Burzynski's \"Clinical Trials\") About the Author Dr. Green (1925-2007) was a biochemist who did cancer research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center for 23 years. He consulted on scientific methodology and had a special interest in unproven methods. This article was adapted from his presentation at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry Symposium in Atlanta in July 1997. References",

It just does your head in. All here can relate to that. It really is best not to try and second guess the path that your Oncologist will take. Consulting Dr Google also can just scare us silly as we don't know yet. The time to research your guts out is once you have had all the tests and know where you stand. I can totally understand needing to know NOW and wanting it gone especially as you have the kids to worry about. I do not have breast cancer so I can give you no opinion.

      "Content": "Hello. I am so sorry that your Mum and you are facing all this. Your questions are ones that should be put to her doctor. We can not answer them and it would be pointless to hazzard guesses as we are not doctors. We don't know what the tests will reveal. I know this is a terrible time of fright and wondering about all the what ifs. Even with the time expectancy of any terminal cancers (I am not implying that your mother has terminal cancer) the Doctors do not have crystal balls and neither do we that can determine survival time as everyone is different and reacts differently to any therapies too. The best that doctors can do if pushed is to give a rough guess from statistics and their own experience. Don't get to far ahead of yourself thinking the worst case situation as you both do not know any of the answers yet as to what is going on. Good luck and best wishes.",

      "Content": "Hi Courtney and welcome to the forum. I am sorry that you are in this horrible time between tests and diagnosis (if any) Researching the net before we know what is happening with us can just scare us more. I hope so much that when you get your results that you can tell us that everything is ok. In my opinion the nurse overstepped the mark by giving her opinion that the node is suspicious. She has caused you much anxiety especially if you get benign results.. If you do have a cancer diagnosis then there are many people here who will be supporting you. Good luck! Hugs from Australia.",

      "Content": "Hello Kirsten. This forum is for cancer sufferers, their loved ones, carers and friends so you are in exactly the right place. I can understand your confusion as she seems so well and active at the moment. A crystal ball would be handy, wouldn't it but none of us or the doctors have them and it is so hard wondering. Has a second opinion been sought? My advice is to continue as you are doing making every day count. Help her to do anything on a bucket list that she feels she wants to do. Make sure when the time comes that you have no should have, would have or could have regrets. Our coping and support board here will be able to give you support too and as we are from many countries someone is usually around 24/7. Hugs from Australia.",

      "Content": "They are considered as alternative therapies..not complimentary. This forum is for those who choose conventional. There are a lot of complimentary treatments that can be added to chemo, surgery and radiation but the alternative ones are not discussed here as they are unproven by scientific studies. If you are contemplating any, google any science behind them, not anecdotal stories. You and your wallet will be much healthier. The usual warning we give is that if you are in treatment, please run anything else you wish to take by your Oncologist first as many can interact badly eg antioxidants and chemotherapy. Of course everyone is free to do as they choose but other forums out there promoting the alternatives may serve their interests better than this one. Some people do not like this but this is THIS Forum's focus.",

There are lists there of alternative treatments shown not to work by cancer centres. If you friend chooses to go the alternate way then there are many forums out there that support that.. Her life path of doing all the \"right\" things to avoid cancer shows that cancer is indeed indiscriminate and good healthy habits don't mean that it won't happen. I suggest that you do your research on the legitimate government, medical sites..for example Pubmed. Here are a few that I hope will be of help. http://www.quackwatch.org/01Quackery...cs/cancer.html http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/20...than-medicine/ http://scienceblogs.com/insolence/20...ersus-reality/",

It is up to the individual. A normal well balanced diet is the way to go. A dietition can help you out with that as well as any special needs. Housework..depends if she is bedridden or just normally up and around as everybody else. There are no guidelines on this either. Whatever she feels she can do and if she can do it.. As you say you want to know how to help fighting this cancer then she is still facing challenges with it? After someone has cancer they have to get used to their \"new\" normal. I am glad the doctor is seeing her and these questions of yours should be asked of him/her as the doc knows your mum, knows her situation where as none of us here do as we don't know you.",
