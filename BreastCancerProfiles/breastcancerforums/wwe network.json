    "Content": "I was wandering if chemo stops pain..I got spots on my spine, at first before I went to the hospital my lower back, an hips were hurting sooo bad. They then done 10 treatments of radiation, about 4 days after my last treatment the pain was gone. So I asked my radiation Dr to do radiation on the other spot tht is causing my upper back to stop throbbing, but my oncologist wanted to start chemo, it upset me, bc thts the only spot left tht hurts..each treatment was only 4 minutes. So if theres anyone out there tht has metastasis breast cancer an chemo made a night an day difference in your pain, please give me insight on it. My first chemo treatment is 12-12-14..its a very mild one, ill only have to take 2 rounds, then hes putting me on non-chemo..so glad, no side effects at all.",
