    "Content": "I'm hoping someone can shed some light on something for me. In 2000, I had a large benign tumor (3cm) removed from behind my left breast, located on the rib cage. In 2005, I had a papilloma removed from my left breast as well which showed severe atypia. I found a lump about 3 months ago in the right breast in roughly the same location as the one I had removed in 2000. I figured it was the same thing, but in the last month, it has become so painful that I cannot wear an underwire bra because of the pain. The pain lasts all month so it's not associated with my cycle. The lump has changed a bit too. It's gotten smaller and went from a hard lump to a soft mass type thing. Any ideas what the heck is going on? Any help would be appreciated. THANKS!!!",
