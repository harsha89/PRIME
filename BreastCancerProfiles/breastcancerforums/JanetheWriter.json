    "Content": "Hi Papillon1, If your consultation is anything like the one I had (although mine was with with a certified genetic counselor), he or she will review your family history form and discuss each person who has been affected by cancer, including the type of cancer, age of diagnosis, and, if the person is deceased, the cause of death. He or she also will review basic genetics (dominant genes, recessive genes, and things you may recall from high school when/if you studied Gregor Mendel and his experiments with peas). The genetics professional probably also will discuss BRCA mutations with you and, based on your family history (including if family members are already known to be BRCA positive), discuss your specific lifetime risk of being diagnosed with breast and/or ovarian cancer. The genetic counselor also may touch upon various options available to you if you test positive for a mutation. These include heightened surveillance and/or prophylactic surgery with various options for reconstruction, if you choose to have a prophylactic mastectomy. You likely will then be given the option of being tested for a BRCA mutation, which can be done using either saliva or blood. The test results take several weeks to come back from the one laboratory/company in the country that performs these tests. At that point, you probably will return to the office of the genetic counselor to receive your results. In the meantime, if you want to learn more about BRCA mutations and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, the FORCE website is a great resource Link removed as per forum policy. Please read the rules for new members. FORCE, which is an acronym for Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered is the only organization devoted solely to individuals and families affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and its website is full of information, resources and support that you may find helpful. Good luck with your consultation, ~ JanetheWriter",
