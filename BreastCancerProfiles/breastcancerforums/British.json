      "Content": "Hello, I was in the process of searching information about tissue expanders and came across your site. I have read the postings with interest and would like to be on board also. I had a lumpectomy in 91 with radiation and here I am 13 years later with re-curring breast ca. I elected to have a bi-lateral mastectomy because I don' t want to do this any more. I had the sentinel node dissection done and there was no sentinel node found so they removed a few nodes to be safe. I have tissue expanders in and will start expansion next week. I have found this whole thing quite uncomfortable expecially the side that was previously radiated. I am now on anti-biotics for infection. When I saw the plastic surgeon she said I cannot use antiperspirants. Have any of you been told that? When researching I also found that parabens are thought to be a bad thing with breast ca. Do you know anything about that? I have to say only prayer has brought me through this. I am so looking forward to getting the next surgery over.",

No nodes were involved thank God but am starting chemo tomorrow. I am terrified. Is this normal? Is it horrible? Are there really good day? Any thoughts will be so appreciated. Prayers even more so.
