      "Content": "Hello all--This is my first time to post--anytime, anywhere so bear with me. My husband introduced me to this forum (he posts under SPOKE) so I thought I would visit. I am an RN who has worked at M. D. Anderson Hospital in Houston for 14 years with Leukemia pts.(10 years ago) and now I have worked as a Hospice nurse for the last 2 years and in March was diagnosed myself with Breast Ca (stage 2,Node1,met0). I am currently receiving chemo (adria,cytoxan-4th course next week). The interesting thing is that until now I haven't wanted to get on the computer or really investigate too much--compare or further educate myself--too much to wrap my mind around at once. But I feel OK right now and would like to talk to other women going through the same thing. In fact tonight I'm needing some encouragement. I look forward to talking to you all and pulling for you too.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Muttsmom Just buy her a new computer of her own If she's like most of us, there's a lot of cat napping when you go through chemo and she'll probably find herself up late and up early and napping on and off. I still have problems with sleep. I think my body got use to not sleeping through the night, it doesn't know how to anymore. BUT, the dogs and cat remember all to well what time breakfast comes, so no matter what time I fall asleep, I'm up by 6 to a cat on my chest and one dog staring me in the face........LOL Keep us posted on what kind of chemo she'll be getting and hopefully we can give her some pointers. No doubt she's a compassionate lady working with cancer patients, but I'm sure she feels like a fish out of water when she's the patient. Most onco's consider the day of surgery, when the visable cancer is removed as the beginning of her living with NED (No Evidence of Disease) and some even the dx date so even though it doesn't feel like it, she's kickin butt already Is she getting AC and then Taxol or Taxotere or 4 rounds of AC only? I noticed that she had node involvement, how many nodes were cancerous? I had 9 and my onco said they would have treated me the same way, very aggressively even if I had fewer nodes or for that matter in my case, no nodes since my tumor was so large. If you or Karen are up late at night and need to talk, just send me an e-mail and there's a good chance I'll be on line or it won't be long. Hugs and prayers to you both. First of all, let me thank all of you for such a warm welcome! Muttsmom, let me try to answer your questions. I've received 4 courses of AC and now, this wek will start Taxotere and Xeloda(clinical trial--oral 5FU) for 4 courses. Two sentinal nodes were pos. and none of the axillary-- so 2/9 nodes. Tumor was 3.5cm. The grade was 2. I'm 48, premenopausal, with a strong family history( my Mom and her sister). So I'm a high risk accd. to my Doc. One thing I'm struggling with right now is \"should I have had a mastectomy instead of a lumpectomy?\" All my Docs assure me that there is no difference between mastectomy or lumpectomy plus radiation. But I keep worrying about it. During my last course of chemo I am going to have genetic testing done. If I have either one of the brca genes I'll have a decision to make about a double mastctomy or just frequent MRI's. Does anyone have any thoughts or info about these issues? Sorry it took me awhile to respond but I was really ssick after the last course of AC--thank goodness that part is over and I'm halfway thru the chemo. Thanks for all your thoughts! Karen",
