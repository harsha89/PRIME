    "Content": "Originally Posted by kdennis421 She's 37 and I can't believe she won't make it to May (her 38th birthday). I just feel so bad. It's not fair. I'm scared for her and her boys and I feel so bad. Thanks, Kristin Yes it is unfair, makes all of us feel bad to see a friend or family member struggle with the battle of cancer. I moderate a group called the Merkel Cell Cancer group at Google Groups for a very rare and incurable cancer. Each us is facing a long difficult battle to keep our spirits and heads up every day knowing that at some time we will have to face these same issues. Many of our members have said that it is often easier for them to accept all this versus their friends and family members who have a more difficult job of adjusting and accepting what will be. The same things you are facing for your friend may be the very denial and wanting to barter with the powers to be over this moment of mourning that is ongoing for you and her alike. George",
