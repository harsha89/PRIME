    "Content": "my mother had breast cancer 6 years ago and has been recently diagnosed with 'breast cancer cells in bone marrow HOWEVER it has not metastatized from the breast tumor???? The doctor said he has only seen 1 other case like this, it could have been there before the tumor in her breast even appeared. Has anyone else ever heard of this and if they have what type of prognosis is there? the doctor would not say because this is so rare. They are starting her on chemo very soon and said it was just a wait and see how things react to the chemo treatments. thanks",
