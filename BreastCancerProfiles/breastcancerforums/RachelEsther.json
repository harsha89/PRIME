      "Content": "Hey there! I do not envy you having a choice in all this - what a difficult decision! But I do URGE you to make you decision AS IF chemo had no side effects, or only minimal ones. Chemo is temporary. Chemo will be over. Your hair, if you lose it, will grow back. You will lose your \"normal\" life to some extent for a while. But it WILL be over. I did really great on chemo (4AC+4Taxol, every 2 weeks), never any nausea, and few other side effects besides fatigue, although some women have a very tough time of it. But it is OVER at some point. You can search this board for more info, or go to my site (www.xanga.com/bcsurvivor) for my info on how chemo was. So you really need to decide if chemo would help you and if you want that extra measure of insurance. You will live through the chemo. Honest. It's an investment in your future. You say that the chemo only gives you 4-6% better survival, but you didn't say what your survival rate would be otherwise - each little percentage on another could add up. OH, WHAT AM I SAYING? I hate those survival rate things - they are inaccurate, and lump everyone in a stage together, without reference to age, hormone receptor status, general health, etc, and the statistics are old anyway (how can they get 5/10 year stats except with women who are 5/10 years out, older protocols, etc). So I hate percentages. Won't look at mine. However, that being said, although maybe the huge percentage of women in your position who choose not to have chemo never have a recurrence, I am sorry to say that whenever I hear of someone who has a recurrence, it is frequently accompanied by, \"They said it made little difference, they left it up to me, and now it has come back.\" And frankly, it usually seems to come back as mets to other parts of the body. I am sorry to frighten you, perhaps it is a rare occurrence that I just hear about alot. I don't know how to think about that, I just offer it up as a pessimistic viewpoint. For me, having gone through a tough chemo, I would do it again in a minute if it would help me. It wasn't that bad. So please, don't let the fear of chemo influence your decision. Rachel",

      "Content": "Hey, Momof5! Yes, they are going to remain rock hard, sorry! But they have to be rigid - thier job is to push out and stretch your muscles, and it wouldn't work if they were nice and soft and smushy. Makes sense, doesn't it? I don't know how many cc's I ultimately got in my expander. My doc expanded me to bigger than I would need to simply accomodate the new implant, so that there would be extra room, and the muscles could relax and contract around it and get the right shape around the silicone implant. The silicone implant I got was 250 cc or a bit less, I can't remember. I am 5\"1', and am going to be a B, I hope a full B. I used to be a not full, sort of draggy C. He estimated the size to match my other boob, which is going to be uplifted - my old 51 year old boobs used to look good as a matched pair, but now the remaining one looks a bit saggy, especially when it's next to the new perky fake one. I am not the final size yet. I am wearing a C, but that's the size that fits both my boobs most easily, and I am still a bit swollen. For me, this is a long process. But my scar looks good. By the way, continue to put moisturizer/scar serum on the scar, it will make it look better, and soften it up. It's ok that you are tight after a fillup, but if it hurts too much, he's overfilled you. And you should tell him, so the next time he won't do that. It really is an amazing process, and I am so glad that I had it done. Although the whole thing is not finished yet, I feel that the final result will be good, and that I will be able to go on about the rest of my life without feeling disfigured (or not too much, anyway!).",

It sounds like the stinging I get when I use a sunscreen that I am sensitive to, one of the old style PABA formulas. The skin on my face is particularly vulnerable to that sort of thing. I haven't had that sort of reaction while on Tamoxifen (one year), but of course everyone differs. rachel",

      "Content": "Hey there! I do not envy you having a choice in all this - what a difficult decision! But I do URGE you to make you decision AS IF chemo had no side effects, or only minimal ones. Chemo is temporary. Chemo will be over. Your hair, if you lose it, will grow back. You will lose your \"normal\" life to some extent for a while. But it WILL be over. I did really great on chemo (4AC+4Taxol, every 2 weeks), never any nausea, and few other side effects besides fatigue, although some women have a very tough time of it. But it is OVER at some point. You can search this board for more info, or go to my site (www.xanga.com/bcsurvivor) for my info on how chemo was. So you really need to decide if chemo would help you and if you want that extra measure of insurance. You will live through the chemo. Honest. It's an investment in your future. You say that the chemo only gives you 4-6% better survival, but you didn't say what your survival rate would be otherwise - each little percentage on another could add up. OH, WHAT AM I SAYING? I hate those survival rate things - they are inaccurate, and lump everyone in a stage together, without reference to age, hormone receptor status, general health, etc, and the statistics are old anyway (how can they get 5/10 year stats except with women who are 5/10 years out, older protocols, etc). So I hate percentages. Won't look at mine. However, that being said, although maybe the huge percentage of women in your position who choose not to have chemo never have a recurrence, I am sorry to say that whenever I hear of someone who has a recurrence, it is frequently accompanied by, \"They said it made little difference, they left it up to me, and now it has come back.\" And frankly, it usually seems to come back as mets to other parts of the body. I am sorry to frighten you, perhaps it is a rare occurrence that I just hear about alot. I don't know how to think about that, I just offer it up as a pessimistic viewpoint. For me, having gone through a tough chemo, I would do it again in a minute if it would help me. It wasn't that bad. So please, don't let the fear of chemo influence your decision. Rachel",

      "Content": "Dear Shelley, I had a RB mastectomy on March 3, 2004, with tissue expander reconstruction done at the same time. I wholeheartedly recommend it. Everyone I know (DC area) has the recon done at the same time as the mastectomy. I strongly urge you to go for a second opinion. I had aggressive treatment. The chemo was dose dense - 4 AC then 4 Taxol, every 2 weeks. A month off, then 28 rounds of radiation. 11 weeks after my last radiation (last Monday!), I had the final silicone implant put in. Of course, everyone is different, but for me, the reconstruction was almost pain free, did not extend my recuperation time, and gave me no trouble at all. My body is strong, and undamaged - with the tissue expander, no muscles are taken or moved, so the rest of your body remains intact. After you wake up from the surgery, you have a fair sized fake boob. I think that that really helps the mental part of this whole thing. There is some discomfort, but I don't think that I would really call it pain. They give you muscle relaxer meds to allow the skin and muscle to stretch, and pain meds. I was off the pain meds in a few days, and had a sort of abraded feeling inside, but it was not bad at all. Of course, I was also recovering from the mastectomy, so who knows what caused the pain really? Anyway, with both the mastectomy and the reconstruction, I was out of the hospital in 2 days, shopping in 4, driving in 5, and feeling really quite well in a week, and back to normal in 2. The tissue expander surgery apparently does not add much to the recovery from the mastectomy. I had \"fill-ups\" - they add more saline to the tissue expander with a syringe - 2 or 3 times every few weeks after surgery until it was big enough. My surgeon was very careful, and never overfilled it, so I had virtually no pain - one dose of ibuprofin just afterwards and that was it. Truly not a big deal. Some women have pain on fill-ups, but it seems to be from over filling, from what I can understand from them. After the expander is put in and the saline fillups are finished, the next step is to have the expander removed and to have a permanent implant put in. \"Permanent\" is a bit of a misnomer, because the implants have to be replaced in 10 or 15 years, but OK. At that point, you have a choice of a saline or a silicone implant. You'll have to do your own research, but I decided to have silicone. If you have radiation and chemo, the final implant has to wait until that is all over. Usually, you have to wait at least 3 months after your last radiation treatment. I did really well with radiation, and my skin seems the same as it was before - I think that I am lucky, but also, I used moisturizing cream 3x a day from day 1 of radiation, and that helped I am sure, so be vigilant with that cream. There are two main problems that can cause problems that have to do with how your body reacts. One is capsular contracture. That is when the body reacts to a foreign thing being placed in it (the expander), and makes alot of scar tissue, which can squeeze the expander. If this happens, they can \"release\" the contracture when they put in the final implant by doing some well placed cuts within. The other is that radiation usually toughens the skin and muscle. I suppose that that could squeeze the expander or make it harder to do the final implant, but I am unclear why it makes a difference having the radiation before or after the expander is put in. In any case, I don't think that I had either of the above problems. I go to the reconstructive surgeon on Tuesday for my first post op visit and he will tell me what he found when he went in - whether he had to fix any capsular contracture and how the muscle did from the radiation. However, I am not even a week after the surgery, and the fake boob is soft and comfy, both in my chest and to the touch. It feels soft, just like my real remaining boob. And this last surgery was a real breeze, no kidding. It took an hour, and I was out of the hospital about 2 hours after that. Took 1 percocet every 3 hours the first afternoon/evening, and that was it. I drove the next day. Now, I don't want to mislead you. The tissue expander (remember, this is the temporary one!) is boob-like, but it will not look like your real one, although you can disguise it with bras that will even you up. The expander (mine, at least) was high, wide and shallow. I did best with a sports bra or a camisole with a shelf, that squished my other breast and brought it up (I'm 51, so I have a bit of a droop). The expander is rigid, and has saline in it, and it is hard. I called it \"the Brick\". It has to be that way, because they are stretching the muscle and the skin. They expand it to be bigger than what it will be with the final implant so there's enough room for the skin to reshape around the final implant. Anyway, no one noticed the difference in the 2 breasts except for me, and I wear loose shirts or jackets alot. After the final implant, which has a boob-like shape, it takes a few months for the skin and muscle to reshape around it and start to project. Because they can't make a fake boob droop like a 51 year old breast, I am having an uplift done on my other breast when the fake one has settled into its final shape (and they will try to match them). At that time, they will take some regular skin from the old boob that they would otherwise discard, and use it to make a fake nipple. That's not a big surgery either. When that is healed, they will tattoo the fake nipple. Of course, I am not done yet, but I can see that this is going to be one gorgeous breast! I also have a beautiful, almost invisible scar, which I bet will fade even more over time. So that's the whole process. All in all, pretty much hassle free, pain free and easy. I had always been a B, but had drooped my way into a C. The new one and the uplifted one will be a full B or so, which is a good size for an implant, not too heavy. If you are considering one of the flap reconstructions, please consider that they have to take muscle and move it, and then you don't have the muscle where it is supposed to be. I cannot imagine doing that. Another thing to consider regarding timing - you know, you can get used to anything, even an unreconstructed breast. And, after all you are going to be going through, are you going to want to start a whole new process when you are done? And it just extends the process. Here I am, 3 months after radiation, pretty much all done, with my final implant in. Also, my general breast surgeon (who did the mastectomy) and my reconstructive surgeon (expanders/implants) work together, and strategized when they are doing the operation as to how it is best to cut for the best reconstruction result. I think that also added to the beautiful result and easy recovery. Good luck with your decision.

In retrospect it would have been better for me to have the chemo on Thursday, because I could always have worked well the next day, and the weekends would have been the tough days. As to reconstruction, can't help you there. I had expander recon at the same time as the mastectomy, but you can't have that because you already had radiation on that breast. If they say they can do expanders on irradiated tissue, they are wrong and you must find another doc. By the way, I was discharged from the hospital from my mastectomy/recon in two days, without drains.

However, when I used to do plateletpheresis before bc, the techs had a really hard time finding the good veins they needed inside my elbow. They told me (and it seemed to help) to drink alot of water for a day or two before, and that would plump them up or something - maybe the extra fluid made for more blood or the hydration worked in another way. That's an easy one. I think that working out makes better stronger veins as well - as the muscle develops, the veins have to get larger/stronger to accomodate the extra muscle.

      "Content": "That sounds rather dangerous, and foolish. And she doesn't even really know what she has. I know that there are stories out there about cures by alternative methods, but they are more anecdotal than anything else, no scientific studies. There was something about apricot pits or something years ago that people went to Mexico for I think, but people died from that particular form of non-treatment. There are also many people touting many different sorts of diets and lifestyle changes and claiming that they cure cancer, but I am very skeptical of them. Usually they are promoting a product. One woman who claims to have had a remarkable recovery because of her new diet and has a book out, is apparently a fraud. There is a site of fraud busters, you can google it. I would google any such cure that your wife is adhering to, and also put in \"danger\" or \"fraud\" or something like that, so you will get the negative views of it as well. Then you have to decide. I think that alot of these alternative methods sound good to a layperson. What the heck do we know? And perhaps they are even good as a supplement to traditional treatment, to keep the body strong. But alone? I would like to have had an open mind, and embrace alternative therapies, and all that, but frankly, my life is way too important to me to gamble on somebody's unproven ideas. I went with the treatment that many many studies have shown to be effective. Stage 1 or 2 should give a good survival rate if the proper treatments are done. If not, well, perhaps she will have good luck. That kind of good luck is pretty rare though. Please do your research. Perhaps she feels that she is being brave and bold and really forward thinking, and that because she is young and strong, nothing really bad can happen to her. Or perhaps she is terrified of surgery, chemo and radiation. Well, we all know that one - we were all terrified, we all got through it, and for me, it wasn't all that bad. I think that we were brave as well. Breast cancer treatment has come a long way, and it is effective, and the side effects can be handled. At her age, cancer is generally rather aggressive if it is hormone receptor positive, because it feeds on all the estrogen she has in her body. Sorry to be negative. I know that some people will differ with me. But I wouldn't pass up conventional treatment. And also, it's been 2 months since her biopsy - she should already have had surgery or be in chemo or something. Time is ticking away.",

      "Content": "Sue, I don't know how much this will help, but here goes: I have very small veins, although the onc used my hand and I had no problems. However, when I used to do plateletpheresis before bc, the techs had a really hard time finding the good veins they needed inside my elbow. They told me (and it seemed to help) to drink alot of water for a day or two before, and that would plump them up or something - maybe the extra fluid made for more blood or the hydration worked in another way. That's an easy one. I think that working out makes better stronger veins as well - as the muscle develops, the veins have to get larger/stronger to accomodate the extra muscle.

      "Content": "Hey! Let's hope that for you, as it was for me, the anticipation was much much worse than the reality! I did really well on chemo. After all the things they read to you about side effects, I know that you can only picture yourself lying in bed retching for days. But that doesn't happen to everyone. In fact, I NEVER HAD ONE MOMENT OF NAUSEA! So be prepared, but don't assume it's gonna happen to you. I agree with what the other women have posted, but the water is more for flushing your body than for hydration, I think. And I got hungry while I was being infused (or bored!) so bring something to eat also. If you don't have a port (I didn't) bring something to do that does not require much hand moving, since you will have the IV in. Wear comfy clothing so you can nap, I loved my sweats and thick socks. As far as meds are concerned - I had dose dense - 4AC then 4Taxol 2 weeks apart. I took 2 anti nausea meds - Emend (hour before chemo, next morning, morning after that) and either Kytril or Anzimet (the doc gave me samples) chemo night, and the next 2 mornings and nights (nights optional). And never a moment of nausea. Emend is new, it's expensive, but for me it was terrific. That was during the AC. No one really told me that I wouldn't need it for the Taxol part, so I did the same thing for 3 out of 4 taxol. Stupid me. Anyway, the last taxol, I took nothing, and was just fine. Apparently taxol is not nausea producing for most people. On AC, I always had a lost day - Monday after chemo Friday. Sometimes it was a day or 2 more. However, I was tired, and conked out much earlier each night than usual. And got up really early! Which I really liked. I could do normal things, but did not have alot of energy, and the idea of dragging the laundry basket up and down 3 flights of stairs really didn't appeal to me. I also coddled myself and didn't do to much - on the 3rd AC, I spent 5 hours cleaning the basement, lifting boxes, etc, and that laid me flat for days and days, so I was very protective for the rest of the time. Too protective maybe. Taxol was much easier. The steriods make you a bit peppier, and I found my energy coming back a bit. By the way, my taste stayed the same throughout. I always ate a big meal on chemo night, and my appetite did not (unfortunately!) go away, although as time went on, I found that smaller more frequent meals were better than the usual three. I never got mouth sores, but for about 2-3 weeks my mouth was sensitive to my usual toothpaste and mouthwash, so I switched to Biotene, which worked great. If you are getting Neupogen or Neulasta shots, you may get some bone/muscle/joint pain - I took ibuprofin and it went away. For Taxol, look into taking L-Gluetimine (sp?). Some people recommend taking it every day while you are getting chemo, my nurse recommended it for a few days after each Taxol. It is supposed to help with avoiding neuropathy, and other Taxol side effects. I sometimes took it, sometimes not (bad with these things!) but I had little neuropathy (a bit of numbness on the soles of my feet, went away by 5 months post chemo; some messed up fingernails, grew out). Good luck, girl! Get your wig and scarves and happy videos ready, and step out onto that road that none of us wanted to take. The good thing is, that although the end is not now in sight, you get there somehow, sooner than you can imagine, and healthy! It's all just temporary, all this chemo. Living long, now, that's the thing you have to keep your sights on. Rachel",

      "Content": "That sounds rather dangerous, and foolish. And she doesn't even really know what she has. I know that there are stories out there about cures by alternative methods, but they are more anecdotal than anything else, no scientific studies. There was something about apricot pits or something years ago that people went to Mexico for I think, but people died from that particular form of non-treatment. There are also many people touting many different sorts of diets and lifestyle changes and claiming that they cure cancer, but I am very skeptical of them. Usually they are promoting a product. One woman who claims to have had a remarkable recovery because of her new diet and has a book out, is apparently a fraud. There is a site of fraud busters, you can google it. I would google any such cure that your wife is adhering to, and also put in \"danger\" or \"fraud\" or something like that, so you will get the negative views of it as well. Then you have to decide. I think that alot of these alternative methods sound good to a layperson. What the heck do we know? And perhaps they are even good as a supplement to traditional treatment, to keep the body strong. But alone? I would like to have had an open mind, and embrace alternative therapies, and all that, but frankly, my life is way too important to me to gamble on somebody's unproven ideas. I went with the treatment that many many studies have shown to be effective. Stage 1 or 2 should give a good survival rate if the proper treatments are done. If not, well, perhaps she will have good luck. That kind of good luck is pretty rare though. Please do your research. Perhaps she feels that she is being brave and bold and really forward thinking, and that because she is young and strong, nothing really bad can happen to her. Or perhaps she is terrified of surgery, chemo and radiation. Well, we all know that one - we were all terrified, we all got through it, and for me, it wasn't all that bad. I think that we were brave as well. Breast cancer treatment has come a long way, and it is effective, and the side effects can be handled. At her age, cancer is generally rather aggressive if it is hormone receptor positive, because it feeds on all the estrogen she has in her body. Sorry to be negative. I know that some people will differ with me. But I wouldn't pass up conventional treatment. And also, it's been 2 months since her biopsy - she should already have had surgery or be in chemo or something. Time is ticking away.",

      "Content": "Dear Pink Girl, It would be kind of rare for you to have breast cancer at your age, but unfortunately, I guess it is possible. I think it is probably a good time for you to find a gynecologist and go in for an exam. Show her where you hurt, and what you are concerned about, and she will tell you if it is normal or not, and if you need to have an ultrasound or further exams by other doctors or other tests. Young women frequently have very dense breasts, and benign cysts. These cysts are frequently very painful before your period, and your breasts may be very tender. That is fairly common. And please, you should know that many women have breasts that are different sizes, and that are not exactly symmetrical, are not a precisely \"matched set\". What you are looking for is a change in YOUR breasts from what they were. When I had a tumor, it made a slight dent above the nipple, and the nipple was a bit indented on the top, and didn't look straight out, if you can imagine that. It was different from what it had been before. So, go find a gynecologist and put these worries to rest. Good luck.",

      "Content": "Dear Danielle, I do think that those sorts of side effects could come from the neupogen. I had neupogen shots for 7 days straight starting day 3 after chemo, and I do think that I had similar side effects, although probably milder. I think YUCK is a pretty good description. Since I had them everyday, it's hard to tell what came from the neupogen and what from the chemo, but I believe ithe shots gave me some bone pain, and it did make me tired. I also got a funny feeling as the drug was injected - I can't describe it, but if your mom gets it also, she'll know what I mean! I took 4 ibuprofin (instead of the usual 2) and it helped. On the plus side, I NEVER got sick during chemo, and I am sure that it is because of the neupogen. Good luck to your mom, and I know that your concern and love envelops her and makes her feel comforted and secure. Rachel",

Some recommend taking it every day of chemo, no matter what sort of chemo. Apparently, it can't hurt. I cannot remember the dosage. I'd do a Google search for more info. I took it, although not religiously during taxol. I had numbness on the very bottoms of my feet, and some fingernails were affected - dented looking and a few \"detached\" from the nail bed about halfway down. The fingernails grew in normally after the taxol. The numbness went away for me in about 4 months. I don't know if it was the L-G, or just what my body does, but the L-G certainly didn't hurt.

I see that you had radiation before your most recent bc, and before your expanders were put in. MY PS won't do put in expanders after radiation, because of the same thing that happened to you - he says he never gets good results. I had the expanders done at mastectomy time and all filled before my radiation (chemo was first) , so I was already stretched fully for 5 months when I had the radiation. Are you going to have any other reconstruction done? My PS says that I could have a flap operation (don't remember if he said lat or tram or if both were possible) now, after radiation, if I wanted. So if you want, that's a possibility for you. I'm happy with what I have for now.",

Yet, the maximum they will pay in prescriptions PER YEAR is $500. This came as a great shock to me, because before cancer, I never even approached the maximum and didn't realized that there was one. There aren't any options to up that number by paying more, I checked. And they do not have that 3 month by mail thing either. This has really been a hardship. During chemo, I took Emend, which cost me $282 each treatment, luckily, the doc gave me samples for the other anti nausea drugs. And I had to go to a facility every day to get my neupogen shots - if I had gotten them from the pharmacy and self injected (which is what everyone else does!), they would have called it a prescription drug and not paid. So, as you can imagine, drugs have cost me thousands in the past year. I am looking for a supplemental prescription program or a supplemental drug program that can give me more coverage. I doubt I will find one, especially now after my diagnosis.",

Yet, the maximum they will pay in prescriptions PER YEAR is $500. This came as a great shock to me, because before cancer, I never even approached the maximum and didn't realized that there was one. There aren't any options to up that number by paying more, I checked. And they do not have that 3 month by mail thing either. This has really been a hardship. During chemo, I took Emend, which cost me $282 each treatment, luckily, the doc gave me samples for the other anti nausea drugs. And I had to go to a facility every day to get my neupogen shots - if I had gotten them from the pharmacy and self injected (which is what everyone else does!), they would have called it a prescription drug and not paid. So, as you can imagine, drugs have cost me thousands in the past year. I am looking for a supplemental prescription program or a supplemental drug program that can give me more coverage. I doubt I will find one, especially now after my diagnosis.",

Most women are able to work almost all days - some are not, but you don't know yet how she will react, it is so very individual. If she gets neupogen or neulasta shots to boost her white blood cell count, then she really shouldn't have to worry about germs so much. I had Neupogen, and my doc told me not to be in a closed car for 5 hours with a person with a hacking cough/bad upper respiratory infection and he let me go if I wore a mask. But I was not otherwise restricted, did not have to avoid crowds or anything like that. So look into the neupogen/neulasta. About the chemicals, well, that sounds like more of a problem. Have you asked the doc about her being in range of the chemicals and what effect it could have on her? If she is very active on her job, that may be a bit of a problem - I did well on chemo, but was tired. Oh, I really sympathize! Not only am I self employed, I also have a disability plan that I need to be disabled 6 months for before it kicks in. So I never used it. I am sorry, I don't know of any programs that help in this case.",

      "Content": "Dear Spoke, Please let us know what sort of chemo regime she is on, as they differ somewhat, and our advice can be more precise. What chemicals, how often, how many treatments, that sort of stuff. I had dose dense chemo, 4 Adriamyacin/Cytoxin, then 4 Taxol, every 2 weeks. I am going to assume that she is starting with AC, as that is the most common. I found that I felt great on the day of chemo (Friday), the day after, and for most of the day after that (Sunday). On Sunday evening, I started to slow down, and Mondays were always pretty much lost days - very tired and feeling off. Usually I felt ok on Tuesday and then progressively better as the days went on. I had neupogen shots starting on Day 3 (Monday) for a week, and I think they added to my fatigue. Anyway, she should be starting to feel better soon. Some women do great like me, others do less well. If she is nauseated, she needs to talk to her onc and get different meds. I took Emend and either Anzamet or Kytril and never had a minute of nausea. She may be constipated which will make her feel bad also, Sennekot helps that. Anyway, lots of women don't miss a day of work, some miss one or two every cycle, some cannot move and are out on disability. Mine was not cumulative, so don't expect that necessarily. Also, the first chemo is filled with terror, which can wear you out. You are just always on the lookout for some dreaded side effect, and the dread can ruin your day. After the first, when you sort of know what to expect, that part of it should go away. Probably, she will be able to continue working, taking one or two days off here and there. If her job is extremely physical, she may want to consider a temporary switch to a position that does not require so much activity - it seems to me that nurses do alot of walking and lifting. I don't know if that's possible, but it's worth a shot. I really want to emphasize that I believe that alot of the chemo \"experience\" is shaped by expectation and attitude. I was surrounded by women who worked through chemo and did very well, and so I knew that it was not only possible, but probable. Your head can do funny things to your body. So, expect the best, but be prepared for the worst. I do hope she starts to feel better tomorrow! Or the day after! Please do let us know.",

      "Content": "Dear Cilver, Just a few weeks out, recovering from both a mastectomy and reconstruction, and probably node biopsy. Well, yes, tightness is to be expected. The expanders probably feel like bricks, and the skin/tisssue inside feels a bit abraded, right? Normal, normal, normal. You should feel better soon. When they do, that's when they will start the fill-ups! Ah, no rest for the weary. I got muscle relaxer meds for the first few weeks. For pain I took Ibuprofin, which worked just fine. I actually felt great after 2 weeks, and just some discomfort from the \"brick\". By the way, it will stay like a brick. But I love my silicone implant - it's soft, smushy and comfy. So hang in there. I also had about a 2 inch tumor (plus 2 others!) and had a single mastectomy, expander reconstruction, then chemo and radiation. Since you are not getting radiaiton, you should have the most gorgeous set of breasts! And not only now, but for years to come! And it is easier with a bilat to get a matching set - my fake and real one are now at different altitudes (hey, the real one is 51 year old, it's entitled to droop a bit!) so I have to have surgery on the real breast for symmetry. The radiation complicates things a bit, but I am getting a pretty good result anyway since radiation came when I was all stretched out. [See www.fotki.com/bcsurvivor for photos - read the Welcome for indepth info on what the story is.] For more discussion on expanders and implants, see www.komen.org and click on Forums, then Sound Off. Search around, even in the archives, this is a topic that is discussed endlessly, obsessively, and in great detail. By the way, make sure your surgeon doesn't overfill your expanders. If he just fills to the point of tightness, it'll be fine. I had no pain from fillups, but took ibuprofin ahead of time just in case. Rachel",

      "Content": "What happened to me is apparently rare, but I thought I'd let you all know so you can ask your doc and take precautions if necessary. I had an expander, then radiation, then exchange surgery for a silicone implant, which has been in and doing well since Thanksgiving 2004. I got my teeth cleaned on a Thursday. On Saturday, I woke up feeling like I had just had my mastectomy/reconstruction 2 days before. Implant breast swollen like a balloon, and bricklike and unmoveable. very painful, couldn't raise my arm. Two hours later, 102 temp kicked in and I was sick as a dog. This all took a while to figure out, but it was the teeth cleaning that did it. Turns out, the mouth is a very dirty place, and when they nick your gums while cleaning, the bacteria jumps happily into the bloodstream. Normally, the body just fights it off easily. And I had had my teeth cleaned twice or so since the implant/expander was put in. But this time, the stars were in the wrong place or something. Bacteria loves foreign bodies, so they all flocked to my implant. And, because I had radiation, the irradiated tissue has a more restricted blood supply, the blood vessels are smaller, so the blood and white blood cells didn't rush in like they should have to fight the infection. Although the antibiotics worked and I don't have an infection anymore, the implant breast is not going to get better on its own. I believe the implant is contaminated, and I have a lot of extra fluid in there (still restricted arm movement). So I have to have surgery in a few weeks to remove the bad implant, scrape out any thickening caused by the infection, and get a new implant. Great, huh? Well, my PS says he's only seen this 4 times in 20 years, so it is rare. But I will from now on, take prophylactic antibiotics before any dental visits, and I will keep in mind that any infection anywhere on my body could affect the implant. Ok, it's not so bad. It's not a recurrence, it's not a cancer issue. I can deal with this. It's inconvenient, and annoying, but on the grand scale of bad stuff that can happen, it's ok. If you have just had radiation, this is not an issue for you. If you had an implant plus radiation, it probably is an issue for you. If you have an implant, no radiation, I don't know, but better safe than sorry. By the way, people with hip replacements, pacemakers, any sort of fake thing inside the body, are also at risk. Who knew that getting teeth cleaned is a dangerous activity?!",

      "Content": "Jill, About swimming... its not the chemo that would stop you from swimming, but the healing of your incisions. My docs let me swim in a swimming pool after my incision from the mastectomy was healed somewhat - I cannot remember exactly when that was, although I think about 2 -4 weeks. He also told me that after exchange surgery for the silicone implant, 2 weeks. I think it will be the state of the incision for the port that makes the difference for you, so check with your doc. Sorry I can't be more help! Since you had some nausea and vomiting, I suggest you talk to your doc about changing your meds - there are alot of alternatives out there. I used Emend and Anzimat (sp?) and had no nausea at all, although I'm probably just lucky . If you react the same way I did, you should start to slow down a bit tonight (Friday, day 2 after AC), and have a really slow day on Saturday - my day 3 was pretty much a useless day for me. I would have been fine by Sunday, day 4. You should also be on the lookout for constipation or diarrhea just about now (I'm sorry, I find that sooo weird, that you can either be constipated or have the runs!). I spend alot of my first Day 3 curled up in a ball, very unhappy, until I realized that I was constipated (duh!), took Sennekot at night and was fine the next morning. Good luck!

If not, he's going to miss something, or you will always be in fear that he missed something, and that will drive you both crazy. Second, I had (and I think it is standard protocol) to get all sorts of tests before chemo, to both have a baseline, and also to see if your body can take the toxic effects of the chemo. I think it is dangerous to NOT have the tests. I had a MUGA, a CT and a bone scan. The MUGA scan checks your heart, because chemo is tough on the heart, and some people can't take it. I think the CT and the bone scan check for metasteses. Since mine came out ok, I kind of forgot the purpose of each one. But they rushed me in to get those tests before chemo, and wouldn't have started chemo without them. By the way, they are time consuming, but no big deal. I suggest you RUN and get an appt for a second opinion with another Oncologist. I know time is running out, but I really think that you are not being treated properly. Usually, oncs get you in pretty quickly, and can schedule your chemo to begin quickly also. I would postpone chemo until you find the right onc for your mom (they may have a different treatment plan in mind), but move quick, you don't want to postpone for more than a few days or a week. I had decided on one oncologist before my mastectomy, but when I met with him after it, and discussed my treatment in more detail, I felt that he was not looking out for my best interests, so I went to another for a consult. The second was really straight up with me, and I felt that I could trust him. So I ditched the old one. And I am so glad that I did.

My docs let me swim in a swimming pool after my incision from the mastectomy was healed somewhat - I cannot remember exactly when that was, although I think about 2 -4 weeks. He also told me that after exchange surgery for the silicone implant, 2 weeks. I think it will be the state of the incision for the port that makes the difference for you, so check with your doc. Sorry I can't be more help! Since you had some nausea and vomiting, I suggest you talk to your doc about changing your meds - there are alot of alternatives out there. I used Emend and Anzimat (sp?) and had no nausea at all, although I'm probably just lucky . If you react the same way I did, you should start to slow down a bit tonight (Friday, day 2 after AC), and have a really slow day on Saturday - my day 3 was pretty much a useless day for me. I would have been fine by Sunday, day 4. You should also be on the lookout for constipation or diarrhea just about now (I'm sorry, I find that sooo weird, that you can either be constipated or have the runs!). I spend alot of my first Day 3 curled up in a ball, very unhappy, until I realized that I was constipated (duh!), took Sennekot at night and was fine the next morning. Good luck! One down, only 7 to go! Rachel",

You say that she had breast cancer 2 years ago, and had a tumor in her breast and cancer was also in her lymph nodes? She had surgery, and had some nodes removed? OK. Did she have a lumpectomy, where they take out the lump, or a mastectomy, where they take out the breast? Did she have chemo therapy, radiation? Do you know what type of breast cancer it was? And how many nodes had cancer? And now, it sounds like the breast cancer has come back. Where did it come back to - the breast, or bones, lungs, or what? And has she had tests? What does the doctor say it is? Is it that the cancer has come back, or does she have a different type of cancer? Also, are they planning a blood transfusion to cure the cancer? They will give her different fresh blood (through her veins) to replace the old blood? Or are they going to do something with her bone marrow? or is the transfusion to make her blood better, give her more energy? Sorry to ask so many questions. I think we can help you a bit if we have more information. And are you in the US? Rachel",

Some recommend taking it every day of chemo, no matter what sort of chemo. Apparently, it can't hurt. I cannot remember the dosage. I'd do a Google search for more info. I took it, although not religiously during taxol. I had numbness on the very bottoms of my feet, and some fingernails were affected - dented looking and a few \"detached\" from the nail bed about halfway down. The fingernails grew in normally after the taxol. The numbness went away for me in about 4 months. I don't know if it was the L-G, or just what my body does, but the L-G certainly didn't hurt.

Do NOT feel stupid about asking questions, or hesitant because other women have more to worry about. There's always someone better off and also worse off than each of us, but we each have to take care of ourselves. As to seeing an oncologist, I have no idea! I doubt you would need chemo with that path report, and it seems that's what your surgeon thought. You probably do not need to see an onc. I just suggested it because sometimes we need to find out more, and have someone who KNOWS tell us what's up, and then we can sleep easy. Or maybe the onc will have an opinion about radiation that will help you. I guess I see the onc as an additional information gathering resource for you, someone who sees this all the time and can weigh in on your options. And, I would not feel stupid about going there (see, I can read your mind!) to get a consult - you will probably be a bright spot in the onc's day, since you have such a good report. I agree, legal action is an emotional drain, that's why I am ignoring that for myself. I see that there are no hormone receptor/her2 results. Maybe they didn't do those tests because the lump was so small, that it's not an issue, and maybe that's the same reason for no node dissection. I still would ask though. They still have all that tissue so they can do more tests if something was forgotten. While it is true that if you have radiation in that breast, you won't be able to have expander/implant put in in the unlikely event that bc comes back in that breast, please remember that there are other methods of reconstruction that work quite well, including DIEP (which sounds really good). And, you said that your skin is too thin for short radiation and keeps tearing. So maybe, even without radiation, it would not do well with an implant, so perhaps you aren't really giving up all that much. I think that in your case, the only alternative to lump+rads would be a mastectomy. And it would be a shame to lose your breast and nipple if you do not have to. Dona, you have much to think about, but it sounds like your prognosis is good, and I am happy for you. Best, Rachel",

      "Content": "Greetings to all breast cancer survivors and friends! I have posted photos at www.fotki.com/BCSurvivor so that other women with breast cancer can see what breast reconstruction looks like. Hey, don't get frightened, it's not finished yet! It is a work in progress. I know that to those of you who are not intimately familiar with the process, the sight of a breast without a nipple is a shock. Try to see beyond that. I had a mastectomy on March 3, 2004 with expander reconstruction at the same time, at age 50. I then had dose dense chemotherapy (4 A/C, 4 Taxol, every 2 weeks) which ended July 1, 2004, and 28 radiation treatments (ended September 2, 2004). On November 22, 2004, I had surgery to replace the saline expander with a silicone implant. At this point, even though it is not perfect, I am quite pleased with what I have and my progress to date. In a bra, my breasts look symmetrical and even. The silicone implant feels soft to the touch, and I don't feel it in my body. My scar is great - thin and fading (I have used scar gel religiously throughout the whole process). I am 51 now, and small, just 5 feet. I will be a B cup on both sides once this is all done, and the silicone implant is about 220 cc's. I am going to have additional surgery, probably in Fall of 2005, for breast symmetry. The surgeon will do an uplift/reduction to the real breast, and use the extra skin to fashion a nipple on the implant side. In addition, he will replace the existing silicone implant with a slightly smaller one, which should give me a better size match with the real breast, and also give me less volume on the top of the breast. He will also do some contouring, to improve the shape. Please note that the shape of the implant breast changes over time, as the implant \"settles in\". To all my breast cancer sisters, who now belong to this club that none of us wanted to join, I wish good healing, and long life. May we all live to be little old ladies with the best looking breasts in the senior center!",

      "Content": "Dona, The pathology reports from your lumpectomy show all the information. I am surprised that your surgeon did not share it with you. You should have gotten a copy of it. I would call the surgeon's office and make sure that they sent the information to the radiation oncologist, then I would demand a copy be sent to you as well. I had a mastectomy, so I don't know how it goes with lumpectomies, but I am surprised that they did not do any node dissection. Maybe because it was so small? But not having nodes removed does not necessarily mean that the nodes were clean. I would ask your surgeon why she did not do the nodes and if you are not satisfied with the answer, talk to another surgeon. You can always have it done now. I wonder if an MRI would be helpful to you, to determine if there is more cancer in the lumpectomy breast. I say this because my mammograms only showed microcalcifications and ambiguous suspicious things, but the MRI showed 3 distinct tumors. So sometimes, it's a better diagnostic tool. It does sound like you are not getting the best information from your surgeon. Maybe she is doing everything absolutely correctly, but just hasn't explained it well to you. You need to persist if you don't understand completely. Make an appt just to discuss if you have to. Anyway, perhaps the radiation onc. will explain things better to you. She is the one that really makes the decision about radiation, and so can discuss it with you more fully. Have her go over the pathology results with you. Good luck. This is a very trying time, when you really do not understand what you have and what you have to do. Don't be afraid to get a second or a third opinion if you have any doubts at all. Rachel",

I really do urge you not to freak out too much yet. Until the biopsy results come in, you really do not know what the story is. I had a friend with lots of bad stuff on the mammogram and a sister with BC, and she turned out negative. Similarly, it seems that there are alot of things that can look bad in the lungs and in fact everywhere, and not be anything. A radiologist pretty much told my bf that his xray showed cancer on a rib - we spent 3 weeks planning his funeral and weeping, because according to our research the only thing he could possibly have would kill him in 3-6 months - the biopsy came out benign. I was tempted to find that radiologist and hit him in the head with my expander breast (it was like a brick, would've knowcked him out for sure! Another story - my radiation therapist's sister had a bad result from some test or something - everyone was convinced she had cancer metastisized to the brain and that she was going to die. My MT even thought that, and ehe knows how this stuff works. Anyway, again, negative, no problem. Obviously, we have no idea what is going on with your mom, but please do remember that you don't know anything until the path results are in, and that many times, diagnostic tests turn out to have different results when the followup tests are done. This sort of question, the spread to lungs, would be under the topic of metastesis of breast cancer. Good luck to your mom, strength to you. Rachel Yes,",

      "Content": "Dona, The pathology reports from your lumpectomy show all the information. I am surprised that your surgeon did not share it with you. You should have gotten a copy of it. I would call the surgeon's office and make sure that they sent the information to the radiation oncologist, then I would demand a copy be sent to you as well. I had a mastectomy, so I don't know how it goes with lumpectomies, but I am surprised that they did not do any node dissection. Maybe because it was so small? But not having nodes removed does not necessarily mean that the nodes were clean. I would ask your surgeon why she did not do the nodes and if you are not satisfied with the answer, talk to another surgeon. You can always have it done now. I wonder if an MRI would be helpful to you, to determine if there is more cancer in the lumpectomy breast. I say this because my mammograms only showed microcalcifications and ambiguous suspicious things, but the MRI showed 3 distinct tumors. So sometimes, it's a better diagnostic tool. It does sound like you are not getting the best information from your surgeon. Maybe she is doing everything absolutely correctly, but just hasn't explained it well to you. You need to persist if you don't understand completely. Make an appt just to discuss if you have to. Anyway, perhaps the radiation onc. will explain things better to you. She is the one that really makes the decision about radiation, and so can discuss it with you more fully. Have her go over the pathology results with you. Good luck. This is a very trying time, when you really do not understand what you have and what you have to do. Don't be afraid to get a second or a third opinion if you have any doubts at all. Rachel",

      "Content": "Dona, The surgeon is NOT THE EXPERT in all of these things. The surgeon usually knows what is standard because she deals with it everyday, and works with oncs, rad oncs, etc, but further treatment (rads, chemo) is NOT her area of expertise. [I still don't understand why no node dissection. ] Anyway, you may want to take your path results and go to see an oncologist. Actually, I recommend it. The oncologist is the one who makes decisions about chemo, but even if you don't need chemo, I personally would probably feel a whole lot more comfortable to talk to an onc and have her tell me that, rather than a surgeon. Also, perhaps the onc can tell you better what you have and why no nodes were necessary to take out. If nothing else, it could be a peace of mind thing. I too would be upset if the lump was there for 2 years and clearly discernible. I had a similar thing, except that I KNOW that the 7cm tumor that I had removed had been there for years, growing, because I had felt it. But I had been going for yearly mammos and sonograms and consults with surgeons, and they had all given me the ok. They say it wasn't there, but I know that it was. For me, I cannot get mired in that at this point, it's just too much for me. But you may want to pursue it legally. It would be medical malpractice. You may want to consult with an attorney, but I would wait on any legal action as long as you can without losing any rights, for 2 reasons - one, docs get funky if they know you are suing another doctor or health org, and two, you don't know what your damages are yet - you have just started your journey, you need to wait until you know the full story. Go forward, be persistent! Rachel",

      "Content": "Dear Dona, I'm no doctor, but your report sure looks good to me. DCIS smaller than 1 mm, and definitely not invasive ductal carcinoma. Seems like you got it early! Wonderful! Do NOT feel stupid about asking questions, or hesitant because other women have more to worry about. There's always someone better off and also worse off than each of us, but we each have to take care of ourselves. As to seeing an oncologist, I have no idea! I doubt you would need chemo with that path report, and it seems that's what your surgeon thought. You probably do not need to see an onc. I just suggested it because sometimes we need to find out more, and have someone who KNOWS tell us what's up, and then we can sleep easy. Or maybe the onc will have an opinion about radiation that will help you. I guess I see the onc as an additional information gathering resource for you, someone who sees this all the time and can weigh in on your options. And, I would not feel stupid about going there (see, I can read your mind!) to get a consult - you will probably be a bright spot in the onc's day, since you have such a good report. I agree, legal action is an emotional drain, that's why I am ignoring that for myself. I see that there are no hormone receptor/her2 results. Maybe they didn't do those tests because the lump was so small, that it's not an issue, and maybe that's the same reason for no node dissection. I still would ask though. They still have all that tissue so they can do more tests if something was forgotten. While it is true that if you have radiation in that breast, you won't be able to have expander/implant put in in the unlikely event that bc comes back in that breast, please remember that there are other methods of reconstruction that work quite well, including DIEP (which sounds really good). And, you said that your skin is too thin for short radiation and keeps tearing. So maybe, even without radiation, it would not do well with an implant, so perhaps you aren't really giving up all that much. I think that in your case, the only alternative to lump+rads would be a mastectomy. And it would be a shame to lose your breast and nipple if you do not have to. Dona, you have much to think about, but it sounds like your prognosis is good, and I am happy for you. Best, Rachel",

They should not hurt, as long as your PS does not overfill them on each visit. My PS asked me to concentrate and tell him when I felt tension as he was filling, and he stopped at that point. Each person differs a bit on how much they can take comfortably, and it probably varies each time. I usually took ibuprofin before or just after as a precautionary measure for pain, but never had any pain or discomfort. And I never had to take a second dose of ibuprofin. It's better to go for more small fillups than fewer large ones. I didn't restrict my activity in any way after the fillups. Take this off of your list of things to worry about! Rachel",

      "Content": "Dear Nancy, OOps, sorry! I misread your info! Yes, too many surgeries! I pray we all get to the 5 year mark! By that time, I am sure that other alternatives will exist, or, basically, who cares? Reconstruction is nice, prosthetics work, but LIVING is the only really important thing! Sorry to hear about all your surgeries. Oh, you have had a very difficult time of it. The ligament problem is a worry - gee, I hope it's not related to the chemo or arimidex. Thanks for the kind words.",

      "Content": "Dear Rachelle, I think that you really ought to strongly consider having genetic testing. It's not only for you, it's for your kids (men get it too, although rarely). I don't know about the insurance, but if you do have the gene, it's best to be alive and deal with insurance later. I do know that some women have been diagnosed while nursing, so you must continue to be vigilant even during nursing. Because of your family history, I would suggest that you push for MRIs as well as mammograms/ultrasounds, because they can give more info - my mammo was merely \"suspicious\" for cancer, but the MRI clearly showed 3 tumors. There is also a new technique called ductal lavage for detection of bc very early, see http://imaginis.com/breasthealth/ductal_lavage.asp, which sounds really promising, and I know it is being done now (at GWU Hospital in DC, for example). I am so sorry for the loss of your grandmother, and for the illness of so many of your family. Rachel",

      "Content": "Dona, The pathology reports from your lumpectomy show all the information. I am surprised that your surgeon did not share it with you. You should have gotten a copy of it. I would call the surgeon's office and make sure that they sent the information to the radiation oncologist, then I would demand a copy be sent to you as well. I had a mastectomy, so I don't know how it goes with lumpectomies, but I am surprised that they did not do any node dissection. Maybe because it was so small? But not having nodes removed does not necessarily mean that the nodes were clean. I would ask your surgeon why she did not do the nodes and if you are not satisfied with the answer, talk to another surgeon. You can always have it done now. I wonder if an MRI would be helpful to you, to determine if there is more cancer in the lumpectomy breast. I say this because my mammograms only showed microcalcifications and ambiguous suspicious things, but the MRI showed 3 distinct tumors. So sometimes, it's a better diagnostic tool. It does sound like you are not getting the best information from your surgeon. Maybe she is doing everything absolutely correctly, but just hasn't explained it well to you. You need to persist if you don't understand completely. Make an appt just to discuss if you have to. Anyway, perhaps the radiation onc. will explain things better to you. She is the one that really makes the decision about radiation, and so can discuss it with you more fully. Have her go over the pathology results with you. Good luck. This is a very trying time, when you really do not understand what you have and what you have to do. Don't be afraid to get a second or a third opinion if you have any doubts at all. Rachel",

      "Content": "I had tissue expanders put in at the same time as my mastectomy. I had chemo and radiation (28 sessions). About 12 weeks after radiation, I had a silicone implant put in. I talked to my PS about this, because there were a number of posts on the Komen board where women with radiation in the future were told that they could not have tissue expanders/implants. My doc told me the following: He will only do tissue expander reconstruction BEFORE radiation. That is, the expander goes in before the radiation, and it is fully expanded (all the fills) before radiation. He overfills it, so that it will have plenty of room for afterwards. He will not do the implant surgery until at least 12 weeks after radiation is complete. Radiation does toughen the muscles so that it is a bit less flexible than if you did not have radiation. That means it does not stretch well. But any stretch put into it before radiation is there to stay. He says he gets really great results doing it this way. He will NOT, however, do any tissue expander/implant reconstruction that starts on an irradiated breast. You have the get the muscle stretched BEFORE the radiation. He says he does not get good results putting the expander in AFTER radiation (ie, reconstruction starting after radiation), and he will not do that surgery. I have been very lucky I think. My skin is virtually unharmed by the radiation, and the muscles did extremely well, and are not too badly thickened or rigid. Both the PS and my radiation oncologist say that my skin and muscle after radiation is just about the best they have seen. Genetics, apparently, although I did moisturize like crazy. After my implant surgery, it took a good 2-3 months for the swelling to go down - a combination of having 10 nodes removed, and the irradiated tissue retards the outflow of the swelling. I am now 3+ months out, and the implant breast is looking better bit by bit, projecting more and losing the pancake look, but I have to massage it every day to guard against encapsulation, and to force the implant down so it'll project and have a bit of droop. I thought I would be able to have the nipple put on and the other breast lifted for symmetry at 4 months, but at this point I think that that is optimistice. However, it looks pretty darn good even now when I am naked, and in a bra, it's fabulous (I need a bra to give some symmetry). I have to tell you that I have healed incredibly well and quickly. I have had no complications at all from my surgery. I think that the problems you indicated, the skin splitting, and blood supply problems, would arise if you had the implant put in AFTER radiation, when the skin and muscles are less flexible. I think that this is why your surgeon said that he could put in a small implant with the lat flap after radiation, because it would not need all that much stretch. And if he is going to use the lats, they have been unaffected by the radiation, so it makes sense that he could put in an implant - although if that is true, I don't understand why it has to be small - maybe there is some tissue that was irradiated that stays and that's the limitation. Oh, that is confusing, I'd ask for more info. I also believe that my doc said that he would not do any flap reconstruction at any time, before or after radiation, for women having radiation, because the results were not good. I would check that out.",

      "Content": "Dear Dona, I'm no doctor, but your report sure looks good to me. DCIS smaller than 1 mm, and definitely not invasive ductal carcinoma. Seems like you got it early! Wonderful! Do NOT feel stupid about asking questions, or hesitant because other women have more to worry about. There's always someone better off and also worse off than each of us, but we each have to take care of ourselves. As to seeing an oncologist, I have no idea! I doubt you would need chemo with that path report, and it seems that's what your surgeon thought. You probably do not need to see an onc. I just suggested it because sometimes we need to find out more, and have someone who KNOWS tell us what's up, and then we can sleep easy. Or maybe the onc will have an opinion about radiation that will help you. I guess I see the onc as an additional information gathering resource for you, someone who sees this all the time and can weigh in on your options. And, I would not feel stupid about going there (see, I can read your mind!) to get a consult - you will probably be a bright spot in the onc's day, since you have such a good report. I agree, legal action is an emotional drain, that's why I am ignoring that for myself. I see that there are no hormone receptor/her2 results. Maybe they didn't do those tests because the lump was so small, that it's not an issue, and maybe that's the same reason for no node dissection. I still would ask though. They still have all that tissue so they can do more tests if something was forgotten. While it is true that if you have radiation in that breast, you won't be able to have expander/implant put in in the unlikely event that bc comes back in that breast, please remember that there are other methods of reconstruction that work quite well, including DIEP (which sounds really good). And, you said that your skin is too thin for short radiation and keeps tearing. So maybe, even without radiation, it would not do well with an implant, so perhaps you aren't really giving up all that much. I think that in your case, the only alternative to lump+rads would be a mastectomy. And it would be a shame to lose your breast and nipple if you do not have to. Dona, you have much to think about, but it sounds like your prognosis is good, and I am happy for you. Best, Rachel",

If you have a smell, you should go to your gynecologist if it is from the breast, or to your regular doctor. Besides the lumps, things that you should look for are changes in the appearance of your breasts - bumps, dents, your nipple being at a different angle, discharge from your nipples. And lumps. Do a monthly breast exam. In addition, sometimes you cannot see or feel anything unusual, but you can have cancer. So you have to go to your gynecologist at least once a year, and start getting mammograms at age 35 or 40, for a baseline, and then every year or whatever is right for your age. If your family has a history of breast cancer, you should tell your gynecologist and perhaps get a mammogram earlier.

      "Content": "Dona, The pathology reports from your lumpectomy show all the information. I am surprised that your surgeon did not share it with you. You should have gotten a copy of it. I would call the surgeon's office and make sure that they sent the information to the radiation oncologist, then I would demand a copy be sent to you as well. I had a mastectomy, so I don't know how it goes with lumpectomies, but I am surprised that they did not do any node dissection. Maybe because it was so small? But not having nodes removed does not necessarily mean that the nodes were clean. I would ask your surgeon why she did not do the nodes and if you are not satisfied with the answer, talk to another surgeon. You can always have it done now. I wonder if an MRI would be helpful to you, to determine if there is more cancer in the lumpectomy breast. I say this because my mammograms only showed microcalcifications and ambiguous suspicious things, but the MRI showed 3 distinct tumors. So sometimes, it's a better diagnostic tool. It does sound like you are not getting the best information from your surgeon. Maybe she is doing everything absolutely correctly, but just hasn't explained it well to you. You need to persist if you don't understand completely. Make an appt just to discuss if you have to. Anyway, perhaps the radiation onc. will explain things better to you. She is the one that really makes the decision about radiation, and so can discuss it with you more fully. Have her go over the pathology results with you. Good luck. This is a very trying time, when you really do not understand what you have and what you have to do. Don't be afraid to get a second or a third opinion if you have any doubts at all. Rachel",

      "Content": "Hey, Kristie, I'll try to shed some light on all this as best I can. The facts you are giving are a bit confusing. I think I understand what is happening, but I am not sure. Here are my ideas based on what you posted, but to really understand what is going on, you need to get more info. If she is a Stage 3, then her breast cancer has NOT spread beyond the breast and the nodes. That means it is not in the cervix. If she had tumors in her cervix, she would be stage 4 - Stage 4 is when the cancer has spread outside the breast/nodes. So why the hysterectomy? You say that she is positive for the BRCA2 gene. Women with this gene (and especially a woman of 27, who has alot of estrogen in her system) are at great risk for the recurrence of breast cancer or another incidence of BC, because many types of BC kind of feed on estrogen, so the best thing is to get it out of your system forever. It is VERY common for women with the BRCA gene to take preventive measures to cut down the estrogen and also therefore the chances of recurrence or of spreading of the cancer. MANY women have their ovaries removed for this reason. You say your friend had a hysterectomy, which is removal of the ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes (I think!) - probably this is the reason for it, a bigger step than just the ovaries, but probably for that same reason. Or could it just have been the ovaries that were removed? I don't understand what you said about the spleen and gallbladder - did she have tumors there? If she did (although I never heard of tumors in the spleen and gall bladder from BC, usually it's in the ovaries, lungs, bones), then she is not stage 3. The stages are very well defined, you can look up what happens in each stage, either on this site or on komen.org or any other cancer site. Did she have chemo first, then a second set of chemo? Because 4-6 months of chemo is pretty standard treatment for BC. If you are talking about a second set of chemo AFTER the initial chemo may be with the chemo Herceptin, which is used for HER2+ women. A little explanation - in addition to STAGE, Breast Cancer is either hormone/estrogen positive(+) or negative(-) and it is either HER2+ or -. HER2+ needs additional chemo, called Herceptin, which does go on over a long period of time, and after the initial rounds of chemo. I don't know if she is going to die, but I'm also Stage 3, and alive and kicking 4 years after my diagnosis, mastectomy, very aggressive chemo and radiation. I am in great health, and not planning on dying anytime soon unless I overdose on chocolate. You can help her by being a good friend. By listening when she wants to talk, and being silent when she doesn't feel like it. You can do her shopping, bring her food, bring her videos, sit with her and find things to laugh about. You can clean her house, drive her places. You can treat her like a person, your friend, who just happens to have cancer, rather than treating her like a disease or a person who is going to die. She's not going to, not soon, anyway. Be sensitive, be helpful, but don't be a pain in the a** and don't intrude on her space. It's all about her, it's not about you or your worry. Good luck, you're a good friend to worry. Now, just go and be a good friend. Alot of people are probably so freaked out they are afraid to talk to her. She'll be needing people around who can be normal with her. Rachel",

In my case, I KNOW that that is not true. The reason in my case was my insurance. I have a $500 maximum for prescriptions per year. Anyway, my onc usually prescribes the neupogen and the patients self-inject at home. However, if they did it that way for me (either dispensed it to me, or if they gave me a prescription for the neupogen), the insurance company interprets that as a prescription, and it would count towards my prescription maximum. Which means that I would have to pay for it out of pocket, since I quickly ran out of prescription benefits (anti-nausea Emend cost me $282/chemo, so I maxed out almost immediately). Neupogen is very expensive. So the only way that insurance would cover my neupogen is if I had it injected by a medical person - then it didn't count as a prescription, it counted as a covered procedure instead. My onc arranged for me to get my shots at a hospital out-patient facility very close to my house rather than go to his office which is farther and where I'd have to pay for parking. The onc was happy to make my life a bit easier by setting that up, and they didn't make any money on it. It was because of the insurance company, not the oncologist, and he didn't make any money off of it. No surprise, I despise my insurance company. I am self employed, so my choices in plans were quite limited.",

      "Content": "Mia, I don't know anything about the workings of it, but I had dose dense also, and had 7 neupogen shots after each of the first 7 chemos, and a Neulasta shot after the last one. (my doc gives only neupogen if there is only 2 weeks in between, won't give neulasta). I had my blood counts done each chemo day and once the day after the last neupogen each time (day 11), and my counts were fine each time. Perhaps you can do a google search on Neupogen/neulasta and contraindications. Or easier, grill your doc, and get a second opinion. I cannot understand why they would not give you the neupogen after a chemo, even if your counts were ok, since it's afterwards that they plummet.",

They should not hurt, as long as your PS does not overfill them on each visit. My PS asked me to concentrate and tell him when I felt tension as he was filling, and he stopped at that point. Each person differs a bit on how much they can take comfortably, and it probably varies each time. I usually took ibuprofin before or just after as a precautionary measure for pain, but never had any pain or discomfort. And I never had to take a second dose of ibuprofin. It's better to go for more small fillups than fewer large ones. I didn't restrict my activity in any way after the fillups. Take this off of your list of things to worry about! Rachel",

Here's what was written about this purported Hopkins story - you can find the full story at http://urbanlegends.about.com/librar...tic_dioxin.htm and there are more links there if you want to look further. \"This widely circulated email ? actual an updated version of an earlier message dating from 2002 ? not only contains inaccurate information, it is falsely attributed to a Johns Hopkins University newsletter. No such information was ever issued by any department of the university. To combat the inaccuracies, Professor Rolf Halden of Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health addressed the email's opening allegation in a special news release: OC&PA: What do you make of this recent email warning that claims dioxins can be released by freezing water in plastic bottles? RH: No. This is an urban legend. Freezing actually works against the release of chemicals. Chemicals do not diffuse as readily in cold temperatures, which would limit chemical release if there were dioxins in plastic, and we don?t think there are. \" There is further info on heating in some of the links, but that's also not dangerous.",

      "Content": "Hey, Sweetie, It's tragic that your friend died; I am so sorry for your loss. I realize that you were not best friends, but you were connected through your other friend, and we all sort of live in a web of interconnections. There are no rules about who can mourn for who, or how close a friend you have to be. You liked her, you admired her, you thought she was nice and funny. If you are affected, you are affected, you don't really get to choose. I think it probably would be bad taste to carry on in public as if you were best friends, since you don't want people to think you are attaching yourself to a tragedy for other reasons, but it's certainly ok to express your sadness and to mourn her. Just be genuine. Sometimes, it's only when someone is gone that we realize how much we liked or admired someone, when we feel a void within ourselves, and a regret that we had not spent more time with the person or appreciated them more. As to your friend, who was close with the girl who died, I cannot say how she will react. I would think that she is very sad now and trying to deal with it. But it's ok to talk to people when they are sad, if they feel like talking. I think that you can call her, and say something really simple like, hi, I've been thinking about you, this is so sad, and you were so close. I really don't know what to say, I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you ... If she wants to talk more, she will, if not, it's ok. You just want her to know that you care how she feels. It is hard to talk about these things, and it is harder when you are so young and, thank goodness, haven't had alot of experience with it. But I think that your friend will appreciate knowing that you care about her, and that you cared about the girl who died, and sometimes, that's all that's necessary. You don't have to pry, you don't have to tell her it will be ok, because it won't, not for a long time. If she wants to talk about her, you should listen. Really listen. If she wants to share her feelings, that will be good. But don't push. The other side of this is, if you don't call her, she may feel alone and abandoned. And maybe she really wants to talk about her friend. Another thing about this very tragic death, is of course that she is too young to die. It is very rare in our society for teenagers to die, and especially from a disease. It upsets what we think of as the natural order. Teenagers shouldn't get sick and die. Older people do, but kids don't. And when it does happen, it scares us. It particularly scares you when you are the same age. You feel like, this could have been me. This is not like the death of a grandparent. So it is certainly ok to mourn, to be sad. You may want to go to the funeral. And also, if you want, you can write a note to her parents. You can say that you liked her and shared a class with her, that she was nice, and she was funny, and that you regret not having known her better. These are nice things to do when someone dies, it helps the ones who are left. And you can write a note to your friend also. Sorry if I ramble. Rachel",

My path report said infiltrating DCIS. I grilled my doc, and he said emphatically that what I had was NOT IDC. Infiltrating DCIS is a higher grade than just DCIS, but it is not Invasive Ductal Carcenoma (IDC). Hope that helps. Be strong. She is going to get through this just fine!

My breast surgeon mentioned a CT scan and an ultrasound of the ovaries, but don't know what to do with that information. This doesn't seem like it's enough!

      "Content": "Dear Colazione, Of course it's ok that you start a new post. I'd like to welcome you to the board. I don't understand about the girl in your class - does she have 2 weeks to live? Good grief, please tell us what that is. I don't think that 16 is too young to have breast cancer, but I think that it is very rare for someone at your age. However, it can happen. So it is good that you are asking questions. This is a good time for you to learn to do breast self exams. And, no matter what we tell you here, this would probably be a good time to go to your doctor or find a gynecologist that you like, so you feel comfortable asking her questions as well. And just because you are young, don't let any doctor pooh pooh your legitimate concerns because you are young. Dappling is when the skin on your breast is, well, not wrinkled exactly, but maybe a bit dented, dimpled or ripple-y. Your breast should be pretty uniformly filled out, sort of rounded, without dips or dents or ripples, no matter if you are big or small breasted. Many women have breasts that don't match eachother exactly in size or shape, but the consistency and feel of them should be fairly similar. I also used to have that yellow stuff, like little grains or something, in my nipples, when I was young. It wasn't anything for me. I cannot tell you about the hard things you are feeling, it's hard to know exactly what that is. Some women have alot of benign (not cancerous) cysts, which are lumps that you may be able to feel. Usually, lumps are not cancer, but sometimes they are, so you have to get a doctor to look at them. Here's what I suggest for you to do. Go to a female gynecologist who is known for being nice and pleasant. Ask her to do a breast exam, and ask her to tell you how to do one on your own. Show her the places that you are worried about. Ask her about breast texture, and cysts. If there is anything at all that is wrong, she will take action. My theory is, don't worry, don't freak, go see an expert. Be well and healthy! Rachel",

      "Content": "I had 5 1/2 weeks of radiation and was not tired at all. No, correction, I took exactly 2 naps during the whole time! Worked throughout, too. No side effects except the skin burn. For about 2 weeks after radiation (and probably one week before it ends), the irradiated area will probably be burned, like a bad sunburn. Get her doctor to prescribe silver sulfadiazine for the burning, and alternate that with the moisturizer. She will not want to wear anything tight or scratchy until the skin goes back to normal, so she should prepare clothing that is soft, and bra/bra substitutes that are very comfortable. I don't think the drive should be anything different than it would be under normal circumstances. However, she should not be exposing the irradiated area to the sun, or at least not without lots of sunblock (ask the doctor!), so perhaps some light cover ups will be helpful. I'm sure that you will both be pleasantly surprised at how easy radiation is.",
