      "Content": "I If anyone out there knows, I would like to find out where to go, or whom to ask about needle biopsy...Especially the mammotone. I recently had a mammogram that showed more calcium deposits, since last year. My Gyn did a magnification, and told me I needed to go to a surgeon. He made the appt, and after seeing this surgeon, I was discussing what kind of biopsy we were talking about. I had a brochure of needle biopsies, and was wanting to have the most accurate one. This surgeon informed me that my 34b breasts were \"TOO SMALL\" to fit the mammotone, and has set me up for the most drastic surgeries, of removing the entire lump, which is only 3/8 inches. Does anyone out there know if breasts have to be a certain size in order to do a core biopsy?? I need some help, ASAP...If anyone knows the answer to this, I would appreciate a prompt reply, as this thing is scheduled for Jan 5th, next Wednesday, 2005. I am thinking of calling the whole thing off and getting another opinion...Please, please HELP....Patricia P. Smith aka [email protected], or [email protected] Thanks so much and good luck to all...Happy New Year!!",

      "Content": "I have opted for the excisional biopsy where they remove the entire lump...Given my family history, I called my cousin, a radiologist in Gulfport, Ms...He told me that since the lump was only 3/8 inches, that if I were HIS wife, he would want it OUT completely. My 2nd opinion from another surgeon, said he HOPED we would get it all, and he would leave a wire in in case we didn't. The key word here was HOPED...The first opinion was to remove the entire lump, and send it off..Not a guarantee that it won't be cancer, but seems more sensible to me, after talking to my cousin who has my best interest at heart...We are quite close...but thanks to all of you, that answered my questions..The only thing about the 1st surgeon, ladies, is that you CAN have a needle biopsy. The 2nd opinion was that you stood up, placed your breasts in two holes and they did it like that...It is better if you are larger than I am in the breasts, but it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE like the 1st surgeon told me...However, at this point, I don't want to EVER have to go through this again...Granted if it is cancer and they didn't get it all after removing the lump, I will have more surgery...I will NOT have chemo though...That stuff is poison...Best of luck, and thanks for all the concern and help...I will keep you posted...Hugs...Patricia (Pat)",
