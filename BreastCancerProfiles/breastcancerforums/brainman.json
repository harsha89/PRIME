      "Content": "It does sound like you are experiencing depressing... for good reason! Have you told your medical team about your feelings? Maybe an anti-depressant would help you to enjoy your children for whatever time you still have left. Yes, I have been through a lot. Mine was originally a low grade glioma (grade II). It treated with chemotherapy. I went for over 13 years before it recurred in 2005. When it recurred it was a grade III. In 2005, I had everything: surgery, chemo, and radiation. My last MRI just last week showed no signs of cancer... just scar tissue from the surgery. However, that does not mean that I do not have my own \"demons\" to fight. I am bipolar with moderate mood swings. I know what depression is like. Sometimes, I feel so bad that I just wish I had not survived. Although at one time I was actively suicidal, I am not now. However, I tend to be \"passively\" suicidal when depressed (wishing that my cancer would return and kill me, for example). You hang in there and I will too .",

      "Content": "It does sound like you are experiencing depressing... for good reason! Have you told your medical team about your feelings? Maybe an anti-depressant would help you to enjoy your children for whatever time you still have left. Yes, I have been through a lot. Mine was originally a low grade glioma (grade II). It treated with chemotherapy. I went for over 13 years before it recurred in 2005. When it recurred it was a grade III. In 2005, I had everything: surgery, chemo, and radiation. My last MRI just last week showed no signs of cancer... just scar tissue from the surgery. However, that does not mean that I do not have my own \"demons\" to fight. I am bipolar with moderate mood swings. I know what depression is like. Sometimes, I feel so bad that I just wish I had not survived. Although at one time I was actively suicidal, I am not now. However, I tend to be \"passively\" suicidal when depressed (wishing that my cancer would return and kill me, for example). You hang in there and I will too .",

      "Content": "Thel, I have never had breast cancer but I have found myself in a similar situation with my primary brain cancer. I am not sure there is a \"right\" answer; we do what we can with the information that we have. Back in 1992, I too opted not to have surgery. In my case, I opted (against all odds) to try chemo for 2-3 months. If it did not work, then I would reconsider surgery. But my cancer was slow growing with absolutely no chance to metastasize. Breast cancer with Liver mets is something totally different. The fact that it has already metastasized does make the decision process a little easier; you are not trying to keep it from spreading further, you are going for local control. My hunch is that, with close monitoring, you should be OK going with just radiation at this point. Keep a close check on your overall health. At the first sign of jaundice, get back to your oncologist's office. You are in my thoughts and prayers.",

      "Content": "Hi AngieLynn, Unfortunately, I cannot answer questions 1 and 2 because I simply do not know. I do know the answer to question 3 and can take an educated guess on question 4. Q3: Why did she order an ultrasound in addition to the mammogram? A: It is very common to use ultrasound in conjunction with a mammogram to examine breasts for cancer... not unusual or surprising at all. Q4: What is different that indicates I don't need the biopsy now? A: My guess is based on what the doctor said: \"No suspicious persistent nodularity is seen on today's study although the nodule still is seen on the medial breast.\" In other words, nothing has changed since your last mammogram and biopsy. Again, it is not surprising at all that they are not doing another biopsy at this time. Unfortunately, (and this may at least be in part an answer to question 2), this does leave your cancer status up in the air and you will have to be monitored on a routine basis for any change. Do you do monthly breast self examinations? If not, then you need to start. If you don't know how, follow this link: http://cancerforums.net/viewtopic.php?t=6499 God be with you and give you peace.",

So it is really difficult for me to advise you on the need for an MRI. I agree with Nancy that it probably would not be diagnostically helpful at this time. And there are several other factors to consider. MRIs are not cheep especially if your health insurance deems that it is something not done for your situation. I am sure that is the last thing on your mind right now, but it may factor into your decision. Your peace of mind is probably more important than cost of the MRI. If it will give you added peace of mind, then it might be worth it even if it does not show anything new. I do agree with Nancy and personally would not have an MRI. But that is just my opinion.

Your history of a moderately high Breast Cancer with metastasis to the lymph nodes does make it possible that it is now in your lungs. But the only way to know for sure is by doing a biopsy. I do not mean to increase your worry, just to express my own hopes for you to get a biopsy as soon as possible. If it has gone to your lungs, it will now be called a state 4 Breast Cancer.

Between now and the mammogram there is not much you can do, so read all that you can about breasts and breast abnormalities. Right now, no one can say what these \"lumps\" are. We all hope that the are not cancer. The good news is that breast cancers are treatable and you detected the lumps on a routine monthly self examination. So you caught the change early. You remain in my thoughts and prayers.",

The second issue for me is: \"OK, you have been exposed to chickenpox... What can be done about it?\" What I am saying is, what can the doctors do now other than to keep a watch for chickenpox to develop? Talk to your medical team as soon as possible... In fact, call the office tomorrow and tell the nurse what happened. They may want to put you on some kind of medication to help your immune system. It is probably not a life threatening situation, but the sooner your medical team can address it, the better off you will be. Let us know what you find out. Good luck.",

Maybe an anti-depressant would help you to enjoy your children for whatever time you still have left. Yes, I have been through a lot. Mine was originally a low grade glioma (grade II). It treated with chemotherapy. I went for over 13 years before it recurred in 2005. When it recurred it was a grade III. In 2005, I had everything: surgery, chemo, and radiation. My last MRI just last week showed no signs of cancer... just scar tissue from the surgery. However, that does not mean that I do not have my own \"demons\" to fight. I am bipolar with moderate mood swings. I know what depression is like. Sometimes, I feel so bad that I just wish I had not survived. Although at one time I was actively suicidal, I am not now. However, I tend to be \"passively\" suicidal when depressed (wishing that my cancer would return and kill me, for example). You hang in there and I will too .",

The doctor does have a responsibility to maintain your mother's medical information private. The way around that is to have her name you as her health care surrogate. That way, you can have full access to her medical information. If your hunch is right... the cancer is a grade 4 and the doctors only recommend palliative care... it does mean that their objective is to make her last months a little easier on her. They do not expect the treatment to \"cure\" her, just control the complications caused by it. When was your mother's breast cancer diagnosed? You and your mother are in my thoughts and prayers.",

I think that is the reason they did the ultrasound... to check for mets to the liver and other organs. Your mother may live the rest of her life with no more cancer. However, she will always life with the uncertainty. It is something that she will have to watch closely for the rest of her life. However, like Maximise said, she should \"try to live life to the full and not keep looking over her shoulder\" all the time. I live with the same attitude about my brain cancer. Odds are that it will return and I do keep a close watch on my overall health. However, I am trying to make the most out of the life I still have. God bless you and your mother.",

      "Content": "Ok, starting from the beginning: I am glad you have already had a mammogram and that you obviously asked for a copy of the test results!! So few people do that and therefore do not have some of the vital information they need for an informed decision. Q: \"don't these radiologists talk to each other?\" A: Usually, yes. They at least read each other's reports. Q: \"why would my doctor jump the gun and immediately recommend a biopsy instead of considering extra views first?\" A: The simple answer is: Better safe than sorry. They want to find out if it is cancer as soon as possible. The more complex answer is scheduling all the scans and the biopsy. It may be that they WILL have the results from the additional scans before the biopsy. Q: \"Can a sonogram pick up calcifications very clearly?\" A: I do not know how well a sonogram can detect calcifications but I do think that a sonogram can detect them. My answer is not that I doubt that a sonogram can detect them it is that I do not know how small of a calcification it can detect. Q: \"Can you have calcifications inside a cyst, and what can that mean?\" A: The simple answer is that I do not know the answer . However, as I interpret the test results, the microcalcifications are not in the cyst but in the same area. I think the doctors are rather certain that the lump you feel is a \"simple cyst\". However, the microcalcifications might be signs of cancer and therefore a biopsy is warranted. Q: \"Should I go ahead and schedule a biopsy AND do the additional views, or wait and see what the next reports say?\" A: ABSOLUTELY!!! You do not know how long it will be before the doctors can actually do the biopsy nor how long it will take to get the additional tests. So do at least start the scheduling process as soon as possible! I am sorry to hear that your mother died of ovarian cancer! I am sure that fact increases your anxiety about your prospect of having cancer as well. However, the good news is that breast cancer when found early is a lot easier to cure than most other cancers. I am sure that Nancy and other women will also respond to your posts with better information. I just hate to see anyone not receive a prompt reply. I will keep you in my thoughts and my prayers. Keep us informed.",

Someone there might know more about breast cancer mets to the brain. Second, it does not sound like brain cancer because the typical brain cancer does not present itself with head pressure. In order for a brain cancer to be causing enough pressure for you to feel it, it would have to be so large that it would be causing all sort of other problems as well. Having said that, you still need to continue to work with your medical team in order to identify the cause of this pressure. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Ok, starting from the beginning: I am glad you have already had a mammogram and that you obviously asked for a copy of the test results!! So few people do that and therefore do not have some of the vital information they need for an informed decision. Q: \"don't these radiologists talk to each other?\" A: Usually, yes. They at least read each other's reports. Q: \"why would my doctor jump the gun and immediately recommend a biopsy instead of considering extra views first?\" A: The simple answer is: Better safe than sorry. They want to find out if it is cancer as soon as possible. The more complex answer is scheduling all the scans and the biopsy. It may be that they WILL have the results from the additional scans before the biopsy. Q: \"Can a sonogram pick up calcifications very clearly?\" A: I do not know how well a sonogram can detect calcifications but I do think that a sonogram can detect them. My answer is not that I doubt that a sonogram can detect them it is that I do not know how small of a calcification it can detect. Q: \"Can you have calcifications inside a cyst, and what can that mean?\" A: The simple answer is that I do not know the answer . However, as I interpret the test results, the microcalcifications are not in the cyst but in the same area. I think the doctors are rather certain that the lump you feel is a \"simple cyst\". However, the microcalcifications might be signs of cancer and therefore a biopsy is warranted. Q: \"Should I go ahead and schedule a biopsy AND do the additional views, or wait and see what the next reports say?\" A: ABSOLUTELY!!! You do not know how long it will be before the doctors can actually do the biopsy nor how long it will take to get the additional tests. So do at least start the scheduling process as soon as possible! I am sorry to hear that your mother died of ovarian cancer! I am sure that fact increases your anxiety about your prospect of having cancer as well. However, the good news is that breast cancer when found early is a lot easier to cure than most other cancers. I am sure that Nancy and other women will also respond to your posts with better information. I just hate to see anyone not receive a prompt reply. I will keep you in my thoughts and my prayers. Keep us informed.",

There are major differences between the two not the least are different treatment option and different prognosis. It is very hard to say whether or not her symptoms of the end. Any tumor in the brain as the potential of causing those. It just depends on the exact location and size of the tumor. In terms of the end drawing near, I would be more concerned about liver failure. Although the tumor on her brain can defiantly kill her, it will probably have a greater impact on her quality of life. If the tumor actually is the cause of her death, she will probably just start to sleep more and more and have breathing problems. The only good news is the she will most likely have a relatively peaceful death. I hope I am not being too blunt. You and your aunt are in my prayers and thoughts.",

Certainly, you should be doing monthly breast self-examinations.

If a lot of women in your family have had breast cancers, the doctors might consider going ahead with a mastectomy. However, this is rather rare. As Nancy said, with a lump that small, most doctors will be inclined to do a lumpectomy first. If they find any cancer, then the decision of a masterctomy will need to be made.",

The fact that you are so young does make it a little more difficult to identify. I hope the ultrasound will help diagnose this lump. However, as Nancy (Muttsmom) will tell you when she replies, if not offered, insist on a biopsy of the lump. If it is cancer, check and see if your husband could come home. The Red Cross can facilitate this for you if the military channels do not work. You are in my thoughts and prayers.",

As you said, your post is too vague to say anymore about her prognosis. One question, what kind of pills is she taking? Not all chemotherapy is given through an IV... some are, in fact, pills. Maybe she IS getting therapy. I ask this question because you said that the pills will make her weak and sick. If the pills are not a form of chemotherapy, then the untreated liver mets will be the cause for her condition. Her liver may eventually stop working at least partially so toxins will build up in her blood. I do hope she will see a specialist. That decision is hers to make and I am not so sure that I would not make the same decision if I was in her place. But I would see a specialist to make sure that my decision was based on good medical advice.",

I did see the radiation oncologist weekly for about three months. After a year, my visits to my oncologist ended. My routine care is through my neurosurgeon, neurologist, and GP. I see the neurologist and GR once a year and the neurosurgeon about once every nine months for an MRI. I expect that he too will only want to see me once a year soon. My point is this, the frequency of visits depends on a number of things but in general it decreases with time and on how fast the patient recovers.",

The fact that you are so young does make it a little more difficult to identify. I hope the ultrasound will help diagnose this lump. However, as Nancy (Muttsmom) will tell you when she replies, if not offered, insist on a biopsy of the lump. If it is cancer, check and see if your husband could come home. The Red Cross can facilitate this for you if the military channels do not work. You are in my thoughts and prayers.",

The symptoms you describe are usually the ones I list when people ask: \"How do I know that the end is near? Maybe your family does not know how serious your mother's condition is? I can totally appreciate your wish for peace and quiet. Rather than yelling at them, maybe have a family conference to talk about what you need from them would give better results. It would also give them time to express their feelings. Be sure to listen to them as well. Is hospice involved in your mother's care? If not, you might want to get a doctor to make that order for her. They can also help with your family, helping them understand what is happening. Involve your family in the care of your mother. You might have to be direct. Some people need to be told what to do, so specific orders might help them to focus on your mother and less on the football game. Patricia, you and your mother are in my thoughts and prayers. PS. I moved your topic to the Breast Cancer forum because your mother actually has breast cancer and because you WILL get more replies here.",

Beyond the possibility of it being benign, the reality of breast cancer is that it is quite treatable if caught early.

Have you had a mastectomy, lumpectomy, or any other surgery? 3. What chemotherapy are you on? Also, as best as you can, answer the questions posted by Dr. Leo on the following thread: http://cancerforums.net/viewtopic.php?t=626 We are here for you any anyway that we can!

The fact that you are so young does make it a little more difficult to identify. I hope the ultrasound will help diagnose this lump. However, as Nancy (Muttsmom) will tell you when she replies, if not offered, insist on a biopsy of the lump. If it is cancer, check and see if your husband could come home. The Red Cross can facilitate this for you if the military channels do not work. You are in my thoughts and prayers.",

Some breast cancer produce a larger than normal amount of a protein commonly called Her2. This means that researcher can find chemotherapies that will attack those cancer cells and leave other cells virtually alone. So, yes, Her2+ is good news. Surgery is her best option. What about the lumpectomy makes you nervous? The potential of having to do a second surgery? Wondering if she should not have a mastectomy?

Usually, it is done before, but it can be done prost biopsy. The die flows from the injection point, through the lympatic system, to the nodes, and attaches itself to cancerous cells. So it does not matter whether the lump in your breast is still present or not. I think I am right but you should confirm this with your doctor. Good luck with the biopsy. I hope it turns out to be non-cancerous.",

I can say with 100% confidence that there is no way for anyone to say whether it is benign or malignant without a biopsy. I can also say, although with less certainty, that the \"30 years or older\" is a limit based on statistics; most breast cancers occur in women over 30. Therefore, the logic goes, why expose women under 30 to the danger of radiation from a Mammogram? Nevertheless, THERE ARE women under 30 who do have breast cancer, so that should not be a hard and fast rule. A doctor should be able to order an mammogram if their is any question about breast cancer. As for breast still growing in women under 30, while that might be true, that really should not be a factor. A Mammogram of a woman under 30 would not be good as a \"baseline\" against which to compare future Mammograms but still a Mammogram would show an abnormality. Well, I think I have muddied up the water and I let others who know more about breast cancers correct me where I am wrong . You and your fiancee are in my thoughts and prayers. Do keep us informed.",

What do I need to do now to make sure my kids are provided for? What do I need to do now so that my kids will remember me? It sounds like your mother-in-law is having some of the same thoughts. In my personal and professional experience, this is a normal change in how we view our lives. It took me about a year to get passed that phase. Depression is also very common... especially in cases that are entering the \"chronic\" stage. Talk to her medical team about this issue. They can put her on a mild anti-depressant that can help her over her depression. Nic, your message just breaks my heart! I can hear the pain you are also feeling. Trying to hid your own pain from your husband may not be what he needs. I am not saying that you should cry all the time... but he does need to know how deeply your mother-in-law's cancer is affecting you. He does need to know that he is not alone in his fears for his mother's life. As for your children, they probably know more than you think. Kids pick up on signs that things are not right somehow. Not communicating with them lets them imagine all kinds of things... including that their parents might not be getting along so well. I do not know your children and it very much depends on their personalities, however, I suggest that you and your husband have a talk with them and explain that their grandmother is very sick and might die and that this is the cause of any worries they might be feeling. I will continue to keep you and your family in my prayers and thoughts.",

The symptoms you describe are usually the ones I list when people ask: \"How do I know that the end is near? Maybe your family does not know how serious your mother's condition is? I can totally appreciate your wish for peace and quiet. Rather than yelling at them, maybe have a family conference to talk about what you need from them would give better results. It would also give them time to express their feelings. Be sure to listen to them as well. Is hospice involved in your mother's care? If not, you might want to get a doctor to make that order for her. They can also help with your family, helping them understand what is happening. Involve your family in the care of your mother. You might have to be direct. Some people need to be told what to do, so specific orders might help them to focus on your mother and less on the football game. Patricia, you and your mother are in my thoughts and prayers. PS.

I do not know whether she has cancer or not but it definitely could be a terribly advanced cancer that has grown so much that it is secreting some form of liquid through either her nipple or even the skin itself. It may also have spread into her lungs which explains the cough. I have only heard of one case that was as advanced as what I am describing to you and what, quit frankly, sound like what is happening with your mother-in-law. In that other case, the woman had also refused to see a doctor until it was far too late. I heard about her in a tumor board review of her case trying to come up with options for treating her. I do not remember what they eventually did for her. The only thing you can do is violate whatever code of family behavior is keeping this a secret and tell your mother-in-law to go see a doctor at once. Initially, you may be resented by other family members but they will soon see that what you are doing is out of love for your mother-in-law.

That would make sense to me because: [list=1][*]The breasts are glands (Adenocarcinomas are glad cancers)[*]\"Extracapsular Extensions\" or ECE is a prognostic factor with Breast cancers and a few other cancers[*]Immunoreativity is a test the do with breast cancer patience to see if their tumors might react well to immunotherapy[*]ER and HMFG2 are two other thing the test for with Breast Cancer patients. [list=1] I don't know how to \"add the up\" either. I will move your post to the Breast Cancer Forum. You will get more answers there.",

As of what you can do: I tend to be one of those people who would rather overstep someone else's boundaries and be told to move back than not go far enough and have people ask \"where is he?\" If I where you, I would start by visiting your MIL as often as possible. Then, when she returns home, I would try to help her around the house, do chores for her, run errands for her, etceteras. If you do too much, she or someone will tell you to back off. But that is just me. Best wishes.",

      "Content": "Right now there is very, very little that you can \"do\" or that she feels like you can do for her since you and your sister are still in shock. Her going at 100mph is a normal way for some people to deal with the shock. Just hang of for a bumpy ride until she starts coming out of the shock. Just \"be\" with her so that she will know that she is not alone. After she starts coming out of the shock, then there are things you can \"do.\" What I often suggest (just did this to someone else) is to help your sister identify the things the she need to do and the thing she would like to do with whatever time she has left. Would she like to go somewhere, see someone, talk with someone... ? Even if it is something as simple as eating a special meal, you can find ways to bring joy to the time she still has. You might also help her to document her life story. This can either be an actual written document or in these days a video taped account of major life events. I guess what I am saying is that you can be your sister's personal \"dream factory,\" helping her to define some realistic goals and then, to whatever extent possible, to assist her in achieving those goals. I know that when my mother died and then when my father died, they wanted to go to their church as often as they could. I helped them do this even though I belong to another church. It was something that gave a lot of joy to both of them so I was willing to take them. That is just a suggestion. With help from your sister, you can identify the things that can bing joy to her life. You and your sister are still in my thoughts and prayers.",

The danger is that she might have complications develop during the cruse. Let us assume the worse scenario. Let us assume that your Mother-in-law will die soon anyhow. Where would she rather be: on a beach in Mexico or in a hospital bed? If she is on the beach, she might die in a lovely place but far from her friends and most of her family... and far from medical treatment by those who know here cancer the best. On the other hand, if she dies in a hospital bed, she will die in a sterile environment having missed a trip that she has been anticipating for some time now. Assuming the best, she will have a lovely trip to Mexico with those she most loves and still be able to return home for any further treatment having only lost the 6 days of the trip. So, you see why this is such a personal decision that we on the forum can only voice our own opinions. Good luck. I will be thinking about you and your family.",

I do not know whether she has cancer or not but it definitely could be a terribly advanced cancer that has grown so much that it is secreting some form of liquid through either her nipple or even the skin itself. It may also have spread into her lungs which explains the cough. I have only heard of one case that was as advanced as what I am describing to you and what, quit frankly, sound like what is happening with your mother-in-law. In that other case, the woman had also refused to see a doctor until it was far too late. I heard about her in a tumor board review of her case trying to come up with options for treating her. I do not remember what they eventually did for her. The only thing you can do is violate whatever code of family behavior is keeping this a secret and tell your mother-in-law to go see a doctor at once. Initially, you may be resented by other family members but they will soon see that what you are doing is out of love for your mother-in-law. I cannot begin to express how sorry I am for you and your whole family. You and your mother-in-law are in my thoughts and prayers.",

Are they just breast cancer in five different areas of her body? That is what I think you mean because 5 primary cancers are very, very rare if not unique. I do not know what all \"changed\" to make the doctor come to a new diagnosis. His she had additional tests run? Did the doctor she take a second look (or, God help him, a first look) at scans? I can hear your frustration and anger. It is one thing to adjust to the fact that you have cancer but do not need chemo. But then to have to adjust to the fact that you (or in this case, your mother) need to have chemo must feel like the rug has been pulled out from under your feet; you are still trying to regain your balance.

I do not know whether she has cancer or not but it definitely could be a terribly advanced cancer that has grown so much that it is secreting some form of liquid through either her nipple or even the skin itself. It may also have spread into her lungs which explains the cough. I have only heard of one case that was as advanced as what I am describing to you and what, quit frankly, sound like what is happening with your mother-in-law. In that other case, the woman had also refused to see a doctor until it was far too late. I heard about her in a tumor board review of her case trying to come up with options for treating her. I do not remember what they eventually did for her. The only thing you can do is violate whatever code of family behavior is keeping this a secret and tell your mother-in-law to go see a doctor at once. Initially, you may be resented by other family members but they will soon see that what you are doing is out of love for your mother-in-law. I cannot begin to express how sorry I am for you and your whole family. You and your mother-in-law are in my thoughts and prayers.",

As of what you can do: I tend to be one of those people who would rather overstep someone else's boundaries and be told to move back than not go far enough and have people ask \"where is he?\" If I where you, I would start by visiting your MIL as often as possible. Then, when she returns home, I would try to help her around the house, do chores for her, run errands for her, etceteras. If you do too much, she or someone will tell you to back off. But that is just me. Best wishes.",

But this is not the case for metastatic tumors. In most cases of metastatic tumors, the best option is chemotherapy since the cancer cells can be anywhere. But, again, there are some exceptions to that general rule. If the metastatic tumor is causing pain or is an imminent threat to life AND can be safely removed, then surgery is again a viable option. I know, this is not a very clear answer but the question is more complex that you might think. Keep working with her own medical team to find out what is best for your wife.

Others have asked the same question already. Have you used our search function yet? I can give you what I know. Usually, radiation of any kind is not given to people with any metastatic cancer except for palliative care reasons. I would assume that is why they are suggesting it to your wife. The problem with radiation is that it does not just destroy the cancer; it also affects other, healthy tissues. If they irradiate her lower spine, the radiation will affect her bowels, kidneys, liver, reproductive organs.... This does not mean that she will have problems in the future; it just means that she has a higher likelihood that if she did nothing. Targeted radiation or Stereotactic modalities like Cyber Knife are significantly better in minimizing this \"collateral damage.\" It aims lower levels of radiation from several different direction. The only place(s) that receive a full dose is where the beams cross. Other organs still get some radiation but it is at a significantly lower leave. I had it to my brain in 2005-2006. I opted for it rather than whole brain radiation for this very reason. There is some very significant limitations to Stereotactic Radiation. I can think of two: Size of the Tumor. The tumor cannot exceed a certain limit in terms of size. I am not sure what that limit is; I just know that there is one. For palliative care, they still might use it because they are just wanting to get some level of control and pain relief from it so that it really does not matter that much if they get it all. Number of Tumors. It is not practical to irradiate more than one tumor. They might do it anyhow but that is a consideration and they usually do not recommend it. As I said, I hope others will also reply and can fill in what I do not know or remember. You and your wife are in my thoughts and prayers.",

The biggest difference is that it is easy to be objective on the forum where it is almost impossible to not be subjective when dealing with a friend. The best thing you can do for your friend is to listen to her. If you truly listen to her, she will let you know what she needs, even if she does not specifically ask for anything from you. Just your friendship will be of great help. You can also encourage her... breast cancer IS NOT the death sentence that it once was. Yes, she may not live to 93 but she might not die of cancer either. I am sure you have meet many women on this forum who are \"long term\" breast cancer survivors. Their stories can be a true source of encouragement to your friend and to you as you encourage her. I am not suggesting that you become a cheerleader for your friend, just a quiet source of courage for her when she has a hard time finding any hope.

As of what you can do: I tend to be one of those people who would rather overstep someone else's boundaries and be told to move back than not go far enough and have people ask \"where is he?\" If I where you, I would start by visiting your MIL as often as possible. Then, when she returns home, I would try to help her around the house, do chores for her, run errands for her, etceteras. If you do too much, she or someone will tell you to back off. But that is just me. Best wishes.",

Family history is not a \"death sentence.\" It is just an indicator that says you have a higher than normal probability of getting breast cancer at some point in your life. My mother's family also has a large number of women with breast cancer. However, my mother lived for 80 years and never got it. I do not thing the fact that your mother had a rare form of breast cancer makes any difference. In fact, if it does make a difference the difference may well be in your favor (since it IS rare, the odds of you getting it are automatically lower). However, you are doing the right thing by starting now to monitor yourself. You should be doing breast self examinations if you have not up to this point. You should probably have a base-line mammogram so that after future mammograms your doctor will have something to compare and see if there are any changes. You are in my thoughts and prayers. Keep us informed.",

Are you a mother already or will this be your first time? Adopting a 13 year old girl will be hard but if your friend thinks that you can do it, that should be encouraging to you. I am not saying it will be easy. That time in any young girl's (or boy's) life can be very traumatic. Add on top of that the death of her mother and moving away from her home town to live with you will really be hard on that young girl... not to even say how hard it will be on you! If I were you, I would try to find a therapist who works with children and start to talk with the therapist now to learn what to expect. Express your anxieties about this whole situation so that whenever the young girl does come to live with you, you do not have to deal with your own anxieties as much and so that you understand some of the thing she is feeling. To me, it does sound like you are on the right path. Coming to this site is a first step in the right direction to learn how to cope with this situation. Do you have your own support network in place? A clarification: Does your friend have a primary breast cancer that has metastasized to her lungs and hip? That is the usual path. If so, it is an aggressive cancer. However, with aggressive treatment, she could live for several more months if not years. I am afraid that there is no cure for any kind of cancer... just ways to control it and put it into remission for a while. I do not mean to be flippant about your situation, but your story does remind my of the movie \"Beaches\" in that your best friend is dying and leaving her daughter into your care. She must know something about you or she would not entrust you with something so special. You and your friend and her daughter are in my thoughts and prayers.",

Add on top of that the death of her mother and moving away from her home town to live with you will really be hard on that young girl... not to even say how hard it will be on you! If I were you, I would try to find a therapist who works with children and start to talk with the therapist now to learn what to expect. Express your anxieties about this whole situation so that whenever the young girl does come to live with you, you do not have to deal with your own anxieties as much and so that you understand some of the thing she is feeling. To me, it does sound like you are on the right path. Coming to this site is a first step in the right direction to learn how to cope with this situation. Do you have your own support network in place? A clarification: Does your friend have a primary breast cancer that has metastasized to her lungs and hip? That is the usual path. If so, it is an aggressive cancer. However, with aggressive treatment, she could live for several more months if not years. I am afraid that there is no cure for any kind of cancer... just ways to control it and put it into remission for a while. I do not mean to be flippant about your situation, but your story does remind my of the movie \"Beaches\" in that your best friend is dying and leaving her daughter into your care. She must know something about you or she would not entrust you with something so special. You and your friend and her daughter are in my thoughts and prayers.",

Did they even do a biopsy when they diagnosed her with breast cancer? Although it sounds like cancer, it might not be if they did not confirm it with a biopsy. I cannot really express to you how I feel about this on the forum but I am very angry with her medical team if they did not do a biopsy of this \"what ever it is\" on her lung . I am glad that you got a chance to talk directly with your friend. Although, as I said before, a true cure is unrealistic, I do hope and wish for your friend to still have a long and meaningful life.

I know that there might be some cultural difference so I do not mean to offend you so just remember that I am speaking from the USA culture. In the USA, informed consent is very important. It is illegal to treat or to withhold treatment to a person without their full knowledge and consent. From our perspective you do not have the option to tell your mother that she is just having normal back pain and to give her medication to mask the truth. On the issue of pain. Tumors in the spine are notorious for the pain they cause. With time, your mother will need to be monitored so that they can give her some very strong pain medication. Even then, she might not be totally pain free. Finally, I suspect that what she has is a recurrence of her Breast Cancer which has metastasized (spread) to her spine. It is very common for Breast Cancer to spread. Good luck with your mother.",

This is extremely a detail that you should be aware of. The treatment options for a primary brain cancer are vastly different from those the work with metastatic breast cancer. I am not sure what treatments are available to her. I do not think brain surgery or radiation to the brain will help her and certainly not prolong her life. I do know that Temodar is the gold standard treatment for a glioma (a family of primary brain cancers). I have never heard of it being used with metastatic breast cancers. I cannot be sure and this advice might to totally wrong but I would NOT \"sit tight.\" You should find a doctor who will be more aggressive. No way will just eating better help with her cancer! Of course, it might be that the cancer is just too far advanced and there is nothing anyone can do. But the doctors should have told her this so that SHE could make an informed decision. Novalis is a rather new form of stereotactic radiation treatment for brain tumors. I do not know if it help will all tumors in the brain or just primary brain tumors. Even so, treating the tumor in her brain will not help in the long run. I wish your mother-in-law well. I hope she finds a treatment that helps.",

      "Content": "Hi tinamah, I am so sorry for your diagnosis!! You have come to the right place. I am sure others on this forum can give you better support and information about you cancer. Ask specific questions and we will do our best to answer them. You do not know who is doing the post surgery treatment? You should already have a medical oncologist. He/she should be (but not always is) the central person driving your cancer treatments and personally taking responsibility for your chemotherapy. The \"where\" part of your question depends on exactly what chemo your medical oncologist places you on and your overall health. As for what went wrong, that is a impossible question to answer. There is no 100% correlation between any one thing and most cancers. Even the correlation between skin cancer UV light is not 100%. What causes invasive ductal carcinoma in one person but not in another, remains an inexact science at best. Having said that, I hear your anger and frustration. You have the right to be angry and I certainly can understand it. Even though I do not have a history of breast cancer, I do have a history of cancer. I have ask what did I do to get brain cancer for years and not found any conclusive answer. Certainly, I have some suspicions. My mother died due to a GBM and several other members of my family have had different types of cancers. I worked with chemicals for 7 years plus college and high school. I have probably ingested more than my share of toxins from the food I eat. However, none of these can explain my particular cancer to my total satisfaction. Over the years, I have come to accept that I will most likely never know. While not knowing is hard, I have come to the conclusion that even if I knew with 100% certainty what caused my cancer, I cannot go back and change anything. I still have to deal with the fact that I do (or at least did) have cancer. Please, feel more than free to post your questions. I am sure you will find others have asked the same questions and found answers... at least answers that have helped them to deal with their cancers. I will hold you in my thoughts and my prayers.",

Without a biopsy, it is really easy to understand how two doctors could feel the same lump and look and the same scans and come up with different conclusions. Most of the time, breast cancers are entirely curable if caught early so I would encourage you to go see the doctor. I know it is frightening but in the long run it is the best thing you can do for peace of mind and long life. I also checked out the link. While it is safe i.e. not a virus, it certainly is a joke! Too paranoid sounding to be believable. Plus it could potentially be an add for the guys book. I will leave the link but discourage anyone to believe in its message.",

Where your mammogram revealed a lump that your doctor's discounted as being nothing to worry about, Dorothy's mammogram (if I am reading correctly) do not show any abnormalities. Therefore, my question is: What and where will the do a biopsy? Nancy, I agree with your usual statement that lumps do not belong in a breast and should be removed. But can they remove something that they cannot see? That may be the reason for the wait and see attitude of your doctors Dorothy. Having said that, I would not wait to see a doctor. I would ask my medical team for a referral to see a specialist... especially if you have tenderness in any area of your breasts. That request will either do one of two things: It will either make your medical team more aware of your concern or it will result I you being seen by a specialist or both. My thoughts and prayers are with you.",

Those studies are listed but I too cannot find where the doctors find them. However, (I think I am right in saying this), once a drug is proven to be safe and effective for one purpose, it is not hard for a doctor to use it for an alternative purpose. The key words are \"safe and effective.\" Here is a link to MD Anderson's research. Unfortunately, only approved doctors can access the list. But other research centers have similar lists. For a lot of these research protocols you do not have to go to the center. Once your doctor is approved by the center, he/she can follow the protocol's guidelines and treat you locally. http://www.oncologyresearch.org/ows-doc/index.htm Good luck.",

I cannot really express to you how I feel about this on the forum but I am very angry with her medical team if they did not do a biopsy of this \"what ever it is\" on her lung . I am glad that you got a chance to talk directly with your friend. Although, as I said before, a true cure is unrealistic, I do hope and wish for your friend to still have a long and meaningful life.

On top of that, having a family history of breast cancer is not a good sign. However, there is some good news... they mailed you the result. I suspect they would have phoned you it there was any urgency about your condition. Look at the following link and give us any information you have: http://cancerforums.net/viewtopic.php?t=626 It is fairly basic information that will help us answer your questions better. Nancy (Muttsmon) will be better able to answer your question about signs you should be looking for. Again, I suspect that if you cannot feel a lump, other signs will either not exist or be so minor that you would ignore them under normal circumstances. Have you scheduled an appointment with your doctor? If you have not, do that Monday morning. It might take a while for him/her to be able to see you. And then he/she may refer you to an oncologist and that will take another while. If you do not get right on to scheduling, you will just end up worrying longer. Maybe there is nothing to worry about. I will be thinking about and praying for you. P.S. How is your son doing, Kathy?",
