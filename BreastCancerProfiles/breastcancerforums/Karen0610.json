    "Content": "Hi, I have Stage IV breast cancer with mets to the bone (since Fall of 06). Since early December, 07 I have had pressure in my head. This is in the front part of head when I bend over. I have NO pain, no headaches no nausea, or any other typical symptoms anywhere else in the body usually indicated for brain tumors. I had a CT scan on my sinuses, but nothing showed up. My onco doesn't think it's a tumor because he said it isn't the typical symptoms. It seems to be getting worse. Usually when I'm upright, I don't feel any pressure, (only occasionally now) and then it goes away. If I lay down at night I will feel the pressure and after a short time it goes away. Does anyone have any ideas as to what this is? Could it be a brain tumor that just isn't exhibiting the normal symptoms? I had radiation in the lower back for a large tumor (in Jan-Feb. of 07) I have had no chemo. Would appreciate any ideas. Thank You, Karen",
