      "Content": "Leo: Thanks for your reply. I had the pathology slide taken to another hospital for a 2nd opinion. By reading the report on the biopsy they should be able to tell what type of cancer, correct? I had asked about Melanoma and they asked me if I thought I could have it and I said no I dont see anything odd, but anything is possible and the Drs. said something about they could tell by the biopsy. Is that true? Thank you again and thank you to you Jackie.",

      "Content": "2 mos ago I had an axillary lymphnode biopsied and it tested positve for cancer. It was 2 cm in size. No other mass in breast was found. After 8 weeks of testing, MRI, Ultrasounds, Breast Core Tissue, Cat Scan of chest, abdomen, pelvis, Bone Scan, Broncoscopy, Endoscopy, Colonoscopy, Pet Scan, all came back negative except 5 very small nodules found on my lungs on the Cat Scan. They are too small to biopsy. Nothing else except the axillary lymphnode. We had the node retested at a different hospital and still positive. All doctors are saying breast cancer because of the axillary node, but nothing shows up. Someone through out there that maybe when the node was tested that possibly the equipment was not sterile and was contaminated by someone elses cancer cells. How far fetched could this be? Could this happen? Is it possible to have the lymphnode test positive and not show up anywhere else? Could the cancer be so early/small that it cant be detected? Please help. I am scheduled to start Chemotheraphy for Breast Cancer Tuesday, November 1st and am very nervous and so uncertain. Your help and answers are greatly appreciated. Thank you. PCharms.",

      "Content": "Dear PK: I'm sorry to hear about your friends experience. I recently had a Core biopsy guided by an MRI last week at a hospital. I was given Lycane (??spelling), like novacane. They made a small incision and when the needle, that sounded like a drill went in it hit a muscle in my shoulder blade, very painful but they gave me another shot. It was uncomfortable and quite long, but nothing like your friend. I do have a pretty high pain tolerance, but overall nothing unbearable. Maybe your friend should opt to have the other test done at the hospital or breast center and ask to be given higher dosage of Lycane and explain her concerns. I wish your friend well and much luck. Take care. PCharms",
