      "Content": "I have read a lot of comments on here. Many have reported that test results came back negative.........so here I am 52 years old,my Dr called the last of April saying time for mammogram...... I had put it of for a few years, 5 to be exact. Well they found something... Ultrasound found a nodule and she didn't like the looks of the lymph nodes. I had a core biopsy done Thursday, yes the sound is scary but techs great. The needle aspiration of the lymph on the other hand...ouch I see why they do that last . Get the results Tuesday......wish me luck.",
