      "Content": "Hi, I was looking up the Cancer Treatment Centers of America on google and I came across your posting on this site, which is exactly the kind of site I have been looking for. My dad was diagnosed with peritoneal cancer about two weeks ago and it seems to be pretty advanced, but the doctors at the Penn State Hershey Medical Center are having a heck of a time finding the source. Anyway, you don't know me, so I won't ramble. I was just hoping to get your input on places to go because I am doing all this research for our family and the CTCA has been very friendly and persuasive, but I'm a little bit wary of a Nike or Coke style ad campaign. Any other suggestions? I would love to come up with some alternatives because my Dad is in a post-prognosis trough right now, feeling pretty doomed.",
