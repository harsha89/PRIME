      "Content": "Hi Amy, I had to remove your link as we do have a policy on links for new users and also on links for commercial purposes. This is a very fine line between promoting your book for commercial gain vs. sharing information to help others. I have left your post so if anyone is interested in the book, they can look it up themselves, but please don't post any more links. Thank you and happy to hear from a survivor! Debbie",
