    "Content": "HI I am 62, 10 weeks post modified radical mastectomy with node resection, for Invasive Lobular breast cancer, Stage 3A. So far, I have had a post op wound infection of the expander treated with 2 1/2 weeks of antibiotics, my medi-port placed, was doing pretty well and then round one of dose dense AC, and then Neulasta x1, followed in 4 1/2 days by a bout of severe chest/incisional pain that was eventually diagnosed as a pulmonary embolus. Then my liver enzymes went very high and my next round of chemo was delayed two weeks. So, I got my second round of chemo 5 days ago, started neupogen daily injections on day 3, and by day 4 1/2 I was once again in unbelieveable incisional pain. It seems to be like a huge muscle cramp around the armpit and chest wall that really limits my ability to breathe comfortably, rest or just exist. Has anyone else experienced this with the Neulasta or the Neupogen, or even the chemo? I think I could manage but for this unrelenting constant incisional pain that apparently recurs after each treatment. I have 6 cycles to go, I don't know how I can face them. I cannot seem to tolerate any pain medications because they seem to destroy my liver, I am at my wit's end. I spoke with the Resident on call, they all want me to take pain meds, but my body cannot seem to handle that. I am just wondering if others have had this and how did they deal with it? thank you Linda",
