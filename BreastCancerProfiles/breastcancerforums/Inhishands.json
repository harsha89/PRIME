    "Content": "Hi this is my mother in laws story and battle with breast cancer. In 1993 she had her first battle. She found a lump in her right breast. She decided on a lumpectomy. And had radiation treatments. She had already had a hystorectomy in 1989. Then she had mammogram and they found a lump in right breast again in 1998 Also took tamoxifen. This time she opted for a masectomy. In 1993 & 1998 no nodes were positive and both were ductal carcinoma. Then in 2005 she found a lump in her left breast. And she opted for masectomy. On the left side it was lobular carcinoma. She had radiation treatments on that side. 2007 she found lump under left arm. They removed lump and it was from an unknown primary. Dr gave her tamoxifen. She refused chemo because in 2005 she had watched her niece go thru hell trying to survive for her kids as she battled rectal cancer at 31. She is greatly missed and was such an inspiration to lots of people. Mom saw her sick all the time from chemo and since then refuses chemo. In 2008 mom took herself off of arimadex (i think) she said she didnt like the way she felt on it. Which brings us to feb 2010. She had this dry cough for awhile and didn't think nothing of it. In May it was still there and she was having problems breathing and was having problems swallowing certain foods. She finally went to Dr. Dr thot she might have a blood clot and sent her for exray. When exray came back there was a tumor behind her sternum. It was a 3 cm tumor. All she said was \"ur kidding\" and went out to lunch with friends. Meanwhile by the look on the doctors face I knew it wasnt good. I had to be picked up off the floor. My husband (her son) and I got in the car and bawled our eyes out. The next couple of days were days of mri's, more exrays, PET scan. Well, then came more bad news. The cancer had mets to bone(hip, ribs), node by collarbone, in bronchi and questionable spot on liver. She is ER+ and PR+ and HER2 NEU. The ONC Dr has given her 6 mths to 1yr with no chemo. Which is what she chose. That was in May. We are now in Dec and she is still hanging in there. She had radiation on the tumor behind sternum to help her breath and eat some food and she had radation to her hip. The only thing that I have noticed recently is she is coughing more and she occasionally spits up phlegm. We just saw Onc. Dr 3 weeks ago and tumor markers are in the 80's. They said she is doing good. I have tried to find a similar story to hers to see what I am going to be up against. But havent found one. Thanks for reading my moms story. Any thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated. Take care!",
