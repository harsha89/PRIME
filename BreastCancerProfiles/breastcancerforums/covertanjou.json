    "Content": "I went in for my pre-op yesterday (will be having an excisional biopsy after having had a stereo biopsy), and was able to see my pathology report. The report from my stereo biopsy states; Lobular Intaepitelial Neoplaisa (ADH/LCIS SpectrumSpectrum-4). FibrocysticFibrocystic breast disease changes with Adenosis, Columnar cell changes/hyperaplasia; Usual ductal hyplasia and Aporcrine metaplasia. Can anyone tell me what this means? I understand that my samples shows ADH and LCIS. What are the other things? What are they looking for in the excision biopsy?",
