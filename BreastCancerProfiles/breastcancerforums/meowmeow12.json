    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I had 2 lumps and some microcalcification surgically removed from my left breast about 3 weeks ago. I am still recovering from the surgery. The good news is that the lumps and cal are benign. But I am really concerned with what happens to my breast now that the lumps and cals are removed. The left breast looks smaller than the right breast. My question is, does the breast tissue grow back to compensate what's been removed? I have gotten mixed answers, some say no, some say yes. Can someone please share their experience with me? Thank you so very much.",
