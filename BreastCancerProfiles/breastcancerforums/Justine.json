      "Content": "Hi Marion, I was interested in your question about WBC and decided to join the forum to share some info. Two years ago, I finished 35 rads and boost and then, also, began a gradual drop in WBC below normal range as you did. I made an exhaustive search for complementary treatments and found several supplement protocols that worked for me. My WBC climbed back up over 4 which helped convince me of the value of trying the alternative path first, if possible. Alkylglycerols- increases white blood cell production. Contains compounds found in shark liver oil (This is not shark cartilage!) ImmunoFin is the brand I used, made by Lane Labs... sold by Vitamin Shoppe and others (can be found on the Internet) Also, check out taurine, AHCC, cat's claw and grapeseed extract. I take all of these from time to time to keep the count in the normal range. There is also Polyerga, a purified extract of peptides made from the spleen of pigs (sounds dreadful, I know) but it is actually a benign, little white pill. At the moment I have forgotten the distributor's name but it can be obtained on the Internet . It is recommended for suppressed WBC by the authors of How to Treat Cancer with Natural Medicine by Drs. Murray, Birdsall et al. Hope this is a bit helpful. Justine",
