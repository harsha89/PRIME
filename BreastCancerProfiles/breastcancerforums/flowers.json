    "Content": "After being one year out from a form of breast cancer, chemo, & radiation, I've found great comfort from friends. After I was diagnosed, the phone started ringing of friends with words of love and encouragement, when chemo began, they knew how hard losing my hair would be, they threw me a big hat party! We ate and laughed and shared, I showed them all my bald head, and they played \"You are So Beautiful\" and I cried and they just encouraged me! I took home lots of beautiful hats and scarfs, I had one to match everything I wore! Everyday I received 3-5 cards in the mail, with words of encouragement. On the days I had chemo, my friends had a list, they all took turns taking me since my husband worked, they would sit next to me and we would visit, read or they just sat without saying a word. The other friend would line up at least 2-3 meals so my husband could eat, after my treatments because I was so sick. I would let them clean my house, if though I wanted to do it. I had a reaction to chemo that made me cry alot. They cried with me. They would always be encouraging, even though I felt so rotten. Cancer is not a death sentence anymore, if though she has lost some to cancer. Be an ear, and a shoulder, there maybe alot of shoes you have to wear to see her through, but just knowing she has a good friend will help her get through even the darkest of times. I used my friends alot. Prayer helped, when I heard my friend pray for me! That made me want to keep on for my husband, family and them. Hang in there, the road may get tough at times. Thank God For Friends!",
