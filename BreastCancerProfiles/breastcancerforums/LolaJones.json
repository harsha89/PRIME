      "Content": "Hello, My Mom had bc approximately 16 years ago, in her right breast, when she was 54. She had a lumpectomy and 6 weeks of radiation. She also had her lymph nodes under her right arm removed- they were not cancerous. (She had had a hysterectomy well prior to the discovery of the cancer - both ovaries were removed). She was on tamoxifen for five years. AND she beat it! Now besides the cancer, my Mom has also been diagnosed with scleroderma - it is a rare auto-immune disease that attacks the skin and makes it hard and shiny. Once the doctors pronounced this approx. 2 years ago - no thought was given to any symptoms that arose that cancer may be back. October 2005 - she has been diagnosed with bc again and it has spread, she was told it is stage 4. She is 69. The lump is again on the right side. The cancer has spread to two spots on her bones - the pelvis and her rib cage, her liver is clear. She has undergone chest xrays, a bone scan and an MRI. She is currently taking: Letrozole 2.5 mg - 1 per day; Clodronate 400 mg - 4 per day with plenty of water. (She is also taking Ramipril - 5 mg - 2 per day for her blood pressure.) She has an appointment at the beginning of February to address whether or not the treatment will be aggressive or give her 'quality of life'; by aggressive I mean chemo - surgery was also mentioned. At the time of her diagnosis she was in pain around her rib cage and very short of breath - a large amount of fliud was removed from her lungs - I believe it was about 800 mil - not all of the fluid was removed, but she gained some relief from that. It was said that the fluid build-up was from the lining of her lungs NOT the lungs themselves, and the fluid was to be tested. Currently my Mom is still in pain from the fluid build up - which seems to be only on her right side. I can feel the swelling on her back on the right side, and around her rib cage - she says it is painful when pressure is applied there. She takes Tylenol 3 for relief, she is very conscientious about taking the Tylenol only as necessary - but sometimes it is three a day and she is quite uncomfortable, even with the pain relief any exertion leaves her short of breath - although she bounces back very quickly. She has no overt pain, no coughing and no bringing up blood. She has gone vegan/organic as much as possible and drinks at least 16 or more oz of carrot juice a day. She is also taking Graviola. My questions: 1) Upon questioning whether or not the fluid removed was cancerous we were not given any clear answer other than the receptionist at the Dr.'s office saying that is not tested - Is that true? Would it be tested anyway? If it is NOT positive for cancer would there be any further follow-up? Should we be asking for them to test the fluid? 2) Why wasn't all the fluid removed at the same time? 3) Why does the fluid build up? There was NO mention of retention of fluids and one of the pills she takes requires lots of water to take it - is this causing further harm? 4) What can be done to not have the fluid build-up at all? - or is it because of the scleroderma that her body is not able to fight and get rid of the fluid? I would greatly appreciate any thoughts or advice you may have - like anyone with cancer the uncertainty is the worst and she has good days and bad - we would also like some answers. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Karin",

      "Content": "Hi JodiLinn, We wish MUCH positive energy to you and to your Mom - as I mentioned in my first post it is the uncertainty about things and having patience to fight this disease that is sometimes the hardest. We thank you for your reply and input - AND I thank you for the reminder that the patient 'is in the driver's seat' - my Mom is very good about asking many questions, SHE is the one that kept going until she finally got some answers as to what she had and how to continue. My Mom objects to taking the pain reliever for the pain as she is concerned about the effects of it on her kidneys and her liver. The latest doctor said that concern is immaterial as her 'quality of life' is more important. And we are going to pursue and answer about the fluid and get a definitive answer. Thank you again for the reply it is much appreciated. We wish you and your Mom all the best too. Karin",

      "Content": "Hi Cindy, Thank you for your kind regards. I thank you for the advice and suggestions, I appreciate that. My Mom, like I mentioned has good days and bad. She is not bed ridden, she still drives, she just cannot do things that exert her strength too much. The patience you have to have to get on with things (sometimes as best you can) can be the hardest, waiting for results, trying to eat right and do the best things for yourself are a challenge too. She has gone vegan and we include many of the spices you mentioned. In soup there is always plenty of garlic, ginger, onions along with the tumeric. There is a great cookbook that my sister got for my Mom called: 'Staying Alive! Cookbook for Cancer Free Living' by Sally Errey (ISBN 0-9732987-0-7 published by Bellismo Books in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. The person that wrote the cookbook is a breast cancer survivor herself and there are inspirational stories too. It also tells you what foods to look for, cook with and to avoid - there is also a handy grocery list that you can photocopy and take with you. The vegan diet can feel limiting especially if you miss the things you normally ate but as I keep reminding my Mom it is a lifestyle change and NOT a diet. It is a tough thing to wrap your head around - I am more vegetarian as I still include a bit of dairy in my own choices! Her breathing has not gotten worse as it was pretty much confirmed by the doctor yesterday that the fluid is most likely cancerous - the most important thing is to be as positive and forward thinking as you can. Basically F_ _ K CANCER - that is our new phrase and if that offends anyone I apologize for your tender ears but I DO NOT apologize for saying it!! I wish you all the best Cindy - thank you again for the post. Best regards, Karin",
