      "Content": "I found taking the supplement Co-Q 10 very helpful to my cardiac function while I was on chemo and Herceptin. My MUGAs all came out in the 75% range until I stopped taking it for a brief period of time when the MUGA dropped to 53%. Of course, this is a supplement that isn't USDA approved and hasn't been proven to the satisfaction of many blah, blah, blah so you should decide with your doctor if it's worth it for you to try. I know it worked for me though! Congrats on your higher MUGA results!",

I continue to work with horses and regularly lift 50 pound bags of feed and heavy bales of hay. It does take a little time to work back up to the norm immediately following the surgery but long term effects have been minimal as far as my ability to lift things goes. Albeit, it does give a strange sensation that takes a little getting used to.",

      "Content": "My cancer was diagnosed as Her+++ and ER-/PR-. My threatment following mastectomy & node disection (8/11+) consisted of 4 rounds of AC (Adriamycin & Cytoxin) 3 weeks apart. When that was done I received 4 rounds of Taxotere 3 weeks apart. When all of that was finished I had weekly Herceptin infusions for a year. I tolerated it all very well. I did not have any nausea since they gave me drugs (can't remember the name rght now). I did loose my hair but it returned when I began the taxotere. The nurse said that this was very unusual (leave it to me!). The taxotere also caused a numbness in my fingers and toes that has since disappeared. I also would feel exhauseted the third day after the treatments. My blood counts did not drop dangerously low since they gave me Neulasta or Procrit the day after the chemo. The Herceptin did not cause any side effects that I noticed. I should mention that I was only 32 when diagnosed so the nurses think my age may have helped me tolerate the harsh regiment. I am now 35 and have been NED for almost a year since completing all of the above. If you would like to contact me please feel free to email me at [email protected]. Good Luck!",
