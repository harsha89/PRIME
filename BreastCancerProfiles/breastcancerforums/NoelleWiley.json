    "Content": "I had a mammogram and ultrasound that they found 3 adnormal lumps. The radiologist had to do a biopsy on those 3 lumps (one on the right breast and 2 on the left breast) .... My concern in that one of the lumps on the left breast had a blood vessel running to it, is that a bad thing? Should I be concerned? I should get my results from the biopsy next week. Thank you btw Im 31 years old",
