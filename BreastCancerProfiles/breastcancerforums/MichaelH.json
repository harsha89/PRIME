      "Content": "Hello everyone, I'm the spouse of a future breast cancer thriver - she's not just going to beat it, she's going to kick it's ***. Wifey was diagnosed with a 2cm lump barely a month ago and has just had her second Cytoxan/Adriamycin chemo treatment. She's been taking her anti-nausea meds as directed and has had no real problems with nausea. She's felt some mild side effects from the drugs but nothing that she hasn't felt during a cold from the drugs she'd take then. She's got a good attitude even while her hair jumps off her head like rats leaving a sinking ship. Her phrase. Anyway, I'm basically her watchdog as well and have been keeping her as safe as possible especially during her white count lows, of which we only have one cycle to judge. To get to the point... When she isn't neutropenic - I.E she's out of the low 7-10 days after chemo or when neupogen has been given - how strict should I be in limiting no-go foods such as lettuce, tomatoes, things that aren't pasteurized, etc? I'm keeping her away from un-cooked foods overall. Raw fruit, veggies, pasta salads, etc. as a safety measure. Am I going overboard? Can she eat mostly what she wants during the WBC highs?",
