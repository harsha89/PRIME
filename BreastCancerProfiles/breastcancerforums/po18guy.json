      "Content": "Welcome! As expected, the drug arrives with numerous rather horrible sounding potential side effects. Since we have two choices in the matter, and since any number from zero to all side effects may actually occur, in most cases we simply begin the drug and report to doctor how we are doing with it. Remember that the list of side effects was compiled from the experiences of a large number of women. As they say, your experience may vary. The clinical trial drug that I am taking has a similar list, but I have experienced only two of them so far. As well, there are medications that can moderate some of the side effects, if needed.",

      "Content": "You can place a call into doctor's nurse for a bit more of an explanation, as there may be no need to wait anxiously for more than two weeks. And, doctor may just call back to explain. Bob is completely correct: freaking out does no good at all. Rather, re-direct that nervous energy into the will to do everything for your mother that will help her at this time. The fight is hers and her attitude toward this battle may vary considerably from yours - we see much potential conflict arise from such intra-family philosophical differences. But, the warning has been given that life on this earth is not infinite. Simply spending time with her and enjoying her presence may be the best medicine available in the next two and a half weeks.",

If you had the mammogram done as a recommendation, and not because of any symptom, why on earth should there be any fear or anxiety at all? Many of us have ancestors that died of cancer - but what does that have to do with you, right here, right now? I am certainly no expert, but such an off-the-charts reaction to routine screening (intended to protect your health) may indicate that you suffer from anxiety. Now, that is something that can be easily addressed by doctor. For your own peace of mind, please mention this at your next visit.",

As to needing the prior mammogram, not one of us exactly resembles the wall chart in doctor's ofice. Since we all vary from the perfect human body, radiologists must make note of that. There may be something on this mammogram that was also there before, and so it is not a sign of anything sinister. And, doctor knows that not everything seen on an image is bad, or cancerous.

      "Content": "L4-5 herniation here. Laminectomy followed by discectomy two years later. I second the request for an MRI or other imaging of your lumbar spine. If there is a herniation, and if it is impinging on a nerve, corrective surgery might be a limp-in, walk out procedure. Tiny little scar on your back. By the time a cancer such as breast cancer would travel all the way down the spine and set up shop, I would think that your symptoms would be worse and that the cancer would be easily detectable. I think you have a herniation in the most hernia-prone part of the spine. As to the other diagnostics, you do not have cancer until a pathology report says you have cancer. A family history of cancer does not assure you of having any cancer, so take some comfort in that.",

      "Content": "Welcome! I am sorry that you have to come here. However, this site is for support and I believe that you will receive quite a bit. As to mom, I would first make certain that it is actually breast cancer rather than some other form (such as lymphoma) that has appeared in the breast. And, having a second opinion performed on the biopsy sample is an excellent idea. Some forms of cancer are very difficult to properly diagnose, and treatments vary substantially between types. \"Cancer\" is like \"Illness\" - what type of illness is it? They are quite unique, each being a different type of cell in our bodies that simply mutated. All are different, act differently and respond differently to various medications and treatment. If the cancer history in your family runs back to the 60s, 70s or 80s, just know that major advancements have been made since then. The 1960s and 70s, in particular, were almost the stone age of cancer treatment. As to coverages and standards of care, she will need to contact her insurer and have them advise of what their level of coverage is. It is also very good that she has a belief system that she trusts - that has made a huge difference in my case. Maybe some of your fighting spirit will rub off on her! All the best to the two of you.",

Started at half-dose due to concerns with drug interactions. To date: 1 cancer, relapse, second relapse/mutation into 2 cancers, then 3 cancers simultaneously, 20 chemotherapy/GVHD drugs in 11 regimens (4 of them at least twice), 5 salvage regimens, 4 clinical trials, 5 post-transplant immuno-suppressant/modulatory drugs, the equivalent of 1,000 years of background radiation from 40+ CT series scans and about 24 PET scans. Both lymphoid and myeloid malignancies lend a certain symmetry to the hematological journey. Believing in the redemptive value of suffering makes all the difference.",

      "Content": "Sorry to welcome you here under such circumstance. I deleted the duplicate post. Steroids have a triple effect, the first two of which are beneficial and the third perhaps not: they boost one's system so that energy levels are greater; they shrink tumors (thus alleviating any nerve pain or other problems), but all of this comes at the cost of suppressing the immune system somewhat. It sounds like doctor is on the ball and is doing what seems right. Others will chime in soon on this. All the best to you.",

      "Content": "Since you have a diagnosis and are in treatment, I have moved your post to the breast cancer forum. Pain relief depends upon where the tumors are growing and which organs or nerves they are pressing on. In that regard, chemo may indeed produce some pain relief. The point of chemo is to kill the tumors and in so doing, it is intended to reduce their size. When they are smaller, there will likely be less pressure on a given organ or nerve. I am a lymphoma patient, but recently developed pain and numbness on the left side of my face and jaw, presumably from a tumor (lymph node) pressing on a nerve. Since entering a clinical trial, the treatment has greatly reduced the pain and numbness, apparently shrinking the tumor away from the nerve.",

      "Content": "Just a layman here, but radiation, if deemed appropriate in her case, would cause the death of cancer cells. As I recall, even if it only slows the rate of growth, it might help, as her body has the ability to absorb a certain amount of excess CSF. It is when the body's capacity to absorb is exceeded that trouble occurs. That is via over-production of CSF by the body, or of a tumor expanding and causing an increase in CSF pressure within the dura surrounding the brain or spinal column. The dura could simply expand like a balloon to compensate for excess CSF, but it is captive within the skull, which limits any expansion and thus, causes a pressure increase. As to pain control, I think a call into doctor or nurse might provide some help, as they must be well aware of the general problem and have some suggestions. Even though it might be uncomfortable, from a physical/mechanical aspect, having her sit upright might help, as blood pressure within the brain might be reduced just a bit. Think of it as being similar to elevating an arm or leg to reduce swelling. Holiday weekend in the US, but every facility has a triage nurse available 24/7. I would make a call.",

      "Content": "Sorry to welcome you here under these circumstances. To avoid confusion, and to keep your concern \"under one roof\", I have merged your posts. Please read through it and make sure it still says what you intended. My apologies if it does not. As to the throbbing aches, a loss of (or excess) CSF can produce that exact symptom. Since there are cancer cells in her CSF, their volume increases as they divide into new cells, and may have increased the pressure within the dura. The dura is very sensitive, and an increase or decrease in pressure can cause the exact pain that you describe. She probably had pain after the spinal tap, which occurred awhile back, as I understand it. If the spinal tap was within the past few days, then the pain would be easily explained by the loss of CSF from the spinal tap. And, with breast cancer cells in her CSF, it is metastatic in nature.",

      "Content": "In the T-Cell Lymphoma world, generally once it defeats a drug or combo, it is not used again. However, with the advent of new categories of drugs, which use completely different mechanisms of action, this is being re-thought. It is believed that some of the newer drugs may somehow sensitize the cancer cells to other, perhaps older drugs. I was on an inhibitor class drug for 5 years until relapse. Doctor is no longer ruling out a potential return to that drug, since I have tried two different types of drugs in the meantime. I imagine this might be termed a re-introduction, or a re-infusion of the drugs. It may not be a simple going back, as the cells may have been altered by the other treatment(s). Definitely one to discuss with the oncologist. Here is a video on breast cancer and multi-treatments: http://www.oncologytube.com/v/103105...-shots-program Interestingly, one of the trial dugs she used (Alisertib) I do have experience with, as it is effective in both blood and solid tumor cancers.

By the time a cancer such as breast cancer would travel all the way down the spine and set up shop, I would think that your symptoms would be worse and that the cancer would be easily detectable. I think you have a herniation in the most hernia-prone part of the spine. As to the other diagnostics, you do not have cancer until a pathology report says you have cancer. A family history of cancer does not assure you of having any cancer, so take some comfort in that.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear of your concern. Yes, this sounds like very good medical practice. Until the nature of the nodule is known, whether lipoma, cyst or something else, it is good to check surrounding lymph nodes as part of the diagnostic procedure. What we must all face is that it is what it is, no matter the wait, or doctor's apparent concern. If it is minor, it can be taken care of easily. If something more serious, what can we do except that which is necessary? Here is hoping that it is benign in nature.",

      "Content": "Sorry to hear this. You're a mom, so the picture is bigger than yourself, right? You would do anything for your children! Well, the picture has suddenly changed and now cancer treatment is part of that \"anything\" that you would do for your children. I am guessing that much of what you have heard about chemotherapy is either out of date, exaggerated or possibly just false. It is not a bomb that they inject you with and hope that you survive once it explodes. It is carefully planned and dosed so as to be most effective against the cancer and the least harmful to you. The monitoring of it is on-going. As well, you can stop at any time if you make that choice. Now, for some perspective, over the past 10 years, I have received 18 chemotherapy drugs in the most heavy doses that I could tolerate, as I have had two aggressive cancers on three occasions which had to be stopped as quickly as possible. After all of this, I am still alive, and very happy to be alive. I think your worries are groundless. Life has forever changed. The new bottom line: Everything must be balanced against what will inevitably happen of you do not have treatment. Your kids both want and need you to stick around.",
