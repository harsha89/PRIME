    "Content": "I had my annual mammogram on Friday, they called today (Monday) and asked that I come back in tomorrow for more pictures. A little background... I had a breast reduction surgery in 2010, I had a mammo done in 2011, and they saw scare tissue....They reviewed the films from 2011 and compared them to the ones on Friday and the radiologist said there are things on this current mammo that was not on the one in 2011... They are saying both breasts are questionable... That being said how common is it to have BC in both breasts at the exact same time, also could more scar tissue have formed between mammos? I am totally freaked out and very upset any insight or advice would be great... a side note there is no history of Breast Cancer in my family!",
