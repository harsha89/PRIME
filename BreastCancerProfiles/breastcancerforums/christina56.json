    "Content": "Hi, I have a lot of anxiety so i tend to over worry about things I really shouldn't and I came here to ask if I should be worried about this. The other day my mom (Age 53) had a mammogram and they ended up calling her back saying she needed to come back and take more pictures because they saw an area that was a little suspicious. Anyways, she went back today and the radiologist ended up wanting her to get a biopsy. He mentioned that the suspicious area was very small and they actually had to magnify it further because it was so small. He also mentioned that he was 95% sure the area was benign but he wanted to do a biopsy just to make sure. I'm having a lot of anxiety over this because I'm terrified of the thought that my mom might have breast cancer. It's a really scary thought and I'm just wondering if I should be THIS worried about it. It makes me feel a little better that the doctor said hes 95% sure but I'm scared he might have exaggerated or something. Any thoughts?",
