    "Content": "My daughter had very aggressive breast cancer. While the normal treatments were encouraged, she hesitated but her peers persisted it was best. We are told that chemo and radiation is proven but research now shows us there is more evidence that chemo releases in healthy cells a protein that cancer actually feeds and replicates with, causing more cancer growth and metastases, the side effects are often more debilitating than the cancer and causes more deaths as the body cannot recover from the onslaught of the chemo. We all like to be so correct, not saying what sounds so scary but the truth is the chemo is not the great miracle we put our hopes into. Radiation is known also to do the same as chemo. I have seen the effects of both and the how fast the quality of life decreases. There are those great and lucky ones, I am so pleased they are all blessed. I have also seen many that believed they were cancer free only to discover after years cancer was back. Discounting any treatment, is not ours to decide. There are other choices, and I would prefer going the do no harm first method than to destroy the body beyond repair; you can always use the chemo. I know my daughter would have tried anything within reason but would have gone to the ends of the earth for a treatment shown proof positive to help or give a glimpse of hope. When you are faced with such a decision, you have to act with your heart. Peers and friends mean well, but ultimately the choice of treatment for you life is always in your hands and friends and peers need support that.",
