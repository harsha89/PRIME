    "Content": "Muttsmom, your story reads like mine. I was told \"you are young I don't think the lump you found is cancer come back in four weeks\" I didn't listen and that saved my life. I agree that doctors and some women beleive that great deal of breast cancer diagnosis is family histroy.Women need to be proactive, be our own advocates when it comes t0 our health. Dear Amanda,sorry to hear what you are going through at such a young age. Be strong, his healing touch is deeper than all we go through. I will encourage to be proactive and take charge with up date information that can help you even with your other health issues .",
