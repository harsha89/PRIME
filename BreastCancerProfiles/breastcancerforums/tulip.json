      "Content": "Hi, im new to this site. My mum has stage 3 breast cancer and has gone through 3 fec chemo already. She was suppsed to have another 3 Taxotere but took an extreme reaction to the first dose and was seriously ill in hospital, so shes back on the fec for 3 more, followed by 29 sessions of radiotherapy. Do you have an idea/knowledge of the likely outcome? Im so scared as the docs arent saying much. She had the lump plus all her lymph glands removed. x",
