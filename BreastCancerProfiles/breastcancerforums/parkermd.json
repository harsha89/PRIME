      "Content": "There is a new report from HHS' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggesting that three drugs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone) used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. The report found that tamoxifen increases risk for endometrial cancer, hysterectomies, and cataracts compared with the other drugs. Tamoxifen and raloxifene increase risk of blood clots, although tamoxifen's risk is greater. Tibolone carries an increased risk of stroke.

      "Content": "In the beginning she won't feel much of the side effects of chemo. So she'll be able to work even on the weeks when she's getting the treatment (other than the times she'll be at the clinic to receive it). Unfortunately, the side effects slowly get worse and worse over time, depending on how many cycles of the chem she gets. Once she's done with the treatment, she should recover pretty quickly, especially if she's young. Like you said, every person is different and will have a different experience with chemo. It's just as possible that she will be fine throughout the whole treatment, aside from some minor side effects. I wish your friend good luck. It's a difficult time for her, but with friends and family who care for her, this too will pass. With stage I, she has a very good chance of being cured.",

Here's the link to the US Department of Labor that can answer a lot of questions regarding mastectomy.

As for the three times a week cytoxan, it is a normal regimen for breast cancer therapy. Your friend should ask the doctor why he opted for a more aggressive treatment regimen. Good luck",
