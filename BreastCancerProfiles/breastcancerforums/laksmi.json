    "Content": "After a lumpectomy, 2 years ago, and a year on Arimidex, I've got some metastasis to the bones, and the oncologist prescribed Tamoxifin. Some google literature speaks of tamoxifin as a poison and a carcinogen, and my body is suddenly got aches that it did not have before the tamoxifin.
