    "Content": "My name is Sandy Howard and I am a survivor!! I survived the poison, cut and burn, and have been taking Tamoxifen for 2 years. After my treatment ended I expected pure euphoria, absolute relief and bliss. I was dead wrong. I was anxious, I cried, I was depressed, I had major insomnia, I was an emotional trainwreck. Can anybody relate to that?! Thankfully I found natural, gentle healing and wrote a book about my extraordinary healing journey. If you can relate to those emotions,or just need inspiration or encouragement during or after your cancer journey check out our website at Lifeafterchemo.com, , send me your mailing address at [emailÂ protected] and I will mail my book \"Life After Chemo; Complete Emotional and Physical Healing is possible\", free of charge, my gift to you. My dream is to help others who are needlessly suffering as I was. God Bless You All!!",
