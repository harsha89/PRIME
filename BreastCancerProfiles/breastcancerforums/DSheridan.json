      "Content": "she did have chemo when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, this is her third doctor, her first doctor was wonderful but this one doesn't give us much when it comes to hope, she's stronger every day, i've seen her walking more and more with her walker, one thing i'm always going to remember with a smile is my mom's spunk, she has surprised many doctors through the years with all her health issues. She's got COPD, heart disease, emphazema and the bone cancer. Her COPD was \"supposed\" to take her many years ago but i've seen her cope through countless times with collapsed lungs, she even had 2 more children after her lungs had collapsed 13 times and she held 3 jobs at one time even with her health issues, of course now she's not working because of her health, she's on oxygen 24/7 because her COPD has become that bad in the past 2 years. One word best describes my mom to me, \"Amazing\". She always amazes me after a hospital stay, she never gives up and seems to fight harder every time. I did tell her that if she ever feels the fight is too much not to hold on for us because we'd rather see her at rest than fighting so hard that she has no quality of life. She smiled at me and said kid, you're stuck with me a long time, deal with it.",

      "Content": "Hi all, I'm new here, just signed up tonight. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer about 7 years ago, she had a mascetomy and the chemo pills and it looked like everything would be ok, she had a clean bill of health her last check up about 2 years ago. This June she was in pain in her hip and kept telling us she was scared to walk, she didn't fall and we thought perhaps it was just muscle pains until one day my brother went to visit her as usual and he walked in just as she fell and told him how deep the pain was in her hips. He immediately called an ambulance and had her transported to the hospital. Several hours later, and a ride to a second hospital, we got the news that her hip was broken, we had no idea it was Breast Cancer related at this time, after her replacement surgery, her doctor called the family into a room and told us the news, her Breast Cancer came out of the remission with a vengence and was all through her bones, her hip didn't \"break\", the cancer destroyed it. We were devastated, she came through the Breast Cancer and the treatments all those years like a trooper and now we find she's facing even more treatments however, after staying in the hospital for 22 days we got the news that she's stage 4 and the cancer is all through her body, they gave her radiation therapy for a few weeks and she seemed to be getting stronger until recently, she had pain in her other leg and we all feared the worst, another hip replacement. This time the cancer split her femur and the doctor told us that since June her cancer has now spread to her spine and ribs. She's been walking a little with help from yet another round of physical therapy and a walker. It's so hard watching our mom deal with this, specially since her doctors have basically told us she's on borrowed time and the best we can do is treat every day as a gift and be thankful she's still here. To be honest it's torture watching her in pain. She's a strong woman and doesn't like to take the pain pills unless it's absolutely extreme pain. Sometimes I sit with her and have to leave the room to maintain control of my tears, I try to keep her spirits up as much as I can. Our family takes turns sitting with her every day, I'm not working right now so I sit with her as much as I can while the rest of the family works, but we do all put in time with her, even her grandchildren who live up here spend as much time as they can with her. She has a wonderful support system with our family and her friends, there's always someone lending a hand or running an errand for us if we aren't able to and she's never alone. We're all working together to try to keep her as comfortable and happy as we can her final months. And of course to let her know how deeply she is loved by us all.",

She had radiation on her hip in June and is taking radiation again for another 7 days but the doctor said it's only to try to strengthen her hips in hopes not to break again. I've spoken with her nurse and her doctor aside from her so i could get a grip on the reality of what she's facing, neither seem too hopeful but the doctor won't give her a time limit, just says to us not to cancel Christmas and we're all hoping that she will be here for Christmas. It takes me a few days to get back here because i'm one of her caregivers, i was with her today and she had some more physical therapy. She's walking well and surprising all of us.
