    "Content": "I am a guy - 23 years old, my girlfriend (24) has bc. I do everything that I can - sometimes just spending hours on line searching for answers, reading posts and blogs. I happend to stumbe acroos a site, on someones blog. http://thiscrazyjacket.com It was about this guy who bought an Armani Jacket off of ebay. When it arrived it was all worn and abused lol. The thing is - he didn't get upset. He moved forward. He now uses the jacket to send all over the country raising money for breat cancer and raising awareness. I saw pictures of an entire school wearing the jacket - and even a celebrity got involved. Sometimes, I think I spend too much time searching for answers. But the site kinda made me laugh and come back to earth. Let go of the things I can't control - and Do the things I can. Just felt like sharing.",
