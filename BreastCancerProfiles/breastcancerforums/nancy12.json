      "Content": "Last year my aunt, now 52 was diagnosed with breast cancer. I read your concern and felt of sharing what my cousin and his family went through. My aunt, she was stage 3. And started spreading to other organs. They went for chemo to stop from further spreading. It was effective. Cancer stopped spreading furthermore. But my aunt was so tired and felt low after every session. She was not able to get up from her bed. She was depressed. There is no history of any breast cancer in our family. We couldn\u0092t figure out how to take care of her. We all helped her but that wasn\u0092t just enough. That\u0092s when they decided to go for a professional help. They hired a senior care in Toronto to help take care of her. They were very professional and helped her in every way possible and it really worked. They helped her get out of the depression too. She took the whole cancer situation very well. And she is doing pretty well now.",
