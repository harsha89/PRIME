      "Content": "Hello, this topic is also important for me. I am 25 years old. I don't have any kids yet but I am married and I want to have them that's for sure. But right now the time is not good because I have just started new job, we still rent an apartment but we are planning to buy one soon and I haven't finished my studies so I guess I need to wait at least 2 years and maybe more. So I also take pills. I have been taking them since I was 18, so that's a long period. But I talked to my doctor, he says that I just need to check my breasts regurarly and that is nothing to worry about. In my family no one had BC, only my brother died from leukemia. What your comments on my situation would be. Is it still so dangerous to take pills for me? Thank you so much",
