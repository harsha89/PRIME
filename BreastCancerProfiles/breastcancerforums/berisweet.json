      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am new here and just trying to find answers so would appreciate any feedback. I am a 40 yr old woman and was diagnosed in 2005 with breast cancer. I opted with the lumpectomy, and then went in for 6 months of chemo followed by 6 weeks of radiation. All of my tests since then have been clear, although they have found some cysts. I just had a mammogram as well as ultrasound back in June and they are still saying it is all clear. Recently, I started noticing small spots of blood on my bed sheets and just thought that maybe I had a bug bite that I was scratching in my sleep, this has been going on for a couple of months. Then to my utter shock I noticed small spots on my night shirts as well as in my white bra. I did a self exam and could find nothing wrong, but looked closely at my nipple and I see a small red spot in the middle of it. I have never actually seen anything coming out, it is only happening it seems when I am in bed. Should this be something I should be concerned with?",
