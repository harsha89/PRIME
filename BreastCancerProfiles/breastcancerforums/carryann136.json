      "Content": "Does anyone take supplements, follow a special diet or exercise program as part of their treatment? I think it would be helpful to share information. I'll start. Supplements that I take include: vitamin D3 calcium d glucurate magnesium digestive enzymes kelp grape seed extract vitamin B12 & B-complex chaga mushrooms I will start intravenous vitamin C infusions early next year. My diet is pretty strict: I eat mainly raw foods, including nuts, seeds, fruits, vegetable. I drink plenty of water and vegetable juice (watercress, kale, carrots, cilanto and apples) I drink a herbal tea that has black walnut hull and chapparral, white oak, plaintain herb, burdock root, marshmellow root and comfrey root & leaf. Exercise I work out five days per week - yoga, weight training, jogging. Also, I try to avoid negative people and situations. I'm excited to learn what other women are doing. Please share.",
