      "Content": "Thanks for the reply. I am trying to just wait out the next 3 weeks, but keep having thoughts like it will be too healed to insert tube and then be back to the 6 week treatment. I feel sure the nurse did not talk to Doctor as I asked, this would mean changing her schedule and she would not like that. I am going to have to let him know I was very unhappy with lack of communication throughout all this (especially the call he told me he would make and didn't) and anxiety it has caused. I am not usually an uptight person as have had 12 surgeries since 1995 but for some reason this has upset me.",

      "Content": "Roxil: Under Proxima Therapeutics site you can search for where in your particular area MammoSites are being done. It has to be a pretty small area though, but also saw a release that they are making a bigger balloom. I do know they state the tube can be put in at time of lumpectomy/calcification removal. But I would wonder how they would be sure margins were clear. Radiologist showed me pictures of balloom insert, good ones that filled the cavity completely, and bad ones that had some area not filled. In that case he said they would remove tube and wait awhile before reinserting It just looks to me like that \"hole\" where calcifications were removed would heal through completely...just have to see what happens I guess.",

      "Content": "Am I being paranoid or is someone goofing up with me. Resection was 11/3, was given the pamphlet on MammoSite, which sounded good to me, was told do it after first of year. I finally called 2 times right before Xmas thinking to schedule things as I had not received the call he promised. Last call I left I mentioned my primary doctor would be calling next so I did get a reply. I saw radiologist/oncologist Mon and he said looks o.k. and surgeon would schedule placement. Surgeon's office called today and said Feb 2. I questioned this as pamphlet said it had to be done within 10 weeks of the lumpectomy(10 would be next week). She acted like never heard of that and did not even know when I had had the lumpectomy. I asked her to please mention this to doctor and she said she would but I am not betting on that. So I am thinking am I getting set up too late and this is all for nothing or what. I know he is good surgeon but the office routine needs a general overhaul. Guess just go with the flow but I am worried as will just have to do nothing if it goes to the 6 week deal.",

I clicked on it and sent message asking about problems after the 10 week period. I forgot about it but then got a telephone call from a representative of the company yesterday. She was very nice and told me the procedure would still be just as effective, the only problem would be if the area had closed so much the balloom could not be inserted. So now I know and it is just a matter of crossing my fingers that I am still open enough. How nice to get someone who actually pays a little attention to you. :P",

I did kind of jump the doctor for not calling me. He evidently went out and read chart and then came in and apologized, said he was decidint whether or not to have me do anything as area so small. He had no trouble getting tube in. So now Fri see radiologist again, and then staying in Indianapolis for 5 days for the treatment and that's it. Maybe now I can quit eating everything in sight. Anyone having this done and has questions, let me know.",

I did not have any lump. These are tiny things that when arranged a certain way has the possibility of being cancer. They actually call DCIS, in Situ as being precancerous, even though the cells removed are dead cancer cells. (A rose by any other name.) DCIS can also be invasive which is worse though they say both can be cured. I am now waiting to hear if I can have MammoSite instead of the 6 week radiation treatment - and getting very antsy.
