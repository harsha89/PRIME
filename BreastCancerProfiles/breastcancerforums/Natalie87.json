I will definitely talk with my doctor about some medication though, I know getting enough sleep will be crucial to keeping my strength up during this fight!",

      "Content": "Hello Everyone, Wish I wasn't here but, ce la vie I guess. I was recently diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 27. They have not yet finished the pathology, however it is most certainly locally advanced and has more than likely spread to at least one lymph node. It was extremely challenging at first to get this news, but overall I am doing OK. However, I am having difficulty sleeping, and because I don't yet know if the cancer has spread beyond the local region, it is somewhat hard for me to keep my mind off of it. Can anyone provide me advice for how I can try to sleep, and also how I can keep calm until I find out exactly what type/stage I'm in and whether it's spread? I have already made several changes to my diet to try and stop any further spread, but additional advice is more than appreciated. That applies also to advice on how to handle this situation overall, not just while waiting for my PET scan. Obviously I wasn't expecting this diagnosis, and I know this is not only challenging for myself but also my family and friends. Thank you! Natalie",
