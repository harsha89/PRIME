    "Content": "Hello Everyone, I'm a registered nurse and came across this site and opted to join. I'll just share something and maybe it'll somehow provide hope to anyone with BC. Last year, one of my co-employees (39 years old) who is also a registered nurse in one of the Tertiary Hospitals in Manila was diagnosed to have a stage II BC. Her family brought her to China and decided to undergo a treatment (i'm not sure what kind of treatment she took). After few months, she went back home with worse health condition. She undergone breast surgery (mastectomy) and went on coma after several weeks. Her cancer cells metastasized all over, which affected several organs. The Chief Nurse suggested to the significant others (relatives) to try a pharmaceutical grade (FDA) food supplement as the last recourse, that was after she was anointed by the priest. The attending physician conformed to administer the supplementation keeping in mind that the products were just food supplements though with a pharma grade quality. The doctor conveyed that there will be nothing to lose if they're going to try for the last time considering that the patient was already in a critical condition. The medications were administered through Nasogastric Tube Feeding (NGT) and to our surprise, she came to consciousness just after 3 days. The first words she spoke were, \"spaghetti and cheese cake\". She was got healthier in just a matter of few weeks and she was discharged from the hospital approx 2 months after. Her cancer cells were fed with the right nutrients and since cells have the innate ability to heal themselves, they just healed. I never heard from the patient again but i'm sure she recuperated. I guess complete nutrition plays an important role in the maintenance of our total wellness. By the way, my wife has poly-cystic ovaries and when i gave her the same supplements her ovaries got corrected. After 11 years, my wife is now pregnant and is conceiving a babygirl for 6 months already. I hope that my story will give hope to everyone.",
