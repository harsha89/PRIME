      "Content": "Thank you for your answer, I' m from Bulgaria. My sister-in-low is 33 years old. Actualy the doctors took out the lump from under o.'s arm. her breast is still untouched. She didn't make any chemo or radiation because this kind of treatment has many other causes. o.k. the people don't die from cancer but from let's say lung disfunction which are from chemotherapy. So the cancer came back at same place, and now has many nodes. One of it ( the biggest one, And the fist one ) is very large-- like jam-jar. She can't move her left hand. The lump is pressing some nerves and she has terrible pain. She has same type of cancer. the doctors said the therapy ( but only because they have no other choise) They cann't tell her \" no chance \" . About the blood transfusion, we just think about it. the doctor didn't tell something. Here the doctors are very conservative. They prefered not to try something else except the standart cure. Now there is too late for operation ( doctors said it ), actualy we try other methods on our own responsability. But it is beter to believe in something then to say \"good bye\". We still hope. You can see her at www.onco.hit.bg",
