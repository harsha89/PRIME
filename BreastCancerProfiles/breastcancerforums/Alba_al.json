      "Content": "Hi everyone, I'm a 22 years old girl and before 4-5 months or so i had my first breast echo and i was diagnosed with several lumps. One was big and had to be removed so i took a surgery and removed this big lump (don't remember the size though). I still have a few left i guess. I haven't gone to the doctor since then.. big mistake, i know! Now, the issue is, it's been a lot, more than e year that i feel light headed, nervous, impatient, dizziness (i know it can be from a lot of things but still though), my body is sour it's like i have pain everywhere. My chest feels heavy. I've read about ovarian cancer too, i haven't had a pap test yet though.. ahmm... i never had \"complete\" sexual relationships so i guess i shouldn't have that, but i do have discharges at times, feel pain below my tummy and my waist... not severe pain, light one.. And i do have how is it called.. Ah, yes, fluctuant gas i suppose.. I's been there for a few months now unfortunately, and in my family we have a lot of cancer cases, from bone cancer, to ovarian and breast one.. i'm kinda scared! Please i'd need any suggestion... I mean besides go and visit a doctor, i know that, and i will.. Thanks",
