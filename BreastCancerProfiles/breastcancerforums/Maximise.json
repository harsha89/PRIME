      "Content": "After I had my lumpectomy and total lymph node clearance where cancer was also found in one node, my surgeon told me had got all the cancer and any more treatment I would receive would be like an added insurance. Imagine my shock when I met up with the oncologist to discuss arrangements for follow up treatment, where she then informed me that they can never be sure the cancer is gone for good, and particularly in breast cancer cancer cells can lie dormant in certain areas (ie Liver, Lungs and bone) even for up to many years. I asked the onc. my prognosis and she advised me that she would never give me an \"all clear\" from breast cancer and views me as somone living with a \"chronic disease\", I am 33 and my breast cancer diagnosis was 2 yrs ago now, I try to live life to the full and not keep looking over my shoulder waiting on it to return but its hard sometimes.

My son is 3 and I am looking forward to the milestones now, ie his first day at school etc, for so long after diagnosis, I couldnt even think about the future with my son except in a negative way.

      "Content": "I was diagnosed with breast cancer 2 years ago at the age of 31. Grade 3, 2cm tumour with 1 lymph node involved. Went through surgery, chemo and rads, and now on tamoxifen and monthly zoladex injections. I have never had the balls to actually ask what my prognosis is, although I have read loads about it on the internet etc. I have now read several times that breast cancer in women under 35 has a much poorer outlook, this really frightens me. My son is only 3 yrs old, he had just turned 1 when I was diagnosed, so I feel like I am constantly \"looking over my shoulder\" waiting on it to rear its ugly head again. I think I just want some reassurance really that there are women who were diagnosed under 35 that are still alive and doing well",
