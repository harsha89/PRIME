I watched my mother go through treatments 25 years ago and, although my treatment sucked (not a medical term!), it was not even close to as horrible as it was for her.

I have a daughter, 3 sisters, and a brother who have all agreed that they would prefer to know so they will be better able to protect themselves, the nine vials of blood I had drawn for the testing was for them.
