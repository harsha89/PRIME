      "Content": "Hi everyone, I am new to this site. I was 38 (Feb. 2000) when diagnosed with breast cancer with several lymphnodes infected. I was not in menopause and received a partial mastectomy with two types of chemo and then radiation and am HER negative. I have had problems with back pain, and general joint pain, ever since treatment. I have herniated disc's or bulging disc's from about the thoracic level of 6 all the way down the rest of the spine. I have now been diagnosed with Avascular Necrosis of my left hip. Just curious if anyone else who has been through treatment has had these same side effects?",

      "Content": "Thanks Muttsmom!!! The orthropedist is saying that the avascular necrosis is due the steroid treatments giving during the chemotherapy. When I looked it up online I found that all sites gave that as a reason for this disease. I also found a few other people who have this as a result of the chemo/radiation therapy. As far as the disc's problem, I have mine at a level that they don't even do surgery for and there is no reason, such as a accident, for this to have occured. My first disc herniations are at the level just below where your bra hooks together. Now the rest of the back has been affected.",
