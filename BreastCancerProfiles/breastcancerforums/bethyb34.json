      "Content": "Hi everyone, My mom has recently been diagnosed with secondary breast cancer. She has been told that she will never be cured and that she could live for 5 - 7 years. The metatasis is on her chest wall currently attached to her sternum, she is responding well to letrozole, so they hope that the letrozole will continue to shrink the tumor. However when we last went to see the oncologist he said that they probably wouldnt remove the tumor even if it became smaller and moveable. He said that they would want to use it as a guide to see physically how well she is responding to hormone treatment. Is this normal? Just to fill you in my mom has had breast cancer twice, bladder cancer and now secondary breast cancer on the chest wall. All cancers apart from the bladder cancer are eostrogen receptive. The oncologist also stated that they wouldnt be using chemo at this stage as they \"would want to save it for later\". My moms cancer levels in her blood were 58, he said that they would be regularly checking her bloods to see if this elevates, what is the normal rate for this level? how high can it go? Sorry for the disjointed post, im new to this and Im still in shock.",

      "Content": "Thank you Vee, that is really helpful. How do you cope with the waiting game? Waiting for a new metasis to appear every time you attend a check up? I suppose im asking how you stay so positive? Im trying to be positive for my mom but she is the one thats supporting me at the moment and I feel dreadful about that. I cant seem to face the fact that I will loose my best friend.",
