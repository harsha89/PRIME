      "Content": "Thanks for your reply... I can't even believe that it's gotten worse.. I called my doctor at ten this morning and was told I would receive a call back before the end of the day.. Now, the day is over and the office is closed and guess what? No call back! All I got was the secretary telling me on Thursday that I had a papillary lesion and I needed to come in for a follow-up. No explanation, no appointment and strange experience at the lab and now no call back..I want to cry!! I'm afraid and not one professional gives a crap!",

      "Content": "Hi- I'll try and make this as brief as possible I'm 38 and I found a lump in my left breast three months ago. I finally set up an appointment with my gyno to check it out. He agreed with me that I had a lump and referred my to a surgeon. About three days before my appointment, blood started coming out of my nipple (spontaneously). I moved up my appointment and went to the surgeon. They took a sample of the blood and it came back benign but showed a papillary lesion. My doc sent me to get a sono and a mammo. After the procedure the radiologist came in and with a condescending tone told me there had been no change in my mammo since 2003 and she asked why I though I had a lump. So I told her that I always do breast exams and this was a very noticeable change in my breast...she felt it and said you just have very fibrous breast. So, she then starts looking at my breast on the sonno and says she doesn't see anything and is going to get a second opinion. The other radiologist comes in and asks me the same questions and asks me if I squeezed my breast to make the blood come out. I replied that I didn't and she proceeded to squeeze my nipple till blood came out and said \"oh, there it is\". So, then she stated they she felt that I just have fibrous breast also and I should follow up with my doc and she could do I biopsy if she wants. They tell me I can get dressed. Then the two docs and the tech are standing by the paperwork and the tech says \"so, what should I state\"? And the doc says write that it's normal, that's what is is and they all leave. So I get dressed and the tech knocks and says, \"I'm sorry, I need to take two more pics of your breast cause I threw out two by mistake\" ??...So, she does it again and tells me to get dressed. As I'm dressing, she says, \" listen, I shouldn't be saying this but I did see something on your sonno and I really think you should ask your doc for a biopsy\"....And I leave. Please!!!!! Give me your impression of this????? I am waiting for my docs office to call me back to schedule my follow-up but I truly feel the I may get better thoughts from y'all. Thanks for taking the time to read this! Mary [/b]",
