      "Content": "Originally Posted by HighlanderCFH I was pretty impressed when I met \"the robot\" when they wheeled me in for my surgery. Of course, I only \"knew\" him for a couple minutes before my lights went out. But everything went very smoothly and I had no pain at all afterward. Wishing you the very SAME experience! Also wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy, HEALTHY New Year! Hi, I'm new here, but I just wanted to share. Actually need to share. First I don't know what robot procedure is, but whatever, I'm glad you went through it fine. Now to my story: I just went through a weekend of worst then fire in hell of pain. I had a liver biopsy. I have 2 cancers history and the breast mescactomy was one of them on the right side, so everywhere I go I have to tell that no blood or blood pressure to be used on that arm. However, liver happens to be on that side too. My question is, if they think a small blood take or blood pressure take would somehow hurt me, what in hell is taking a chunk of my liver on that side would be like? did they think about that? Is it not something to consider by the doctor? or even tell the patient? or anything? I guess not, because during the procedure my back was hurting so bad it was knifes being thrown at me, then when he was done, I couldn't move, then the nurses tell me I can't get any pain medication because this procedure they only recommend tylenol. Am I on the same planet as before? Are all these people insane? I tell them I have horroble pain and they tell me they can't give me anything and I'm in a god damn hospital.! So I told the nurse then let me go home. What's the purpose of me lying here for 3 hours in pain if you're not going to help. She says dr. won't let you go. So, I said to the nurse, so basically I am a prisoner in a hospital that won't help me when I'm in horrible pain.! (now that I think about it, I should have just gotten up and left, even if they tried to stop me and cause a scene because this is not the first night mare experience in a hospital I had. But the nurse got a hold of a pain killer, with or without consent, I don't know and that helped for about 2 hrs. then I went home. When I got home, the local anesthesia must have worn off together with the pill the nurse gave me and horrible pain came back to the point where after a few hours I was crying, but there was nobody to call because it was already like 6pm and most people from the shift in the biopsy area I was at were gone, and I didn't even know the name of the doctor who did the biopsy. I tried to make it through the night, but the pain got worse to the point I thought I was going to go crazy, and was crying and cursing and everything. I finally said, i can't take it anymore, told my son to call 911. \"drum roll\" the lady that answered the 911 call say, we have nobody available, can you call back in 10 minutes. I looked at my son, and I couldn't believe it. I yelled, not later, now! you are 911 are you not? she told my son they'll send someone, as soon as they are available. After that, I was not only in pain, but filled with extreme anger. I don't know how much time passed before they showed up, two guys who looked more like plumbers than EMT responders. I'm all messed up, confused, and angry and one of them has a questionnaire in his hands and starts asking questions, name address...etc...My son, who's been with me through the whole ordeal in the hospital and home offers to give the information since i was obviously out of it. The guy says \"NO not you, I want to hear it from her\". I look at him and say \"you gotta be fukn kidding me\"! He says \"well mam, if you're not going to cooperate with us and use that kind of language we will not help you\". OK AT THE MOMENT i BECAME THE BEAST AND ALL i SAW WAS RED. I YELLED \"well then DON'T\" and get the f..k out of my house you scum bags, son' of bitch, and threw a small eating tray table at them and all the cups that were on it.. They ran out of the house like the wind and I was left in tears and pain. I cried so much, I think all that adrenaline kind of settled me down for about an hour. After that, all I can remember is calling my daughter who doesn't have a car \"Juliet please help me\". She said mom, there's nothing I can do, Just wait till John, my husband, comes home and let him take care of it. My husband works till about 1:30am. He came home and I don't remember what happened, I was mentally out, just blabbing some stuff. Finally at 7am I asked him to call the surgery place. Their answer: They know nothing, don't know where the doctor is, and tell me to make an appointment with my referring physician. Make an appointment for pain that I feel now.? words coming out of the mouth of that woman were unreal and I wondered if she was from a mental institution because what she told me was so not right, it was unreal. I have to make an appointment which could take up to a few days, for excruciating pain I have right now? I took the phone from my husband and demanded to speak to the doctor that treated me. They said he was not there. I said then give me immediately the number where he is at. So, they gave me the number, but it was not him that called me back but my referring physician, the gastroenterologist and I told her what happened. She said I'd have to come over and she'll give me pain meds. So, from 7am, it wasn't until about 3:30pm that I actually got some pain meds, because the one she prescribed, apparently, the pharmacy didn't understand or whatever, and after my husband told me that, I just threw up my hands and said I give up. Anyway, he took care of it, and finally got the meds by 3: 30pm. I'm still recovering not just from the physical trauma, but from the emotional trauma from the whole thing as well. I had to tell somebody, thanks for listening.",

      "Content": "yes, thank you. I'd appreciate it if you could transfer me to that area of the forum. but I didn't have liver cancer. I had breast cancer, and a mascectomy done, then 5 months later, I discovered after horroble pain and in emergency after surgery that I had colon cancer. However, my doctor also found that I had hep c, not in serious condition at that time, now being 4 years later, she wanted to check what the condition of it was and had me do liver biopsy. I wanted to know, if being that the liver is on the right side as well where my breast was cut off, that it may have caused more pain than a person who didn't have that combination. Because I never felt such pain in my life. The thing is, it was mostly my back that was killing me, like sharp knifes being poked through it, and the area around the liver as well. I'm just trying to connect the dots here since the doctors and nurses seem not to know what the right hand is doing and what the left hand is doing and they do just regular stuff with everyone. The surgeon just comes in like a ghost, does not introduce himself, does not even know my name, I don't know if he even looked at my chart, he just assumed that the nurses had done all that. He did his thing and left. That's it. sincerely, kiki5711",
