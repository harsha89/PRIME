      "Content": "Hi All, I'm brand new to this forum - have been browsing it for a few days now and finally plucking up the courage to join (never did anything like this before so i hope I'm doing it right!) I'm finished AC chemo, wasn't easy but I didn't have pain, just nausea and the dreaded fatigue. Just started this week with Taxol. Woke up this morning with pain down the right side of my face - can anyone tell me if this is part of the neuroplasty side effects? Thanks for listening! Word of warning, as I get use to this, I'l probably rant on a lot more Denise",

      "Content": "Hi Everyone, Thanks for replying to my post. The face pain has gone now, Thank God! I was scared stiff that it might have been an allergic reaction to the Taxol. Been on a bit of an emotional and physical rollercoaster since December, still find it hard to believe this is really happening to me. Am amazed I've coped with it so far as I consider myself a really bad patient! Some days it feels like there's gonna be no end to it so viewing the forum and seeing how many others have now completed treatment and are still going strong really helps keep the spirit up and helps me look forward. I know I'll still have dark days but hopefully less of them See, I told ye I would start to rant! Bye for now and take care all Denise",
