    "Content": "My mom had breast cancer in 1998. It was so advanced, she went through the then-experimental stem cell transplant. Exactly 7 years later, they have found cancer in her bones, her liver, and her lung. She hasn't been able to receive all her chemo for various reasons, but has recently been unable to get treatment because of fluid around her heart. I know the end is coming ... and soon ... but she and my father haven't told my brother and I what sort of \"life expectancy\" she's been given. Has she not been given one? Are they just not sharing the info? She refused to discuss it with me. If anyone has any words of encouragement or info, I'd love to hear it. God bless!",
