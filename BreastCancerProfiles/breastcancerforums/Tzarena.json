    "Content": "Hi Natalka, I also would be interested to know the answer to this question. I am having a CT scan in January and am wondering would a PET scan not be more beneficial. I have had one clear CT scan already which was done on May 17th 2010. My sister in law was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer last December and after a lumpectomy she had chemo and radiation. She then had a CT scan in August 2010 after her first follow up. I thought they would have done a Pet scan but she did have a Pet scan earlier this year. Maybe a radiation expert will see this and answer. Best wishes, Mel Best wishes, Mel",
