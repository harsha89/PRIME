    "Content": "Hi everyone, I am curious if any of you have experienced a loss in hearing after having treatment? My aunt had chemotherapy and radiation for her breast cancer and is doing very well, she has been on a preventative medication for a number of years after having treatment, it starts with an A, and is a newer preventative drug but I can not recall the name of it at this time. Anyhow, she has had a significant loss in her hearing and it continues to deteriorate and I am wondering if it could be due to this medication - a side effect not mentioned perhaps? Has anyone else expereinced issues with their hearing or have you heard of anyone having a similar situation following treatment or due to medication? Any information you can provide would be greatly appreciated. thx very much",
