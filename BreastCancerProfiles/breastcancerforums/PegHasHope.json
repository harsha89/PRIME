    "Content": "I am currently a 2 year survivor of BC. I am on Femara for my BC. I was stage 1, grade 2. Estrogen, Progesterone positive, HER-. I have had some side affects such as: Horrendous hot flashes/night sweats. Some achy joints. And I do a 1x per year infusion of Zometa to strengthen my bones, as I had Osteoporosis prior to my BC diagnosis. But otherwise I have tolerated this medication fairly well.",
