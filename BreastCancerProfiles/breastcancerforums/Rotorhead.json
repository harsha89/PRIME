    "Content": "Linda- Welcome! I've gone on a crusade for stuff like this. I'm in the military and I got basically zero information beyond \"you have cancer and need to get started on treatment next week\" when I was diagnosed. There was no coordination between chemo, radiation and surgical; I had no idea that there were all these other entities available and waiting (like a nutritionist, genetic counseling, psychologist, psychiatrist, etc). I got no literature on cancer, no lab reports or medical journal articles about clinical trials...you get the picture. I felt that I deserved a lot more, so I'm gathering all this info and hope to turn it into something that helps others like me out - whether it be an info package posted at the hospital, a book or an online resource I don't know just yet. Also, an online blog helps me keep my family (which is large and spread across the country) up to date with my experiences. Basically I'm trying to turn it into something positive, and it's worked for me so far. Welcome to the forum! ALoha, RH",
