      "Content": "I'm so sorry you're here about your mother now after your fathers battle. I'm neither a Dr nor a pathologist, so please take this with a large grain of salt. When the Dr told you that there were clear margins, was it immediately after the lumpectomy (before the final pathology report)? Many times there will be a pathologist in the OR who will do a quick microscopic exam of the tissue during surgery. This is a preliminary look to guide the Dr. It is not as sensitive as the final pathology report where the tissue is stained to make the internal structure more visible. It is possible to have clear margins in the OR that are not clear after final pathology. If the surgeon told you there were clear margins AFTER the final pathology report, then the margins were clear, but the pathologist was clearly concerned based on the note. The fact that this is an invasive cancer, cells were seen well away from the main tumor and near the margins, and there were positive lymph nodes are all cause for worry, but not for freaking out. Freaking out does no good. Now you have to research options, potentially get a second opinion at a major cancer center, and make a list of question for her oncologist (or you will miss something - everybody does). If you are not already at a major cancer center, you might consider a consult from one. They tend to employ a team approach where medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and surgeons work as a team rather than as separate disciplines. In the US, the NCI has designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers - here is a link: NCI Cancer Center Finder My best wishes to you and your family.",

      "Content": "Carangure, I have neither breast cancer or sisters, so I don't know if I'm qualified to answer, but.... People just don't know how to handle cancer or cancer patients. They have never felt what we feel. One of the most annoying thing for me was when an acquaintance would come up and say \"You look so good!\". A person without cancer would probably think \"I got a good haircut\" or \"that gym membership is finally paying off\". To me, it was like they were saying \"I thought you'd be dead by now\" or \"Gee, you don't look like a walking skeleton - yet.\". It wasn't really their problem, they meant well, but they just didn't know what it felt like to be in the middle of chemo. It wasn't really my problem either, because I really felt like I should look half-dead. Both sides were missing how the other really felt. With friends, I've been able to say \"You would never go up to an overweight woman and comment about her weight gain.\". Everyone knows that most overweight people are struggling, and it's best to just stay away from the subject. The worst thing is to say \"You've lost so much weight\" when you know they haven't. The same thing for cancer patients. We are probably a little too self conscious about how we look, feel, and are perceived. Our friends are a little insensitive when they trivialize how we feel or look. Good friends (and sister, I imagine) should be able to understand and appreciate direct discussion of how you feel about something. The worst thing is when someone tries to \"ride on the coat-tails\" of a cancer patient. We all have a tough journey and don't need to carry friends or relatives on our backs. If either sister seems to be doing this, I would go back to the distance you had before. Best wishes to you. Spend your time and effort on feeling better, not on what other people do. Bob",

      "Content": "Razool, I'm saddened to hear about your mothers diagnosis. We are not Drs here, but only patients and their caregivers who share our experiences, so we cannot give medical advice. Showing us her medical records would be like walking up to someone on the street and asking them to look at the records. If she can be seen at a large cancer center, they may have some treatment to offer besides just chemo. There are many clinical trials going on here in the US and in Europe, but I don't know if any of them are offered in Qatar. I do not have experience with breast cancer, but options are usually limited with stage 4 patients because the cancer has spread. Even though they only see the spread right now in the lung, there may be other small areas that are too small to see on the scans. Since chemo spreads throughout the body, it can hold back, or even kill, many of these small tumors. You ask for hope - the only thing I can tell you from my own experience, is that hope is most important because without it you will stop trying. You need hope to see what doors open to you when one door closes. I was originally told that I had 5-7 months unless chemo and radiation would shrink my tumor. With hope, I took the chemo and radiation and the door opened for surgery. I had no evidence of cancer for two years, but it returned and I was stage 4 like your mother. With hope, I did a strong chemo again for 6 months followed by a year of a milder \"maintenance\" chemo. At that time, I was losing hope and had little strength to continue chemo any longer. With what I felt was my last hope, another door opened and I found a cancer center that offered an experimental procedure. I will find out the results of that procedure at my three month follow-up appointment this Friday. Today I am stronger and feel better than I have at any time in the last 4 1/2 years. Hope must rise up from within, but maybe telling your mother my story will help that happen. Best wishes to you and to your mother. Bob",

I wish that I could help with the laboratory results you gave, but we are not Drs, just other patients and their caregivers who share our experiences. Unless there is someone who has experienced this particular problem, you will probably do better talking to her Dr on Friday about your concerns. One experience I can share, and that is very common, is that if you Google your mothers symptoms or results things will almost always look much worse than they really are. We jokingly say that Google is not a Dr, but a mortician. Best wishes to your mother as she continues chemo. Bob",

      "Content": "Sareena, Welcome to the forum. I'm so sorry to hear your diagnosis, but very happy to hear of the progress you seem to be making. I have no experience or knowledge about breast cancer, so can't comment at all about that. I do have experience with chemo and nausea, so maybe can help a little. I was prescribed several anti-nausea meds to take along with the IV meds during chemo. I found that Emend along with the zofran for four days after chemo almost controlled nausea during folfirinox. I also had constipation with these drugs. I had read about marijuana having an anti-nausea effect, but it is not legal here. There is a synthetic THC drug (Marinol) that is FDA approved and legal here. I asked my Dr about this and he said I could try and that some patients seem to have luck with it and others don't. I was one of the lucky ones. Using 5 mg of Marinol twice a day for about four days after chemo, along with Emend on the day of chemo and zofran IV during chemo only was able to give me better nausea control (no vomiting at all) without much constipation. It also avoids most of the high cost of Emend because I can extend the prescribed amount over several treatments. I hope this helps you, or you find another solution. Best wishes to you in your treatment and recovery. Bob",
