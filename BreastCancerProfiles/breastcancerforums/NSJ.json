      "Content": "Hi all New here. As you see from the subject line, I have a Stereotactic Biopsy scheduled for this coming Tuesday - 8/14. I've been doing lots of reading and think I may want to get another opinion before I do it. One of the things that disturbs me the most, aside from all the post-Biopsy horror stories of pain, infection and the titanium marker moving or migrating, is what I read on the thread below: LINK REMOVED AS PER FORUM POLICY It frightens me that the very Biopsy that tells us whether or not our suspect breast \"lump\" is malignant or benign also has the potential to metastasize the cancer via the biopsy's needle track later on. Has anyone else heard this before? BTW: This is my first experience with any sort of potential cancer, including breast. Thank you for reading. NSJ",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Prometheus I'll throw in my two cents as a radiation therapist. Yes seeding through tumor biopsy or excision is a possibility, but imagine if you never had the excision/biopsy you'd be way worse off. It's better for doctors to know what they're dealing with so they can come up with a proper treatment approach. If they do the biopsy and the tumor is benign you're in the clear no worries. If they do the biopsy and the tumor is malignant than they know they must take appropriate action. For breast cancer a combination chemo and radiation therapy approach is common. For radiation therapy the whole breast is treated for a period of time to eliminate the initial cancer and any microscopic cancer that might be in the breast, after the initial phase of the treatment a \"boost\" is given. The boost is basically extra radiation given to the tumor site and scar from the tumor removal, the goal of the \"boost\" is to kill any possible remaining cancer that may have seeded during the tumor removal. So in a nutshell from how I see it as a radiation therapist. Yes, you may be at risk for seeding during a biopsy but it's better to know you have cancer and get the proper treatment than to refuse a biopsy for fear of seeding and let your potential cancer go untreated. Breast treatments account for seeding from the biopsy and always give more than enough chemo/radiation to eliminate all possibility of a second incidence. So the original post does bring some important information to light but at the same time if you have or may have breast cancer don't be alarmed. This may be news to the general public but to the team that is treating you it is old news and you will receive the proper course of treatment. Up above Prometheus wrote \"biopsy or excision\". Does \"excision\" mean lumpectomy??? Anyone?",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Blu I've had many biopsies. The first was over 30 years ago and luckily all have been benign. I have a marker that was implanted 10 years ago and haven't had any issues with it I also never had any problems with any of my biopsies afterwards. Originally Posted by Blu I've had many biopsies. The first was over 30 years ago and luckily all have been benign. I have a marker that was implanted 10 years ago and haven't had any issues with it I also never had any problems with any of my biopsies afterwards. Thanks so much for responding, Blu. I'm so glad to read that. An Article I read states concerns by researchers where they fear the stereotactical procedure may spread (or seed) the cancer, causing something called \"needle track metastasis.\" There was a study done in 2004 by a doctor named Hansen called the \"Manipulation of The Primary Breast Tumor and The Incidence of Sentinel Node Metastases From Invasive Breast Cancer,\" that was published in the American Medical Association's prestigious journal, Archives of Surgery, revealing that patients undergoing fine needle biopsies were 50% more likely to have micrometastases spread to the sentinel lymph node than those patients having the entire tumor removed for biopsy. The implication of this discovery is that a woman without lymph node involvement, who would have been staged at a low level, now will be staged higher, her disease considered more advanced, and more aggressive treatment might be recommended. Has anyone read or heard of this study regarding Stereotactic Biopsy? NSJ",

That is some good info and I really appreciate hearing from you. The idea that the medical community knows about needle track metastasis or \"seeding\" as a result of Stereotactic Biopsys when it's found to be cancer and takes care of it in the course of treatment makes me feel a bit better. For me, I would have liked to be told by my doctor that the seeding risk exists or at least place it in the literature for patients so they are informed. They mention other things in the Stereotactic patient literature like risk of hematoma, etc., but nothing about seeding. I'm also wondering if a lump ends up being benign, is there anything a stereotactic biopsy does to it in the procedure that could possibly make it malignant?",
