    "Content": "Hi, my girlfriend was just diagnosed with BC. Needless to say, she is suffering from extreme anxiety now. Her doctor put her on Citalopram (mild anti-depressant) but it isn't helping. What do you recommend for addressing her anxiety about having BC? I read and meditate, based off books I read. Should I recommend some meditations/breathing exercises to her? Would that help? Please give me your advice. I am somewhat familiar with the fears she's facing because she tells me about them, but I would like to find a way to help her deal with them... How do you or did you deal with them? Thank you ahead of time.",
