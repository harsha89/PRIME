      "Content": "I'm 38 and found a lump in my breast. I went to my gyn and she could also feel it and also said there were smaller places surrounding it, but not attached to the chest wall. I had a diagnostic mamogram and ultrasound and both were negative. A needle biopsy is scheduled for next week. Does this sound fibrocystic? Has anyone else had negative results and still have a lump? I guess I'm just confused by the negative results and still have a lump the size of my thumb nail. Obviously I'm worried about cancer. I'm otherwise healthy and have had no problems like this before. I have no risk factors for breast cancer.",

      "Content": "I got my biopsy results back and it's a fibroadenoma. I'm so relieved but also very glad that I pursued the biopsy! After seeing some friends and family members battle breast cancer, it seemed like a must. I will be diligent now about my annual mammo. Though mine was benign, I hope anyone in this situation would get the biopsy. I am terrified of needles, not to mention the possibility of cancer. The biopsy wasn't nearly as difficult as I'd expected...just the waiting was hard. Thank you for your information and support!",
