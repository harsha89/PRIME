      "Content": "Hello Pastor Rich, Yes, she will lose most of her hair. She may be left with fuzzies and not be completely bald but she will want to wear a hat or scarf or wig. I think you got very good advice! It is not necessary to shave it clean right now. It can be cut short in several layers. That way as it comes out the layers will slowly diminish. Most women start to feel a tingling sensation around day 14 and she will see more in the shower and more in her brush - but builds gradually. What usually happens is it feels so yucky you just want to shave it and get it over with! This IS a big thing. Our hair is our \"thing\". And it is like losing a friend. But the best part is that this friend comes back!!! And, if I may, FEC has been getting WONDERFUL results! So I pray your wife and YOU are also blessed with the healing powers of this medicinethatmakesussickbeforewegetbetter Medicine. Martha Anne",

All you need is a prescription from your doctor for a head prothesthis (sp?) and they cover about 90% of the cost. You have to use a wig salon that participates, but MOST do! Enjoy the little one!

      "Content": "Hi Dr. Leo and Laura, I had been told many times that my breasts were fibrocystic by my doctor who did exams by hand. Only when I got my first baseline did he discover that I didn't have that at all. It was not long after that my cancer was found. Maybe I am an unusual case. But if I knew a girl who had a lump and the doctor just went by feel I would tell her to get a mammo just to be on the safe side. I think after what happened to me I want to be checked every which way they can. I simply don't trust my body anymore. PS - I got a clear MRI on the Sclerotic Foci! He told me that they were \"unremarkable\" and that he will watch them carefully to see if they change in any way. Blessings, Martha Anne",

      "Content": "I was thinking about mammograms and you know how they really press down hard on the breast making them as flat as possible? It is painful and it is a lot of pressure. And sometimes they have to do it mulitple times. Well, I was thinking, if you had a DCIS that was still safely IN SITU could a mammogram's pressure push it so it breaks through the duct? My path was a DCIS AND IDC. So I always assumed that had I caught it early I would have a better prognosis. But if a woman has just a plain contained DCIS that is forced out of its containment just from the mammo could that be why some women do much better than others? Meaning that they didn't have as aggressive a cancer as assumed- it was just made to look that way. What do you think Dr. Leo?",
