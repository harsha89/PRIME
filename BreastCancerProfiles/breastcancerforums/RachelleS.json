      "Content": "Thank you everyone for your support and kind words. I stopped taking my hormones yesterday after reading everything about them. I go to see my PCP on Thursday and have spoken to my aunt who was diagnosed recently. She is helping me and checking on alot of stuff for me as well. My lymph nodes have been swollen for quite sometime and are getting larger but I thaught it was just fat. So I ignored it. The problem was and still is the chest pain that comes and goes. But I hope it is only muscle pain. Well God is on my side and tommarow will be great day. I will keep you all posted. Thank you again. rachelle",

      "Content": "Hello all my name is Rachelle and found this site by searching about Breast Cancer. I am 29 and I have been having chest pain on my left side for about 6 months. My PC has been doing EKG's and nothing. Well yesterday I had shortness of breath and the pain that comes and goes and she sent me to the ER. Well they have been the first to do a breast exam and found my lymph nodes all swelled under my armpit on my lfet side and up onto my breast. No lumps were found. They did do a chest xray and saw a mass above my heart that they said it could be from my ammonia I had 6 months ago. So they told me that my pain can not be handle in the ER and that I must make a appontment with my PC ASAP and get a mammogram done. They gave me some bactrim DS for the inflamation and muscle relaxers. They told me that they are not equipt in the ER to take care of the lymph nodes and that my PC will probably send me to a breast specialist to get the lymphs checked. My blood work was fine. I am so lost and confused my Aunt had breast cancer and I am afraid that this is what it is and that is has already spread becouse no one listned to me 6 months ago. I have checked on line and I know it states that after 50 is usually when people get breast cancer. I am 29 but I had a hysterectomy 2 years ago and have been on estorgen and also started by period when I was ten , also I have endometrosis. I have noticed that this all takes a factor in this. Can anyone make me feel better. I see my PC in two days. Thank you for you help and listning Rachelle",
