      "Content": "Hi everyone, I tried to write a post before but it didn't seem to work. 6 months ago I found a horizontal lump, (5 cms long now) below my collarbone and just above my left breast. I believe it has grown in size and it has just started to become visible. It is hard and unmoveable and is not painful. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar lump before? And perhaps might now what it might be? It almost feels like a protruding rib. I have finally mustered up the courage to go and see the doctor. Any advice/comments would be deeply appreciated",

I might go see the doctor in the next week or so as I don't think this lump is too serious to go see a doctor straight away. I think it might just be that my rib has protruded. My left leg has been really hurting lately so I might go see someone about that.",

My left leg has been really hurting/aching for the last year, especially after I exercise or have a big day on my feet. As soon as I told him my symptoms he send me to get an x-ray. I'll be going back for an appointment about the x-rays as soon as I call and book one. Here's crossing my fingers it's nothing!",

When I went to see my doctor (I had a lump under my arm at the same time, which turned out to be nothing) she told me it was nothing to be worried about and completely normal. But of course, everyone is different and if you're worried about it definitely go check it out!",
