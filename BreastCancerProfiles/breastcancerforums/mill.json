I believe it has grown in size and it has just started to become visible. It is hard and unmoveable and is not painful. I was wondering if anyone has had a similar lump before? And perhaps might now what it might be? It almost feels like a protruding rib. I have finally mustered up the courage to go and see the doctor. Any advice/comments would be deeply appreciated",
