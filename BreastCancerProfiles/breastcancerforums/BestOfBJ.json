    "Content": "Hi There, I too had serious left breast cancer. I went for the Mammosite but had to have the external radiation too. Let me tell you, if you are a good candidate for the Mammosite, in my opinion, it was so much better than the external radiation. Only 5 days of radiation versus 5 weeks. You can get more info at their website and contact people from your state or area. The catch is, if you are a good candidate. Meaning, is the breast still intact and is the cancer contained within the breast. Mine went into the lymph system, 4 of the 7 removed were cancerous, and was stage IIIA because of the size of the mass removed. I'm also a volunteer for the voices of mammosite, not a saleperson. It's not meant for everyone so the best thing to do is contact a doctor in your area and start asking lots of questions. I'm in Arizona and was very lucky to have such progressive doctors working with me. Good luck. BJ",
