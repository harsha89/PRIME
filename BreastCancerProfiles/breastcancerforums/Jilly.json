      "Content": "Hello Everyone~ I was hoping you might give me your thoughts on this: I just had a wire localization excisional biopsy based on a previous stereotactic biopsy that had results of LCIS. I had an MRI prior with results stating \"appears invasive lobular\". I asked my surgeon if he would do a sentinal node biopsy and he said no \"first things first\". Isn't it common to do that at the time of an excisional biopsy? And another question if you will bear with me .... The wire localization was done with the radiologist placing the wire to pinpoint the exact spot where the clip was placed at the time of stereotactic biopsy. I'm concerned that they might be missing the section that looked invasive on the MRI, because they seemed to just be focusing on the previous stereotactic biopsy. I thought the whole point of doing an excisional biopsy is to remove other tissue to determine if it's invasive (not only the \"in-situ\" portion). I guess I'm just concerned that they are going to miss something!! Any thoughts and how do I question the doc when I go for follow up next week? Thanks for any input ~ you all are so helpful and reading your stories is such an encouragement. Jilly",

      "Content": "Thanks for your response Muttsmom~ I appreciate your insight since you've been through a bunch. I agree & thought it was a bit odd that Dr didn't seem to think the nodes needed biopsy (maybe I misunderstood him?) He just said the PET scan looked clear and likely no radiation/chemo was necessary. I definitely will tell the surgeon that I want him to do a SNB though. I told Oncologist that I wanted bilateral mastectomy since I'm fairly young (50-it's all relative) strong & otherwise healthy. I would rather deal with this once (hopefully) and not have constant worry, biopsies, mammos etc to check the other breast only to end up with removing that breast later. But, then of course, I start to worry about the insurance etc... I hope you are on the other side and doing well!! Thanks again for your help!",

      "Content": "Sorry, think I need to vent here The oncologist sent me to a surgeon to talk about mastectomy. My first impression was \"ok, the waiting room is full...he must be busy\" (Good or bad to start?) While completing the paperwork at a table in the center of the room with other waiting patients, I can hear the person at the front desk getting my new patient chart together. She needs to get the pathology report from the sterotactic biopsy because they only gave me the final conclussion/findings, but not the actual pathology section. So, she's calling to locate this and request it~using my name, date of birth etc...(made me uncomfortable what with all the privacy/hippa papers I had to sign) Anyway...just felt like she was broadcasting my dx, name, age etc...The waiting room was very small and some people standing. Maybe I'm just a bit sensitive with all this!! Finally called in to exam room and the doc's nurse is very nice, goes over all my films, asks why I'm there etc. The doc comes in and very nice, but kind of brusque (He had all those patients in the waiting room)Ha! Well, he starts out with the LCIS is not really cancer theme and that MRI's are often False positive and show things that aren't really worrisome. He asks what my thinking is on my situation (if I'm ok with careful monitoring, maybe tamoxifan, biopsy, mastectomy etc). I explain that I want to know exactly what's in there and to remove it before it spreads. So, his advice is an MRI guided biopsy first then we can discuss mastectomy if I'm really searious about doing it even prophylactically. I can tell that he thinks I'm wasting his time and my situation is not as serious as all those others in his waiting room!! (I really am sensitive today!) Anyway, I was a bit put off by him (sort of the attitude that he \"knows it all\" and my questions / concerns were silly and I should just do whatever he says. By this time, though I'm thinking, well another biopsy might be good and better to have another shot at getting a true dx. So, go make the appt for MRI guided biopsy for a week later. Then, on the way home I get a call saying that they had to schedule a regular breast MRI first (I just had one 2 weeks ago) because this dr doesn't think the facility where I had the first one was the best equipment / best radiologists etc. and \"their protocol\" was to have an MRI at their facility before the MRI biopsy. Would that tick you off?? I understand that he has radiologists that he trusts etc. but, it just seems a bit excessive. I asked to speak to the nurse to have it explained, and she said, \"Well, maybe the MRI done at our facility will mean that you don't even need the MRI guided biopsy\". I'll tell you, by now I'm feeling like I want to just hide under a rock and not do anything...(I know it's just the beginning, but I felt so emotional about it)....\"NOT DO ANYTHING?\" Anyway, I don't even know if my insurance will authorize both the MRI and then MRI biopsy and really hate to go to yet another surgeon. But, feeling quite uncomfortable about the way this consult went. Am I just being too naive and emotional about this? Do I have to put up with it? Ha! My oncologist is kind, caring & top notch in his field, and he highly recommended this surgeon....so hate to be one of those dissatisfied patients, that complains all the time. But...it's my body/life!! Any advice or input and how would you react and handle this?? Ok...my rant is done (I think) I know you all have dealt with so much more and probably understand all of this too well. I'll try to have more encouraging words in the future Jilly",

      "Content": "I've received the excisional biopsy results and the report says: Extensive LCIS - multiple foci \"focally extending into duct epithelium\". Also 3 of 5 core biopsies done at same time on other portion of same breast had the same diagnosis. (All in one breast~the other dx is benign). Any thoughts on what the \"focally extending into duct epithelium\" means??? Also, the ER/PR receptor studies were performed but not indicated on report with \"will not be repeated unless specifically requested\". Does that mean that if I ask for it they will provide the results or that they will repeat the test on the tissue? Sorry for so many questions, but I need to make some decisions. It's difficult to know what is right with LCIS when so many reports say \"not really cancer\"!! Of course, the surgeon says I've got 3 options: close monitoring, close monitoring w/hormonal therapy or mastectomy. I don't like any of those options!! But, I am thankful that it is caught early and I have choices. I'm sure many of you wish you had my diagnosis. I know that so many of you have been through so much and your input is highly regarded.

      "Content": "Still39, Best wishes for your surgery next week!! I am still living in sweats, button front shirts (flannels for warmth!!). I was fortunate to have a friend come stay with me for a week after surgery. I do think you might need some help for a day or two (?) I have not tried sleeping in bed yet....I have a comfortable recliner and it seems easier to lie at that angle. My friend who recently went through this surgery used one of those wedge type pillows with other pillows propped up for support as well. From what I've read, you may have to deal with drains as well (I was fortunate to not have any at all!!), so I think if you prepare to wear things that will allow you access to that and mostly be as comfortable as possible! It's really not that bad, especially if you take the pain meds as needed!! If you have easy, nutritious things to eat and drink as well...I think quick little snacks that will help you regain your energy etc..will be best. I will keep you in my prayers for a quick recovery and great prognosis!!! Let us know how you are doing after surgery!!! Also...I did receive my pathology report yesterday and thankfully the nodes were clear!! There was a small invasive portion, so I was reassured that the bilateral mastectomies were warranted!! After reading so much about LCIS being just a marker and not cancer, I worried that I was being too aggressive. Now, I just feel total relief and glad that I trusted my gut instincts. I trust God was nudging me in that direction!! Take Care~Jilly",

      "Content": "Hi all, I thought it was time to post and share that my surgery went well on 12/1. I ended staying in the hospital for 4 days as the morphene did not like my stomach much! Once they changed meds, I started doing much better. My blood count went down a bit, so stayed in a day longer to wait for that to improve, but other than that it wasn't too bad. I was surprised to wake up to no drains! I had explanders placed immediately and just wrapped up with ace bandage. The doc seemed to think that the pressure was enough to move the fluid along. I had just a bit of swelling, but after getting up and around, it went down quickly. The next surprise was that I was gathered up with stiches where the nipple will be eventually with reconstruction. I expected long scars across the middle!! The doc basically cut off the nipple, scooped me out, then gathered me up! I'm expecting no scars to show as the stitching is where the new nipple will be. I am quite sore, tight and get tired so easily after being up for a couple of hours...but feel pretty good! I do advise that any of you planning this surgery, to be sure to take your colace/stool softener as that is a problem...drink prune juice/other juices and eat other fiber/fruit to keep the bowels moving!! Lots of water too!! My first fill is next week, so I'm nervous about how that goes...but will share with you as well. Also, the final pathology should be in by my next followup on Tuesday. I'm so curious to find out what all was in there!! Best wishes to everyone on their journey, Jilly",
