    "Content": "I was diagnosed 6 weeks after the birth of my third child. I was 37 years old. My doctor and I thought it was mastitis because of the timing. After my doctor actually touched it she knew right away it was not mastitis. It did hurt when I pushed on it. I ended up with a rather large mast on my left breast. i went on to have partial mastectomy, four months chemo and 6 weeks of radiation. Make sure you have it checked out. YOU may not have breast cancer, BUT you need to make sure!!! Early detection, is the key.I am doing great now!!! You can email me directly if you have any [emailÂ protected]om Take Care-Glenna",
