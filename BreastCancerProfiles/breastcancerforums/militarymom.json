    "Content": "I had a lumpectomy 3 years ago on April 9th with Chemo and radiation following. Last year I had another biopsy in the same breast (it turned out to be a hematoma in the site of the tumor) which abcessed and took 8 months to heal. The Doctor says I can now have reconstruction done and have visited a couple of different plastic surgeons. The first one said he could take a flap from my back but could not use any implants because of the radiation that I had. This is what my medical oncologist had told me also. The second surgeon I visited said that he would also take a flap from my back but he would also use an implant. Now I am really confused. Which one is right?",
