    "Content": "Hi Everyone, I got my first mammogram when I was 39 years old. They did all sorts of tests as well and it showed I had nothing. Results were negative. I got my mammogram done today and I am more than terrified. The night before I threw up and was just in panic. My father passed away from Prostate Cancer so all of this is just a lot! I got the mammogram done at a new place because I have a new job. I went to the mammogram place and they told me that I will hear from them in one week as they need to get my first mammogram when I was 39 first to compare with the mammogram I just did now. Why do they have to compare? Why do I have to wait a week and they will contact me? Don\u0092t they give results on the spot?",
