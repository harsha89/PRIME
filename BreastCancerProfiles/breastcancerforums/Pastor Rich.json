      "Content": "Hello all! Wow, this board is moving right along..... It's been a week or so since I've been here...... Cathy's next chemo (4 of 6) is this coming Friday. We were told point blank in our chemo and nutrition class that chemo patients should stay away from supplements and large intake of certain vitamins that are anti-oxidants. The reason to stay away from supplements is simple: they are not regulated and there is no guarantee of what they contain or even how pure it is. In spite of the massive lobbying by the manufacturors, they may or may not be safe. With vitamins, at high dosages some can interfere with the chemo. Why go to all the pain of having chemo and then counter the effects? Blessings, Pastor Rich",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by Muttsmom Hi, Just wanted to see how Cathy was doing with her FEC. Is she still having no problems or have the side affects besides the fatigue kicked in. She shouldn't have but about 1/2 of them left to go? How are you holding up Rich. Komen has a new pin on the website. It's a co-survivor pin. It's the regular pink ribbon and then it's got a white ribbon bordering it too. It's for all the caregivers that got us through this \"journey\". I know it about killed my parents when they heard their daughter had BC, so I've ordered them one as my way of saying thank you for being there and thank you for putting up with my MAJOR mood swings. Nancy Hi Nancy! Just picked your message up!!!!! Cathy is doing GREAT! Right now she is in bed and not going to church to avoid infection, but there has been no nausea. Her blood counts were SPECTACULAR, said the onc. We are 2/3 done. Her veins are holding up not-to-bad, though the blanket heater at the hospital was on strike, and that made it difficult. So, God is good! In fact, very good! Thanks for asking! Rich",

That was the night of the 1st chemo.... we prayed and asked the folks on the catholic forum to pray (www.catholic.org) and the nausea was gone. She has had some hot flashes but after seeing our doctor those are almost gone as well. (Cathy is 54 next month). Next chemo is Dec 10th. And, if I haven't shared this, the radiologist told us that after she finished the chemo and radiation, there is less than a 10% chance of recurrance. Of course, that's not a guarantee but it was welcome news. The way they put it is that what they are doing is not curative but is preventative. Today our grandson will be born, probably by c-section, and Cathy will head down on Friday to help. So tomorrow she will get her head trimmed as she doesn't want to have it fall out away from home. And, she does have her wig. Our finances are tight as she is the major income-earner and being a contract worker she has no disability income. Several of the \"church-ladies\" offered to pay anonymously for her wig. Well, it turned out that Cathy needs a blend, not synthetic because she is allergic to acrylic. (The wig shop let her try one of each). The price was $650 Canadian, or about $500US. We had thought it would be about $200. The ladies didn't even bat an eye -- they said \"let us bless you as God has blessed us.\" And Cathy has her wig. Blessings to you all as well, Pastor Rich",

      "Content": "Hello all (and especially the Drs); Cathy is finished her chemo (6xFEC100) as of last Friday and we are off next week to a cottage for a rest. During chemo, she was told not to drink alcohol as her liver was already busy processing the chemo chemicals. The doctors did give the OK for one glass of wine or beer (no hard stuff) in between the chemos. She enjoyed this after her fatigue began to lift, usually at the end of the 2nd week. Since chemo is over, when can this restriction be lifted? When she asked the onc she told him that she had a glass of wine every three weeks, so he automatically said \"then in 3 weeks.\" Would it be OK to resume light drinking (i.e. wine with dinner or wine and cheese) at the cottage after chemo has been done for 10 days? Thanks, Pastor Rich (who feels like a lush for posting this)",

The good news is that the oncologist has said that after chemo and radiation she has less than a 10% chance of recurrance. So far as chemo goes, my wife had heard every horror story out there from well-meaning people who should keep their mouths shut, IMHO. (Not on this board or www.breastcancer.org, BTW). Her own sister kept referring to it as \"draino.\" The reality was very different. She drank litres and litres of water before the 1st chemo and all the time since. We were prepared for a lot of nausea and I had a \"barf-bucket\" all ready to go beside the bed. Around 8pm she felt a bit queezy so she took the extra nausea pill and then some gravol as directed. I also got a number of on-line friends to pray and the nausea went away. It has not returned and we are approaching chemo #3 on Dec 31. Her appetite has been fine, too. I guess what I am saying is that you should be prepared by doing what the chemo unit tells you to do. They said \"drink water,\" and my wife drank water. They said \"take your meds,\" and my wife took her meds right on time. If they had said 'stand on your head,\" I would have insisted she do that as well.....

Cathy did not think she would be bothered by her hair, until it happened. She got it cut short around day 14 and it was hard on her. She was surprised at her reaction.

      "Content": "Hi Shelly; I had a melanoma about 10 years ago and for the 1st five years I went for checkups every 3, then every 6 months. Each time, about a month before, I started to feel tingling under my arms. My family doctor had to send me for a cardiac stress test, it was so bad. It was all in my head. Strange thing, our minds. Now, my wife has lobular, and when I reminded her of this she admitted her underarms were bothering her as well. BTW, lobular is different than ductal in many ways. Because it doesn't show up well on mamograms, it is usually found when it is at a later stage. My wife's \"first-blush\" diagnosis was a 1cm tumor. It turned out to be 2.1cm and eventually stage III. 10 of 14 lymph nodes were positive. This would normally be bad news, but the good news is that recent studies show that in spite of being found at a later stage, lobular long term statistics are better than ductal. Try not to be anxious. This is terribly difficult to do, but the best advice I have is to take the anxious thought as it pops into your mind and replace it with something lovely. It works but requires practice to intercept the thought before it takes root and grows. Blessings, Pastor Rich",

      "Content": "Hello folks; First, Cathy is doing GREAT! She had chemo #4 of 6 last Friday. The doc looked at her blood counts and said they were SPECTACULAR. His words! My question: the doc said Cathy could take Vitamin E for her hot flashes (she is also on other meds for that). When we questioned him about that and anti-oxydants, he said NOT to take them within a few days of the chemo. She is on FEC100. I guess this is just for my own knowledge, but how long does it take for the chemo drugs themselves to clear through the body? Are they sort of mixed in with the blood for a few days, or weeks, or what? Thanks and blessings, Pastor Rich",

Please let us know how it goes ! leo Hi Leo; After my wife had her mammogram, she was sent for X-rays and blood tests. As she has sciatica, they even X-rayed there. Since then, she has been diagnosed as pT2, N3a and she is being scheduled to see an oncologist. Initially, it seemed the cancer was T1 and the surgeon was talking about radiation only. It was lobular and that fooled everyone as to the size. We haven't heard anything about what was seen on the X-rays and blood tests, and didn't remember to ask at our appointments. Would it be likely that they gave no indication that the cancer had spread?? Thanks, Rich",

      "Content": "Hi Sharon; The most general rule is that \"small is good.\" If it is 8mm that is good news. My wife and I are just about to see the oncologist next week for the 1st time. She has invasive lobular which is less common than ductal. We have cried a lot over the past few weeks. If you keep it bottled up you will explode. My best advice (as a Pastor) is to have a long talk with God, and if you feel like yelling at God, go right ahead. Even if you don't believe He exists. As well, call a friend you can trust and lean on them. This is a time when you will need support. Even if it is difficult to reach out, it is far far more difficult to go it alone. Blessings, Pastor Rich",

      "Content": "Hi folks; My wife starts 5 weeks of radiation on April 4, and we have been offered a place to stay in Florida in May. We would have to drive from Ontario... Cathy has been told she will be tired after the radiation is over (she has just finished 6 chemo treatments). Just how tired will this be? Will she be OK to go and enjoy the drive and the vacation??? Thanks, Pastor Rich",
