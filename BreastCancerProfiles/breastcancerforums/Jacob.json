    "Content": "Eat a low fat diet high in fiber and complex carbohydrates. Foods such as cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower are thought by some to prevent Breast cancer. Do not eat charred or burnt food. Don't smoke and do not drink alcohol heavily.If cancer runs in your family get an annual check up. In some countries where Breast cancer is low, iodine content in the soil is high; therefore, an iodine deficiency may be linked to the incidence of Breast cancer.
