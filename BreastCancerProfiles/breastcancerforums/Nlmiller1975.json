    "Content": "I was dx with idc breast cancer est+/her2+ in February of 2013. I had surgery, chemotherapy (Carboplatin and Taxotere), Herceptin, radiation and Tamoxifen (for five years). Now, I'm dealing with a few issues, but I'll not overload the post and make things confusing, so I'll try to attack things a little at a time. 1) I have no eyebrows. Will they every grow back? What can I do? 2) I now have blepharatis. The ophthalmologist thinks it may have had something to do with the chemotherapy. My eyes are always irritated and red. I'm taking Restasis, putting other drops in my eyes almost all day, warm compresses. It's just consistently painful. Perhaps part of the issue is my makeup? Has anyone had any issues like this? If so, any name brands of makeup that I should be looking at that are paraben free and okay for someone with blepharatis? 3) Finally, for now, I would love to find some laundry detergent, et cetera, that I can get at the grocery store or local department store that's paraben free. Any ideas? Thank you for reading.",
