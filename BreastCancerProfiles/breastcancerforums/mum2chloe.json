      "Content": "Hello new to this forum so bare wth me... I was diagnosed with b/c at aged 28, 5yrs ago now, underwent mastectomy, chemo, radio etc.... comenced tamoxifen plus Zoladex as adjuvant treatment, 2yrs spent off treatment when we concieved our little baby girl, whom is now 8mths of age. Shortly after the birth our baby girl i recomenced the Tamoxifen and Zoladex adjuvant treatment. Recently my oncologist has put to me the option of having my ovaries removed instead of taking Zoladex implants montly. Is there anyone on this forum that has had an ovarian oblation and if so how did it go? Did you still have bleeding afterwards? Were the hot flushes extreme? I am suffering with Depression atm and finding it hard to make the decision, i know that the positives outway the negatives and if i didnt have my little baby i wouldnt even contemplate it, but want to be here for a long time not a short time. Any help advice would be much apreciated Kim",
