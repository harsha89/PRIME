One of those fundraisers this year is a raffle for Custom My Little Ponies. We will be donating every penny from this raffle to The Breast Cancer Research Foundation. More then one of the team members for our event has been affected by breast cancer including myself. We are doing everything we can to spread the word on this raffle.
