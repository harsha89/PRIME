      "Content": "Hi I finally thought it was over, but was completely shocked when I went for my 3 month check up and my recent mammogram showed more calcifications. I am now booked for another core biopsy only one year after having core biopsy and then surgery to remove the area.I am also on tamoxifin as they found LCIS last year.I never thought I would be considering a mastectomy but see on this board that it might be a possibility. If anyone has thoughts on this please advise.......I keep thinking how many biopsies can we put ourselves through? Thanks Lenora",
