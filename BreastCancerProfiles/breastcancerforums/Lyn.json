      "Content": "My sister is about to have 6 sessions of chemotheraphy but we are still in the process of choosing the set of drugs/medicines for her chemo. Well, of course we want the best but we have financial problems. We are choosing for the 1st option which according to the doctor include medicines such as taxotere,doxorubin and cyclophanphanamide and it is 90% effective while the other option which is less expensive but also less efefctive is that the first 3 sessions doesn't include the taxotere and the last three sessions do include taxotere. Is anybody who experienced or know something about the 1st and 2 option? If we do choose the 2nd option does it mean the possibilty of my ssiter to be cured is less?",

      "Content": "Thank you for your reply.. Her tumor was invasive ductal carcinoma grade 3 - stage 2, it is it is considered the maximum size of the tumor (not sure the exact size but I remembered it is in the maximum). Her ER/PR- and her-2+ intensity 1+..Yes, the doctor says the first option is 90% guarantee and the 2nd option is 80% guarantee. We are in the Philippines and there are no organizations here taht can help us. My sister is now jobless and she doesn't have husband to assist in her financial needs, nor my parents. I've been thinking if we don't have much money for her chemo, would the 2nd option a big chance of survival?",
