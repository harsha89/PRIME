As for your sisters shaving their heads and how you feel about it, that is hard to answer. Sounds like you were very open with why these actions made you feel uncomfortable. Many times people are not sure how to handle or support the person with the diagnosis and they were probably just wanting to say hey even though you haven't been close that doesn't mean they are not there for you. How have you been doing with your diagnosis? Do you have support? This section of the forum can be quiet some times but I am hoping others with chime in here for support for you. Please continue to let us know how you are doing. All the best, Jodie",

I would strongly recommend you speak to your oncologist about your question. Do you have any follow up appointments coming up? Or can your family dr contact them to discuss and then they can follow up with you? How have you been feeling? 10 years is great news! Please if you are up to sharing, we would love to hear your story. We like good news stories. Jodie",

      "Content": "Hi Gemmamoran6, I have moved your thread to the Breast Cancer section so it may more likely seen by others affected by this particular type of cancer. I am sorry for your mom's diagnosis and what you and your family are going through. Honestly from what you are describing I would think it is the steroids and the drinking. But then again I am not a doctor. What steroid is she on and what dose? Still sometimes when facing this diagnosis and our own mortality people can change and not always in good ways. Obviously she is in lots of pain too. That can turn people mean. I am not try to excuse her behaviour. Just help explain where it may be coming from. It is hard to always be understanding if you are always a target. Especially your dad. The ones we love the most are often the targets. Has anyone talked to her doctors about this? About her behaviors and especially her drinking? Other than the anti hormone and steroids is she in any other kind of treatment? Sorry for the questions. Just helps us get a better understanding. My only advice is to make sure her treatment team knows what is going on and if you haven't involve hospice. No one can give you a time line. It varies too much as there are too many factors - sorry. But hospice van maybe help take some of the pressures off at home and give everyone well deserved breaks. I am sorry I did not have more precise answers for you.This is a tough road you are on. You are welcome to continue posting. This is a very supportive group. Jodie",
