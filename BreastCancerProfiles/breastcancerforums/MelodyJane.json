    "Content": "Hello, I am new here and have a couple questions about my experience so far. I have had some pain in my left breast for weeks, if not months, and it seemed to be getting more constant. I found myself checking for any sign of why it was hurting such as bruising or a lump and couldn't find any explanation. Finally, when it again hurt for several days I asked my husband to also feel which he did and he felt nothing, but he then said he wanted to feel the other side to compare. He quickly said, \"do you know you have a lump on this side?\"...and sure enough on the other side was a lump. Waited several days thinking it would go away until my husband insisted I go the the hospital. The Dr there immediately located the lump and said I needed to be seen by a general surgeon and gave me a referral saying that he felt I could/should skip being seen my by PCP. I made an appt and was seen today by a general surgeon. He examined me and also immediately located the lump. He then said he recommended I have both an ultrasound and mammogram and plan on having a biopsy. The way he presented it was that if any of the three tests indicated anything at all unusual that he would recommend surgery to remove the lump. He then asked me, \"but if all three of those come back indicating that it is benign, will you be satified with that?\". Puzzled, I asked him if there was a reason why if all three tests came back indicating it was benign that I shouldn't be satisified and he said because at that point there would be different options to consider and depending on my answer to that question would determine which path we would take. Not in these exact words, but he basically asked me if at that point I would be satisfied or at peace with it still remaining in my body or would still want it removed. My question is this....after I left the office I realized he never mentioned even the possibility of it being a cyst. Even in his discussion of a biopsy he never discussed the possiblity of it being fluid...his only said, \"we would do a biopsy and take a piece of it\". Am I wrong to assume by this that he was indicating that he believes this isn't a cyst and is a mass and what we are trying to determine is if it is benign or malignant? It just struck me that he never mentioned the word cyst at all and I have read so much online about how many lumps are cysts. Any feedback would be appreciated...I scheduled both my mammogram and ultrasound for this Friday so I'd appreciate any info about that too.",
