    "Content": "Hello all, my mother has just recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and both her and I are worried about the right place for her to be treated. Has anyone been or heard anything about Cancer Treatment Centers of America? We went there today and it seemed to be ok, it just seemed alittle like they were trying to sell you something...alittle scripted i guess. the doctor seemed alright though, and very optamistic (which im hoping is a good thing, and not just becuase he wants to make money off of us) the only reason i doubt it is becuase its hard to kno who to trust, and since he suggested surgeory, its not like theres room for a second chance. We went to the one in Illinois if that helps. Any help would be fantastic thx a bunch.",
