    "Content": "My friend told me something recently that seems to defy all medical knowledge. My friend's mom's friend was diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm not sure what stage the cancer was, but I'm assuming it had metastasized since my friend said that surgery was not an option. After making some big lifestyle changes including a strict vegetarian diet, regular exercise, and quitting her job, she felt much better. I don't have any of the details and I'm sorry for that, but basically, she had beaten cancer without surgery or any kind of therapy. Has anyone else heard of any miraculous stories like this? I didn't press my friend to find out more details since her own mom is dealing with stage 4 breast cancer right now and is trying to make the same lifestyle changes that her friend did. I didn't want to be rude so I hid my skepticism... but really, has anyone heard of anything like this? I would love for it to be true because I'm hoping the best for my friend's mom.",
