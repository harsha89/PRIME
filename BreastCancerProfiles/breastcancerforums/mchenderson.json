      "Content": "Hi All, I said that I'd update this after today at my doctors so I wanted to share the news with you guys. I went to see the radiologist this morning and they ran an ultrasound on me. The radiologist spent nearly 40 minutes looking at the black and white image on the screen before even muttering a word. The outcome....the lump is not fluid filled so he said he ruled out the likihood of it being a cyst. He believes it's a tumor. The radiologist said that because of it's location that he doesn't want to needle biopsy it and would prefer doing surgery to remove it. The radiologist said that he isn't positive that it's not cancerous, but that most tumors are benign. I'm waiting for my doctor to call me back to set-up a surgery. I'm hopeful that it's benign, but still concerned. It's been an emotional day. My husband happened to call today so I told him about my news. He is concerned and wishes he could be here with him, but I hope everything works out. I'll continue to update you all when I know more. Thanks for listening.",

He worries about me a lot as it is....new house, new dog, new city, and alone....so I'd hate to add to that list. My family all knows about the lump and are just as anxious about tomorrow as I am. We all just don't talk much about it yet because we believe that thinking positive sometimes makes a huge difference. Tomorrow just couldn't come soon enough. It's crazy how slow a clock ticks when you watch it. I plan to post tomorrow after I know just because I don't want to leave you guys hanging. I've read a lot of posts on this site and hate never knowing what happens after a woman who discovered a lump and made an apointment never posts again. So, I'll be back to let you guys know the great news that the lump is a cyst and nothing to be concerned about. Again, you all are in my prayers tonight, and always... Oh, and before I forget...If any young girl is reading this I can't express to you how important self breast exams are. I never would've discovered this lump without doing them. I'm only 20....Breast Exams are just as important as brushing you teeth, combing your hair, or anything else you do daily. In the time it takes you to send a text message you could be done with your breast examine.... so just take the couple minutes to feel your \"ta-tas\" haha...because it really could make a HUGE difference!",

      "Content": "Hi, My name is Catie and I'm new to this site. I found this site today after my visit to the doctors. I found a pea-sized lump in my right nipple a couple weeks ago and finally got to the doctor to have it looked at. I have an ultrasound scheduled for Thursday morning and possibly a mammogram, but they said because I'm still young, I'm only 20, that it's difficult to see a lot on a mammogram because my breast are too dense. My lump in my breast is hard and can't be moved so the doctor told me he doesn't think it's a cyst, but he can't tell just from feeling it. He said a cyst would move at least a little bit. I know that family history only plays into so much of breast cancer, but both of my grandma's and mother have had breast cancer. After reading this site I did become aware of one thing though. A couple months ago my nipples started to peel and become really red. I was nuts about scratching them. I couldn't get enough with just a couple scratches. It was so bad at some points that I needed to leave a store because I was embarrased about scratching my nipples. They were also scaly like fish. I didn't really think anything of it at that point because it was the summer time and I thought my skin was just dry so I treated it with lotion. It's only returned once since then. Now, after reading about Paget's Disease I'm upset that I put off a breast examine. I'm just worried about the lump in my breast. I never thought at 20 I'd be having an ultrasound on my breast. I'm trying to remain positive, but Thursday couldn't come soon enough. My husband is deployed also to Iraq right now....we're newly-weds so it's even more difficult doing this alone. I can't even tell him what I'm going through because he is also facing a difficult time where he's at. I'm glad I found this site.",
