I have read that you are support to put thngs at the bottom of the page about your condition, so I will have to read that again and start doing that with my in my posts. I'm just new to the forum and haven't done that. Thanks for you reply, and I hope that you are doing well.",

      "Content": "I've had a needle biospy that showed a hormone driven cancer in my right breast. Now I'm going to MRI and surgery. Although I'm 58, I look much younger and care about how my body looks. Plus I have panic attacks, so I'm having a lot of them even with medication to control them. I'm not sleep well and crying a lot. But as I said, I've had two opinions and both of the drs. were reassuring about how it is in it's early stage. There are so many decisions to make, and I can't even think straight.",
