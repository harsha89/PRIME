      "Content": "There is a lot of interest generated by cyberknife. Cyberknife and its related products are more for metastatic cancers than for treatment of any primary tumour. Like for example, a patient of breast cancer develops a secondary in the brain. Brain secondaries cause a lot of symptoms. And it is difficult to operate on same, especially if the tumour are multiple (where surgery is not possible, and conventional radiation therapy takes multiple sessions and results are not that good). With cyberknife, those secondaries can be targeted, with minimal loss of surrounding tissue, and render a patient symptom free. For the same brain mets, we would give palliative radiation therapy Cyberknife, as of now, is NOT indicated for primary surgery of breast at all. It is being tried in those areas where surgery is difficult, and for stage 4 disease, where surgery is to be avoided. As for your question on whether it helps and avoids complications of chemo, the answer is a strong NO. Because, cyberknife is only a 'local' therapy. It can never replace chemotherapy which is a 'systemic' therapy. The aim of chemotherapy is to destroy all cancer cells circulating in the system. The newer chemotherapy regimes have fewer side effects, and have excellent results.",

If its very hard, and deep in tissue, and if you can feel, the rest of the breast is soft, they I am worried. Do consult your doctor as soon as possible. I would advise a mammogram (which is a special type of Xray of the breast), and an FNAC or core biopsy from the lesion (where they put in a needle, and get some tissue from the lesion and send to pathologist, for diagnosis). But before jumping onto conclusions, let your doc have a look. It may not be what we are suspecting.",

If the lesion from the breast turns out to be a cancer; whether the nodes have cancer or not is not going to change management. If they are enlarged and clinically felt, a complete axillary clearance is done. So do not worry that your radiologist did not biopsy those nodes. Let the report of the biopsy from the lesion in the breast come and then it will be decision time.",

Spending as much time with them as possible. Most important is that, I believe, the sufferer should know that time is limited (many may not agree with me, but I feel they should know), which initially will make the patient depressed, but within a few days, they accept it and face it bravely. The most important is to keep the patient symptom free. Brain tumours tend to have unacceptable symptoms, including convulsions, and they should be tackled aggressively. Hold your Dad's hand, and face it together. I always tell my patient, that about a 1 an 9 or 1 and 10 ladies are going to get breast cancer.

      "Content": "Hi Brandy, I will try to clarify a few things: 1. Since the nodes showed metastatic deposits, it is essential to do an axillary surgery to clear the axilla of all nodes. 2. Yours is a breast conservation surgery (lumpectomy). All patients who undergo lumpectomy also need radiation therpay, basically to decrease the chances of the cancer coming back in the same breast. 3. Any 'node positive cancer' needs chemotherapy 4. Depending on results of receptors, hormonal therapy will be planned. My advice: I can understand the anxiety you must be passing through, now. All of us are worried by the word 'chemotherapy'. We think of loss of hair, vomiting and other side effects. But believe me, the present molecules do not cause as much side effects as before ten years. And these side effects are easily controlled. So a few days after your every chemo cycle, you will be back to normal, do not worry. Radiation by itself, does not cause any pain or such. It is just cumbersome, to daily go and sit through the sessions. Think of your daughters, go to your doctor and tell him that I have to live for them, I am willing to fight, treat the way you have to. Time will fly, and soon you will be cancer free, dont worry. You might want to read up how we plan treatment here on my page: http://www.breastcancerindia.net/bc/bc/treatment.html",

Other hormonal agents do not function with a functioning ovary, so that cannot be given now. After 5 yrs of tamoxifen, if menopause occurs, you can switch over to Letrozole.

      "Content": "Before starting Arimidex, we usually get a bone densitometry done. Arimidex and other similar medications have a very bad efffect on bones. That is why, along with Arimidex, I usually advice a calcium supplement at least once a day and a bone stabilizing drugs like Zoledronic Acid (given i.v, once in three months to once in six months, depending on patient to patient). Oral bone stabilizing agents are also available, like Osteofos (70mg) to be taken once a week, with a full glass of water, and upright posture for 30 minutes. You might want to discuss with your oncologist about them.",

      "Content": "It is normal to have differing densities in the left and right breasts, nothing to worry about it at all. I would just advise to get yourself evaluated for that lump, since you say you can feel it, but the sonography doesn't show it. Sometimes, there is just a lumpish feel in the breast and no real lump. And even if it is lump, more than 90% of them, at this age group, are fibroadenomas, which are harmless. So it may be nothing, but to be safe, see a surgeon.",
