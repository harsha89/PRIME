      "Content": "I had my first mammogram at about 34. At age 38 - I was diagnosed with breast cancer based on the most recent mammogram. I am currently being treated for my 4th cancer diagnosis (my age now is 63). It makes me crazy to hear folks say mammograms should only be for women over 40 or even 50. If my Doc followed those rules, I'd most likely be in my grave by now. I personally feel that 35 is a good age to start mammograms with even earlier if the patient has a family history of cancer (which I did not have...). Good luck to you. It sounds like your Doc wants to work with you. Be Well",

      "Content": "Hi. I had breast cancer in 1998 with lumpectomy, node removal, chemo and radiation (surgery was followed by 2 years of unresolved infection that finally healed when they left the wound open to the chest wall and it healed from the inside out). Five years later - as I was starting to breathe a sigh of relief as no new cancers had been found - I came up with uterine and fallopian cancer (2 separate cancers - not metastasis). More chemo - bald again... Then 13 years pass with regular visits to the cancer center for followup - everything looks great. On my most recent appointment this week, however, my tumor markers are elevated for breast cancer. I am now set to have an MRI and PET scan plus more blood-work. I am a bit stunned. These tests have become routine. I was not expecting any change. I am not freaking out. No tears, panic or trauma... but, I am worried. I am not sure why I am posting this. Just needed to share with folks who will understand... Anyone else out there with multiple recurrences? Feedback will be appreciated.",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by jorola Hi Scarlett, I have moved your thread to the Breast cancer forum in hopes that members in this group may better be able to answer your questions. I am very sorry you find yourself possibly having to fight this ugly demon again after you have been through as much as you already have. I truly hope this is all a false alarm for you. Please keep us posted. We'll be thinking of you. Jodie Hi - Thanks for putting this post in the right section. I appreciate your kind thoughts. I am still pretty much OK - no extreme stress - no overt trauma... I have a Russian friend, Igor, who says, \"Don't trouble trouble til trouble troubles you.\" That sounds like a good motto for this situation. I would totally do chemo again if it is required. I think I may have that \"forgetting thing\" that women get with the delivery of a baby - they do not remember the pain (it is a good thing or the world would be much less populated)... smile. I don't remember chemo as being all that bad though my wife assures me it was hell...",
