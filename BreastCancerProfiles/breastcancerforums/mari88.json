      "Content": "Hi IndyLou, I am interested in how did you look for the best cancer treatment center, as you stated: \"Immediately following my diagnosis, my wife wanted me to explore all kinds of cancer treatment centers, trying to seek out \"the best.\"\" Because I'm from Europe and my relative has been just diagnosed with breast cancer (she's been in a diagnostic procedure for 6 weeks!) and is now waiting for some additional results before getting treated. In the meantime we would like to find the best place to get her treated and we are not sure at what indicators of quality of breast cancer care to look at. The diagnosis was made in a general hospital where they don't offer breast cancer care. We would like to get her the best treatment asap and I really hope you can give me some usefull info. We are looking at major EU centers. Would you just recommend to go to the nearest breast cancer center anyway? Or to the one with the highest volume of patients in the region? Or are there any additional quality indicators we should be aware of? The recent study on quality of care in breast cancer from the neighbouring EU country is not helping, as there appears all the hospitals are equally successful, but overall the breast cancer survival there is lower than EU average, but still better than in our country. Any practical advice would be much appreciated.",
