      "Content": "Originally Posted by spf is my bff Hi all! I don't actually have breast cancer, but I did have a mole removed from my right lateral breast that came back with melanoma and thus I had 3 axillary lymph nodes removed for testing (path came back negative for mets thankfully). I thought I would post this question here since there are many many more people here who have had axillary lymph nodes removed than in the melanoma forum. I am currently 2 weeks post op. I have a seroma under my lymph node incision (right armpit). It is about half the size of an egg and feels about as hard as one. It was VERY tender so I went to my oncology surgeon to have it looked at/drained. After the drainage, some pressure was relieved and while the seroma has returned to its original half-egg size, it is no longer tender. They said I didn't need to come back and have it drained unless it gets too painful again or shows signs of infection. They said eventually it will absorb/go away. SO now I have a new problem- I keep having these burning sensations in my forearm-on the flat side- but I only feel it when I try to straighten my arm all the way-it even goes a little above my elbow on the inside of my arm. When I relax my arm by slightly bending it or bending it all the way- the pain goes away. I've never had experience with this before, but it feels to me like it is a nerve pain. I emailed my dr about it and she said it is just post op stuff and if it hasn't improved in a week to let them know. everything I try to google about it just talks about numbness,tingling, or loss of sensation in the area- I don't have any of that...just the sharp burn when I try to straighten my arm all the way. Have any of you experienced this? Do you think my seroma is pressing on a nerve? Could it be crazy soreness from just using my arm less? a muscle spasm? any ideas?!! Hi Please try not to worry about this. It is as the doctor says normal post op pain. I had symptoms almost exactly as you describe after having a bunch of nodes taking from my left axilla. These uncomfortable feeling will pass very quickly and it really is nothing to worry about. I hope that helps....Good Luck",

      "Content": "Well I Googled pain during needle and wire biopsies and found that overwhelmingly women felt little or no pain during these procedures. link after link told me the same story. As Di mentioned how much pain is felt is very individual as peoples pain tolerances vary greatly. Also those of us who end up being diagnosed and having treatment find that any pain or discomfort felt after procedures is quickly put into context with the rigors of treatment, in other words what comes with treatment makes any discomfort from biopsies insignificant. I wish you luck in your endeavours and welcome you to the forums. I would like to echo Didee and ask you to step down from this soapbox if you wish to stay. You have put your point across and anyone interested can send you a private message via the forum",

      "Content": "Originally Posted by CoffeeBean80 I am a 31-yr old woman. I have 1 indirect family history of breast cancer (mother's aunt). I had a mammogram/ultra-sound 4 weeks ago for multiple palpable soft lumps (post that month's menstrual cycle). The findings were - multiple benign cysts, BI-RADS 2. After my next cycle, the cyst remains and a new one has appeared (on palpating, feels like the other soft movable lumps). Is there cause for concern? How long do cysts take to disappear? Hi Coffeebean80 You are clearly worried about this so I think a second opinion is warranted even if it is only to put your mind at rest. Getting a second opinion on a negative diagnosis when cancer is suspected is always a good idea. Good luck",

      "Content": "Hi below is a cut n paste from Healingwell,com: Breast thermography is a clinical diagnostic procedure which uses highly specialized infra red cameras to measure the heat coming from the body, in this case, the breast. Thermography has been approved for this purpose for many years by the US FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) and in the past two years (2001-2002) many new doctors and technicians have entered the field. With the rise in breast thermography popularity comes the chance of your having an examination performed by non-certified or properly trained practitioners. There are also many individuals who are promoting thermography simply to build there practices, sell vitamins or other health services, and so care must be exercised when selecting a thermographic lab. Why the fuss? Because thermography is an unregulated industry with no mandatory certification requirements. This brief papers has been written to assist you in separating the what from the chaff and finding the truths behind thermal imaging.
