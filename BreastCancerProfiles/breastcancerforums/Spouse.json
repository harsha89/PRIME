      "Content": "Hi, I'm jumping into the breast cancer thread to ask some advice. A friend has been diagnosed with breast cancer (by a mammogram and a biopsy). Her GP referred her to a general surgeon for a consult. Based upon what I now about other cancers, an oncologist should be part of the decision making team. Does that hold true for breast cancer? Also, I think she should ask about having a PET scan before making any surgery decisions, to see if there is detectible mets or not, because that could change the treatment plan. Is this a correct assumption, that you should do a PET as part of the diagnostic process? I'm trying to help her work up questions for the surgery consultation. I do not know if her health care system even has a surgical oncology specialist, or even a breast cancer surgical specialist. So what is needed are questions to ask the general surgeon, ones that could help her end up with the best team makeup. Suggestions are appreciated. Thanks.",
