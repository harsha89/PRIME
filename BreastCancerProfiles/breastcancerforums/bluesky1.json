      "Content": "Dear Ellenmri, You may feel all sorts of pains and aches, and waiting for your operation and the final histology results, and staging of the disease can be a very stressful time indeed. This does not mean that the cancer has spread, and you shouldn't be worrying unnecessarily. When you have your operation, your doctors will be able to tell you whether the whole tumour has been removed, whether the axillary lymph nodes have been affected or not, and if they have, you will have a whole body CT scan, as well as a bone scan, which will tell you whether the cancer has spread anywhere else. Link and untrained diagnosis removed.",

      "Content": "Dear RedSox9068, Firstly, I am sorry to hear about your mother. However, if the tumour (cancer) is only 8mm, and is only in the breast, then most likely she is going to need only a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (biopsying the lymph nodes from her armpits). This will then be followed by radiotherapy and possibly endocrine therapy (hormone therapy - a tablet to take every day usually for 5 years). She may or may not need chemotherapy, but that will all depend on the characteristics of the cancer. Mammary carcinoma is the medical term for breast cancer. She has to stop smoking straight away, as it will increase the risks of complications during her treatment. There is also some association between breast cancer and smoking. With regards to your risk, I do not believe that you are at any increased risk. However, if any other members of your family are affected either with breast or ovarian cancer, then you might be at increased risk, requiring extra screening. I hope this helps. You can find more info about breast cancer and breast disease at my websites: https://sites.google.com/site/cancerbreastinfo https://sites.google.com/site/breastproblems",
