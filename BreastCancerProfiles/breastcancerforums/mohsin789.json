    "Content": "I was then placed on Xeloda again, this time it did not work. I had an \"ablation\" which is a radiation procedure. That seemed to do it ---but it returned again in the same spot---the lymph node behind the sternum. It was no where else at that time. I was placed on another oral chemo, which did not work and again it spread to the lung. I am now on Navelbine, which is a intravenous chemo. I hope it works.....I'll know the next Pet scan. _________________",
