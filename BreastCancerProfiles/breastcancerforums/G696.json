      "Content": "Dear Ladies, I am very new to this & trying to get a handle on my situation. I have DCIS through a stereotactic core biopsy (high & medium) They think most or all of calcification is out. Small 2mm & 5 mm out of 7 samples. One surgeon told me lumpectomy or wider excision & 6 weeks of radiation & tamoxofin or other drug. 7 years ago, my other breast had low grade LCIS. Is a lumpectomy an out patient procedure - under local annesthesia? Many of you had stated you had a double mascectomy and immediate reconstruction. Does that mean that no drugs or treatment is given afterwards? How long is hospital stay? Do they use your breast skin? How are results? Do they have to take nodes & arms get swollen (like in past) or how long is recupperation? Please give me some feedback - I am thinking of genetic testing (no breast cancer in my family - sister, mother, grandmother) I am seeing another NY surgeon & need to know before my appointment. Thanks for the help.",
