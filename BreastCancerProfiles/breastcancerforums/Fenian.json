    "Content": "The surgery went great thank god but she has very bad diarrhea but she only has that since the end of the surgery. Doctors here wont let her home until it is firm and the family are told she can go home on a certain date then they change their minds. I know they have her best interest in mind but as I said she's 85 and in her final phase of alzheimer's so really I think she should be home with family. They also discovered that her bowel was actually moving down her body and going back up again. The hospital have her on a special diet now the last few days but it's not taking the diarrhea away. I'd be grateful with some advice.",
