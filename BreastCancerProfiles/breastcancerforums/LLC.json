      "Content": "I don't have breast cancer, I have lung cancer but I am hoping I can reassure you and your sister a little. It is important your sister likes and has confidence in her doctor and it seems like she does. Because he is on a Breast Cancer Board that is great because he alone won't be making her treatment decisions but many other doctors will have input in deciding her treatment. In my case, there is a Tumor board that meets once a week and goes over the cancer cases and this has really reassured me in my particular case. Yes, cancer is a waiting game. We are always waiting on tests, to schedule and then results. After my lung biopsy I waited almost 1 week for the results. And yes, always expect the unexpected. You love your sister a lot and being supportive in her decisions and being with her at this time will help her a lot. Linda",

      "Content": "I have not gone through chemo yet but am at the present going through immunology, 2 different drugs being given. I can completely understand being terrified, and even though right now I feel really good, these drugs they are putting in my body are giving me the chance to live and hopefully not let my cancer grow. I think that after chemo or immunology or radiation, we hopefully can feel ourselves again. Last year I had radiation and after a few months I felt totally like my former selve. You are young and chemo will give you the chance to live a long life, hopefully cancer free.",
