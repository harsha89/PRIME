      "Content": "Hi guys, I read some of stories. It is hard to express my sorrow. I am sad for circumstances that bring us together. I hope we will be strong enough to fight back I would like to hear your advices on a certain problem that I faced. I am 4th year university student and all these years I have a brest tumor \u0096 fibroadenoma (III decade). For the first three university years I have gone through two surgeries. The doctors are not professional enough at my country. They could not remove it at first two surgeries; they used out of date technique and some powerful drugs for anasthesia. Due that time, I got a memory failure. If before I was good at my classes with GPA 4.0, but after these surgeries, even though I have been studying for 11-12 hours per day, my grades rolled down. Because of all these unprofessionall treatment that resulted my GPA to drop to 2.52 I decided to take a risk to cancel my 3rd surgery in a favor of trying to fix GPA. Anyway, I have no chance to raise my GPA above 3.0. This year I am applying for Masters to Stanford University. But it is almost impossible to succeed. My professors are ready to give me a reccommendation letter but they advice me to step back from this ambition. I meet all other requirements of top schools except GPA. What you reccommend me to do against the facts?",
