      "Content": "There is an effect called the \"Monte Hall effect\" google in the New york times from the old TV show Lets make a Deal. It says that the second choice you make ican be a better one than the first... You'll have to read the article for the statistics. I too scond guess and wonder if it was realy really the best...but somethings I attribure to fate and intevention with a sacred contract with me and the divine - some whisper in my ear which is the way it's \"supposed to work out\" for my and other's life stories.. Have things all has worked out as it is suppoed to with the decisions you have made thus far..... maybe things \"could have\" been better but equally then things could have been worse. Like monte Hall there is a posiblity you could have gotten a pig or a goat - metaphorically.",

      "Content": "I too am sorry for your having to deal with this. I would agree- I think you have many options . You can do nothing or everything. Having seen a number of older women have mastectomies It seems like they recovered rather well and quickly. I had double mastectomy ( for Invasive lobular grade 2) with simultaneous reconstruction and I was able to get back to work in 7 days but I had some lite pain meds on board. I did not do chemo or radiation that was offered to me which was deemed risky for my premenopausal estrogen + status - I am willing to do somethings and not others. Its' just what I feel is right and do-able for me. Make sure someone explains the risks and benefits. If anything makes you go into your fear of needless suffering as you feel you will die sometime then ask questions...lots of questions. Take someone with you to listen and write things down. It's hard to hear and then remember CLEARLY what was said as it's all so new. Be tender with yourself and remember what you believe and what you have valued in your life - and stay true to yourself.. No one can tell youthat you have to do anything if it is more than your can endure physically emotionally or spiritually. Take the gentlest of care....you have come 80 years you have obviously done alot of things \"right\" for yourself. Dont' give up your thoughts or will to anyone or any profession or system. Care for yourself in a way that makes sense long term and short term. Breathe and find peace in your decision to go forward with or without certain ascribed treatments. You know the way..... I know you know. Trust",
