I go for my second yearly mamo tomorrow and am a little freaked out. I had a 1.2 greatest dimention,mucinous carcinoma invasive compoent size 0.7 no lymph node involvment er and pr very pos. HER2 - I had 35 rounds of rads. and am now on tamoxifen. I'm 52 and found my lump myself, two years ago. I don't know anyone else with this type of BC. I know that I am lucky that I found my BC early, and that so many others have had a much harder time then me but, I still live in fear. I am really working on trying to enjoy life and stop worrying so much. What sence does it make to LIVE with the fear of dying? Does it ever get easier? Anyway, thanks for letting me sound off. I would love to hear from anyone. Thank you Jim for your email. You are in my thoughts and prayers too Ellen from NC.",

Mine was a mucinous carcinoma, somewhat rare it seems, I was dx two years ago and I'm doing great. I know the fear you and your family must be feeling. Make sure you ask for copies of all her path. reports. I only had a little swelling after my lymph nodes were removed. But I felt more pain in my underarm then my breast after my lumpectomy, so she will be sore. Please keep us posted on her condition. I wil keep you and your Mom in my thoughts and prayers. Ellen",
