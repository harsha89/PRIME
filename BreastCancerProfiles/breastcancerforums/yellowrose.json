      "Content": "hi i had a very similar diagnosis i was told that because my tumor though contained and not spread anywhere was filling most of the breast ,if they operated they risked shreading cancer cells so the safest option was to try and shrink the tumor.for what its worth i was scanned after my first chemo and my tumor just after one session halved its size and over all responded very well to chemo.sometimes i dont think they realise how we dwell on these things and they should choose their words more carefully, no wonder your doubting after being told that it might not do much i also had an oncologist who was very negitive caused me alot of extra stress and upset. ive since had my op and am now just about starting rads so im quite a way ahead of you.good luck.",
