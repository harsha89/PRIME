      "Content": "Hi, I just became a new mom in January. In February my Mom found a lump on her breast, and she had a mastectomy in March. She started chemo after the surgery, but the oncologist decreased the strength of her treatments when her CT scan showed spots on her liver. She has had 2 rounds of chemo so far. After her CT scan today it showed that the tumours in her liver have grown and she also has spots on her bones now. The oncologist has told my parents that this is a rare occurrence, and that the cancer is more aggressive than the chemo. My parents have decided that my Mom will stop with the chemo treatments and that she will try to stay as comfortable as possible. She has been given weeks to maybe a few more months. This is all happening so fast, it doesn't even seem real. With my new baby, I haven't had much time to process the fact that my Mom is dying. I live in Alberta and my parents are in Ontario. I'm on maternity leave so I am able to go for an open-ended visit to be with my family back home. However, my husband is working and will not be able to take an indefinite amount of time off. I am so torn between staying with my family for as long as they need me, but if I go to Ontario for a long period of time my husband will not see his daughter during this critical time of her development. What should I do? MJ",
