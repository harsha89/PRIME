      "Content": "For the world to know: The answer to cancer in my opinion is.... First my grandmother made herself available for Experiments in chemical treaement during the late 40's...she died. My sister started chemo and radiation and then quit and became better with a change in thning an eating. Mys sister-in-law went the chemo radiation route and is now dead. Cancer is the body's localizng of the toxins we have put in. No medication, no drugs, no chemotherapy is going to cure cancer. Yes maybe a short termfix to get on a better track..but Cancer will only be cured when we see it as a sign to change...mostly change the way we look at life and change our diet...Hey..Don't believe me... The \"CURE\" for cancer is change your diet, change your education! Thanks",
