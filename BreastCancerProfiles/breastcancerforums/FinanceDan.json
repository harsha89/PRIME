    "Content": "I read your posting and felt like I was reliving the experiences I just went through with my mom. My mom has been fighting breast cancer for over 32 years. Radical mastectomy in '74 right breast and another one in '98 at the age of 66. Both times she went through radiation and chemo. December '04 she was complaining of back and leg pain - walking with a cain and eventually a walker. Doctors thought it was bad disk but after changing doctors discovered she had bone cancer (actually breast cancer of the bone). Now, as I have learned, this is very common. The good news is that bone cancer can be radiated. They found a tumor in her back and leg and several spots on the chest and even her skull. These can all be treated. My observation is that after fighting breast cancer for years, the cancer starts to appear in different areas. You have to fight breast cancer like heart desease - you go after the condition that it's hitting. After radiation and Chemo again in Jan '05 the spots all went away. However, her lung - (actually the space between the lung and the pleural) started to fill up and needed to be drained. The pleural is the lining on the outside of the lung. My mom went from being drained one a month to every other day within a matter of 2 months. We thought for sure she was on her last leg; feared the worst and felt cancer was taking over. They tested the fluid and didn't find any evidence of cancer. However, the filling got worse and worse and she was being drained every other day. After asking a lot of questions and doing some research we saught the help of a respetory specialist recommended by her cancer doctor. (Side note - One of the biggest issue with the drainage, other than the trouble and risk of having it done, is that they are draining all the good nutriants in the body which causes further complications and problems. ) But, the good news is that there are a few things they can do to actually stop the filling. There are basically two techniques both called Pleurodesis. Basically, as it was explained to me, the pleural and the lung are supposed to be stuck together like two wet pieces of glass (or like a coaster stuck to the bottom of a glass) - the two pieces have a natural suction. They can slide back and forth, but the bond between them is strong. In the lung, this bond, keeps the fluid from collecing between them. When this bond fails, fluid collects in this space and reduces the lung capacity making it hard to breath. With my mom, there was likely some initial problem (some cancer) in the outside of the lung that caused the filling to first happen. Once it happened, the bond between the pleural and lung was released and allowed for fluid to collect. The radiation and chemo stopped the cancer but not the fluid problem. In the two techniques the goal is to get the pleural and lung to rebond. With Pleurodesis, they drain the space between the lung and the Pleural for a couple of days in the hospital. They then inject a chemical (like an acid i'm told) into the drainage tube. They role your mom around on the bed to get the chemical to coat the lung, leave it in for about 20 minutes and then drain it back out through the tube. This technique causes the pleural to rebond with the lung. My mom first went through this technique. The problem, however, with this technique is that it is extrememly painful and the paitent is awake. Pain medication (morphine, etc) was administered but it caused an overdose unexpectiedly and she almost died. So, the doctor had to abandon the proceedure - he released the chemical within about 8 minutes and the bond didn't work. After a couple of week, she went back in for the second technique. The second technique is one where they put the patient out under a general (no pain here) and then somehow they blow sterile talcom powder around the lung. Amazingly, this recreates the bond between the pleural and lung. The benefit is that it's not painful. The risk is the general vs local. In my mom's case, this worked terrific. No more fluid. Her breathing has been weak but getting stronger every day as she does breathing excersizes. From all the cancer and radiation, she just went through a hip replacement two months ago and is now getting stronger. She continues to take Xeloda - a chemo pill routine you take everyday for two weeks and one week off. And also other infusions on a regular basis. She has also has lymphodema in her arm for over 30 years from the first BC back in '73 - but that's another story. Don't every give up. The body can bounce back. As long as the cancer stays away from major organs they seem to be able to treat it agressively and successfully. The biggest recommendation is to make sure you are talking to the doctors and asking for clarity about what you don't understand and alternatives. The doctors do their best but the patient and family also need to do their research and ask the right questions. Check out this link out, it might give you some more information. Best of luck and I hope it helps. Dan",
