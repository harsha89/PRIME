      "Content": "My sister has breast cancer. She had a mascetomy with some lymph node removal. She just finished 4 rounds of chemo. Now her Dr. wants to do radiation. From what I can find on the internet, they recommend radiation to treat a specific place of cancer. ie...to shrink a tumor in the breast. Since her breast was removed, then why would a Dr. recommend radiation?",

      "Content": "Thank you both. The link was very helpful. My sister lives about 1,000 miles away from me. She is all by herself, except for her dog. We tried to get her to come home when she was diagnosed, but we couldn't convince her. Now all we do is worry, worry, worry. The oncologist originally said she would have a minumum of 4 chemo treatments. She finished those and went to her surgeon for her checkup. The surgeon is the one that told her that the oncologist was going to recommend radiation. She has not seen the oncologist for this info yet. I will wait and see what she finds out at her appointment. Thanks so much!",
