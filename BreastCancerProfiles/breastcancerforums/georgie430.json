      "Content": "What your posting is really incrediable!! When your Momwas dx'd originally, 6 yrs ago, didn't they do a bone scan at that time?? I see on the community BC .org, most woman are sent for ct scans and bone scans? Also I would definately go to a teaching hospital, that has a wing just dedicated to BC!! Really cant stress that enough, please let us or me know what happens, I hope her Dr. is right. Is he an breast onc?? or a breast surgeon? Also Is he from large hospital? I'm not puttong down her Dr. and I really hope he is correct, however if it is rare and it sounds rare then Iw ould want to go were there is alot of BC traffic. with the best best intentions, Denise in NY",
