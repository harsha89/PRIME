    "Content": "Hi, I am new to this forum. I had a mammogram on Dec 27th & received a call the next day that I needed an ultrasound on my left breast. No questions answered as it was the receptionist to schedule the ultrasound. I went on Jan 4th for the ultrasound & then they wanted more mammogram images so I had to do that & they took about 10 more pics. I was told they found 2 \"spots\" & to come back in 6 months for another mammogram. I was given a paper that only said \"probably benign\" & to have left breast checked again in 6 months. I still have not received the report from my Dec 27th mammogram. I'm not sure how long they usually take to be mailed. Is it normal to take this long to get your report & for no one to answer any questions? Thank you",
