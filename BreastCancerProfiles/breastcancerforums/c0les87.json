    "Content": "Hi, I am 23 years old, and about 2 months ago, found a small pea sized lump on my right breast. I went to the DR and had it checked, as I have a history of breast cancer throughout my family. As she (the DR) was doing the exam, she found a second lump & was a little concerned. She is now sending me for an ultra-sound to check it out which is on March 9th. Im just wondering if anyone might have a possible time line on what I should expect, from time of the ultra-sound, to maybe a diagnosis?(spelling) Im super scared, and reading things on the internet just seemed to make me more scared. Anything will help. Thanks so much! -Nicole",
