    "Content": "Hi I am just about to finish my course of radiotherapy - i have one booster left. I have quite a bad skin reaction (very red, burnt and sore and itchy) and very painful breast tissue, in and around the treated area. It was described by a help line nurse as \"fibrosis\". My question is can anyone recommend any topical creams or oils that i can use once the therapy is finished to help heal my skin? I have heard about vitamin E oil, for instance but am unsure. So far I have been using aloe vera gel and polymem dressings (given to me by the hospital). I also get random shooting pains both in the breast and beneath it, too, which I am assured are 'normal' but any help would be appreciated in healing this too. Generally I feel like I am carrying around a very painful and tender 'rock' right now. Thank you for reading this",
