      "Content": "She has breast cancer. Got it 11 years ago. Had mastectomy etal. Now it's mestasticized to her breastbone. They wanted to give her some IV chemical (don't know the name) drug to stop the bone itself from thinning any more than it already is. Two days after her first IV, she got an infection in her foot. Size of a football. Is this a common occurrence from such a toxic chemical? Anyone heard of such a thing?",

The tech is never suppose to discuss what she THINKS she sees. Only your doctor should be discussing the results with you, after the Radiologist looks at your mamo and writes a report. You should continue to find another specialist and get his opinion. And go from there.",

Once the thought of my having something abnormal growing in my breast, I could no longer function (I'm on antidepressants anyhow).

They could not find anything. :P Does this mean without a doubt, she does not have cancers elsewhere in her body? Educate me.",
