    "Content": "I have a friend who had breast cancer. She was diagnosed at the age of 23 or 24 (shes 28 now). The cancer is also in her Lymph Nodes and was told it can travel. She had a mastectomy and did the chemo or radiation( I dont know ). They put her on drugs to make her go through menopause. And as far as I know she is still on that treatment ( does that make sense?How long does the treatment last normally??) This November was I guess you can call her 3rd year cancer free. But just the past month shes been getting pain in her pelvic area. Her doctor is concerned that it may be colon cancer or ovarian cancer. She has diarrhea(sp?) all the time. She also told me that if it is cancer there is no treatment for it.. What does that mean?? Why not?? What will happen if it is the cancer that came back?? Does that mean thats it!!??!?!? Nothing more they can do and just let her live as long as she can with cancer!?!??!? How long is that normally?? Shes only 28!!!!!Since her breast cancer is the type that is in her lymph nodes and will travel, does that make it a stage 4? If so if the cancer DOES come back then will it come back as a stage 4 as well?? Im just so confused about this all and figured this would be the best place to ask away. And I just dont understand why they wouldnt treat it.. What are the chances of this being cancer again?? Seems like the chances are high, Ive been looking on the internet and it seems lots of people who get colon cancer have had breast.. And the fact that its in the Lymph nodes, just doesnt seem to good.. HELP me understand all this please!! Thank you Chrissy",
