      "Content": "Hi Kiki, I'm so sorry to hear about that terrible ordeal you went through. What I went through, with the robot, was surgery for prostate cancer. I noticed that your ordeal was after having a liver biopsy, so I wonder if you'd like me to transfer your post to the liver cancer forum? They may have more information and experience with the after effects of a liver biopsy. So, please let me know and I can transfer your post over to them where they may be able to offer you better advice. In any case, we're glad to be here even as a sounding board because sometimes we just need to scream to someone. Good luck with the biopsy results, Chuck",

Biopsy DXd adenocarcinoma in 3/20 cores (one 5%, two 20%). T2C. Gleason 3+3=6. CT abdomen, bone scan negative. DaVinci prostatectomy 11/1/11 at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN), nerve sparing, age 62.

Final pathology shows tumor confined to prostate. 5 lymph nodes, seminal vesicules, extraprostatic soft tissue all negative. 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm mass involving right posterior inferior, right posterior apex & left mid posterior prostate. Right posterior apex margin involved by tumor over 0.2 cm length, doctor says this is insignificant. Prostate 98 grams, tumor 2 grams. Catheter out in 7 days. No incontinence, minor dripping for a few weeks. Seven annual post-op exams 2012 through 2018: PSA <0.1 Semi-firm erections without \"training wheels,\" usable erections with 100mg Sildenafil. NOTE: ED caused by BPH, not the surgery.",
