      "Content": "I am a 60 year old post menopausal woman in otherwise good health that was diagnosed in late April 05 with invasive infiltrating duct-cell carcinoma of the right breast who has been given confusing and contradictory advice by several oncologists. I had a lumpectomy and sentinel-node surgery on June 22 '05 with three nodes removed for biopsy. My cancer was measured at 1.6 centimeters and the margins were clear. I am her2neu negative, estrogen-receptor very positive and progesterone-receptor very positive. At first, I was told that I was totally node negative; but later the final report showed that new techniques had found 10 cancer cells in my first sentinel node. None in the other two nodes were found. The Doctors told me that my condition is considered node negative. However, since the ability to find such minute amounts of cancer is new and has no statistical history yet, they do not know what relevance 10 cells will have on my prognosis. I was told that a second surgery was not advised to remove all the nodes based on a 2% chance of developing lymphodema and based on the results of the normagram. The normagram showed a 4% chance of my having cancer in any of the other nodes. I have met with four oncologists and found that I fit into a grey area in which most advise CMF, hormone-receptor therapy and radiation. But I am also finding out that they are making this treatment plan based on the Adjuvant on Line program, which states that chemo may provide only 0.4 to 0.6% increase in my life expectancy, depending on what model they choose. Some input the node negative into the program while others use node positive that yields a much more pessimistic mortality prognosis. 1. The anti-estrogen therapy is much more effective and obviously pays to do as does radiation. But I do not know whether I should do the Chemo based on the low numbers. How do I decide? 2. Also generation 3 medications provide 35% more effectiveness than CMF for node positive patients. It is believed that it would also be as effective in node-negative patents although no studies have been performed on node negative people. Would G3 drugs be an appropriate option for me? 3. What are the side effects of generation 3 Vs CMF (generation 1?) 4. Are there any reasons for not taking the G3 Vs the G1? 5. Does CMF have any advantages? 6. Would most insurance companies cover G3 medications? 7. Is there any other medication I should consider rather than CMF? 8. Why? Thank you",
