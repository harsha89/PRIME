    "Content": "Tamoxifen has made me feel worse than any of my chemo treatments. Ovarian cancer stage 3. Last chemo July 2017 and cleared. Complete hysterectomy and two resections of my lower intestines. Went back to work in August for 3-4 hours a day. That was the best I could do before the fatigue set in. In November I experienced a complete setback. Leg pain returned making it difficult to walk. Terrible bowel issues and so tired all the time. Now I'm pretty much home bound and the depression is debilitating. These are common side effects from tamoxifen. I'm looking for alternatives as this is no quality of life!",
