      "Content": "Hi This may sound really unbelievable, but I know a natural cure for most cancer: Lindseed or flaxseed oil mixed very well with cottage cheese or yogurt. It is the work of Germany's best biologist, Johanna Budwig, who lived to be 95 years old. If you would like to read about this to give your loved one a chance at a longer life on this earth, please type in \"Budwig\" into Google, and read about it. Start him/her on this diet that Budwig reccomends, and they will most likely live. Please try this. It could be the difference between life and death. Thank you",

Budwig has been nominated for 6 nobel prizes during her lifetime. If you have cancer, or know someone with cancer, please tell them to type \"Budwig\" Into google, click on the first link, and read about her cancer curing diet. It is formed around flaxseed oil and cottage cheese. I personally know 2 people who were diagnosed hopeless and sent home from the hospital to die in peace, and they both went on this diet and survived thier cancer. The cancer never came back, because they stayed on this curing and preventitive diet. So If you could, please read about this and spread it to as many people as possible, as it may be the difference between life and death for many. Thank you",
