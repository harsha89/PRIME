The two most troublesome being numerous hotflashes daily and I have alot of joint pain. Mostly in my hands but at times in feet and hips as well. What has made you decide to have your ovaries removed? Are the shots to hard on you? I wish you well. Nice to talk to someone who is taking the same steps as i am.

From my understanding there is something palpable at the tumor site (could be scar tissue or fluid). I had a mammogram in April but , I guess is very dense, so has ordered an MRI. She has mentioned that she would like to have a MRI every year. And also a mammogram every year (each test 6 months apart). My question is has anyone had these tests done on a regular basis like this? And should there be reason for concern?? Also, she says that I am \"high risk\" , does this mean for recurrence?? Thanks !

I too was diagnosed in 2005 (march) and also had lumpectomy followed by the same chemo and radiation treatments. My oncologists explained to me that all the extra test do not necessarily find anything any faster than no tests. And even if found the treatments would be the same.. They would not catch anything any sooner than if you keep all your regular checkups. It took me some time to allow this to sink in, but I do trust my drs. I hope you can live each day knowing that tommorrow will come. My prayers are with you and your wife during these trying times. God bless and be well ....... Jill",

I agree it is difficult to have to take more meds to help relieve the side effects which then cause other side effects. It is a vicious circle. I am taking a medication called Exemestane (participating in a clinical trial- It is concerning whether this med may be better for women compared to taking tamoxifen, seeing if less side effects and easier on premenopausal women.) I have been taking since Feb 2006. I have some joint pain (occasionally need a vicodin to help with pain) and discomfort with vaginal dryness. But nothing real severe, does not stop me from living. I hope everyone will figure out what is right for each individual because we deserve to be able to continue a \"normal\" living. God bless and be well........Jill",

I Just finished my last chemo on 8/17/05. I posted here very early in my dx and come back all the time. I don't always write, reading other posts and repliies is comforting. FYI at my last chemo treatment labs showed elevated enzymes in liver as well. Drs. said most likely from treatments and ordered more labs in 3 weeks.The chemo treatments are hard kid you not but VERY doable. Keep positive thoughts and eat healthy and you will be fine. God Bless and be well. Jill",

I will be starting chemo 5/11/05 every 2 weeks for 8x's then onto radiation for 33x's....so I do have time to think this over and ask more questions before Tamoxifen use. Its good to know that I'm not the only confused person out there. All these different protocols, decisions to be made..I just want, like all of you, to do the best possible option to avoid any reoccurence. That is our biggest fear once get through the treatments.

      "Content": "Hello I am going to start taking EXEMESTANE (instead of tamoxifen) and receiving an injection of TRIPTORELIN ,once a month, to stop ovarian function, on Monday. I am doing this as part of a clinical trial for premenopausal women. As I continue research both exemestane and triptorelin I find quite a lot of possible side effects. I am wondering if anyone here has taken either of these medications and how were the side effects for you?? Any replies would be helpful. thanks, God bless and be well...... Jill",

Yes, you should get a wig just in case, I never used mine but I had it if I felt i needed it. My drs told me that I would definitely lose my hair. I had chemo every 2 weeks and one day after second treatment I had my hair buzzed, sure enough next day started falling out. I want you to know it isn't easy but it will be okay. My hair is starting to grow back now and my kids say It doesnt look like me anymore.( they were so used to seeing me without the hair ) Be well......Jill",

I really only had about 9 days (after radiation finished) to celebrate the end of treatments and a very long 8 months of being strong and positive to help myself get through the treatments successfully. I feel now that these celebrations have come to a halt. I am having a hard time staying positive and am beginning to shed a lot of tears because i am scared of the unknown. Is there anyone who has had any of these complications and might know what I may expect?? Feeling very Depressed, Jill",

Radiation 33x. During chemo lost menstruation. Tamoxifen for 2 weeks, estrodial level test showed menopausal levels, Switched to Arimidex for 6 weeks. Started having vaginal bleeding, back to med. onc. more blood levels, appt. with Gynecologist, scheduled D&C procedure. Taken off arimidex for 30 days to do yet another estrodial level. I have been back to see my med. onc. The latest two estrodial levels show that I am PREmenopausal. I have been taken off arimidex and put back on Tamoxifen. (I feel like a yo-yo, and I wonder if I will ever feel like my old self again). Dr. Leo, I thought you might want to know this being as you had replied to my post thinking it unlikely that I would regain menstruation. Apparentely, I have gone against the odds again (no breast cancer in my history and age). My med. onc. and my gyn. both agreed with you stating it was very unlikely as well. Med. onc. has seen this occur maybe 3-4 times before, last time being about 4 yrs ago. I am hoping to be able to go one full month without having to see a Dr. God Bless all of you and be well...
