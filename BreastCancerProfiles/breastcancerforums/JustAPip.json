      "Content": "pjutawan...Yes, soy products are bad. Do research on Google. I changed my eating habits 2 years ago now, after my radiation was completed. The protocol for me was 5 years of a hormone that supresses estrogen. No way, it has too many side effects and I would stress out about those side effects. Anyway, do research on PH balance in your body. You will see that cancer cells can not thrive in an alkaline environment. They do thrive in an acid environment. The way to control this is by what we eat. I don't eat sugar, dairy, processed food, beef. Plenty of fruit and vegetables, brown rice, etc. If you look on the ingredients in boxed stuff, almost all have soy products. Anyway, do your research and you will see. It is a challenge to eat this way, but worth it. I have dropped 35 pounds in the process.",
