      "Content": "pjutawan...Yes, soy products are bad. Do research on Google. I changed my eating habits 2 years ago now, after my radiation was completed. The protocol for me was 5 years of a hormone that supresses estrogen. No way, it has too many side effects and I would stress out about those side effects. Anyway, do research on PH balance in your body. You will see that cancer cells can not thrive in an alkaline environment. They do thrive in an acid environment. The way to control this is by what we eat. I don't eat sugar, dairy, processed food, beef. Plenty of fruit and vegetables, brown rice, etc. If you look on the ingredients in boxed stuff, almost all have soy products. Anyway, do your research and you will see. It is a challenge to eat this way, but worth it. I have dropped 35 pounds in the process.",

      "Content": "Vee, Are you saying that I should be stating my opinion on the complementary therapies forum? I think I am following the rules in this forum, if not, please advise me. I like this comment: \"Finally, this forum is simply meant to be a source of information for our members. When browsing through posts, please use reason and caution. Most of our members are people who are dealing with cancer in their lives; they are not necessarily cancer experts. Be aware that not all posts will be factual, but are rather the nature of opinion, theory, and advice.\" I don't want you to think that I am a freak of some sort, because I am not. I went through conventional treatment for my breast cancer. Lumpectomy and then radiation. Then I decided that I did not want to take the hormone pill for 5 years. That was my choice based on my research and the knowledge of a nutritionist. I think most people who read posts here are reasonable people and can decide for themselves, based on their own research, what they will do about their health. I have no product to sell or stake in anything. Someone asked a question and I gave my opinion. That is it.",
