    "Content": "I am a new person to the site. I wanted to share a postive thing that happened to me this week. My mammogram and ultrasound came up with BIRAD 5. Went to the surgeon, had a biopsy yesterday, frozen section came back fine, final report will be in on Tuesday. What I am trying to say is.. just because it said BIRAD 5 does not mean bad things. My surgeon and the radioligist both said it is how the xrays are read... I was freaking out..after all the research I did.. it was telling me that I had 85-90% chance that I had cancer... now I know different.. It has been a postive day for me.. I hope that this will calm other women who get freaked out like I did. God bless. Nanc",
